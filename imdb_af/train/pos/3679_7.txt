I watched the movie just two days ago and I was filled with the expectation that Paris was my second favorite city in Europe and I had a very romantic 18 months there in the 80's. I was somewhat disappointed that most of this group of vignettes, while originally and artistically done, did not catch the city's light and beauty very well. Not enough of the romance! We didn't see any of the tree-made boulevards. There was too much darkness, not just literally but figuratively. Some of the stands have manipulated the viewer, leaving it "flat" (the Marais sequence, the decorated vendor order), to give two examples. The exhilarating goodies: the Mime sequence, the cemetery, the Montmartre (although too much for the viewer to understand), the "Cowboy" vignette and the Sacre Coeur - were few and far between, and I would Like to see such a wonderful actor as Orlando Bloom in something that would have shown its originality more.
