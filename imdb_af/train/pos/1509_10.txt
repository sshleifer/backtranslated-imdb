The British horror movie was in terminal decline at the beginning of the Seventies, but out of the blackness came three films that were among the best that produced our island. The Wickerman, Blood on Satan's Claw and The House that Dropped Blood, made the future look rosy, although many people knew at this point there was none. THTDB has the kind of cast that can easily form a wish list if it's not actually assembled. In the dark land of 2008 you might expect yourself to wake up. Waxworks is the most overlooked of the four stories and of course my favorite, Cushing's life and art are so strongly committed that you can't know where performance ends and pain begins. One can only guess how this role affected such a gentle, sensitive man. Death and the Virgin. RIP Peter.
