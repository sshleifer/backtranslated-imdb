A Give this movie a 10/10 because it earns a 10/10. Two of the best actors of their time - Walter Matthau & George Burns work with Neil Simon and all the other actors in this film + director Herbert Ross. This makes this stage adjustment true. The Sunshine Boys is one of the best films of the 70's. I like the kind of humor in this movie, it just makes me so hard. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie on VHS 3 days ago (yes, VHS because it was cheaper - only $ 3). I watched it as soon as I got home, but I had to see it again, because I missed some parts for the first time. The second time I watched it, it felt much better, and I laughed a lot harder. I'm definitely going to get it on DVD again, because I have to see the special features. <br /> <br /> It's very funny how this happens. Two people work together as entertainers / actors / artists. They do well on stage, but really work off the stage, they can't survive another minute, and then about 15 years later you want to reunite them for a TV specialist. You can find it in this movie. Matthau & Burns was great in this movie. It's a pity they are dead. George Burns earned that Oscar. He delivered a strong comic performance. He was also 78 when this movie was filmed. So far, he is the oldest actor to receive an academic award at an old age. Jessica Tandy breaks the record as the oldest actress. Richard Benjamin was also fantastic in this. He won a Golden Globe for the best supporting actor. He earned the Golden Globe. Although many may disagree with what I intend to say, everyone in this movie has shown a strong performance. This comedy is a direct classic. I highly recommend it. One more thing: Whoever hates this movie is a "Putz"
