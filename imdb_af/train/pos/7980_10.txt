Man On Fire tells a story of an ex-specialty man with a drinking problem who accepts a job as a personal guardian of a girl in Mexico during the wave of kidnapping for ransom. Initially he is not friendly, but then they are friendly with each other, he decides to drink, etc. Etc. ... then one day she was kidnapped ... and murdered ... <br /> <br /> And HE won't stop doing anything. <br /> <br /> It's basically the story of Man On Fire, but expect a few big twists at least a few times, including the end that's pretty and probably will make it too because of the big music that Harry-Gregson Williams compiled with Lisa Gerrard (Gladiator). <br /> <br /> But the strongest part of the movie ... wait .. The thing is, everything here is perfect. <br /> <br /> First acting. Denzel Washington is at best, Mickey Rourke and Christopher Walken good as always, great Radtha Mitchell and AMAZING young Dakota Fanning. And that's not the end of the list. <br /> <br /> Then comes the cinematography that is brilliant and with excellent editing, surely won an Oscar. <br /> <br /> The story is ... not just a revenge movie. The story is intelligent, the story makes you think ... and is beautifully beautiful. Really. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies you should see in your lifetime, at least once!
