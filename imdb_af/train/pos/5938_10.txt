Another great taste of what a superhero movie should be to Batman: Dead End that just helps to stimulate our taste buds and let us have more! That's how a true superhero movie should look and feel! Even difficult it is a fan film of all kinds. The attention to detail, character and action is undeniably true. Although it is a limited resource production, it places huge, budgeted, die-casts, hyped productions "other" superhero-related movies. Here the main and supporting characters work and look like their real people. Finally, a Superman that looks really "super" and looks like the right thing! Batman the way it should be, without the flashy rubber cast, torn body armor to hide scrap physics from overpaid non-performing actors. I just wish some wise Warner Bros. exec gives the right to produce a complete adaptation of this gem. I don't care if it's going to the theaters or straight to DVD, I'll never be tired of watching it. Just the plot itself is worth my hard earned dough. Hope the "bigwigs" at Marvel & DC productions look at what a really well-crafted superhero movie should look like. No more Batman & Robin Failure or Hulk, Daredevil, etc. Learn from these little time directors and learn that there should be no reason to rediscover the hero for the movie, just to "bomb" it in theaters. Mr. Collora ... We need more directors like you !!
