It's a story of two dogs and a cat looking for their home. Old and wise Golden Retriever Shadow, young American Bulldog Chance and Himalayan cat Sassy, ​​flee the farm and go to the desert to reunite with their family. Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey (1993) is a family adventure directed by Duwayne Dunham. It's a remake of a 1963 movie. This movie became a successor three years later. Michael J. Fox is the perfect man to vote for Chance. Fox has some youthful energy that he brings to life. Sally Field does good voice work as Sassy. Don Ameche is fantastic as Shadow. It was this veteran actor's second last movie. Also the visible actors are great. Kim Greist plays Laura Burnford-Seaver. Robert Hays is Bob Seaver. Benji Thall plays Peter Burnford. Veronica Lauren is Hope Burnford. Kevin Chevalia is Jamie Seaver. Jane Smart depicts Kate. It is quite amazing to try these pets to survive in the desert. We see Sassy running through the river and she looks like ours. The bear scene is exciting and funny. Chance has no chance with that big, hungry bear. And his encounter with the hake looks painful. It's great fun for the whole family.
