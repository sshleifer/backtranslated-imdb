So lucky we were to watch this fantastic movie at the Palm Springs International Film Festival. At the entrance to the theater we were handed a small opinion ticket that will be used for our personal review of the film. Looking at the map, I went to my wife and said, "How many movies in your life do you think can be so fine, just about 5 for me." But when I watched the interaction between Peter Falk and Paul Reiser as I see the spectacular scenery in the film's New York area, I slowly start clashing the movie in one category at a time. Surely it was good, but the completely natural repertoire of the actors and an award-winning show by a man who is unlikely to be remembered for a raincoat with detectives rather than this film, has jumped to the excellent level. <br /> <br /> Towards the end of the film, there were few dry eyes in my home and my usually stoic and sad heart just as the Grinch's melted and I finally got it perfectly healthy. <br /> <br /> This photo is a must have for anyone with parents. No violence or nudity, but some strong language.
