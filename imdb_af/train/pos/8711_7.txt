It's beyond my understanding that so much litter from Norway has been reserved for DVD release, and still gems like this don't get a shot to regain their former glory. I give it a 7, not because it is very good, but because it is one of the few sci-fi movies made for Norwegian television. This movie is nothing short of a movie-historical jewel that shades the first Alien movie in so many ways. And my word, Blindpassasjer was first! Did Ridley Scott or anyone in the crew see the mini series? But the fact that the screens are very similar remains unlikely. Well, the budget is lower in the Norwegian movie, but it is a very well done piece of the desert of Norwegian filmmaking, which lasted until the 90s.
