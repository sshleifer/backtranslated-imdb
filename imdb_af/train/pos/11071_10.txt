I give ten out of ten this is one of the best movies ever. Absolutely crushed, astounded and astonished by the whole picture, wonderful play by Jason Statham, Ray Liotta and all the crew, incredible plot ... Just look at yourself and bravery to admit - it touches your soul because it's strange, but There are all the answers you've ever sought ... The very best, sir. Ritchie! The very best ever. Those who were looking for simple fixtures and skirmishes screamed they were disappointed. But there are plenty of flat movies in Hollywood, you can't remember what it was about the next day you saw it. On the contrary, Revolver is unique, I hardly expected it to be such a clear and brilliant picture of myself, of all that it had to see. Absolutely unbeatable, amazing, brilliant ... One can get insight to see it, I have no doubt about it. Actually, no words can express my admiration. I still wonder how it was possible to shoot such a movie after years of ugly Hollywood rubbish we watched. Thank you very much, it's just the best.
