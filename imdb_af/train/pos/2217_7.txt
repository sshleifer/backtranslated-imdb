I'm usually skeptical about movies or mini-series based on novels, because the script is always different from the novel. Luckily I was wrong! The script was very close to the novel (I think it helps the author to be an executive and author, huh?) <br /> <br /> The movie is outstanding. I can't describe how much I enjoyed seeing such a wide variety of actors (from Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee to Robert Ri'chard and Bianca Lawson). <br /> <br /> The location where I waited to see the houses and cottages I introduced to my mind: what I saw on the screen was slightly different. However, it wasn't enough to keep me from the mini-series. <br /> <br /> I recommend it to anyone who read the novel: you won't be disappointed if you have it. 8 out of 10 stars! <br /> <br />
