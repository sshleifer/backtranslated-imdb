Maléfique is a very interesting film. It is an unholy alloy of triumph and failures. The central concept is wonderful, three prisoners with bizarre personalities are joined by a fourth (with whom the audience identifies) and they try to escape from their cell using a book of magic that they find within the walls of the cell . <br /> <br /> The atmosphere is well-woven, reminding me of reading Edmond Dantes prison accommodation in the Château d'If (in front of the Count of Monte Cristo). The director feels that the characters are tied to the cell, especially the character we are meant to identify. (Carrère - a white-collar criminal whose crime is not specified, but it is suggested diagonally, may be fraud). On one occasion, Carrère insists on leaving the cell for exercise and holding the cell door on him; we never leave the cell, the claustrophobia is unbroken. There are also no shots of jail outside the cell, and the view of the bars is a longing sunset over a generic prison wall. So even though the movie looks very modern, it has a very old worldwide sense of imprisonment. <br /> <br /> Those characters are intriguing. We have Marcus, a violent pre-transsexual who plays an abusive mother to Pâquerette (French for Daisy), a heavily delayed young man. Pâquerette likes to eat everything he likes, and unfortunately it included his baby sister, hence his current predicament (I like this comment on internalization, very primitive). Lasalle is a withdraw, owns elderly man, in which he brutally murdered his wife. <br /> <br /> The central message of the movie is that your desires will destroy you, and there is a ritual associated with it. I think that's what disturbs me the most, since people are destroying themselves ritually. It has a real life on it. The fairly simple soundtrack backs it well, each step coming deeper into the mercury sand is accompanied by the dull ring of a gong. I actually hear the gong every time I do something self-destructive. <br /> <br /> I think one of the plot issues is that the points of the characters do not consistently boost the message, especially with Carrère, also the concept of the book seems to change through the film, not in terms of " a consecutive revelation. I also think some of the images we see are a bit amateurish, more like design than execution, such as the well-known "vagina eye" and the sodomy of Lasalle for completely hollow images. <br /> <br /> In the end, the movie that feels like the director is in a hurry to make it, and some things don't seem logical. For example, we had uncertainty about believing different things about Carrère's child. It doesn't change the fact, even though it's what we have here, that scarce bird, a "pure" horror movie. There is no comic dross or genre win, such as Cube (1997 / Natali), the obvious movie to compare it, it's a total experience experience, where you feel like you're in the cell with the characters . This last comment I make is that it is a "pure" experience that I think is something others have also mentioned. This is a fairly unanimous point. <br /> <br /> On a personal note, my favorite part of the movie is when Lasalle talks about his past as a librarian. He describes a scene where he goes to work one day and sits in his usual place in the middle of a room where all the books are arranged in a circle around him. The books seem to him that he will never contain their knowledge. It asks Lasalle to be insane. This is really the problem with an obsession with understanding and knowledge. This is something I felt myself. <br /> <br /> One final note is that two of the very well received comments on the board confused the characters' names. To convince yourself that Lasalle is the older library character, simply click on Philippe Laudenbach's page and you will see he was born in 1936.
