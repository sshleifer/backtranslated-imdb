this one is out there. Not much to say about it, except that it deals with a rarely touched topic in movies of beastiality. I can see why this movie has been banned for so long. The topics covered in the film are still a small taboo for most of the world, saying the eroticism in the film is well-deserved and fits the sphere of the film. It's a good movie that has performed well and serves a purpose to shock and cross the viewer that we don't often see in movies. I got this movie on the net I thought I could make sure. I enjoyed the movie because it was thought challenging and somewhat erotic at the same time. Something you rarely see in movies.
