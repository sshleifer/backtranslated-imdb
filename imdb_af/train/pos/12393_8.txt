For those who were interested in knowing exactly how humanity came in big red pods that made me shake, there is the duo of "Second Renaissance" pants. I am not quite sure why they are split into two parts, especially because they are credited as one on the DVD (and these shorts are viewed in any other format, but the DVD?), But they are insightful even if they have " some gaps. <br /> <br /> What really constitutes this first part, from the second part and the rest of the animations, is also the parallels it shows between robot uprising and civil rights. Graphic tribute to slavery, fascism, concentration camps and mass graves are mixed with verbal references to the Million Man March and humanity's God Complex. In fact, "God" is never really referred to by these shorts, but replaced by "Man's own image". <br /> <br /> As far as the shorts are concerned, "The Second Renaissance: Part I" is by far the most effective way to do emotion. It is a sad and disturbing view of the potential of man to "become the architect of his own destruction." Some may be turned off by some of the concepts that fall short of the previously established science fiction literature, but basically what most of the Matrix series did and was a driving force behind its success. <Br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
