An excellent movie and a good example of how frightening a movie can be without really seeing the viewer. It's a set of four stories that revolve around the tenants of a beautiful old-fashioned home and their various gruesome and horrific fortunes. They are all tied up by a cover story of a Scottish inspector looking for a missing horror movie star. It begins with a story about a riddle writer whose main character becomes a little too realistic, followed by a story about two old romantic rivals who become obsessive about a washing figure in a museum, then a story about a sweet one. angelic little child doing anything else and ending with the story of what happened to the missing movie star and what he did to the inspector. It is a beautiful print that you greatly appreciate the work of director Duffell and what he could achieve with a very small budget. Add to that the acting talents of Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, Denholm Elliott, Joss Ackland, Ingrid Pitt and Jon Pertwee and you have a movie that can be enjoyed from time to time. Don't just answer the phone if someone from Stoker Real Estate calls to offer you a bargain on a beautiful home in the English countryside?
