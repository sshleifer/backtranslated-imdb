Well, I don't agree with the other comments posted. Piedras is much better for their Magnolia or any of the other films mentioned. <br /> <br /> Especially about non-true characters, I think someone just wrote it because he never lived in Spanish society like I did. (and I'm not Spanish), is a real movie with real characters, well done by one of the best Spanish actress Antonia San Juan. <br /> <br /> About a European movie unlike an American movie, our different societies, I personally love American modern movies (I like the classic and some of the Andy American movies, but they are very few). <br /> <br /> If a movie is about the ongoing Constitution of a Man or not, we all make mistakes, but some can learn about the mistakes.
