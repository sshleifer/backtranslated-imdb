The Unborn is a Roger Corman production and as such it is nasty and tasteless. If you hate pregnant women, look at this movie because it is very full of preggo murders and failed abortions. Brooke Adams star as Virginia. Her and her husband's square go to a fine conception clinic because they can't have children on their own. There they meet dr. Meyerling (James Karen of ROTLD 1 & 2). Dr Meyerling had a very high success rate to get couples pregnant. (Enter joke here.) Is it because he creates some genetic killers super-mutant babies? This is what Virginia is beginning to think about when she starts with some strange side effects and extreme moodiness in the treatment. This is when she begins to take matters into her own hands. <br /> <br /> On this one you have to get the rest of the details somewhere else, because if I told you all the goods, you might have been hurt. Put yourself too fast on your Netflix rental queue. It's a bit slow moving, but once it picks up in the last third, all systems go! Highly recommended by me on the strengths of his PC-fetal violence. 33 1/2 out of seventeen stars.
