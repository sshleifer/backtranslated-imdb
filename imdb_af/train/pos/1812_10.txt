It's one of the best movies ever, perhaps even the greatest movie ever. I forgot about 12 years of the movie. Until I watched ADGTH on TV and it kept me watching memories when I was a little kid. And when I watched it for a few nights, I became addicted to the movie. Usually I don't like animated family flies, but this one is special, it's the perfect family movie. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie always touches my heart and makes me very sad, but that's what makes this movie. incredibly better than all the garbage that comes out today for children's movies. I mean the movie is rated G and it's about 2 dogs involved in gambling, there is a lot of smoking, drinking, murder, death and hell depicted in the movie. What I believe makes the movie good. I mean movies today do not bring reality to children and in this movie they did. <br /> <br /> RIP Judith Barsi & Dom DeLuise
