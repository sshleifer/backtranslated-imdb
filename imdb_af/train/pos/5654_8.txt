I watched the show 10 years ago and loved it !!! I now own the DVD and watch the series and wait for scenes I knew in the show (when Lucas Gail confronts in his home) and realizes it is missing - suddenly I look at the temptation without the guidance. Then I went to see all the BIOS of the stars and left out the comments about the shows. Thank you!!!!! But there seems to be some conflict. Some commented "Strangler number 19 than Triangle 20, when another had the other side. And also Potato Boy 5, and Dead to the World 6, were also overturned. Can someone explain ?????
