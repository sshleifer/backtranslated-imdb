A River Run Through This is one of those movies that is earned to be seen in theater so that the majesty of its cinematography can truly be appreciated. The acting is wonderful and understated, with every gesture and smile and nodding meaning. Brad Pitt gives a radiant performance and Tom Skerrit is powerful as the preacher father. The movie moves like a river, you have to follow it through ebbs and flow, but it's finally worth it.
