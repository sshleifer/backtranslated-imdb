It's a nice little movie with a nice story, which plays the most important role in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> It's a rather intriguing dramatic story, with romance as well. The story is told slowly, but it all works well for its build up. The characters are beautiful and beautifully portrayed by his actors. Usually I'm not too big a fan of the Asian scene, but the play in this movie was simply good. <br /> <br /> Of course, the film is very different in its approach and style of other genre films. in the west. In a way, this movie is increasingly advanced, with its approach to Western movies made in the same era. <br /> <br /> I just wanted the movie. His visual style would have been a little better. For a movie that is considered a kind of an art house movie, this movie is definitely a lack of good search queries. It was, of course, a pretty cheap movie to make and it was made quite generic. Not that it is a bad thing, it only prevents this movie from raising itself and raising itself above the genre. <br /> <br /> But oh, this movie is all about its well-built story and characters in It. In this respect, this movie certainly doesn't disappoint. <br /> <br /> 8/10
