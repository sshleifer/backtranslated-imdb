Vincent Cassel plays the part of Paul, an ex-con dedicated to an office work where he meets Carla, a secretary who is a little deaf, when she hears her drugs in many deaf people? when not (played by Emmanuelle Devos). Together they help each other to develop as people. <br /> <br /> What was especially interesting about this movie was the complexity of the characters ?? not in obvious stereotypes. Paul seems uncomfortable in the office environment, is it that he just hasn't cut off work? This belief is driven out when he gets a job in a bar and shines. <br /> <br /> The movie has a certain amorality that I find refreshing and shows how easy it is to act criminal, even though we think it is harmless or justified. <br /> <br /> Finally, it's a movie full of fantastic moments that are both touching and humorous. One is when Carla babysits and tries to comfort a screaming baby. She continues to hug it ?? but take out her hearing aids for her own comfort.
