I have never really seen this program, although it is highly recommended by members of my family. Enthusiastic enough, my girlfriend lives in Hadfield (the filming station) and she called some landmarks when I first visited. <br /> <br /> This was my interest, so I bought the 1st series on video and watched it. Apart from recognizing some of the places, I didn't surprise me. Once again, the BBC was responsible for producing another example of the best comedy in the world. TLOG is easily there with Red Dwarf, Fawlty Towers and Monty Python as probably the best. <br /> <br /> It's enough to say I'm stuck on the program now. The characters are beautiful and show unusual depth while maintaining a scary realistic edge. The look and feel of the program is perfect and reflects the sometimes gloomy feeling of the North (no lack of respect for Hadfield, which I found a very welcoming and warm place). <br /> <br /> I just hope this is definitely his originality in his career (based on the 2nd series ending his recession in the UK last night). <br /> <br /> The BBC is well done!
