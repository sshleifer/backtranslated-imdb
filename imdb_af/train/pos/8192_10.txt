These two parties were excellent - the best since the series returned. Sour pieces of the story have been pinched from previous movies, but what TV shows are doing today. What we got here was a good, good sci-fi story. A large (very scary) monster trapped on a deep well ground, some wonderful aliens in The Ood - the best "new" aliens, the revival series, a set of basically sympathetic and Credible human characters (complete with some unusual security people in true Star Trek fashion), some large-scale philosophical themes (love, loyalty, faith, etc.) and some top-loading special effects. <br /> <br /> I loved this every minute of this.
