In his first performance as a Hollywood director, Henry Brommell swings an exciting yarn that is all the urgently related melancholy-related marital problems, pruning it with an equally absorbing subplot of a hit injury. The film is played straight and consists of a wonderful joint cast as well as a quick, family-conscious script (also by Brommell) that brings life to an otherwise tired genre. As a bonus, Panic offers subtle, sharp humor? An unexpected, unmistakable charm, and very welcome surprise? Through his bumbling, uncertain, low-key star, whose everlasting cool state is tempting, especially The Real William H. Macy gives us the heart again as Alex, an unhappy, torn, middle-aged man and father who comforts in the most dubious find people: a young, attractive 23-year-old Sarah (Neve Campbell), whom he meets in the waiting room at a psychologist's office where he is treating Dr. Josh Parks (John Ritter) awaits discussing his growing eagerness to end the family business that his father (Donald Sutherland) built. Alex, whose desire to live a new life, is hampered by the fear of disappointing his dictating father, strikes an unwise fancy to Sarah, who ultimately leads him to the essence and irrefutable responsibility of becoming a man for his wife and, more importantly, he is a good father to his six-year-old son, Sammy (played enthusiastically by the engaging David Dorfman). <br /> <br /> Henry Brommell's brilliant 'Panic' is something of a rarity in Hollywood that is rarely seen (with the exception of 2002's 'Road to Perdition') since its inception in 2000? Does it weave two contradictory genres (organized crime, family drama) into a fascinating, warm heap of movie viewing that is equally strong in any direction? It is one that will maintain its exceptional, irregular caliber and glittering sincerity for the coming days.
