This show is so full of action and everything needed to make an awsome show. But best of all ... it actually has a plot (unlike some of the new reality shows ...). It's about a transgenic girl escaping from her military container. I totally suggest adding the DVDs, I already pre-ordered them ... I suggest you do it ...
