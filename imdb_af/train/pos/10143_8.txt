It was an excellent episode, one of the best of both seasons. Down rightwind for a change, with a story far away from the average MOH episodes, if there is such a thing. A man's wife is almost killed in a tragic car wreck in which he was driving. His airbag worked, she didn't. She is burned unrecognizable (big makeup VAT) and has not given much chance to live without a full skin graft. BUT, even in a coma, she remains dead but brought back by modern technology, and if she dies for a few minutes, her ghost appears as a very fiery spirit. Carnage follows, of course, and also some very gory killings, and also some very sexy scenes. What more could you ask, could you ask? Well, not much, because this baby has it all, and a very satirical end, it must leave a smile on most viewers faces. I also loved Rob Schmidt's (Wrong Turn) direction, he has a great talent for horror. Excellent episode, that's one I sure buy.
