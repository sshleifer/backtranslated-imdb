I stopped briefly to give "Mr Blandings build his dream home" 10/10 due to an aspect that makes us force a little in the 21st century: the fact that a black man is the faithful servant ( somewhat reminiscent of Stepin Fetchit). But other than that, the movie is a hoot. The depiction of middle-class New York couple Jim (Cary Grant) and Muriel Blandings (Myrna Loy), who are trying to build a home in Connecticut, has something for everyone. <br /> <br /> Grant is his usual flippers, while Loy does pretty well as just a woman. But Melvyn Douglas adds some real laughs to Jim and Muriel's lawyer Bill Cole, who has more plans than he makes clear. As for the house itself ... by most of the movie, you will probably feel ambiguous whether you want to live there or not. The builders, contractors and others also give their fair share of laughter. <br /> <br /> All in all, a comedy classic. Also with Louise Beavers, Reginald Denny, Sharyn Moffett, Connie Marshall and Jason Robards Sr.
