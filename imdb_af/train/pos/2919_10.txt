I watched the movie twice in the space of one week, both at a cinema in Orpington, Kent, UK. The place was packed both times and people had to be turned away. From the start of the movie with Henry Winkler injured on the soccer field, the whole audience was excited with the laugh, the laughter that lasted to the credits. <br /> <br /> For those who love American wrestling, this movie is a must, but be sure to see Henry Winkler as you've never seen him before. Also look out for a well-known actor whose brand wheel moves is a head-but! <br /> <br /> If you get a chance, watch this movie and it's the best family comedy entertainment!
