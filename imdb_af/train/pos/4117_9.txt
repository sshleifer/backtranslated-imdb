"DÃ´ desu ka den" is the first colored movie of master Akira Kurosawa, and surprisingly it is not about samurais, ronins, warlords or battlefields. It is in a very poor community in a slum in Tokyo, where residents are homeless drunkards, beggars, tramps, abused women, losers. I do not know why Kurosawa chose this tragic theme and environment to place colors, but indeed, they are very sad stories, some of which are sad. I personally like the touch of the boy and his father who dream with their own house and built by them; the story of the delayed boy who he believes pilot a train; the story of the man who raises five children as if they were their own sons and daughters; and the story of the young woman abused by her stepfather. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Death Injury ?? O Caminho da Vida" ("Death Injury ?? The Way of Life")
