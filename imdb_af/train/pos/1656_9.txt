"Thieves and leaders" offer us a very naturalistic depiction of the levels of corruption that affect many Puerto Ricans and force them to make difficult or impossible choices about their and their loved ones' lives. The role play is excellent, as some are non-professional actors; an excellent choice that increases the level of reality in the film. Photography propels the story without intrusion, as it should be in this kind of movie. The script captures the idiosyncrasies and attitudes of the "Boricuas" in a very deep way. Sometimes it feels like you're watching a documentary! If you see this movie, you feel as if you have entered the real Puerto Rican society and remain invisible and see it implode. I love it!
