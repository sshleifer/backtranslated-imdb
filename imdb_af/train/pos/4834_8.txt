For anyone who wants to get an impression of the Soviet view of modern Russian history, this monumental film is a treasure. The story begins at the turn of the century (1900) in the yellowish sepia colors of ancient photographs, improving in the middle of the century to black and white and to full color as the story approaches modern times (ie the 1960s). /> <br /> The story focuses on a boy in a remote Siberian village, characterized by the arrival and arrest of an anarchist during the saristic era. He later joined the Bolsheviks after the revolution and brought Soviet communism to his village. His son, through the local beauty, fights the Germans during World War II. When he returns to town, the oil industry goes off and we are treated to Soviet economic idealism. <br /> <br /> This movie is long and slow but quite logical and very good. It can be seen in three parts.
