Bertrand Blier is indeed terrible from the French theater and in the seventies he could always shock the public. With his fade duo (Depardieu and Dewaere) and the usual sex dose (Miou-Miou playing her distinctive role, at least one of the seventies, we can know that she will be the best French actress a decade later). In the first "Les Valseuses" is also one of the first roadmovies, as the viewer is only taken after a few trips of two small criminals. Those who are just happy with family life, or just nothing more, will be a shocker movie, but this movie is more than just that, it just makes you think of all the usual things in life (work for the car, being bound at work etc.). This is a kind of critic to the hypocrite society in which we live. Great work and it only makes you win two things: Dewaere just died too young, as he was a top performer and of course Depardieu, he would have to sit better with French. films as he proves that no one can beat him. Timeless classic and 20 years later it will still shock ...
