I recommend this movie. In the Bladerunner-esquire future of 2054 Paris, in most respects it is a classic film noir script: lady in danger, sister trying to find her, honest police fighting everyone. Fortunately, it avoids stereotypical, and combines a fairly good storyline with interesting, innovative footage. The movie may remind you of Sin City in the eyes, but it has a sharper, even more graphic novel that I really found compelling. Every frame, every row looks like it could be drawn from the desk of a skilled graphic designer. In terms of story and artwork, you can find buttons after the nineteen forties (or even earlier with the classic views of the Eiffel Tower and Sacre Couer) and movies like Casablanca, as well as a grim future where our destinations are. subject to corporations. Make any excuse you need to watch this movie.
