Finally! A decent British comedy that is not centered on some mockney bank robbers or washed out of a TV series. John Ivay's film is a psycho-story of discovery, dressed in biker gear. The three protagonists are gentle fool with a predilection for failure and each at a turning point in their lives, giving a sensitive, emotional trio of sub-plots to combine the riots. The chemistry between the three amigos is tangible and makes for a pleasant company with hilarious dialogue and some classic comic moments. It feels a bit like Atnail and I, sharing American Werewolf in London, and sharing Quadraphenia (just because of the bike gangs and Phil Daniels). In fact, Phil Daniels's darling villain reminds you of Danny the dealer in Withnail and I, with his scientific approach and scientific commitment to drugs. This is a good movie, especially for those who have turned into psychoactive substances in the past. It will often be related to the movie. A personal favorite is the brilliant scene in the Welsh corner shop and buys munchies while they are up. "This gentle comedy will warm the hearts of your heart and laugh aloud. And you don't have to ride bikes or even like them to enjoy them. But it will add to that if you do. Brilliant.
