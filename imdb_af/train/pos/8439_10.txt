For all the murder criminals out there, this movie was great! Every single character ever on the show appeared in the movie. It helped solve some (but not all) problems of the series. Unfortunately, unless you actually watched the series, most of the enjoyment will be lost, as the movie made strong references to every season of the show's existence. It would probably be appropriate to be a series of finals instead of being a separate movie, but we have to take what we can get. I hope they make more movies, and remain Homicide characters on the law and order.
