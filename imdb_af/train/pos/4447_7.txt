Barbara Stanwyck gives this early Douglas Sirk-oriented, Universal-produced soap only the kick it needs. No less as memorable as Sirk's later melodramas, it's easy to see by looking at "All I Desire" where Sirk will be artistic in the next few years. Stanwyck is a showgirl returning to her family in small town, USA, after leaving them a decade earlier. Her family and community have mixed emotions in dealing with her shocking returns. Some of the cinematography is wonderful, and Stanwyck is tough-like-nails and really gives this movie a shot of energy. Overall, a pretty good performance.
