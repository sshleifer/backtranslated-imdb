Okay, I know I shouldn't like this movie, but I do. From Pat Morita's loving interpretation of a Japanese stereotype to Jay Leno's annoying rejoicing, I laughed throughout this movie. As long as you consider that it's not the best movie in the world, it's a good mvie. <br /> <br /> My favorite part is Morita who talks to his boss in Tokyo while drinking a second second.
