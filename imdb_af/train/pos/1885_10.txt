It has long been one of my favorite movies. Recently I was lucky to see it on DVD. It is a relief to watch the old, grainy VHS versions. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen it for years and watched it today to wonder how well the movie is on time. It is one of those rare, perfect storms of comedy where great writing (really funny line to really funny line) along with good direction and outstanding performances at the same time. <br /> <br /> Dudley Moore lost an Oscar nomination for "Arthur" (although John Gielgud won for the best supporting actor). If Moore's performance in "Arthur" doesn't win a best actor Oscar, it is proof that no comedian actor can ever win the title (another example is Gene Wilder in "Young Frankenstein"). <br /> <br /> Steve Gordon crafted the movie beautifully with every character and warm heart of the story truth. Quite simply, IMHO the movie is a rare gem. It's just sad that Steve Gordon died just a year after Arthur was released. <br /> <br /> With regard to the DVD available from 1/2007, it is so / so. Although the video quality is a leap over the old VHS copies, no widescreen version is yet available. <br /> <br /> The DVD has some nice extras, but it's just not enough. One example of this is the comments of the director explaining how he wished to include certain deleted tasks and scenes (because they were hysterical), but that he had to make difficult choices for final editing. The DVD, the perfect format to include such material, also had to offer it so well. <br /> <br /> This, the original "Arthur", is a classic comedy that is one for the books.
