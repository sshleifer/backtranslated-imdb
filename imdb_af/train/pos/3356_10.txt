Ettore Scola is one of the most important Italian directors. My parents and I spent a summer night looking at "C'eravamo tanto amati": we liked it, but we didn't love it as we loved a special day. I believe Ettore Scola is underestimated: we often forget to remember him, perhaps because his latest films were disappointing. And so, last night, my mom and I sat on our couch to enjoy this masterpiece. Writing, direction, cinematography, score and production design were sober and accurate, but the thing I liked most was the chemistry between Loren and Mastroianni. They are both excellent actors and play the lead roles of Antonietta and Gabriele. Antonietta is a housewife: married to a fanatic fascist, she has six children, but her husband wants another child to get a prize for the big families. Gabriele is just an anti-fascist. They spend a special day, that special day of 1938, when Hitler came to Mussolini in Rome. I don't want to spoil the plot anymore: look for this movie!
