I really enjoyed this one, and although the end made me angry, I still give it 10 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Four college girls (Baltron, Kelly, Stahl and Cadby) drive down to Florida in their way they meet 2 guys (Turner, Davis), they really do not add anything to the plot, but at least something nice. The girls agree to meet the guys in Florida for a lot of fun, but they have car problems and never make it. One of the girls decides to go to a nearby gas station for help, the other three stay with the car. <br /> <br /> Soon, one of the girls should use the bathroom, in the middle of nowhere she has no choice but to go into the bush. Soon, his witnesses are as a man (March), a woman, a woman, a terrorist, the girl flies the area, she doesn't get very far, but manages to leave. <br /> <br /> Her friends going through the car for her, they go into the bush and run into the same man, one of them sees the dead woman, the man responds by shooting the girls, the other girl walks away, controls it back to the car where she is also dead. <br /> <br /> Eventually, the two remaining girls find each other and because they break into the filling station, they are arrested. That's when I got angry, these poor girls are afraid of their lives and the redneck police don't believe them. <br /> <br /> They are badly treated and one of them is left alone for the crazy man to kill. manage her in the cell, the remaining friend to escape, but not without being in dangerous situations. <br /> <br /> This movie has nudity, good actresses, a shower scene that mimics Psycho, graphic violence against women and a solid story. Some women may find it offensive and sensitive individuals will NOT stop, but above all, it's a big, unknown movie.
