It starts with a bet between Edgar Allen Poe and a journalist. Poe claims the man can't spend a whole night in a creepy castle. Well, of course he can, but will he come out harmless? Hard to say with all those strange people who are not supposed to be around, including the icy Barbara Steele. This is a pretty strange movie because the presentation is in French and English and switches back and forth a few times. Perhaps this is because pieces of dialogue have been lost? It is also fairly dark and claustrophobic, as it is not far beyond a small cycle of light that generates candles and such, and there is always a sense of fear and threatening punishment. This version (on Synapse) is also uncensored and I wondered what could be censored in a movie from 1964 until I saw the topless scene, I think it might be. Overall it is pretty good and in sombre black and white. Barbara Steele definitely makes the movie. 8 out of 10.
