Men of first class Cuba Gooding Jr., as the real marine diver Carl Brashear, who defended a man's fleet to become the first African American naval diver. Sometimes at his side and sometimes his opponent there was one man who really admired Carl Brashear. His name was Billy Sunday (Robert DeNiro). Struggled, exacerbated on Sunday and helped Carl become the man he wanted to be. <br /> <br /> I loved Cuba in this movie. His depiction here is so liberating and as strong as Denzel Washington in The Hurricane. Through each scene we can see his passion, motivation and stubbornness to achieve his dream. We can see the battle inside him if he starts to make his father proud. I also loved how the director created and put a lot of tension in some of the key diving scenes. Brashear's submarine encounter during a mountain mission is heartbreaking and brilliant. <br /> <br /> The only mistake I could see would be in the supporting role. Cuba and DeNiro's characters are very intricate and exciting to watch. What makes you a little sad when they have to kick heads with such two-dimensional supporting characters. The evil Lt. Cmdr. Hanks, the wife of Sunday (Charlize Theron), the eccentric colonel dive school (Hal Holbrook) and Cuba's love interest are the characters I found not to have much depth. What made these characters more and more effective was a little more time to develop them. Why was the colonel always in his tower? How come Sunday's wife so bitter and always drunk? <br /> <br /> Another curious question should be. What happened to Carl Brashear's wedding? I mean if this movie is chronic this man's life wouldn't be a wedding event? Maybe it's just me. Honor men, however, are a perfect example of the triumph and faith that surrounds the human spirit. This movie will inspire and make you feel like the man's battle. What I believe was why this powerful story was told. My hat goes to your Carl Brashear. I admire your strength. <br /> <br />
