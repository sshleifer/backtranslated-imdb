It must be against the law not to experience this very funny act with Eddie Murphy. I have never seen anything like this. <br /> <br /> For nearly 70 minutes, Murphy goes on dicks, pussy, tits and invading so many famous people including his own "family". Among the people who get it by murphy are: Elvis, Mr.T, Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder, Mick Jagger, Luther Vandross and James Brown. I've never laughed so hard all my life. I mean, if one doesn't know who Mr. T is not, but still Murphy like Mr. T, there's something about it. When I saw the show, I couldn't remember who Mr. T. was not, but still laughed. Now I know who he is and that makes it just as funny. Because Eddie does this, he can make the impressions so good that it doesn't matter who the hell he's trying to do, it's still hilarious. And besides, we learn that Murphy is a very good singer. Please look at it.
