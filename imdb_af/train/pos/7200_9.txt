Deathtrap gives you a turn every turn, every turn, in fact, the biggest problem is that there are so many twists that you never really get oriented in the movie, and it often makes no sense, although they usually catch you surprised. The story is very good, except for the fact that it has so many twists. The script is great with great dialogue and characters, but you can't catch all the development due to the twists and turns. The performances especially by Caine are incredible. The direction is very good, Sidney Lumet can direct. The visual effects are fair, but again most are in a play and fake. Turn far too much, but still work and is worth watching.
