I would like to make the series a great effort. The story line, although needing some improvements, was pretty good, especially in season 1. However, season 2 became more of a freak show, losing DA's original charm. Season one story line was more interesting, a light side to life at Jam pony while a focused severe plot with manticore pursued the X series. I'm looking forward to new seasons, in fact I'm still. I hope the FOX guys and DA production team realize that many of the DA are still waiting to come back. Even after 2 years of cancellation, DA can make it big if it's worked properly, and I think a name like James Cameron should tackle this challenge.
