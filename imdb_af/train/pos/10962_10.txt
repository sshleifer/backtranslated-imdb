It is interesting how the train can flow from research. I started looking at an article about Cristo's "The Gates" in Central Park. The article said the Maysles had been Cristo's filmographers for many years. Hmmm ... Then I looked at their bodywork. I believe one of them has succeeded, but the other is still filming Cristo and Jean Claude in their stages of creation. Gray Gardens sounds very interesting. Video Station, in Boulder CO, is the place to look for the obscure or horrible and of course they had it in stock. DVD and VHS. Edith and Edie are female women in the past, and oh what a glorious past it was. Edith was well off, born a Bouvier, married, had several wonderful relationships and became a singer when she was in her forties. Her daughter Edie was a debut, a fashion model and very much in favor. She never married and at some point her thirties came home to recover. She has some kind of nerve disorder. Too much about things. This is just a shadow of the world in which they live, because Jackie O. came and renovated the place so her aunt and cousin would not be put out. It is a 28-room house that has been cut down and exhausted. But in the movie you will see fresh paint on the walls. If you look carefully at the newspaper clippings you see, it's very dirty. The Edie outfits come up with a very clever and creative. The viewer gets the impression that Edith likes to look naked, but she doesn't have the movie. Edith was really nice and you can see the shadow of her beauty while singing 'Tea for Two'. Edie was also a beauty in her day and very attractive at 56. It was a good movie, but not for everyone. When the cat urinates behind Edith's portaine, she says, "At least someone does what they want!"
