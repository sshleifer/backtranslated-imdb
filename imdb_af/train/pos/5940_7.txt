This short film trailer is basically about Superman and Batman working together and forming an uncomfortable alliance. The two characters certainly have divergent views on how to deal with crime and what punishment means. It's great fun to see these two iconic characters. to go along. I won't go to the storyline here. But I'll be in the acting. It's great. All are well thrown. The two actors playing Superman and Batman are well suited to their characters. Batman: Dead End and Grayson also made this short film. Of the three, I probably had one, but I still thought it was well done. For me, the world's best is 7/10
