A great gangster movie.Sam Mendes arranged this beautiful movie that still shows a father-son companionship. Brilliant star-cast that leads with Tom Hanks (Michael Sullivan) has done a tremendous job. Great work by him again. He is an acting legend. Great also from Paul Newman, Jude Law and Daniel Craig. Casting is not too good. The plot is pretty good. You will enjoy the movie. A good portrayal of the 1930s gangster. In the 1930s it will surely stand out. as the highlight of all gangster movies of that era.Soundtrack is pretty good for the movie. A great movie in totality that shows what a father does to protect his son. Be subordinate to my taste. A fully earned 10.
