Actually, the answer is only a small part of this excellent Imax movie that we educate on our delicate self. C. G. and special cameras - assisted by Imax - show incredibly the inner (and extreme) functioning of an average person, that is, adult men and women, boys and girls, or babies. Almost every human body part aspect is specifically detailed: digestion, reproduction (with a Marvin Gaye hit), heart, etc. Some particular moments include how a baby can immerse underwater and how the brain's impulses look. It is wonderful how we function. <br /> <br /> The subject is jumping about a terrible lot. But we still learn a lot from our bodies that we need * to know.
