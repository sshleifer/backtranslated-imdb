I accidentally felt on this movie on TV, and I couldn't leave it. It's really an excellent movie that lets people learn about American history with the Vietnam War, the power of the flower, the racism's battle .... It illustrates the conflict of generation, political opinion, of race that took place in the 60's. I was born in 1980 so I didn't know all those things before. In France, the history of the US is not a priority and the movie has taught me a lot of facts! By the way, I think all the actors are wonderful; especially Jordana Brewster, Josh Hamilton and Jerry O'Connell. Now I can see this movie more than once every day !! It's really great. What a shame it just appeared on TV, not in theaters. <br /> <br />
