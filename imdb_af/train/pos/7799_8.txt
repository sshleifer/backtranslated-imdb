Very slow-paced but complexly structured and ultimately touching. A good, very true look at a small Florida beach town in winter's death - I was there, and it's absolutely accurate. <br /> <br /> It's also the debut feature of actress Ashley Judd, and she's making a big impression here. It's hard to believe this movie is 12 years old - I remember it in theaters, and I recently rented "Ruby" again. Except for the 80's who put on clothes, it kept very nice. Ashely is so radiant and touching here, that it is difficult to think of her next career without wavering. Son, talk about the failure to fulfill your early promise! Anyone who sees Ashley here in "Ruby In Paradise" will assume that this elegant, natural beauty went to all sorts of interesting art films and serious plays. Instead, she became the "go to" girl for silly action movies and slasher movies! Very disappointing, but at least we kept this beautiful show to show her early promise. <br /> <br /> As some other commentators say, it's not for everyone, because it's very slow. It's not an action movie, nor is it a romance. The director (Victor Nunez, "Ulees Gold", another excellent character study) deals with this ordinary young woman's life with deep respect, building her story slowly and with great detail. In this way, I think this is one of the most moving and respectful stories of age stories about young women I can remember. It's not about Ruby's sexual awakening or how she lost her virginity, but about her life choices and her growing maturity. <br /> <br /> A lovely movie, if you take the time to see it ... I think it would be a great movie to show teens and young girls (or boys) to the cause. and give them the opportunity to think and discuss it. <br /> <br /> Particular kudos to director Nunez, who also wrote the script, which is so realistic and detailed that I have accepted everything through the film on which it was based on a female written novel or memoir, but in fact it is Mr. Nunez's original work. Rated 8 out of 10.
