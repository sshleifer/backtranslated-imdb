To all the reviewers on this page, I should say this movie is worth seeing. So It was made in 1972, so what. The fashion in the movie was exactly the same way of his time. People who haven't studied the culture of the decades would think that this movie is a cheese ball. Compared to the modern series, "Left behind," (which is currently made for our time) it looks bare. But the only cheesy part of the movie is fashion, which has been more than 30 years in the past. BUT. The message sent in this movie is very powerful and meticulous. There is so much to say, but I refuse to say so. (for fear of spoiling it) So go out and see this movie! If you do not have the message it sends, you have problems, which need attention!
