David Lynch (1999 )'s movie by John Roach / Mary Sweeney's story is in Iowa and Wisconsin for some time before the film's eventual release. <br /> <br /> We come to life in the life of Alvin Straight (Richard Farnsworth). His medical condition is poor, his life is mostly behind him and he knows it. <br /> <br /> It makes what he decides to do, even more remarkable and engaging. He decides (and at every point in the movie his own name reverberates through his actions) to put a few things straight. <br /> <br /> At this time Alvin is a man with great experience but modest means. His daughter Rose (Sissy Spacek) is struggling with a speech restriction that makes communication a huge effort for the sake of the audience. But it's worth it because Rose's story can't help but come out as the movie progresses. <br /> <br /> This movie is the story of a journey. But like all journeys, it's a journey in the geographical sense and in the human sense. Early in the film we begin to understand that this is an ambitious journey, which no older man of Alvin's age should reasonably undertake. <br /> <br /> But along the way, we slowly learn how Alvin has so many qualifications. which equips him to achieve his unlikely purpose. Its purpose is very simple and straightforward. His brother is ill and will probably die and he wants to visit him. He fell out with him many years ago and they didn't talk very long. <br /> <br /> Alvin encounters many people along the way. The way he behaves towards them and the benefit they get to know him is at the heart of this movie. We know who Alvin Straight is, what Alvin Straight does. And at the end of the movie we know who we are. Better.
