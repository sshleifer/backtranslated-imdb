This is my favorite classic. It was filmed a little west of Philadelphia, PA, when I was 13 in 1957 and released the following year. Then, in 1970, I myself worked the same province as a newcomer PA state robber. I always enjoyed watching the different places where scenes were filmed. I knew the owner of the Downingtown dinner well, and he had a road sign from the front that told all passing motorists it was the "house of the blob". The theater scene was in Phoenixville, near Valley Forge Park and it still shows movies today!
