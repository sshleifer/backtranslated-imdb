Penny Princess finds American work girl Yolande Donlon the heir of a small kingdom located in that triangle where France, Italy and Switzerland met Lampidorra. The Lampidorrans seems to be billing bills across Europe and smuggling the country's main occupation because of its geography. An American multi-millionaire buys the place but dies before he can take title. His closest heir is Donlan. <br /> <br /> But of course, the estate needs to go through a probate in America and what is the Lampidorrans to do? Especially since Donlan, who has now become a princess, has banned smuggling. <br /> <br /> Give Dirk Bogarde, who is traveling to Switzerland to learn about the cheese industry. It seems the Lampidorrans has a kind of cheese that they playfully refers to as Schmeeze. With a few bumps in the road, Schmeeze solves all the financial, geopolitical and romantic problems between Donlan and Bogarde. <br /> <br /> How Schmeeze works, it's the gimmick for the whole movie. But here's a tip. In Lover Come Back Jack Kruschen might just have got the secret of Schmeeze when he was inventing VIP for Rock Hudson and his advertising agency. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Penny Princess is a beautiful mix of British farce and romantic comedy. Yolande Donlon again plays a role that Marilyn Monroe would have been if the film was made this side of the dam. Dirk Bogarde was well-cast in the part that was at the beginning of his career as a romantic heart, before someone else, but he suspected he had the acting he had. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie was shown at three o'clock in the morning on TCM. But at least I found a reason to be grateful for insomnia.
