This movie won't fit well in some, but it's a must see. I'm glad somebody has finally worked on the realities of HOW African American couples to make a name in communities and how many of them felt like staying there when 'other' African Americans moved in. <br /> <br /> (Minor Spoilers) <br /> <br /> This little Showtime movie is almost like a Spike Lee joint ... you have an African American man (Danny Glover) who his way worked hard through the traditional white professions in the 1970s. Like any American, he facilitated his family with his upward mobile status, but forgot, there were still many problems going on. The only African Americans in the area were the maids at that time. One who owns a home? Wow. <br /> <br /> Then the blend started. His wife (Whoopi Goldberg) is told to "get involved" so she does what all the other women do in her area. And just when the man thinks he and his family are "in", another African American comes in because they have won the "lotto" (Mo'nique), and in his eyes he doesn't want to do anything with them. because he doesn't want the neighborhood to think they are equal. He is of course a better caliber, his new neighbor is "ghetto", not a must not be there! Who has a problem now? <br /> <br /> What this movie shows is the great pain that this family needs to fit in and how they lose themselves in the process. It makes you question where to start and end racism ... and with whom. It shows you no matter what color you are and how much money you have, you can still shut yourself off the real world and help those around you. It also shows how these African-American children, when they fall into a neighborhood like this, fall into the trap of changing themselves to the culture (with blonde hair and blue eyes, caring!) To suit them. They laugh with the jokes, not knowing they are joking and not knowing. Why. <br /> <br /> But overall, this movie is about "people". No matter what race you are, this movie comes in how terrible you can be to your neighbor and to each other ... all for the sake of convenience. Even because you feel you have more money than others, it automatically makes you better - and you forget the battle you have and those who come after you. <br /> <br /> Again, NOT for everyone. But look and judge yourself. <br /> <br />
