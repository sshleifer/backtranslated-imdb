Today's sci-fi thrillers are more like Rambo in outer space with monster special effects (often ridiculous as sounds of explosions in the vacuum of space). Although tamed by today's standards, the special effects of "Forbidden Planet" were very striking for their time. Even today, they still hold credibility. Still, the best part of the movie is perhaps why radio thrillers still have appeal. Much of what is left is left to the imagination of the audience. (What did the Krell creatures look like?) By having much of the framework of the story, they never gave up in the end, but the tension and tension kept in the movie. The end was also very tempting and satisfying. In my mind it's still one of the best (if not the best) sci-fi movies ever made.
