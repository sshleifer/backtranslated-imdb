The main reason for seeing this movie is Warren William, who is in the best shape as the shyster campaign manager. He is electric, constantly finding ways to mislead the public and defeating the counterpart in the midst of the greatest disasters. William is a good actor - I feel he never had his appearance. Bette Davis as his girlfriend also shines in a signed role. Personally, I didn't see Guy Kibbee quite right as the lame-brained candidate trying to publish William and the others. He was more like a blanket than a man. I would have preferred to see a real character appear rather than a non-character. The story itself is unreliable, stupid and clich√©. But Warren William and Bette Davis are worth watching.
