Contains spoilers <br /> <br /> "Hollow Man" is probably the worst film that Paul Verhoeven, director of big movies such as "Total Recall", "Starship Troopers" and "Robocop" ever made. <br /> <br /> It's probably not his fault. For some reason, Verhoeven was holding on to a very mediocre writing, and he made the best of it. <br /> <br /> The first part of this movie is pretty good, with lots of cynical jokes, great special effects and even Skunk Anansie on the soundtrack. Unfortunately, the movie falls flat in the second part, if it degenerates into a standard slasher movie or perhaps a very bad "Alien" clone. The ending is particularly ridiculous <SPOILER>, as Kevin Bacon comes to life again after a number of incidents that had to be killed (in the logical sense). </ SPOILER>. And the whole thing is pretty level. Indeed, the subject to become invisible is never fully investigated. <br /> <br /> But compared to this movie, Verhoeven prevents staying above average. <br /> <br /> ** 1/2 out of **** stars
