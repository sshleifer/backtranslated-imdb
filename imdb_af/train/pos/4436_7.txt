The Tattooed Stranger was one of the rare B-movies released by BBC2 over Christmas / New Year 2005-2006. See also they live at night and Brighton Strangler. <br /> <br /> In this one comes a man walking his dog in Central Park over a deserted car and discovering a dead woman inside. She was shot and the police then tried to identify her as the main point with only a tattoo. After it was identified, the killer was discovered and shot dead at the end of the shooting. <br /> <br /> Most of these movies were shot in and out of New York so we could see some parts of the city. We don't normally see, especially the back streets. <br /> <br /> Mostly unknowns are in the throw, with John Miles getting the best bill. <br /> <br /> The Tattooed Stranger is worth looking out for. Excellent but rather unclear. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 stars out of 5.
