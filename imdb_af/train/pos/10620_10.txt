At the first show I found that this story is at least less annoying than other Cannon Movie Tales. After much more, I think this is one of the best. Some of the songs are pretty bad, especially the love song, but two things stand out that make the movie, even the song, worthwhile. One is the artistic direction. Like the other Cannon Movie Tales, it's a beautifully decorated period piece; Each piece of cloth and jewel (both have large parts in the movie's plot) looks fresh and new, and contrasts with the ordinary clothes of the farmers. Even during the love song I find myself dressed up and dressed by the princess, wonderful. The other thing is the comic timing. Much of the movie is cheesy, but the emperor's vanity (and he finally makes his pleasure), the suspect waits, the wagon Nicholas and the stupid prince were all quite funny and seem ridiculously completely deliberate. . And the sequence of the song Weave-O makes the songs not so good.
