Some of the guys watching movies complaining about them for a life forget something: DVD menu system. I tell you the people, I have repeated the main screen in this one about 35 times. It was incredible. A movie tapestry with a brilliant luster that was from where I was, what was the beginning. Many times the sum and Bam! I was addicted. Over and over and over. And over. <br /> <br /> Doot the dead, the dead man. And it's just the soundtrack! <br /> <br /> I'm lying in bed, curled up with my Vaio. The rain is in the flat roof and tonight the soft weather is soft. The cat is comfortable and my ankle that is in my cross is already rested. I beat in the DVD. I was enchanted. By night. "Doot the doot, the dead man." <br /> <br /> The Blob. See it. Steve Queen, two policemen, and one girl in a dress. Two thumbs up!
