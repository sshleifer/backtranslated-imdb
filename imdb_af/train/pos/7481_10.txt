I couldn't agree more with the quote "It's one of the best movies ever made." If you think Vanilla Sky is just a "make-up", you can't be wrong anymore. There is tremendous depth in this movie: visual, musical and emotional. <br /> <br /> Visually, the movie is soft and delicate at times (early scenes with Sofia) and other times powerful and intense (Times Square, post-climatic scenes). <br /> <br /> The music and sounds are so perfect in this movie. Without the music, the story was only half told. Nancy Wilson created an emotional but eclectic score for the movie that would no longer be suitable for such a dreamy theme (although I never released, I could get my hands on the original score for about $ 60. , you may find a copy yourself). Crowe's other musical choices, such as The Beach Boys, Josh Rouse, Spiritualized, Sigur Ros, the Monkeys, etc., are also ideal for the film (Crowe has an ear for good music). <br /> <br /> More importantly, the emotional themes in this movie (ie, love, sadness, regret) are very powerful and are tenfold enhanced by visual and musical experience, as well as the ingenious dialogue. I admit that the elevator scene repeatedly tears my eyes. <br /> <br /> The best part of this movie, but as if it were getting better, is that it was so intelligently crafted that each one sees the movie, you will collect something new - so be good and be prepared to think! Certainly, a theme becomes clear after the first or second watch, but there is always more to the story than you think. <br /> <br /> It's easy Cameron Crowe's best work, and quite a brilliant job. Many of my films and musical inspiration come from this work alone. It touched my life honestly, because true art has a tendency to do. It constantly surprises me that there are many people who cannot appreciate this movie for what it is (I think true art is an art itself). Bottom line: Vanilla Sky is in a league of its own.
