It is a ripe furious western and I have watched it many times and it is on every level. But if you look at the real facts about such legends as Hickcock, Cody and Calamity Jane then elsewhere, as John Ford has suggested, it is the west when the truth becomes legendary and the legend is under pressure. The story moves at a creaking pace and there is a great dialogue between Gary Cooper and Jean Arthur two very watchable stars that help make this movie. The sharp eye between you may just be Gabby Hayes as an Indian exploration, there is also a very young Anthony Quinn who made his debut as Cayenne fighter. He actually married one of Demilles daughters in real life. As his Quinn character, who informs Cooper of the Custer's massacre, tells in the flash, the finals are well finished and when the credits roll it, the American West blends with American history. So please take time to look at this classic western.
