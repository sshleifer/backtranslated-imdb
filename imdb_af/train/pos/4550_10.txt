Daniel Day-Lewis is the most versatile actor alive. English aristocratic snob in a room with a view, passionate Irish thief In the Name of the Father, an unholy, violent butcher in New York gangs (in a march that is ten times stronger than Adrian Brody's in the pianist ) and as the shameful Cristy Brown with cerebral palsy in my left foot (just to name a few). His roles influence each other, but each is separated and completely unique. He changes completely, with every character he accepts. And I start to believe he can act as anything. Anything. <br /> <br /> As Cristy Brown he is amazing. He does not mock the character, and he is not sorry for the character. A difficult performance. And Cristy Brown comes to life. A smart man. A scandalous man. Human. <br /> <br /> In spite of small theatrical failures and the like, this movie is an inspiration. Yes, this is predictable. But is it silly sentimental? No, I laughed. I cried. Not a moment of cheese. Prove that this is not a Hollywood movie. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is the scene in the restaurant, when Cristy discusses writers with Eileen, Peter and her friends. Here is where Daniel Day-Lewis reaches an acting climax. "I'll kick you in the only part of your animated anatomy." "Wheel out of the lame!" And his performance never slows, never falls, and is beautiful. Simple. He has a lot of screen time here. I watch it again, and I never get tired of Cristy's winding eyes, winding and guttural speeches. <br /> <br /> A must-see. Fo sho, yo!
