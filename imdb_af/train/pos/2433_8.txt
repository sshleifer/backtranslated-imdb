I was about 12 years old when I saw this classic "Casper the Friendly Ghost" cartoon. Say it was earlier since Casper didn't look *, so Porky Pig doesn't look right in the old 1930's cartoons. But I leave ... <br /> Anyway, this episode in the friendly phantom's aftermath worried him about a young fox he calls Ferdie. I remember being lucky to see Casper having a friend, because those who watched the cartoons don't know that most people run away from him, and scream "A Ghost!" Casper and Ferdie have a little fun together until someone else appears ... I hate leaving you with a semi-spoiler, but the cartoon is only seven minutes long so you can't really be too ambiguous. Besides, anyone reading the cartoon's IMDb summary can deduce what happens next ... <br /> <br /> The final is a bit heartbreaking. In fact, it's probably the sadness I've ever seen a cartoon. But that just means it has moved me, which probably explains why I decided to comment on this particular cartoon and not many others. Or, quite simply, the fact that I really mock this cartoon is because of its emotional effect on me - I didn't see it. But the cartoon ends in a positive note, and I was happy to see Casper and Ferdie happy again. <br /> <br /> I'll give this cartoon 8 out of 10 stars. Second, just for the Warner Bros. cartoon "Peace on Earth," it is the most I have ever been moved by an animated short.
