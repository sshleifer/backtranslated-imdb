Not earning the 8-star score, as it is one of the biggest bad movies ever made. I saw it in a midnight screen in L.A. And people roared and raised over the madness. This movie is one of those movie wrecks where you can't get strangers and DO IT! The millionaire who finances the project to defrost the Yeti looks like Chris Penn and John Goodman both put in a bad pace. The man who plays the science is one of the worst actors ever to appear on the screen. And yes, there's a dumb son (who looks like sorta kinda like a girl) and he's stupid since he survived a plane crash that both killed his parents (maybe hmmm for the kid?). Then this hottie Italian girl is seen by Yeti (as soon as he thaws - it takes MORE) - and he immediately falls in love with her - which is one of the most hysterical things about the movie, is that these giant Yeti "make bedroom" eyes at her - it's like a big Barry White trying to seduce a group. In fact, once the big Yeti picks up the hottie and has her on his chest - she accidentally touches the Yeti's nipple and yes, the movie takes the time to see his big gray nipple. Yikes of all YIKES! There is also a collie dog because the Italian producer has heard that American audiences are like dogs and he has similarly tried to get a Lassie. There is also this insane scene where the Yeti eats a giant fish. Hold the big fish bone and use it to comb the Italian girl's hair "Give, thanks Yeti - now my hair is smooth and smells like the trout. You're the best." This movie is more bizarre than anything Ed Wood could ever have dreamed of. If you're a fan of classic cinema cat, look for this baby.
