It's not as big a movie as many people believe (including my late aunt, who said it's her favorite movie). But because of the better parts of this film, especially the fairly well-known "fun house" final, THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI has gained a position of interest, apart from its real value as a key to Orson Welles's saga failure to conquer Hollywood. <br /> <br /> By 1946, Welles's position was mixed as a Hollywood figure. CITIZEN KANE has not been recognized as the major film it has seen since its inception by the Hearst press and by Hollywood insiders themselves. Welles' attempt at total control (direction and production and acting) of his films threatened the whole system. His best work in this period was like Edward Rochester in JANE EYRE, supposedly shot by Robert Stevenson, but shot with Welles (with Stevenson's blessing). But the credit went to Stevenson. Only THE STRONGER, a film that benefits from a post-war interest in the Nazi war criminals' flow, made a profit. For five years in Hollywood it was hardly a good record. <br /> <br /> Welles returned to Broadway in 1946, hoping to regain its critical capabilities by producing around The World in 80 days. But despite the help, Mike Todd and Cole Porter compiling the score, the musical was a failure. His failure only occurred when his wife, Rita Hayworth, was engaged in her portrayal of GILDA. So the marriage also went on the rocks. <br /> <br /> Welles had to make money - his Broadway production led to his personal bankruptcy. He sold his interest in the possible film rights around the world to Todd (which he would eventually issue) and he also sold the idea of ​​a film about the career of Henri Desire Landru to Charlie Chaplin. This (and what it has in MONSIEUR VERDOUX). <br /> <br /> The story goes to Welles, with a $ 10,000.00 tax account to worry about, called Cohn and offered to make a movie with Rita for an installment. Cohn was prepared to do so, but of course asked what the film was. It was a sensible question. Welles was on a payphone in New York in a pharmacy that had a book division. He grabbed a book entitled THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI, and ordered it to be a great thriller. Welles convinced the benevolent Cohn that Welles knew what he was talking about. Cohn said he would look at the rights and sent Welles his $ 10,000.00 installment. After Cohn hung up, Welles bought the book and read it and found it really bad. He spent time rewriting a treatment and script that builds Rita's character from Elsa Bannister. Certainly it has a curious plot development. Michael O'Hara is a sailor / longshoreman. He saves Elsa Bannister, when she is allegedly being attacked by gangsters in a park in San Francisco. Elsa is married to Arthur Bannister (Everett Sloane), a crippled lawyer with a good reputation. She convinced him to hire Michael as the captain of their hunt. The cruise also includes Bannister's sinister partner, George Grisby (Glenn Anders) and one Sidney Broome (Ted De Corsia) who is apparently a detective hired by Bannister to see Elsa. When they can try Michael and Elsa to find time together, but Broome or Grisby will stop. <br /> <br /> Grisby makes Michael an offer - he wants (for reasons related to his so-called fatalistic view of modern society) to fall out of it, as if he's dead. According to Grisby (the plot gets dark here) he can still collect and use his life insurance (though dead?) To run it to the South Sea. He will pay Michael $ 10,000.00 if he pretends to shoot Grisby. This includes signing a document that recognizes the murder. (Michael doesn't realize that such an admission will explain the need to produce a body if all the other evidence suggests Grisby is probably dead.) <br /> <br /> Whether Grisby Course is murdered, and Michael is arrested for this and for the murder of Broome (shot with Michael's gun). Michael is trying with Bannister to defend him, and discover that the latter is doing a second class job because he wants Michael to be convicted. Michael is convinced that Bannister is the actual killer and manages to escape just before the jury's verdict. He is eliminated and deposited in an abandoned carnival, resulting in the well-known "fun house" series and the conclusion of the film. <br /> <br /> It's a very confusing movie (as I noticed). This does not mean that it is not worth seeing - visually it is striking. Testify of the battle between Michael and the police in the trial judge's quarter, knocking the sheriff into the judge's bookshelf, tearing the glass. Whether the clever use of photography to capture Hayworth's dive from a rock is reflected on the binoculars Grisby's binoculars. <br /> <br /> The play is pretty good, especially Sloane (possibly the best film actor of the good actor). Glenn Anders was a leading Broadway artist. He rarely made movies before the song from SHANGHAI, and his clever Grisby is unforgettable. Ted De Corsia also does very well with Broome - a detective who really seeks his own interests at his own expense. <br /> <br /> As far as Hayworth is concerned, she is turning into a performance different from most of her before (BLOOD AND SAND, LANGUAGES OF MANHATTAN, AND THE STRAWBERRY BLOND are exceptions), and is a unforgettable siren. Welles' O'Hara is a very unusual character for the actor - a nice but naive man who learns the hard way not to believe what he wants to secretly believe. It's not KANE, AMBERSOMS, OTHELLO, TERM CONTACT, or CHIMES AT MIDNIGHT, but it's a good movie for it all.
