Fay Grim is a true example of what I call a completed puzzle movie. It has all the pieces of acting, direction, storyline and entertainment value. They all fit together, and once it's done, they create a masterpiece, Fay Grim. <br /> <br /> This movie follows a single mom, Fay Grim, who is trying to raise her son not to grow up as her father got rid of the law. and was missing. Soon, the CIA Fay will be in desperate endeavor to find 8 journals from her husband Henry's. These journals were filled with confessions of his long past in the CIA and his involvement with countries and their government. Fay is sent to find these journals, in return for the release of her brother from prison, and is sent throughout Europe by a cat-and-mouse hunt to restore these journals and learn about the hidden secrets of her men she never knew. <br /> <br /> Parker Posey was an actress I liked after watching her at The OH in Ohio and Best in Show. She gave her two lively comic roles, but Fay Grim was a lot different to the other two movies. Posey made me believe what happened on the screen, I felt for her, I rooted her, and I wanted to know more. She grabs you while she is on the screen and when she is gone, you can't stop thinking about what is happening to her. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen any previous works by writer / director Hal Hartley, but I believe I'll look at some of his previous films if they were half as good as Fay Grim. <br /> <br /> If you decide to make a smart movie choice, you will decide to rent a movie or purchase next time. A DVD I really want you to choose is Fay Grim. If you have common sense about how a movie should be, you will enjoy this movie immensely.
