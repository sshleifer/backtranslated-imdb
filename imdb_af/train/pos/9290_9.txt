It's not the kind of movie John Wayne is famous for. He plays a diplomat, a man who gets things through words and beliefs, rather than physical action. The film moves with a quiet realism through its superficial unforgettable story. <br /> <br /> For the candid, the patient and the thoughtful, this movie is a rich representation of an intriguing part of history. <br /> <br /> There are two intricate stories. The big story is internalized, Japan's isolation and exodus, expansionist America clashes when their interests are in conflict. The small, human story is of an outsider barrier (Wayne) and a civilized Geisha's initial hostility and does not like mutual respect and love. The human story is a reflection of the greater story of the two nations. <br /> <br /> The movie is very well done and all actors play their roles well. The two main roles are performed perfectly. John Wayne is excellent as Townsend Harris, who hits exactly the right blend of power and negotiation with Japanese. Eiko Ando is also excellent as the Geisha of the title, charming and delicious. The interaction between her character and John Wayne's is well portrayed. This is exactly how these two individuals (as depicted in the film) would have behaved. <br /> <br /> The writing is very well written. It has no pumping capacity. and is a realistic portrayal of the manner in which depicted events may have taken place. The characters are real people, not self-conscious "great" figures from history. Furthermore, the clash of cultures and interests is portrayed with great skill and subtlety. Indeed, the clash of a traditional and traditionally powerful isolation Japan and a rising, powerful nation across the ocean are summed up well in one swap between John Wayne and the local Japanese baron. Wayne complains that seafarers are beheading seafarers as they land in Japan, and that passing ships cannot even sit in the harbor for water. The Baron responds that Japan should be left alone. Wayne's character replies that Japan is at an increasingly important crossroads of international shipping and that if things continue as before, the nation is seen as nothing more than a group of brigades that infect a major roadway. A very real summary of the way the two countries each saw themselves in the right and saw the other as wrong. The consequent clash between two self-righteous, conflicting interests has reflected reflection through history, an ongoing theme coming into the present and future. <br /> <br /> Cinemas and the mid-nineteenth century portrayal of Japan, before the accelerated growth after industrialization that would follow later in the century, is excellent. A visual surprise and enlightening insight into Japan's ancient civilization. <br /> <br /> I recommend someone, whether it's a John Wayne fan or not, to watch this movie if you get the chance. Just be aware that this is not an action movie. It's a showcase of an interesting place and time in history, and a slow cooking love story that (to their surprise) dominates the personal lives of the two main characters. Watch this movie on its merits, without prejudice, let yourself be immersed in the story, and you'll enjoy it thoroughly. <br /> <br /> All in all, an excellent movie.
