I watched this movie in the avant premiere at Imagina Festival in Monaco. <br /> <br /> I saw the first trailer four years ago and from now on I was waiting to see the final result. I'm not disappointed. <br /> <br /> It is a complete 3D movie with high contrasting black and white render. It is clearly inspired by some comics, such as those of F. Miller. In this perspective, it goes one step further than the excellent "Sin City" adaptation of R. Rodriguez. This time, (almost) no gray or any middle color, but a graphic style that has never been seen in a realistic animated movie. (Cannot wait for dark waiting) <br /> <br /> The massive use of Motion Capture gives a lot of life and credibility to the characters and we soon forget the technical aspect to focus on more classic elements such as direction or plot . The direction remains sober and controlled despite the infinite possibilities of the medium, and this is a very good surprise. <br /> <br /> The futuristic story (Paris 2053) makes it a classic science fiction movie and maintains the viewer interested to the end. Despite a classic base plot (an investigation that goes far beyond the initial expectations), the atmosphere and some interesting recurring themes (genetics, absolute power of certain firms ...) give this movie a great interest. <br /> <br /> Despite This is an animated movie, this is of course not made for kids. You won't find a funny pet or a stupid family here, just the cold reality. It is much closer to a good movie noir. <br /> <br /> I found that the environment is one of the best aspects of the movie: we still feel the well-known Paris, but it gets through a fine touch of futurism. <br /> <br /> However, I regret some mistakes. The assembly is sometimes a little flat, one or two very clich√© slow motion effects and some poor dialogues. Although the technical is excellent, it shows its boundaries in some romantic rows (a bit like "final fantasy"). Those little things make it a 7/10. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a successful art challenge you need to look at if you can. The director, Christian Volckman, knows how not to fall into potential falls. Fortunately, they didn't ask John Woo to do the job!). <br /> <br /> Finally, it is a shooting film, an intelligent story and a great artistic direction. See it if you can! <br /> <br /> Please excuse me for the spelling errors.
