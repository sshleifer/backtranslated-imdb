There are so many words I want to use to describe this movie, but can't really do it? This movie is a movie to see if you just want to sit, laugh, cry and breathe. I'm serious. Don't see this movie if you are easily offended by curse, sex, nudity, homosexuality ... and everything related to nature. To be a woman, and it can't even be a factor, I can watch this movie over and over again. Trey Parker and Matt Stone are absolutely brilliant. Along with all their other debuts, I think Baseball is the prize winner. I just laugh about some of the stupid things they do in the movie. Watch the movie !! That's all I'm going to say. It is hard for me to leave this comment because I am one of those people, such as Ozzy Osbourne, who has a curse word in almost every line that speaks out of their mouth when they speak. So I keep it professional. Best movie. Heck yeah !!
