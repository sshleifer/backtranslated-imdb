Purple Rain is a good movie if you are a 40-something music lover who participated in prince music in the 1980s. The story is a widely used formula: Rising musical talent must overcome personal and professional hurdles to find its audience and self-respect. Prins is a bad actor, but his performance, especially of Purple Rain / I Would Die 4 U, makes it worthwhile to sit down through the movie. He is himself and as a showman, so powerful on stage like Mick Jagger or Michael Jackson, about Thriller. Apollonia Kotero, a former prince protégé, is beautiful and shows a few plays and chemistry with Prince, but her writing does not leave her far. Morris Day and other supporting actors provide comic elements.
