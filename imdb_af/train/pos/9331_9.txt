This movie was last week and although the quality of the movies almost never (at around 18:00) is almost good (at least here on Mexican TV), I couldn't switch off the TV. The story about Madelene Moore really touches you. She doesn't even appear as a very sympathetic character, but sees the whole movie, you just want to pass her. This movie really makes you think. And I think it's basically because of Brooke Johnson's great acting. I have never heard of her and have never seen her in another movie, but it was wonderful. Compliment with Brooke. I hope to see her again in another movie soon.
