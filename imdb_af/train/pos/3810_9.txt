this is my first review on IMDb, i didn't want to write one, but since there is only 2 for this big movie, i feel compelled to add my perspective ... and no, i'm not associated with the movie makers on any way (yes yes how often do you have before ;-)) FYI I'm in my late 20s <br /> <br /> First of all, I have to admit I really like animated movies because what you see is only limited by the imagination of the creators and they were quite imaginative on this one. Not so much in terms of story, but to achieve a very unique and imo fresh visual style. The characters look good, but far from real and it works well for the movie, it's a fairytale world. But the backgrounds and the world in general are filled with immense images that have dropped my jaw several times while I watched it. The blue, bunny-like mini-dragon steals the show and easily has some of the funniest moments of the movie. He is already a direct classic, much like Scrat of Ice Age. The story is not too surprising (a lot of anti-heroes have to go out and kill the biggest dragon you can imagine), but who cares to see if the movie looks and sounds so good ;-) 1 thing I need show, imo the movie is not suitable for very young children, as it has a few darker plays in it and perhaps frightening for children under 6-8. I will say, it is very few scenes, but worth mentioning. Anyway, I had a good time looking at it and can't wait for it to hit the stores in a hurry to look it over just for its beauty. <br /> <br /> 8.5 for me
