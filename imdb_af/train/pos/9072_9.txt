I remembered it as one of my favorite books as a child and wanted to read it for a while for my 5 year old daughter. I knew the movie was coming out soon, so we went to the library to get the book and they gave us the preview for the next day. We went home and spent the afternoon reading the book so we could compare it. Wasn't necessary. The only thing that is common between the book and the movie is the main character's name, the fact that there is a bet, and a lot of worm eating. Oh yes, I almost forgot, the child who cooks most of the worms likes to present his masterpieces with a French accent. How the kids know each other, the number of children involved, how the bet originated, the number of worms to eat, the time frame in which to eat the worms, how they were cooked, progress of friendships, climax scenes, etc., nothing is the same. But somehow it didn't spoil my role. The characters are all nice, and the movie didn't disappoint me. Word of caution for parents, there was one moment when you could hear the adults in the room pulling their breath together and that was when Billy's little brother referred to his penis as a "dilly dick". The embarrassment came when my daughter continued to ask those sitting around us, "Does anyone know a dilly dick?" lol. This and an occasional "shut up" is as dirty as this movie gets. My daughter thought she could get sick around worms 3 and 4 (and just keep the empty nacho container) but was good at worm 6. She and I both enjoyed the movie very much and had a wonderful time to experience. Share.
