Von Trier once explained how he created such a strong involvement of the viewer with his movies by placing his film world in the middle of the real world and the imagined world. So as viewers we think we are looking at a "real" story, while we are actually being thoroughly manipulated, often to the point that the movie is disturbed (Dancer in the Dark) or painful (The Idiots / Idiots). Of course, the Dogma movies only acted as a means for this theory (except for creating a welcome spotlight on von Trier). <br /> <br /> The story is typical of Von Trier: our hero is idealistic, looks his balance of relationships with everyone else, but soon becomes the victim of the problems that others have created for themselves in the past. The idealist must inevitably reject society to remain idealistic and become the terrorist. Humanity is spoiled and purity leads to (self) destruction. (These elements were also very ubiquitous in Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark.) The movie is also full of cynical (even humorous) undertones about the role of the Germans and Americans in post-war Germany. <br /> <br /> As a technical achievement, the movie is wonderfully designed: shifting and blurring of erased colors, screen transitions, action on different deliberations (with the shootings of the soon-to-be most interesting). In this movie we can see how good Von Trier's film is as a technical medium. In his later works he seems to come out (as if he is no longer interested in technical achievements, because they are so easily available).
