**** SPOILER ALERT **** In Australia, summer changed rainfall and hailstorms to baseballs in coastal cities such as Sydney. It is under these hectic conditions that tax adviser David Burton, Richard Chamberlain, became involved in a case, as a defender, who involved the death of a local aboriginal dead outside a Sydney bar. <br /> <br /> With five co-natives arrested for Billy Cormans, Athol Compton, death was determined by the police suspect Billy was dead of drowning by violence, even though he was on his neck and shoulders crossed. Yet, the court decided to prosecute the five for his death and instead of committing homicide instead of murder. <br /> <br /> David, who defends the five, gets no help from them in their defense, while the accused attackers prefer to stay and keep properly what happened to Billy and take what from them to the court comes. One of the defendants Chris, David Gulpili, began to get hold of David's dreams as if he wanted to tell what was really behind Billy's death. <br /> <br /> David doesn't even begin to get serious about Chris's dreams. that they actually when he met him at the court building. Chris confirms David's dreams by showing him a strange black rock that David sees Chris has in his dreams. Later Chris meets and seems to be an aboriginal shaman, Charlie (Nandjiwarna Amagula) who came home at night. David is told that he, like Charlie, has spiritual powers he inherited from his mother's grandfather. These forces will reveal to him the future that is concerned with the strange weather conditions that flood the Australian continent. The Earth, Chris says to David, is going through a giant cleansing cycle with the old world to be washed away and the new world is ready to use it. <br /> <br /> David is confused about what both Chris and Charlie tell him but if the rain keeps rising and the ocean waves are rising, he feels something is going to happen terribly. David wants to know if it's all mature folklore or there's scientific facts or logic behind their end of worldly revelations. <br /> <br /> By now, both Chris and Charlie are members of an aboriginal tribe. right in the heart of modern Sydney. This alone can get Chris, as well as his four friends, for Billy's murder. As the Australian government will not prosecute tribal tribes, the tribes themselves will do justice. Nevertheless, Chris refuses to admit he is a member of an indigenous tribe and he and his four friends are found guilty of culpable homicide in Billy's death with the sentences that will be handed over by the judge within days. <br /> <br /> David is now determined to find out what the reason for Chris's silence was, and why Billy had to be killed by Chris after the crime scene. It is there that David finds out that Billy has betrayed Chris's tribal members by going there with Billy not to be a member of Chris's aboriginal tribe. It is also revealed to David that he himself has a spiritual connection with the Eastern Trail Aborigines, since both Charlie and his stepfather, Rev. Burton, David Parslow, told him. <br /> <br /> The stage is now set for the great and final cleaning cycle that David saw in his night-time dreams and day-time visions. It comes in the form of a massive tidal wave that rolls out of the Pacific Ocean into the Australian coastal city of Sydney and plunges the entire continent.
