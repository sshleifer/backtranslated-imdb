I just watched it on Turner Classic Movies. Last night, for the first time, I have ever seen it, and I loved it. I love many older movies, especially because of the absence of all the dirty language, and excessive violence, nudity and sex in most of today's movies. I also think they were much better in many (but not all) cases. Jimmy Stewart is a special favorite of mine. I just thought this movie was fun to watch and I thoroughly enjoyed it. If you feel the same way about the older movies in the same way, I don't think you can go wrong with this one. I believe that you have 'Mail' is a remake (even if it's a little different and also a very enjoyable movie.) From this movie. For a relaxing night with a movie, you don't have to be ashamed of your kids or anyone entering your show, get it or take it on one of the classic movie channels.
