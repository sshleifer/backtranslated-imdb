This animated TV series is simply the best way for kids to learn how the human body works. Yes, it is biology, but they will never tell it. <br /> <br /> I really think this is the best part of this stream of "educational cartoons". I remember finding small books and a plastic body in several parts: skin, skeleton and of course: organs. <br /> <br /> In the same stream, you find: "Il était une fois l 'homme' that connects the human history from the whims to the 20th century. There is also:" Il était une fois l'espace "( about space and its exploration), but one is more a fiction than a description of reality, as it will happen in the future.
