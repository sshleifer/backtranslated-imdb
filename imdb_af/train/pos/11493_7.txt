The Unborn is a fairly good low-budget horror movie that exploits the fears associated with pregnancy. It is very well handled by the always good Brooke Adams and b-movie James Karen, although the supporting scroll is quite average for a b-degree. The music, by Gary Numan of all people, is also good. Henry Dominic's writing is quite intelligent for this kind of thing, though there is some indication of misconception about it. Rodman Fender's direction is just enough, and there are a few unnecessary cheap scarce. If you are a fan of Adams, whose film career is nowhere as beautiful as it should be, check it out; She is wonderful, as always.
