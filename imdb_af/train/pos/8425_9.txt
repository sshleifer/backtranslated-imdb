I eventually looked at these episodes in 2008 and had to go back and verify all the time when they were actually made. They are absolutely scary because they made room for the fun of what the future would be. Parker and Stone lived in Texas and experienced Gov Bush's idiot or they are those strange people who pay attention to things. Boo, scary! Bush's frat brothers attacked the White House as Arabs carrying guns? Bush 'accidentally' exports someone? (No, wait. He did it as a gov.) It may have been a failure as a sitcom at the moment, but should now be considered brilliant if it is haunting.
