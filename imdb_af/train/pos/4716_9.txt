This movie is just too funny, a totally non-PC gangster skirt. If Mel Brooks made a picture about the Mob in the 30's, it would probably look like that. Too many large one-liners to remember, and although not for everyone, anyone who hasn't slept for a long time doesn't have a pulse. So put it on and LET YOUR Iceholes !!!
