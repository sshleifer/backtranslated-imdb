Christina Raines plays a beautiful model in New York looking for a new apartment and begins to meet strange neighbors and reveal a secret about the building and slowly build herself up to the height of the movie. This film has all sorts of neat plural elements from the Roman Catholic Church towards the Devil, to the gateway to hell, to bizarre rituals, to a growing conspiracy, and eventually to a lot of talented well-known actors and actresses that flood the film. We get Ava Gardner, Burgess Meredith, Chris Sarandon, Jerry Orbach, Deborah Raffin, Arthur Kennedy, Jose Ferrer, Slyvia Miles, Beverly DeAngelo, Eli Wallach, Martin Balsam, Christopher Walkin, William Hickey, Tom Berenger and Jeff Goldblum. forget John Carradine as the old priest. Many of these actors pick it up - especially Burgess Meredith gives a nice comic / demented performance as one of the neighbors with a small bird and a cat. Meredith is unforgettable like Balsam and Chris Sarandon. Some of the artists have virtually nothing like Jose Ferrer in an ungrateful role, even though it is nothing more than a cameo. The Sentinel is a fine horror movie with many psychological elements and some terrifying scenes. The final scene is repulsive and yet cool. I find fault with some of the free sex and violence in the movie, especially the whole scene with DeAngelo and Miles. Was it really necessary? I do not think so. Also, the father / daughter things were a bit so good, but overall the movie works and has a winning pace. Director Michael Winner does a real job and is effective at creating tension and scary movie moments. The scenes with Carradine are particularly effective.
