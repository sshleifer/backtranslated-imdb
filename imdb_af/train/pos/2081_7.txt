1st Looked 8/29/2009 - 7 out of 10 (Dir-Sidney Franklin): Well, account of farmers in China and their rise to prominence and struggling with which Mother nature toss to them. This movie is based on an award-winning novel and chronicles a family starting with the boy's regular marriage to a maid. The film does a great job of retaining your interest despite a somewhat hammy show by the lead Paul Muni played. It chronicles, Wong Long (the character played by Muni) and how he works the land, buys more land, eventually becomes very rich, but then returns to the country where he originally started. The relationship between him and his wife, played by Luise Rainer, is the main board of the story (except the country itself) and despite the obvious non-Chinese actors, it is a good work around the country and its people to show. It is clear that MGM used it to create a very good epic with this one in an era where they could probably afford it. The scene with the locusts is done very well and the rest of the movie really looks good to justify the best cinematography award at the Oscar that year. The definitive definition of an epic is what this story is and it is fairly well subtracted.
