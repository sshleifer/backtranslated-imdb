Here's a strangeness: a contemporary movie about a serial killer that has no combat screens, no one died, no car hunters and no loud noises ..... and it is happening in Russia. There are only two short action scenes, but it's terrible. <br /> <br /> The rest of the story is detective, and how much hassle the poor detective needs to solve the murders. It's a very bleak movie, and "somber" describes the hero's personality (Stephen Rea) the best. Still, the story is not depressed and it is very interesting all the way through. <br /> <br /> Rea is outstanding as the determined, highly-watched detective. Jeffrey DeMunn is actually scary as the killer. Donald Sutherland's Russian accent is thought to be, but he is the only character in this movie that has some warmth. <br /> <br /> Again, the story is dotted with liberal agendas, here and there, with none but two references to bias against gays, the total validity of secular psychology, police and government officials is boring / crude / bigoted , yadda, yadda, yadda. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, it's an intelligent and refreshing lowest crime movie. It is a somewhat unique film that is probably not known, but is well kept by the people who saw it. Since it is based on a lifelong account of this killer, it is increasingly chilling. Don't pass it on, just because you have nothing about it.
