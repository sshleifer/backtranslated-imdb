One of the heartwarming foreign films I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The young girl is a wonderful talent. Stellar performances by her (Doggie), the old man (the king of masks) and Liang (the Living Boddhisatva). <br /> <br /> (SPOILER) The unfortunate treatment of children, especially women, is disturbing. /> <br /> Loved the music. The original Chinese dialogue enhances the emotional intensity of the performances and the story. <br /> <br /> It's a MUST SEE - nice family movie, but not for very young children. If the DVD release was even higher if the soundtrack was transferred better to the DVD and the transfer included the widescreen version.
