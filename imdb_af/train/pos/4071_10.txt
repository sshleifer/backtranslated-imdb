I only saw the movie when I was about seven years old and was totally enchanted by it, but for years I couldn't figure out what the movie was called. Now I accidentally stumbled on the movie twenty-one and about two weeks ago and bought a copy. Although my memory of the movie was a bit vague, I was never disappointed with what I saw. The animation in this movie is great to set up a whole world that is so credible and so animated that you are only drawn to the movie. But this movie also has a plot that will entertain and entertain adults and children. With a floating island, a crazy general, a friendly pirate grandmother and a well-built love story, this movie won't allow you. I would recommend this movie to anyone.
