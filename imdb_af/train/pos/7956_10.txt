It's just a classic movie where the human voices of animals come, is really their mind. I don't know if my video copy is missing a scene, but it never shows how the dogs come out of the pit. It also shows an animal survival instinct and capability detection. But people in the same position will be the helicopters. For once, an original movie is enhanced by a remake if the voiceover is removed for the first time. Only the use of animals can work in such a movie, because the use of humans had to digest the story by killing it, and proving that animals are more interesting than humans
