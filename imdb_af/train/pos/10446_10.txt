I watched this movie 10 years ago. and watched video on average once a year. It's the type of movie that is timeless, because the themes are universal, but the stories and conversation are so personal. It's also one of the few movies you capture from frame one to the credits, despite the fact that there are really only two characters. It is very owed to the engaging hawk and delpy act, which makes us believe that they are actually jesse and celine. It is also the first movie I have seen to call reality TV, and now the phenomenon is fierce! I like the way this movie just encloses the audience in its space, and lets you think how far you may be, that you are one of those characters. It also made me ride the train in Europe! I did not meet anyone who is not related to this movie. Maybe it's talking about myself, my friends, or just the sheer genius of this movie.
