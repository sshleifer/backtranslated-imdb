I can safely admit (as an IMDb geek) that 'Phantom Lady' will never break into my film noir top twenty. It may not even sneak into the top fifty. But rather than discrediting the movie not to be as good as many other classics of the film noir genre, keep in mind that 'Phantom Lady' has enough strong and lasting images to make it worthwhile . All that is expected of the viewer is the ability to go beyond the extremely slow start. <br /> <br /> The movie is not cooked until 'Kansas' (Ella Raines) tries to prove anything but a single-handed, innocent innocence of her boss, Scott Anderson (Alan Curtis), found guilty of murder . 'Kansas' is Anderson's secretary every day and amateur detective at night. Like the beginner's key, she does very well for herself while working in the streets of New York at night. She started some bits with a murder mystery. To be honest, the movie belongs to Raines and it is only because of her presence that the film doesn't work well at all. Somehow, she can breathe life into a movie about a convicted man who isn't interested in the slightest. I'm not sure if this split dynamics of a characterless front man is the fault of the actor or the director, but it is clear where it touches something terribly wrong with the film. <br /> <br /> As interesting as Raines is As a novice detective, things are really accelerated in another hidden device when 'Kansas' visits a walking drummer (Elisa Cook, Jr.) after a night out, looking for information to help her convicted boss. She and the drummer paint the town a new kind of red while visiting the "all night" jazz clubs. Trying to describe this scene would either be an injustice to the scene or worse, it could destroy the scene all together. You will know the scene as soon as the last cymbal accident is complete. If you are lucky to have this movie on DVD, you will regain this scene time and time again. As good as Raines, this is the scene that makes this film remarkable. It is mainly because of this scene that I rate 'Phantom Lady' a 7 instead of a 6. <br /> <br /> For the most part, this film comes out as lazy and leafy with some great scenes and one beautiful scene. . This is the 'drum / sex scene' that separates this movie from any other of the same ilk. <br /> <br /> And just as it is said in the movie that you never go wrong with Vanilla, I would also add that "With Vanilla" is the safe fall back choice if one cannot decide have a better treat. <br /> <br /> 7/10.
