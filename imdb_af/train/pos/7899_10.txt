It was an excellent movie. I don't understand why so many people don't like it. There was so much to do with so many beautiful images and so much compassion in the things that were not said. I was thoroughly entertained, leaving a sense of joyful exuberance, just as I am most of the Tom Robbins stories. Now I haven't read this particular Robbin's book, so I'm not doing it now, but I can't think this movie could be a very bad interpretation. The film has left much to you to define yourself, which is the best part of a Tom Robbins novel, dreaming of the details. <br /> <br /> For all of you who said it was the worst movie ever, I was sorry that little of the blackout light in your hearts should be left. By far the worst was this movie glorious. Long live the creeping tap.
