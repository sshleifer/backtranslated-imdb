His time to pay tribute to the big Charton Heston after his recent passing, but this film is not the one. His other films from a previous generation were BEN H, THE TEN COMMENTS, OMEGA MAN and PLANET OF THE APES were his better works. <br /> <br /> This film, made in 1973, aims to prophesy a future earth in 2022. It is so overpopulated that the human race has been manipulated by authorities to eat a universally manufactured food product called Soylent Green made with human flesh. This bizarre and indisputable film was so ridiculous at the time of its release as it is now, and is taking India's population of about 2 billion. It will then be meat eaters without knowing it. <br /> <br /> Charlton Heston character this super secret international conspiracy that world powers have used to meet the nutritional needs of overcrowding by using cannibalism. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, for the producers of this movie, the Green message they deliver is not the Green Party of today's ethos. thank the Lord. Cannibalism has been practiced by the indigenous peoples of New Zealand, Fiji and Borneo up to 40 years before this film was made, but has long been abandoned by human civilization. <br /> <br /> Another stupid prediction in the film is that women become quasi-sex slaves that reflect the tide of radical feminism, which was on the scene in 1972 when this film was made. <br /> <br /> The movie was stupid and now so stupid, but it contains a very unrelenting last movie. show by the late and great Edward G. Robinson, but still not a valid reason to visit the film, except for academic reasons. <br /> <br /> It's a dud of a movie and I wouldn't even recommend baby boomers or Charlton Heston fans. All the other reviews of this film I have read the same sound that refers to a dystopian society, in the future of which the central theme only involves the US where an ecological disaster occurred. <br /> <br /> Only merit in the movie is that the Earth is not overcrowding.
