This movie must be placed on DVD. It was so funny and I loved it. Really, very cute and funny. Not realistic, but not supposed to be. The only thing I didn't like was that the girl relied too much on the guy. However, this represents the duration of thought. I tried to get this movie for so long and it wasn't available for US format, just in the UK and won't play on American DVD players. This is unfortunately an overlooked classic movie! Believe it or not, this movie can easily become a cult favorite for all ages. Sorry, we do not legalize certain things that can really save small countries or our own. Lindy is invaluable, a positive character that makes lemon juice from lemons. She is funny and charming. She stole the show!
