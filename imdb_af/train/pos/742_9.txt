Upcoming age films are nowadays very normal. For 1980, "Foxes" really gives its meaning. Jodie Foster plays her character straight out. Since then she has been doing "Taxi Driver" four years earlier. She has a stronger character in this movie. She is Jeanie, a high school who has a lot of guts, and apparently comes out of the situation. Scott Baio plays Bradweg for Chachi on 'Happy Days'. He is considered immature by the other girls. Cherie Currie is Annie, hangs with the wrong crowd, followed by her policeman's father. Jeanie and her three other friends decide to stay on the wild side until they move into a rented house where a party gets out of hand. Exploring life on the other side of the tracks can be fun or dangerous. Annie is saved by Jeanie and Brad all the time she is wasted. The reality is coming back hard where she is killed in a car accident. And one is married to a much older man. Growth is not easy, sometimes we have to investigate life. In fact, you need to be careful about the people around you. For me, I was my own, and I tend to stay that way! Great music, good plot, this movie is a gem! 4 out of 5 stars!
