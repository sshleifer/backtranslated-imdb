The literary genius of Vladimir Navokov is brought back on the screen and much will be noted in the cultured world. The director puts us in control of the story of Alexander, an absent chapline study of chess addiction. Nastasya is on holiday in a marble column resort where a chess championship is offered. She met Alexander by picking up a queen piece he was bagging through his jacket. A magnetic attraction developed by which he suggested the next day, the mother warned the man's telegrams. He comes and asks Alexander, we get it faded to the past, including Godfather II, where we see young Alexander, a child producer. He is taken under a school teacher's wing and uses his genius for 10 years to make huge amounts. Think Alexander reached its peak, leaving him but becoming legend. The old teacher is hurting and trying to win over an old Alexander rival. In a serious chess game where the World Cup victory is one way to immortality, the match time, the game time ends to end the next day. That day Nastasya's wedding, the old teacher disturbs and Alexander is sent on a nervous breakdown. Nastasya, holding her stomach and looking through her love jacket, finds his strategy for the game and follows the moves. Although the film unfortunately swings from its Russian roots, its low-back dresses are beautiful, Alexander plays his role sublime. The director underestimates her audience, we hardly ever play and the only hint of the Luzhin Defense is after the trade queens, isolate The Opponents King with your 3 feet and king, which offers the castle for a partner. Nastasya is a good game, but feels his conclusion deserves more intensity, but maybe the emotions were right for chess for just her. The Luzhin defense elegantly gives the honor of Navokov, the complexity of his work in images is a world event that should not be missed.
