I only saw this movie in the early 90's when it was first released. Room with a view was also new. Enchanted April has so much more to offer! I found it much more real and nice, the characters are more credible than being 'normal'. By the end of the movie I felt the same as I did when I first saw the BBC production of Pride and Prejudice. I longed for the characters to find what they were looking for, whether it was isolation, peace, freedom or love. You get the feeling that Italy is so far removed from everything they have ever known, that they are so decadent to take a risk and stay behind everything that is confused. But in the heat of spring in April, everyone's lives are unleashed and unraveled (in line with Victorian corsets) and slowly rebuilt to everyone's satisfaction. What a little jewel of a movie! How come, is it no longer known?
