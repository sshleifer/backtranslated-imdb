The Sopranos may be the most spirit-opening series you may ever see. It's smart, it's weird, it's funny - and it carries the mafia genre so well that most people don't resist watching. The best thing about this show is the overwhelming realism of the characters residing in the underground world of New York crime families. For most of the time, you really don't know if the wise guys will put someone in the back or buy their lunch. <br /> <br /> Further additions to the realistic approach of characters in this show is the depth of their personalities. These are dangerous men, most of them killers, but by God if you don't love them either. I laughed at their wisdom cracks, tore when they made the wrong judgment, and felt scared of the mere ruthlessness of a serious criminal. <br /> <br /> The suburbs of New Jersey are absolutely perfect for the sub-texts of this show - people are not always as they look, and the sharp contrast between humdrum and the actions taken by these seemingly small criminals , even weighing the probability. <br /> <br /> If you haven't done so yet, you should definitely.
