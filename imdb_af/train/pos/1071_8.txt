definitely need some work in season 2. Like the Virus between Max and Logan, and Ames White with his old, supercultural. However, during the season two were the only things I watched, to see if Max and Logan would ever get rid of the nasty virus Max was infected. Very good drama in season two. But of course, like all TV shows, if something is wrong, the broadcasting corporation takes it out of the air. I was seriously hoping for a third and final season. Season 2 lets you hang out, unless you read the books by Max Allan Collins, then you'll know what's happening. <br /> <br /> Dark Angel needs to be re-aired for one season, though it may be a great deal just to get all the original actors back. as Jessica Alba's carrier air allegedly hit the show. If that were the case then there should be a movie to complete. just like the show Firefly, which of course also canceled FOX.
