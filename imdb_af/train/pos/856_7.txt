Delivering some very humorous rude lines by Pierce Brosnan is just the admission price. He plays a sort of James Bond's psycho-twin brother, undoubtedly divorced at birth. As an intense hit, his character is very sexual, but even better, very funny. Add the friendly, up-and-coming American man next door, Greg Kinnear, to contrast. The many places, vibrant colors and fast humor offer great entertainment. Hope Davis is well-cast as the "jewel of a woman." But the focus of the movie is on the two fellows, a new "Odd Couple", and that is the part that works very well. Hold a big (probably R-rated) laugh and look at the places where the story goes a little deeper.
