I saw the description of the movie on TCM and let it run because I love Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith. So I was surprised to find that I really liked the movie and found it very exceptional. Of course it is seriously dated, but as a period piece it is worth looking at the subtle sense of humor in life and lifestyle, almost forty years ago. Now the only problem is finding it on DVD so I can see it more often. I was also well taken with the performances of Smith and Ustinov as the lead roles, and of Karl Malden, Bob Newhart, and the como appearances of Robert Morley and Cesar Romero.
