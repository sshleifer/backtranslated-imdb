This movie is fantastic because it explores storytelling and fantasy in the way a child, for adults. The idea that a child's drawings become a place that she can physically visit and influence is wonderful. At the same time, you can get all the child psychologist about it and say she really investigates her subconscious, just as we all do in our dreams when we sleep. The little that my gauze pussies give is when her father is in the paperhouse and pursues her. The only thing I can't stand is that it is marketed as a horror movie ... it's really not. If you want to see something British with a lot of storyline that makes you guess without the usual cheap excitement that most movies have to use, look at Paperhouse.
