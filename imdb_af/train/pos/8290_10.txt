This is just another example of Gene Wilder's absolute genius. He wrote and died in this wonderful mystery. No one could do it better. The tension was continually significant. I wish Mr. Wilder will satisfy us with one of these things. I enjoyed everything I've ever seen for Mr Wilder, but I didn't know how truly talented he was before I saw "Murder in a small town" and this one. He really has a good understanding of what audiences want and how to deliver it in his writing and, of course, in his brilliant acting. His subtle white comes in shovels. I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves secrets and / or Gene Wilder's film work. His star just becomes brighter and brighter.
