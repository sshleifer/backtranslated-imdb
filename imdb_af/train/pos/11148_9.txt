'Midnight Cowboy' evaluated X in 1969 with the original release. There are a few scenes you can understand, just a little. The movie about Joe Buck (Jon Voight) coming from Texas to New York City to become a hustler is sometimes a bit disturbing. Adapted as a cowboy, he tries to live as a hustler, earn money by love. It doesn't work as it intended. After a man named Rico 'Ratso' Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman) pulled a trick on him and stole money, they became friends. They live in an empty and very dirty apartment. Then Ratso gets sick and Joe has to try to make money. <br /> <br /> The movie is probably rated X for the major, but on the way we see some strange things. The editing in this movie is wonderful. We see Joe and Ratso's dream order interrupted by the real world in a fun and sometimes funny way. Dustin Hoffman, Jon Voight and the supporting actors give good performances. Especially Hoffman delivers some well-known lines. The score is done by John Barry and sounds good. All this makes it a good movie that won the best picture Oscar for a good reason.
