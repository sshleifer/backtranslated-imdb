Always enjoying the big play by Drew Barrymore and her great performance in this film, where she plays a very complicated young bile, (Holly Gooding), "Skip Parts", 2000, leaving New York and traveling to California and a flat share with an emerging author, George Newbern, (Patrick Highsmith), "Far Harbor", '96. Many strange things start happening with Holly and she tries to find her brother in a spiritual setting after killing her father. If you look close enough, you see Drew Barrymore's mother in real life as her mother in this picture. If it wasn't for the good acting of Drew Barrymore and George Newbern, this movie should only be seen on Halloween Night! However, it is sure to be surprises in the END !!
