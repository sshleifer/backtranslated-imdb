First, I'm a big fan of 80 movies, and also of Jennifer Conelly. So yesterday I wandered into a local, used book / movie store and found a VHS copy. I read the back and it sounded good and for $ 3.99 it was a good deal. So I took it home and put it in the video recorder. What a lovely movie! At my age I am more concerned with movies like About Last Night or St Elmo's Fire, but I still remember how it was to be 15/16 and in love with an older man. We all have those little breasts when we are younger. And if that doesn't work out, we're sad and we think we'll never get over it. But of course we do it. Many times. It's the kind of sweet quality I really got from this movie. The feeling of "Oooh! I remember when something like that happened to me ..." is all that. The characters are interesting and well developed. I recommend it to anyone who recommends 80's movies, especially teenage films, or for anyone who just wants to go back and remember a simpler time in their lives.
