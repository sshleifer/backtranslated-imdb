First, this movie was a wild ride all the way. The story of training the soldiers, fighting with their superiors, and eventually grouping. <br /> <br /> From the beginning to the end. This is a war drama that you can see if you are in constant cussing (sometimes out of reason) and the horrors of the boat camp. <br /> <br /> The dynamics of how the actors interacted was quite surprising. , and sometimes humorous. How Bozz (Colin Farrel) talks about Paxton (Matthew Davis) about the story, from camp to Tigerland, and even eventually helps him. <br /> <br /> The innovative freehand filming has a certain flavor or flavor to the film. Constant motion, constant action and just constant confusion. Sometimes it was a tool. Others, not so much. <br /> <br /> In the course of the film, it's increasingly realistic. Some points in the movie (especially the sex scene) were just a little too realistic, although they did have an effect on the movie that would not have been there without them. It was a very gritty movie, through and through. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, it's one of Colin Farrel's better movies (if not his best performance). The acting for each character was excellent. 9/10 ssnuk3r
