A Bug's Life is a very good animated feature. This movie is for younger children, but it is also a good movie for people who are my age. The story is about an ant called Flik. He brought destruction to his colony when he destroyed the food that was for the superior locusts. He is banned and he has to find bigger mistakes to solve the mess. This movie is a classic because it is a good movie and it is a Pixar movie. The animation is brilliant especially for the late 90's. The story is good, but a little more detail will suffice. The tuner is good as with most animation films. The music is nice to listen to. Nothing special, but it deserves a nomination for one of the music categories. Overall, this movie hit me as awestruck. It's a great movie for all families. I rate this movie 10/10.
