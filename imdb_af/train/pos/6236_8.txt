The plot's intellect is about as light as feather. But the advantage here is the classic refusal of the boy and girl we got used to in "The Gay Divorcee" and "Top Hat" is now absent. Instead of the typical casual acquaintance, the dance duo is former Bake Baker and Sherry Martin lovers who have still been in love since their dancing days. <br /> <br /> Of course, as a 30-year-old musician, there are the problems of misunderstood romance, elegant courtesy, and the slight annoyance of a sabotaged baking soda audition has made Ginger something special. And then in the great tradition of falling finance, there's nothing better for Hollywood's best entertainment officials than placing on a show. <br /> <br /> Delicious numbers of Irving Berlin are sprinkled across the spectrum. Top hats and evening dresses are saved right up to the end, which remains a refreshing change. Fred and Ginger are out to charm the world ... and charm the fleet. Everyone and everything is just as enjoyable again. <br /> <br /> Pure classic folly at its best. But with Astaire and Rogers, we just know it has to work. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8.25 / 10
