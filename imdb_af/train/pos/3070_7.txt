"Panic" is a fascinating, faded genre film about a disturbing and confronted middle-aged Hitman's reconciliation of lovers with a younger, unadorned hair stylist, his love for wife and son, his duty to his employer / father with his own identity. Although the film has a turbulent purpose and an ambiguous end, in almost all aspects it is a beautiful production. The characters' clarity and sincerity in such an unlikely story can fascinate and irritate both audiences.
