Richard Brooks excellent 1967 film by Truman Capote's novel IN KOUE BLOED is a perfect companion for Philip Seymour Hoffman's Oscar winning performance in 2005 CAPOTE. They play really well together (try their separate nights). It is unusual to find 38-year-old films that are so good. These two really improve each other. Although different actors play the roles of killers Perry Smith and Dick Hickock, the two pieces mix well. Only the part of the writer (played by Paul Stewart) in the Brooks films is weaker, as they give him a different name than Capote. I suggest looking at CAPOTE first, followed by IN COLD BLOOD. It makes for a powerful experience!
