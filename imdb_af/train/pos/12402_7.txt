** Warning! Spoilers Forward! ** <br /> <br /> This short part is one of two outlines on the short section of "The Matrix" in which Morpheus explains how the matrix originated. Because we already know the story, the plot itself is not surprising; and the short is not so much entertaining or informative. But that's how it is presented, as a file in the historical archives. The footage is better than average, and generally cold colors help the purpose of the short. <br /> <br /> A few issues. The violence of the story is a bit free and, in combination with the occasional political correctness (UN scenes), detracts from the straight narration of the short. Plus, it has to be seen with part two to be complete. <br /> <br /> The Animatrix concept is brilliant, and despite some difficulty, these cards still meet its purpose. It won't fit in the original movie in style, content or flow. This is the ideal method to reveal history. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: Good information. Could have been a little better, but still a solid 7 out of 10.
