I suggested renting this movie to my friend and he obliged him as he had already seen the movie and he said it was okay. I thought the title was a bit crazy, as the version at our store was called "The Fear: Halloween Night". I expected this movie to be a bit of a Halloween with a killer. But it opened with a good scene and the murderer immediately killed two victims and flew forward twenty years later where his son who saw him killed the two people (including his mother) and he even testified that his fathers were suicide. a secluded cabin. the forest with his friends and his girlfriend, where he tries his fears to come up with a wooden image with his father's spirit. Pretty good for a sequel and I've never seen it first.
