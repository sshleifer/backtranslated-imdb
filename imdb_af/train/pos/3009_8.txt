A movie that is such a 30-year-old Warners movie in an era in which every studio had a special look and style, unlike today where only audiences come, is the object. <br /> <br /> Curitz was one of the essential Warners home directors working with a stiff economy and a great deal of efficiency while creating quality, working methods that much required a director at Warners, a studio that One of the "big five" majors in this era was the production of quality films for their big chains of theaters. <br /> <br /> Although we have an upper class environment on Long Island, there is the generic Warners style embedded here, with a story that could be torn from the chapters. Another example is when the photographers comment on the girls' legs early in the film and suggests that "they are not the trophies" give the film a more working man, to the earth, because it was the audiences targeting Warners in major depression. (Ironically, Columbia and Universal were the two minors under these five majors up to the 50's when their television involvement changed their prosperity - they would have made so cheap and without the Polish and great talent). Curtiz has a fast-moving movie, while the viewer is kept with large camera angles and quick editing. <br /> <br /> Thanks, there is no flexible love subplot so the pleasure can only move on.
