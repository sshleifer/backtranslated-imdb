Maria Braun is an extraordinary woman who is offered full and very credible, despite being so inflexible than limiting incompetence. She will do everything to make her marriage work, including shameless opportunism and sexual manipulation. And so under the loose outside, she reveals a pretty nice value system. The film suffers from a sudden and unexpected end that later feels totally inadequate, with the ease known to end your school's creative writing exercise with "and then wake up". It's also on the other side with the most eccentric title sequence I've ever seen, but don't let anything come of you.
