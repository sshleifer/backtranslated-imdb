Back to the roots with "as it is in heaven" - what are the real values ​​of life? These Swedes cut out a message that focuses on each heart. We've seen it twice in a theater packed up to the last seat: love of pure and joy within the music of a chorus that is simple, yet powerful, once everyone gets his inner tone. <br /> <br /> From the brightness of fame to the school of his youth, now empty and ready to be adapted as his new home after falling into the scene, Daniel wants to listen and live in the simple, warm and rough people from the north. <br /> <br /> He wins the hearts of music and has the ability to love and unconditionally love. <br /> <br /> Don't see it if you're down to Hollywood. These things do not contain any extras, only your laughter, your compassion, your tears!
