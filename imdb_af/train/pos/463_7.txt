Of course, the plot, the writing and especially the decisive role in the film is strong. So many good things to see. One aspect I particularly liked is the idea of ​​the antagonist - Luzhini's (Turturro's) - ex-mentor who sidelines his evil. His chess opponent - an Italian three-piece dandy and sugar cane - seems to be a real ghost, and a very good chess player. To his credit, the "opponent" goes along with the plan to finally finish the final championship game (Luzhin took a flyer from a window - sad but released to him) by the unstable genius of a widow (Emily Watson.) In death, the Luzhin's defense (which he worked out in a late moment of clarity) allowed the play of an honorable chess master to be played. The Italian gentleman has the drama and calls it brilliant. Talk about a dramatic "end game!"
