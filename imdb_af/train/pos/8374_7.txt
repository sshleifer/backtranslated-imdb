OK, this movie was cool. I don't think it was the best movie ever made, but it was definitely fun. My brother and I do plays again, and occasionally throw the movie out of the closet, blow off the dust and enter it. Enjoyable to the end, but a good concept. It is a movie that one should only forget and enjoy. Judgment is the victory for Robot Jox.
