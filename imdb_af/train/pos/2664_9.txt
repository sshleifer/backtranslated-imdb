Although The Shining is over a quarter of a century old, I challenge someone not to upset Jack Nicholson's descent into madness. It is a rare example of something so unique that no one could rip it; Instead, it is referred to again and again in pop culture. The twins, the elevator of blood, RedRum, the crazy nonsense "write" ... it must be seen, if it is nothing else, to understand all the play in daily life. The film is simultaneously scary, exciting, beautiful and psychologically interesting. It has the classic Hitchcock mystery and the horror of a modern thriller. And it has what horror movies usually lack: a great script.
