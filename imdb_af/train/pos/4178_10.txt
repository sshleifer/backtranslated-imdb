This movie is a true reflection of the Australian ingenuity needed to make this country over the past 200 years. Not pompous like the British, not Gung-Ho like the Americans. If one of those countries tried what this crew did, it would have failed. Either because of ignorance on the British side, or too much faith in superior firepower on the American side. "True" Australians (ie non-importing) are the only ones who can excel in modern military conflicts because they had to improvise most of their adult lives. Just look at examples like Gallipoli; Paschendale; Tobruk; New Guinea and Vietnam.
