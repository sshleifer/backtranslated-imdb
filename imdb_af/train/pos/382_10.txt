One of the best movies ever made! Why it's just a 7.6 rating is a mystery. This film is a window in the world of black experience in America. Must be compulsory for all white people and all children over 10 years of age. I recommend watching it with 'The Long Walk Home' as a companion. If you think Whoopi Goldberg's work is about "Homer and Eddie" or "Hollywood Squares" think again. Don't miss this movie, which won the Oscar. (And read the book too!)
