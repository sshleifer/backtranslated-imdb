Mitchell Leisen's fifth feature as director, showing his versatility by directing a musical, after his previous movies were heavy drama. He also plays a cameo as the conductor. <br /> <br /> You can see it's a pre-code movie, and nothing like it has been made in the US for a while (like 30+ years). Leisen shot the musical numbers so they were as the audience would see - no wide screenshots or from above all Busby Berkeley. What I find funny or interesting is that you never actually see the audience. <br /> <br /> As others have mentioned, the leaders are fairly characterless, and Jack Oakie and Victor McLaghlan play their normal movie characters. However, Gertrude Michael offers a little spark. <br /> <br /> The music numbers are interesting and some good (especially the rape of the Rhapsody is amusing), but the drama is inconclusive and decayed - three murders are too much and have minimal emotional impact on the characters. This is where this movie could have been much better.
