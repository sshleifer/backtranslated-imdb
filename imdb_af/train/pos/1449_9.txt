This is one of the best crime drama movies in the late 1990s. It was filled with a huge role, a powerful storyline, and many of the players involved performed well. Pacino was wonderful; He had to be nominated for something. John Cusack was also good, as long as the viewer didn't emphasize his Louuu-siana accent. He can come so annoying if you can't stand this dialect. The way Pacino's character interacted with Cusack's character was sometimes credible, dramatic, and somewhat comical. Danny Aiello was excellent as always. David Paymer was great in a supporting role. Bridget Fonda was good but not memorable. There were times when this picture called so many characters, probably too much. It may take a second impression to remember, "what Zapatti was?" After so many cross references, just stop thinking and thinking. The end didn't have much to do. It had been built up for so long and then it was a bit of an eclipse. It was one of the few problems with the movie. Since the movie was not billed as a "big, blunt" big-screen hit, it forgot some that this movie even existed. Pacino and Aiello were great, but the film's lack of "splash" in the theaters may not have accounted for any nominations. It was semi-successful in the home market, and viewers still learn that this title is out there. Made in 1996, it still stands today and will be popular for many years. <br /> <br /> Make yourself a lemon pudding (you'll see) and see this movie!
