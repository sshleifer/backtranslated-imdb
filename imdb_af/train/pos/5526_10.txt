I love cinema so I'm going to be deeply embarrassed. I put an inch down to "Che, Parts 1 and 2" without seeing the movie. I know terribly. But I felt in a trap committed by ... who? I don't really know, but there was a negative word of mouth that spread like a wild fire. And no matter how difficult I am, I fell into it. But I happily bumped into an Argenic film director, Martin Donovan, a man I love and admire. When I told him I wasn't going to see it, because I knew the movie was a failure he looked at me as if he were ready to hit my face and Donovan was a pacifist! He took me aside and told me how much he loved the movie and why. I immediately looked at both parts and "Che, Part 1 and 2" is the best movie I saw in 2008. It is so pure that it will remind you of the work of some of the great masters of the past. The audience for his audience is something we are no longer accustomed to. I don't know if we ever were. Sounds, moves, without concessions and Benicio del Toro is just extraordinary. We can see his soul, we can actually see it. The mankind of the man is overwhelming. So, thank you Martin Donovan once again for teaching me so honestly. Bravo Del Toro, Bravo Soderbergh and everyone involved in this landmark movie. Don't make the mistake I was about to commit. Go on now, on the big screen
