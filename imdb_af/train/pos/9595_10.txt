In the beginning of this film, one of the commentators said he said he had two strikes against him: he was black and male. But in addition, he has a third strike: he's gay. "You need to be stronger than you ever thought," he said. "Paris is Burning" is a documentary about gay black and Hispanic men who are tranvestites or transsexuals. <br /> <br /> The miracle of "Paris is Burning" is that director Jennie Livingston takes a subject that could easily become a freak show and allow people into it. We learn their views on homosexuality, men, women, their hopes, their disappointments, their dreams. Some of these dreams are so unattainable, it's tragic. Many people are serious in denial; <br /> <br /> It's not a movie for everyone. There are shots in this movie of naked transsexuals. If you have a problem with homosexuality, then this movie is not for you. But if you see this movie, you will realize: "Paris is Burning" is not really about men wearing women's clothes. It's about a group of people who are regularly marginalized and placed by society in general and what they do to get a sense of community in their lives. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie four times since it was released in 1991, because it says so many things: it's a comment on materialism in our culture, on gender roles, on rich and poor people, on the media and what it celebrates, about fame and adulation. "Paris is Burning" is one of the most humane, and one of the saddest, movies I've ever seen.
