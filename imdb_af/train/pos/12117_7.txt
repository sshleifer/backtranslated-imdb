Although this film has placed Davis on the map because of her brilliant intensive performance as the illiterate boy-snatch waitress / prostitute Mildred Rogers, this film is particularly unsatisfactory for me as a whole. The acting is indeed good in every respect. What I cannot satisfy for my life is how Phillip, a sensitive, well-bred young man, will take on the constant abuse that is constantly smashing at him: I find his na√Øve tolerance in some ways incredibly incredible. Yes, I know he is a sensitive clog-footed, introverted intellectual. But Davis is such a poisonous witch that no one who has cultivated will endure her beliefs or actions and make them credible. Davis is amazing in her role: yes, she may occasionally go overboard in her histrionics, but it is a lively creative depiction, no matter what. Too bad she didn't play a gangster ball. Her character would be completely credible as a tramp under low life!
