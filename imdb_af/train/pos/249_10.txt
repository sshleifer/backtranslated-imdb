I've seen the trailer for this movie a few times, and I have to say Ned Kelly looks like it's a great movie. When I saw the trailer for the first time, I couldn't take my eyes off it (it ensured my attention). Heath Ledger sticks to what he knows and what works for him, periods. Not to say Orlando Bloom, which is seen for a split second look fantastic. I think this movie will be a hit, and it will be seen over and over again, many people.
