This program is great fun and the title song is so catchy. I can't get it out of my head. I find, as I get older, I recorded on the wrinkles that did things, and these four are excellent in their efforts. Some of what they do is shameful but brilliant, as nowadays we can never do our real life with our computer world. I always learn something from the shows. But if you like mystery, drama, comedy, and a little forensic work, you'll love this show. It reminds me of Quincy, ME in one way and Barney Miller in another way they work and respond to each other. They screw a lot, but they get the job, and that's what counts.
