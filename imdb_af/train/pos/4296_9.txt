This would be my number one movie of the year for 1991, except that it was beaten by the brilliant JFK. It's such a wonderful movie! I loved it. I love stories where different characters' lives intersect and how to handle their lives. Kevin Kline is good here, but is challenged by Danny Glover and especially Steve Martin. I've never had much like Martin or his style, but here he is wonderful. I loved the whole speech he gave to Kline at the end of the Grand Canyon. The writing was excellent. Larry Kasdan, IMO, is a great dialogue writer, along the lines of Kevin Smith and Quentin Tarantino. Here he formed several three-dimensional characters and well-designed story lines, and messages that give a positive feel to our lives. A truly excellent movie. 4 out of 4 stars
