I rented it a few years ago, but the video industry only had VHS. Straight to the video it was noticed (you know where the box covers the same writing and color schemes using successful movies). I didn't know what to expect, except what was printed. The first thing I thought when I looked was "what the heroes wrong with the sound?" - It was clear that there was no dialogue. Words echoed, so I stopped saving what I needed to pay more attention to. Think there's no Shakespeare here! Just plain talk. The story is simple enough, the boy meets girl, etc. What made me so humorous and sincere was that people in the movie didn't look like caricatures written in the story, but rather non-actors who were temporarily from their work (including uniforms). All the time you start to see what the filmmaker is after, and then see that there are no attempts at cheap humor (people who have hurt their private use vulgarities. It couldn't hurt the marketing.) There was something honest it. If they had a bigger budget, it would have been better, and they sure would be considered daily, but they went ahead and made it. It made me feel what independent movie work is about. The word "Indy" is cast as if it were a genre. Ha! .. it's funny!
