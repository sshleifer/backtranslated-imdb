Just a cause is a faulty but decent movie held together by strong performances and some creative (though very predictable) writing. Sean Connery is an anti-death crusader brought in to rescue an apparently innocent young black man (Blair Underwood) from the ultimate punishment. To fix things, Connery goes to the scene of the crime, where he has to fight not only over time, but an engaging sheriff (Laurence Fishbourne). Twists and turns and rollovers are in abundance - a little surprising, some - as the aging crusade attempts to unravel the mystery. The climate end is a bit ridiculous, but just a look at a slow night is just a cause.
