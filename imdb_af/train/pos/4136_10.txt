I loved Laurence Olivier for the past few weeks and was excited when I discovered this gem. I always found it wonderful if I walked over a movie where I didn't have to put my finger on the remote control if nudity was giving it a bad head. <br /> <br /> The divorce of Lady X is charming to the final scene and had to be a real joy to viewers in 1938. I just wish people today can accept and love true humor instead of the awful dirt talk that people now call. <br /> <br /> The divorce of wife X is worthwhile for anyone's time.
