What a beautiful movie ... <br /> <br /> Accompanied by Oscar-winning Composer RACHEL PORTMAN's lush, emotional and dreamy music, this film remains a pure pleasure that is considered more than once a year. <br /> <br /> Incredible decisive ... <br /> <br /> Gwyneth Paltrow was perfect for Emma's role. Toni Collette was great like Harriett Smith. <br /> <br /> The character that stole the movie was MISS BATES !!! She was pleasing to look at, one found him on the edge of the seat just hanging on her and laughing with her hysteria. One of the most impressive characters I've experienced in the ages. From one of the opening styles when she mr. Woodhouse thank you for sending "that beautiful quarter-back of pig ... Pork, MOTHER !!!" she shouts in her daffy and clearly hearing-impaired mother, ma'am. Bates (played by Emma Thompson's mother, Phyllida Law) who is lost and lost. <br /> <br /> The comical ways in which Emma will avoid the Miss Bates grid builds herself for a real treat on the picnic when Emma Mrs. Bates insults what takes her cruel digs to her heart. We see poor Miss. Assets that stutter and on the edge of tears and just as crushed can't help, but feel that his heart has ripped out on her behalf. It's a classic scene, one to be played over and over. <br /> <br /> The end is right with 'Sense & Sensibility' and offers one of the greatest lessons of life on how to marry one's best friend ... <br /> <br /> I hope this movie will enjoy you all as much as I do. <br /> <br /> I advertised it!
