Have you ever, in your life, gone out for a sporting activity, tried your best, and then found yourself in an important part, after which you had a brief chance to be a hero and a champion. . . fail? I believe many of us had that moment in our lives. This is the premise of the movie, "The Best of Times." In this story, a middle-aged banker, called Jack Dundee (Robin Williams), suffered from the deep melancholy of a soccer error, which happened years ago, to play the game again. . again. To achieve this, he must convince the once great soccer game Reno Hightower (Kurt Russell) to make a return. For Reno, who is satisfied with his current fate in life, it is not necessary to change the past record, which gets better as he ages. In both their problems, the fact is years gone by and both of their marriages are fading and in need of re-movement. Not easy if his father-in-law (Donald Moffat) usually reminds him of the biggest decline. Nevertheless, Dundee is persistent and will do anything to try and correct the biggest blunder of his life. Great fun for everyone who wants to enjoy their youth again. ***
