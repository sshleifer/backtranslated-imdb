I was fortunate to see it at a movie festival and was beaten so hard with what I saw the next night for his second of three shows. A funny, cruel and sharp-toothed attack on every aspect of mainstream entertainment is passively swallowed without tasting by the lower-common denominator target audience used by a unified journalist, slowly adopting members for his guerrilla warfare for predictability is what the film is about and is performed in such an unpredictable and refreshing way that you remain after the credits have been hopefully extended and excited that original films can still be made. Anyone who is frustrated with unfulfilled expectations for something to relieve their imagination will do well to hunt this rare seen item (and I mean hunting). For Fight Club fans and any Charlie Kaufman movie, they need viewing for anyone who avoids multiplexes like a rabid dog.
