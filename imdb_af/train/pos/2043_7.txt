I just watched this movie last night at the Toronto Film Festival where it played under the Midnight Madness section. To tell the truth, the only reason I went for this movie was because it shared its name with the Radiohead song, and also because my friend bought the tickets, so I really didn't have a choice. It's like The Silence of the Lambs, but it seems to be semi-gore flick. Someone has already said that none of the characters is equivalent, and it is absolutely correct. I couldn't really care if Potente's character had her bowels, the Creep figured out. I waited for the homeless to make it alive with Potente's character just to get her desserts. Christopher Smith certainly did a good job with the visual aspect of the movie. However, the story is pretty poor, but then the whole point of the movie is going to be crazy about you and it really did it effectively. Moreover, the score by a Bristol group called The Insects was. It frightened me more than anything else. <br /> <br /> The director was a very decent guy and was quite entertaining during the Q&A session. I really hope he will get better movies in the future. <br /> <br /> This one is strict for genre fans, but I recommend non-supporters to try and give it a try anyway. It was a fun ride.
