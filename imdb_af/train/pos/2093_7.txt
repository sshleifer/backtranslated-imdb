It's a bit long (2 hours, 20 minutes), but it had a lot of the famous Pearl Buck novel in it. In other words, lots of ground to cover. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it was soap operas, but also included visually dramatic moments with a locust at the end of the movie. It was amazing to see. In view of this movie, about 70 years old, the special effects staff on this film have a spectacular work. <br /> <br /> Paul Muni and Luise Rainer were award-winning actors in their day and they do not disappoint here, giving both powerful performances. The only problem is credibility, since all the Asians are played by Caucasions and some of them, like Walter Connolly, don't really look like that. I would like to see a repetition of this movie with all-Asian actors, not for PC reasons, but to make the story look more credible and sound.
