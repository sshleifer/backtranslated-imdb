The plot: A crime master unites 3 different mafia into an enterprise to buy an island, which will then serve as money laundering facility for organized crime. To stop this, the FBI tries one of the mafia gentlemen to breastfeed. The thing goes wrong, and with a few unlikely plot points and turns, we are presented with another "non-dislike cop buddies" movie ... one is a female FBI agent and the other a male ex-DEA agent. <br /> <br /> So far, so stupid. But the strength of this movie is not in his story - a poor joke, at best. It's funny. (At least the synchronized German version is). The action is also good, with an unforgettable scene that includes a gun and a rocket launcher. But the focus is on the humor. Not intelligent satire, not quite slapstick, but somewhere in between, you get very funny jokes. <br /> <br /> However, this film is the opposite of political correctness. Legal drug abuse is prominent, without criticism, and even appears as cool. It's the piece of the movie that made me seriously annoyed, and that makes it inappropriate for children, in my opinion. <br /> <br /> All in all, for a fun night look, acceptable action comes with some funny jokes, this movie is perfect. Just remember: In this genre it is common to leave your brain at the door when you enter the cinema / TV room. Then you have a good time. 8/10
