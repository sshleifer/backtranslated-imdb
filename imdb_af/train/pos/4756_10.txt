This is one of the more beautiful episodes of the Twilight Zone, with some fun dialogues and amusing characters breaking the tension of some flu moments. There is the usual blonde vamp dancer (who is there with Serling's love ability for that kind of character, as she appears in several episodes?) And other different characters, but it is Jack Elam's "old man" who steals the show completely . I consider this the funny, light version of "The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street" - or perhaps a 20-minute Twilight Zone parody of The Thing. On another note: I thought the young lover of the episode might be someone who eventually passed on to other things - he became known - but it turns out that Ron Kipling has disappeared to just two TV credits after his name.
