I read the comments on the message boards here. I expected this movie to be a complete deduction - but when I saw it, I couldn't stop laughing! It has officially become my new favorite movie. <br /> <br /> I don't know what all the hate is about here, maybe it's because a movie of this kind has never really been before. I have a loss to name another completely female-driven comedy. Many comedies will have one or two actresses in the lead, but there will be many supporting characters. This one was almost ALL women - with the exception of Seth Meyers, Justin Hartley and the short appearance of Will Arnett - and it worked. All the actresses have unleashed a lot of funny performances (especially Missi Pyle) of a strange and sweet writing. <br /> <br /> The charm of this movie seems to me to be in its subtle feminist message: to accept who you are, female success in the public sphere, the strength of female friendships and break gender roles. Although light-hearted, each of the main characters is a challenge as they attempt to be more 'fun' conflict with their feminist values ​​and who they knew themselves. <br /> <br /> Missi Pyle suggested that this movie missed a theater release due to his female cast and lack of a big-name actor to get the studios behind it, and I have to agree make. Everyone I recommended to recommend this movie loved it and I think it's a pity that a comedy that celebrates female drowsiness is not widely accepted and successful. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone with an open mind or a love for female-centered comedy.
