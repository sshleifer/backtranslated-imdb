The presentation of Lily Mars (MGM, 1943) is a cute movie, but in my opinion it could have been better. Judy Garland is fantastic as always, but some scenes in the movie seem out of place and the romance between her and Van Heflin develops too quickly. <br /> <br /> I mean, one minute he's ready to beat her butt, but the next moment he falls in love with her. I believe that this production, the movie editor and the script (although photography was great, the scenery was nice and the costumes were nice) could have been a little better. It feels like the production was too rushed. <br /> <br /> The supporting role was also good, especially little Janet Chapman as the second youngest girl Rosie. She is at age 11, looks really cute and it is a pity she did not develop into a teenage comic actress. She's much better in this movie than in her previous films as Warner Brothers in the late 1930s (except for Broadway Musketeers in 1938, it's really good at that) when they tried to make her in a Shirley Temple / Sybil Jason hybrid. Overall, this movie could be better, but eventually Judy gave it to her all.
