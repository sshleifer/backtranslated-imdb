Of course, I would have to give this movie 10 out of 10, as my uncle was the main screenwriter of Once upon a Crime. Rodolfo Sonego has been writing screens for over 50 years in Italy. He was a wonderful storyteller and someone suggested that he put his stories in writing. So did Rodolfo Sonego. Looking at his biography, you see the number of films made in Italy. Alberto Sordie was the lead actor in his stories. My uncle visited Australia and my town in 1968 to investigate places for a girl in Australia and created a wonderful film about a full-blown bride after the Second World War. You can see his humor in all his movies. I recently received a copy of this movie on DVD. GREAT
