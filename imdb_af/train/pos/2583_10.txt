The biggest games of Kasparov or Fischer can be a mess for a total newcomer. It's a good movie. There is no special agency involved in the plot. This is the clue! This is a PRIVATE plot built as a private enterprise. It is a self-destructive and self-organized plot. In conclusion, the scenario described the perfect professional plot: private, self? Organized, self-destructive, with no trace at the end. Anyone can be behind the plot: a smart "director" with a little money. All can only be done by delegation. The "director" should only be faster. If the normal viewer cannot see the essence of the plot in the explicit sequences of the movie, a real plot has less chance of being discovered. All the actors' performances are well done, with a particular mention for Gene Hackman and Mickey Rooney.
