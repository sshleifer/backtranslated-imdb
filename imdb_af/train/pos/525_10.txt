Just after the end of World War II, Powell & Pressburger was asked to do something to try to cure the gap between the United Kingdom and the US. By that time, there were many "overpaid, over sexual and above" types of comments. Somehow they came up with this masterpiece. <br /> <br /> My favorite movie of ALL time. It has everything. I can never explain exactly why, but it hits all the right buttons and although I've seen it hundreds of times (yes, really) I'm still guaranteed to be in many tears. <br /> <br /> Was it the wonderful acting, the wonderful sets, the inspired writing? Who knows. But * DO * Look and you will see what I mean.
