I was one of about 200 people who were happy to see an early sneak of this movie. <br /> <br /> Stardust follows Tristan a young man in search of a fallen star and brings it back to the woman he likes to prove his love for her. The only catch is that the star has fallen on the other side of the wall, a doorway between England and a magical kingdom known as Stormhold. <br /> <br /> This movie was just a joy to watch, it got something in. It's for everyone, all the action scenes are played beautifully and the comedy is spread by the movie that makes it funny without maize to be. If I compare the likes of another movie, it would probably be The Princess Bride, a classic. <br /> <br /> All the performances are excellent, the beautiful Claire Danes loves her in her portrayal of Yvaine's confidence naive star and under the judge Michelle Pfeiffer gives a star on the best performance as Larnia .. But the show to talk about is Robert De Niro. In every scene he's in, he steals the show ... <br /> <br /> If you're in the mood for a funny fantasy love story, it's the movie. Children are not disabled by the description. There is plenty of action comedy and not many eyebrows with Claire Danes and Michelle Pfeiffer to entertain you. The cinematography is dead and keeps up with the feeling of the movie ... nothing of the movie seems to be forced.
