I've been waiting for such an original picture for quite some time. Brokedown Palace has that "difficult to believe" aspect, but with the ingenious direction and script, ?? Palace is great. <br /> <br /> I never really enjoyed watching Claire Danes in any of her movies, but I'll tell you what she really did with this one. Kate Beckinsale joins Danes on a vacation to Thailand where they meet with a young man who convinces them to travel with him to Hong Kong. However, he neglected to inform them that he would carry an obscene amount of drugs. Well, eventually they are caught, and they end up in a Thailand prison. I know, I know, how can you not know that you have 18 pounds of drugs? Well, if you can get through that little one, you'll find a very well written and performed story. Lately I've found myself in the story lines of the movies I watch, and I develop a personal feel for the characters I watch. This movie is no different. By the end of the movie I looked after her more than any other characters in the movie. <br /> <br /> Bill Pullman plays Hank Green, a lawyer who lives in Thailand and specializes in international relations. As always, Pullman delivers a great performance and beautifully tie the film together. <br /> <br /> There are some twists and turns that will be in tears by the end of the movie. This is one of those movies that you probably passed when you searched the movie to look at home. It is my opinion that next time the video store should not pass this one again.
