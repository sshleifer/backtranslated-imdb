I initially bought this DVD because it had SRK and Aishwarya Rai on the cover and I thought, hey! Another movie with Aishu and Shah Rukh, I knew very little that Aishwarya only appeared in an item number in a song she shared with SRK in the last quarter of the movie and helped to represent his character just in the film is. minutes. Shakti is a film about a mother's love and endurance. It is a film about transformations, ignorance, the coming age, the input of the harsh realities of life. The item number in which SRK and Aishu appear, has nothing to do with the movie. It's actually a dream sequence that happens while SRK's drunk character is beaten unconsciously through drinks. He dreams that Aishwarya Rai barely dressed this sexy street girl who once appeared on his favorite hangout spot and began to seduce him. The title of the song is 'Ishq Kamina' (loosely translated as 'Love's a bitch!') And it's just clean smoking! Don't miss it.
