I didn't see this movie on Sky Cinema for too long. I must admit it was a very good Western that contained two of the big names. On the one hand is Charlton Heston, the notorious and retired lawyer Samuel Burgade. . On the other side. The late James Coburn plays the villainous Zach Provo. Looking for revenge on Burgade, no matter what the cost! <br /> <br /> The good thing about this movie was there were some very good characters. Most of the actors played it really well. Especially James Coburn, I think he really was in this movie. But that was how it was. <br /> <br /> Christopher Mitchum, who I "I saw everywhere in other movies. Hal Brickman plays. I felt his character was left out in the cold, but he could come back by working with Burgade to bring Provo's jobs! <br /> <br /> All in all, it was a good movie. Very good to look at. Great score from late Jerry Goldsmith. Wonderful piece of western persona ..! 8 out of 10.
