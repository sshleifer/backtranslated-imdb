Great acting, music. A simple and clear plot, but it caught up with me and caught up with me all the time. I don't know why it was so great, but it was simple. So many of the characters were so real. It moved me and made me think I'd like to see more about this. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​a school trip as a forum for such a wonderful plot was a brilliant idea and so many of the people were like people were like every day by teachers in the classroom. <br /> <br /> The film addresses issues of religion, prejudice, drug friendship, memories, difficult experiences, and simply the diversity of life itself.
