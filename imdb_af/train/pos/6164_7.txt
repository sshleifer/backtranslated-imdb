Make us 'video nasties' again? In the prospect of a large wide screen large budget remake of 8MM, this is quite a ride. Unfortunately, there is a little too much story and sometimes it becomes like a travel companion, as our heroine is looking for the sleazy spots of Paris, Hamburg and Amsterdam. However, I am quite churlish for the 'depraved' scenes, including everything from hot wax, hard coat and rough sex to drown, decapitated and some. These scenes are impeccable and it is a pity Bruno and his budget cannot stretch to ensure that all the very characterful creatures are introduced more than just caricatures.
