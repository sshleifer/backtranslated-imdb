An excellent movie makes this movie work; all the characters are extremely well developed and it is clear that the actors enjoyed this movie. <br /> <br /> It's not quite the comedy I expected, much more a light-hearted look at the attempt to regain youthful glory than the bawdy humor. For music fans, there are quite a few subtle references that are intelligent in themselves. <br /> <br /> I hate directing movies to other movies, but so much of this movie reminds me of Alan Parker movies I can't do. help it: imagine if the commitments really made it big - and try to repeat that glory 25 years later.
