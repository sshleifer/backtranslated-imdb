The power to dream is a wonderful thing. There is a saying, "Not all dreams come true, but all achievers dream." By exploring our imagination, we form our own future. Or build rich. Perhaps we overcome fears, limitations and barriers. Gain wisdom and benefit humanity. Or (simply) find our way to true love and happiness. Freud can express such things in symbols. The language of fantasy. <br /> <br /> Tristan ventures out of a rather two English village called Wall. He goes through a break in the wall. A portal. Looking for something to prove his love for Victoria (Sienna Miller). Victoria doesn't take him seriously. That's why he promises to bring a false star back. <br /> <br /> Stormhold is the world outside the wall. He discovered that the fallen star took the form of a beautiful girl, Yvaine (Claire Danes). To complicate matters, three evil witches want to get hold of Yvaine. If they can eat her heart, it will complement their youth. (One of the witches is played by Michelle Pfeiffer, who does fantastic old-fashioned transformations of appearance and way.) The "good guy" they meet is Captain Shakespeare (Robert de Niro). He has a fiery, swashbuckling pirate outside, but is a caste queen underneath. Stormhold's heirs are now struggling to inherit the Kingdom. Ricky Gervais is an extra extras. A flexible trader who throws standard Gervais type gags. Tristan's purity of spirit arouses Yvaine's love, so there's a nice little triangle. Until he reaches maturity to discern pedigree divas from real women. <br /> <br /> Stardust is a full-scale, large-scale fantasy that gives credit to its many stars. Completely positive, and written with clarity that makes it more worthy of the psychoanalysis that has a full Harry Potter torso. Production values ​​believe Hollywood, and the storyline is free from racial stereotyping, misogyny, religious or class agendas as form and distorting so many large-scale fantasies. <br /> <br /> It's not to say that Stardust is without his mistakes. . Plot and dialogue have many predictable elements, and the fairy tale quality can be saccharine for some audiences. But if you want an excuse to make your heart fly, this movie can provide it well. <br /> <br /> As a boy, I remember the album Moody Blues (who didn't practice in a home, from where I lived). They made records with names like "Looking for the lost accord" and writing lyrics like, "Think is the best way to travel." I'll fill my head with books about magic and mystery, from Timothy Leary to Aleister Crowley. Creating dreams. Learn to make them real. Today people can talk about NLP or positive thinking. Adults who remember how to dream with the power of youth, but with the vision and application of adulthood. Do you still enjoy that feeling? <br /> <br /> You are advised not to wait for Stardust on DVD. See it on the biggest movie screen you can find. And Dolby Digital Surround Sound if you can get it. The actors looked like they had a ball. Maybe you will too.
