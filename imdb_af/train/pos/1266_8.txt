I read some previous remarks that said this movie lost steam to the end of the movie and that it had a similar end to Cape Fear. I totally disagree. I'm going to give a simple overview for the normal movie goers out there. I thought the casting was perfect. I thought it was one of Ed Harris's best performances. What an evil psychopath !!! I have a lot of respect for his acting after watching his performance in this movie. I was consistently sounded in this movie. If you like mystery thrillers then it's definitely a movie you want to see. I also noticed a young Scarlett Johannson in this movie. This movie is filled with top stars and I highly recommend it!
