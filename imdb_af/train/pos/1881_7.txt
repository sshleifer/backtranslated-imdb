Dudley Moore is as drunk millionaire player, Arthur Bach, perfect as a grown man trapped in childhood. As it turns out, the role Moore fits so perfectly, it caught him as an actor. Many disappointments soon followed (including the film's pale sequel), but it didn't diminish the charm or appeal of this picture, which is cleverly written and directed. Some of Moore's drunk scenes are being forced, parts of the movie are shaky, but the role-play with so much pleasure is a tough movie to resist. It has a very big heart and gives Oscar winner John Gielgud a clever, dry amusing role as Arthur's valet, Hobson; his relationship with Arthur is nice and they have a wonderful report. Liza Minnelli (as a blue-collar love interest) is sick in a low key and Moore is brash, but sad and alive; He never shook off the shadow of Arthur, but at least we have this high career document to nurture. *** of ****
