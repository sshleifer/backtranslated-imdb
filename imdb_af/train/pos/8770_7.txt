I thought I should believe in a good way. True, it is not. The whole Oirish thing gets so thick, but you enjoy the role here - Flynn, Smith, Bond, Watson, Frawley, etc. All good. I also liked to see Mike Mazurki or Course, he played a boxer, what else? Plane is fine like Mr. Jim, you never get a one-dimensional look at him or the rest here, I suppose, but it's okay, it's a cartoon and meant to please, that's all. The boxing screens were pretty good, Ward Bond's vaudeville logging had a riot, and you thought all the rookie bobbies went into the scene a few times. <br /> <br /> Really wonderful, Flynn was in a role at that time and it is clear to see why audiences loved him. <br /> <br /> *** outta ****
