That's what I wrote to friends earlier: <br /> <br /> HOLY CRAP, The Grudge is honest with God, one of the terrifying movies I've ever seen! I also get very soft in my age, or Sam Raimi and Ghost Pictures did a KICK A ** job! (Can't wait for Boogeyman!) <br /> <br /> I was very scared to sit in the dark theater and wanted me to have someone, someone sitting next to me (except the protagonist in Grudge. Myself .) I swear, there were lots of jump scenes NOT expected! I felt foolish, but my nerves didn't care! I was on the verge of the whole movie, the opening credits, and the music was scary. But I think of the sound, and I don't like it. <br /> <br /> I ran and cried aloud a few times, "oh" in one scene !! Oh, yes, I even covered my eyes half way! Word to the Wise, though: I thought some of the scenes were a bit psychotic. My DH hated the Event Horizon and thought who wrote it was sick and psychic, but I don't remember the movie, so I can't compare. <br /> <br /> I can't say I got this movie b / c I was scared but it was very good and scary. The final scene, too ... who! For the 32-year-old mom, I think I can have nightmares from this movie, especially because of the sound. Please come out of my head;) <br /> <br /> In summary, it's not a shooter movie as I grew up (Jason, Freddy). It's a most haunting movie. Perfect for Halloween. <br /> <br /> Two big trailers for this movie were Boogeyman and The Ring 2 !!
