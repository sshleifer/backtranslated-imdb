The Intruder (L'Intrus), a film by French director Clair Denis, is the release of film. It follows its own spirit over time, space and character. There may be a plot, but what I understood I picked up from the description on the Netflix DVD sleeve. Honestly, it's probably better to know nothing about the movie before it is watched, because then the viewer can set aside any and all expectations. The film requires the viewer to think, but also the fact that he or she will not fully understand. <br /> <br /> The human heart is the movie's mystery. Each image questions its role, its nature and its form. The heart is the intruder, that of the viewer and that of Louis. Louis's character is played by Michel Subor with the peace and mystery required by such a character. First, someone could have played Louis's character if he or she had a wandering, willing and comfortable heart. Yet Subor is the one that appears here; he becomes the movie, his identity is inseparable from it. Many of the film's images hanging in my mind revolve around his expressions, but mostly physically. <br /> <br /> The intruder is poetic in his ability to capture the silence and fullness of movement, but more fluid than any literature in the form it refuses to take. "Surrealistic" is a term used to describe this movie, but perhaps "quasi-realistic" is a more appropriate term. Nothing in the film is beyond the realities of reality; the simple ubiquitous score confirms that you represent the connection between heartbeat and dull light in music. <br /> <br /> Watch the trailer a few times when you are attracted to visual images; See the movie to see the effects of the combination of verse and a hold on freedom.
