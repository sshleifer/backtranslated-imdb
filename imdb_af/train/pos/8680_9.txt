Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer is a very lost player in the short cartoon market. This market is predominantly dominated by the Looney Tunes and the Merry Melodies shorts, which come from Warner Bros. But MGM can also release hidden gems, such as "To Spring", an astonishing story about the most beautiful season of the year. /> <br /> In the environment shown here, spring is not caused by natural cycles, but is produced. And by whom? For small male elves living under the ground. Every spring, when the snow begins to melt, they start working. They begin with the rounding of rainbow rock columns, then reduce them to litter and use this litter to make it into color fluids, which are moved to the ground and grass, flowers ... In other words, spring! The first half of the cartoon shows the spring's production, but the second part is a little different. The Old Man Winter comes back and he tries to expand the winter by destroying the elves' work. So we help fight the elves and the Old Man Winter. <br /> <br /> The music heard here is wonderfully wonderful. The melodic parts hold in the head like an ink point on a paper sheet. The second part melodies are exciting and they fit perfectly with the action. This is just fantastico, Giorgio! The animation rows are also a delight. The colors are well mixed and every little detail is shown in a massive, epic environment. The concept itself is brilliant. The elves are characters, so Old Man Winter, depicting the cold and relentless feelings of the white season effectively. <br /> <br /> There's also a strong message included here. The battle ends at the end of the elves, until a single late eleven jumps into action and it leads to the eleven's win over the winter. So the point is: only one person can make the difference. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, "To Spring" is a remarkable, lost classic of a short cartoon era. What is even more remarkable is that the director of this cartoon made his debut here. And who is the "To Spring" director? This is a certain William Hanna ...
