I agree with the previous comment to mention the contents of the movie "Everyday Madness" but would like to specify that: "Dog Days" is about how women are treated in a male society. The episodes we see here show some variation in the everyday discrimination of women, mostly according to age group. There is a senior man who makes his new partner look and act like she had late wife, and treated her like a doll that would 'worthy' the former's dress. There is a middle-aged couple in whose relationship she is almost a slave and he is a (violent) master. Furthermore, we find a somewhat younger man who does not communicate with his friend / wife and, instead of being jealous of her business, even makes friendship with his rival (s). A young adult man makes his friend clear - a girl who is really worried about being nice enough to him - that she should be the jewelery of his side and follow her meticulous ethical rules. Finally, in his late fifties there is a man who calculates his own benefit, a simple woman who is an angry customer, who is guilty of scratching his car - of course, she knocks. To complete the examples, we find the mate of the man in the "master-slave" chill - after abusing her and murdering the former "for her" because she will get rid of her partner and himself as her new "master". During this all, the residents of the newly built environment in which the action takes place rest under the burning summer sun - absolutely motionless (sic!). Unfortunately, I have not seen the last few minutes of this shocking and authentic portrayal of the archaic structures still in the relationship between women and men, but I have convincingly analyzed the repertoire of discrimination. Probably a useful tool to even teach the less sensitive spectator what goes wrong - due to good visualization.
