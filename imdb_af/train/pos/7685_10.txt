Another Norman Lear solved the problems African Americans had to face in the turbulent 1960s and 1970s. <br /> <br /> With Ester Rolle and husband with 3 children in a Chicago high-rise project in a predominantly black neighborhood, the show depicted black people through a landlord (black agent Mr. Bookman ), as well as the pricing and daily problems of just existing ones. <br /> <br /> The 3 children portrayed how people look different from their problems, from the comic JJ to the militant Ralph Carter, to their daughter who also succeeded. This show was a perfect description of African American life.
