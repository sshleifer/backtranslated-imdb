I watched the opening of this film for a few months. As a great Jim Carrey fan, I easily saw him morph in Seuss' Grinch and make the character his own. I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> This movie was pure magic. Carrey is a master of his trade and no one could have played this role perfectly as he did. There was plenty to enjoy for both adults and children, and this movie is certainly a timeless classic for everyone to enjoy in the years to come. I already have visions of my young daughter who year after year to watch this remake on video, and I will undoubtedly watch and laugh with her as I did the first time. <br /> <br /> Obviously, this movie wrote Jim Carrey about it and I don't think it would have come together without him. The supporting role, however, was charming and entertaining, especially the lovely Taylor Momsen, who was the perfect foil for Carrey's antics. The set of designs, musical scores and costumes have all lent their hands to a magical, fantastic end product and I believe everyone involved can be proud. <br /> <br /> It's not an easy thing to make a 22 minute cartoon classic in a full-action live action movie, but Howard has succeeded in flying colors. For the critics who disagree, maybe it's your hearts that are 2 sizes too small.
