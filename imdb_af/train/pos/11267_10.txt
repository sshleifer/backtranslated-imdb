Robert Wuhl teaches a class of film students at New York University in Manhattan, New York. <br /> <br /> He covers history and truths that are no longer widely known. I'd like to see much more of this show. It's very entertaining. Mr. Wuhl uses examples and "shows and tells" to get his points. He explained that the person who actually drove Paul Revere's Midnight Ride was not Paul Revere! Henry Wadsworth Longfellow uses Revere's name because it sounded better. <br /> <br /> I've been looking at Robert Wuhl for many years, from the time he was uprising and all the way through "Arli $$" on HBO. He is a good actor and a good stand-up comedian, but he is an excellent teacher! I recommend viewing an episode of this show. It's worth your time to appreciate.
