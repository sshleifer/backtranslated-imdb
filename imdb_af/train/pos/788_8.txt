Ok - I admit. I think Kenny Doughty looks great in this movie, but beyond his appearance, the film was borne by a predictable but reasonable plot. <br /> <br /> Start launching the three main women of the movie. One is a chief - very concerned about her image and never married. A police officer - with child and a bad ex. The third - a power and status hungry doctor with a desire for recognition and three ex's. <br /> <br /> They are almost the "First Wives Club", and indeed there are many verbal bashing of ex's involved, as well as some He left the credit card's behavior. Characters set - the movie continues. <br /> <br /> McDowell's character, the chief, comes late at a funeral - where a young organ, who fills in the regular player (Doughty), catches her eye. What will her two friends say about the subsequent calamity? Will they ever be happy? <br /> <br /> A fabric or two is recommended if you are the teary type - elevating the end, but perhaps not what you would expect. All in all, a big movie that stands out among the current choices of action, special effects and shock shock.
