It's just in the same league as `The Black Cat ', although I will give it a 9 rather than a 9+. It is indeed praise for a movie that is so underestimated that it is wonderful! <br /> <br /> "The Invisible Ray" is part of horror, drama and certainly part of the sci-fi. For a movie made in 1936, the sci-fi elements were a good deal before their time. The mix of horror, drama and sci-fi is a perfect combination, while the acting of Lugosi and Karloff cannot be better. <br /> <br /> Director Lambert Hillyer captures many elements that James Whale has done so often. What I am saying is that this movie has been ominous and well shot. The scene with the gargoyles outside Lugosi's room is a perfect example of the mood. This is a striking moment in the film, which is unfortunately lacking in today's movies of the genre. <br /> <br /> Like "The Black Cat" and "Island of Lost Souls," I can't understand why this movie hasn't been released on DVD yet. If you think some of the junk that has already been transferred to DVD, it's so much mystery. <br /> <br /> Anyway, watch this movie if you get the chance. When released on DVD, grab it quickly and place it in a venerable place in your DVD library.
