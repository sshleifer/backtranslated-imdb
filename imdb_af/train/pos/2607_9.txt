The season final sent mixed messages, I felt feelings of joy, and also feelings of being lied to and deceived. Roseanne tells all her viewers that the whole season was nine a lie because her husband, Dan, died. She also admits that the family never won the lottery and which season 9 was a lie, just how she wanted or wanted. I'm still confused when she said Becky ended up with David, and Darlene with Mark because Becky and Mark admitted they were pregnant. So I believe it's just how she wanted it to be, but it wasn't. So the season finals were good but sent mixed feelings. I will always be a fan of the show. :)
