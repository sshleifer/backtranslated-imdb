Who doesn't have unresolved issues with parents? And what parents don't have unresolved issues with each other? <br /> <br /> I know it sounds heavy. But it is played for the laugh in the movie, which makes both the comedy better and the drama better. I have always liked Paul Reiser and Peter Falk, and although I was a little worried that their star qualities might be too big for a small movie, I was enchanted by the very first scene. <br /> <br /> Especially entertaining were the discoveries made by the boy about his father as a person. And Peter Falk's monologue to be a hardworking, sacrificial father and husband was the perfect point of balance. Without the scene acting so well, the film would have been much less nuanced, and the character much less interesting. <br /> <br /> Well done, Paul and Peter!
