The group of people travel to Belgrade in a terrible bus led by a drunk conductor and his stupid son (who wants to ride with his eyes). Their journey is often interrupted by many hilarious events describing the fall of the nation's spirit in 1941, and it is so funny that they are even used today as a common joke.

In the end, the movie takes a dramatic turn and the journey becomes nothing more than a swan's song of a dying country.
