Although I usually don't like remakes, I believe remakes are wasteful; this movie is an exception. I didn't know so far until I read the previous comment that it was a remake, so my opinion is just about the real movie and not a comparison. <br /> <br /> The story and the way it is written is no doubt: it is Capote. There is no need for more words. <br /> <br /> The play by Anthony Edwards and Eric Roberts is wonderful. I saw some movies with them, each in one or the other. I was sure they were good actors and in the case of Eric I always wondered why his sister was the number 1 famous star and not her brother. This time, this certainty is put to the test, no doubt. His play, as well as the play by Mr Edwards, is clearly the culmination of his career. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to be on your top 50 movies to watch and keep your DVD shelves.
