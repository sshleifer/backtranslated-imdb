This adaptation of MR James's short story 'A View From A Hill' was only shown on British television in 2005 on the BBC 4-watched digital channel. I saw it repeated on BBC 4 again and decided to go it, remember the BBC's successful 1970s adaptations of other MR James stories including "Flute And I Will Come To You My Lad" and "The Signalman." Although not in the same class as these masterpieces, a hill view is a pleasant and sometimes exciting drama. <br /> <br /> A historian arrives in a small rural village about the collection of a recent deceased collector of ancient artefacts. While in the countryside, he sees an abbey lying in ruins for hundreds of years. But what is it about an old binoculars and a gruesome legend about the ominous Gallows Hill? And what does the vibrant country and its servant know about the situation? While I was not scared in any way, I enjoyed this little production, and if the running time was longer than 40 minutes, it could have been a great fit. As it is, it feels a bit rushed and a little more detail to set the mood would be welcome. <br /> <br /> I give it 7 out of 10.
