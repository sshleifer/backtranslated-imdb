If a more masterful adaptation than this one even existed, you don't have to look for it; You'll find everything in this almost perfect representation of Charlotte Brontë's masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Rarely did I see a movie that would insist on reading the novel on which it was based, but I admit it here. Although I did not read Jane Eyre, I am convinced that I have missed very little in the way of dialogue and plot or intensity and emotion. I just want to explore the novel because of the enormous curiosity and emotion that this masterpiece has stirred in me. <br /> <br /> I don't have to tell anything about this. Let me just say: if you are not sure whether to look or read the beautiful story, Jane Eyre, I ask you not to doubt! Every atom of power and magic that Jane Eyre raised as a popular classic English literature has been successfully captured in this film. <br /> <br /> What Brontë didn't bring herself into, Clarke and Dalton managed to translate into the spotlight with great intensity. The film's success is undoubtedly due to their contemptuous actions. <br /> <br /> Love Jane Jane or hate her, but appreciate the wealth, vitality, truth of the story; love the characters; love the actors; everyone just wants to love what is good in the theater.
