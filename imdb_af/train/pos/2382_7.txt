For a long time, 'The Menagerie' was my favorite 'Star Trek' episode, but in recent years it has been obscured by 'City on the Edge of Forever'. What I chose to talk about "Menagerie" was that it was more hard-core Star Trek with this fascinating story of the then Trek story. I still think it's pretty skillful the way Gene Roddenberry recorded the original pilot in a two-part episode. Although the 'new' part of the story is largely an excuse for Kirk and a few others (and us) to watch the pilot, the idea that Spock is being courted is a smart one. If you want, you can put holes in the plot. For example, given the Talosians' mindset and Captain Pike's condition, why is it even necessary to bring Pike physically back to their planet? And there are other confusing questions about Pike and Commodore Mendez ... best not to think too hard about the details and just to enjoy ST's two parties.
