As an expert fan, I recommend this movie as true to the facts and well done. As an 11-year-old living in Istanbul, I heard a few friends talking about a new music sensation that shouted girls. I thought hmmmm, if girls are like them, they should be crazy. My only records so far were Haley Mills, The Everly Brothers & Ricky Nelson. Shortly afterwards, I heard a song (which I later learned 'Love Me Do') on the holiday with the family at a military cafeteria in Ismir and was cursed by the difference between it and every song I had heard. When I heard the 'Meet The Beatles' album of my older brother, I was addicted to life. After reading the definitive book of their inception (by Davis), I was surprised that this movie followed the facts very well, except that most of the sex and some of the drug use remained (it used of methadiene / dexadrine use). >
