I love this movie like no other. Once again I will try to explain his virtues to the uninitiated, but now let me quote a few pieces of the remarkable dialogue, remembering all the tongue in the cheek. Aussies and Poms will all understand, well? <br /> <br /> (title song lyrics) "He can sink a beer, he can choose a visit, in his latest Double-breasted Bondi gear." <Br /> <br /> (another song lyric) "All pommies are bastards, bastards or worse, and England is the e-hole of the universe." <br /> <br /> (during a television interview on an "arty program"): Mr. Mackenzie, which artists have impressed you most since you were in England? (Barry's reaction) Flamin bulls artists! <br /> <br /> (while talking to a naive young girl): Mackenzie, I suppose you have a hordes of Aboriginal servants back in Australia? (Barry's reaction) Abos? I have never seen an Abo in my life. Mom does most of the solid yacca (ie hard work) around our place. <br /> <br /> It's just a taste of the hilarious farce of this Bonser Aussie movie. If you can get a copy of it, look and enjoy.
