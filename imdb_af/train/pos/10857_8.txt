Johny makes one of his best piece exercises here, making a strong movie with a good Yakuza story. The election of the new Yakuza's boss is the start of a war within the organization. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, violence is being used wisely in the context, which makes a very strong gang movie. I especially love the way he tells history, to move all the roles in the Yakuza family and to see the violence, as the only way to solve their problems. <br /> <br /> Talking The technical aspects, the movie is a good example of a break, space and planned way to shoot a movie. One of the Hong Kong films of the year. Is like Infernal Affairs, but without the easy action violence scenes, and the confused story. Highly recommended to all Asian movie lovers. <br /> <br /> (sorry for my English, do better in Spanish lol)
