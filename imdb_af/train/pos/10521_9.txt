Well, I think I'm attached to this movie emotionally because it's the first one I've had in the theater more than 10 times ... help me through my master's thesis, or keep me working on it! <Br /> <br /> But to watch it again for a few more years (and lots of movies) - what a well-made jeweler is! I have never seen Gwyneth Paltrow in a more convincing performance, and Jeremy Northam is the perfect Mr. Knightley - where do you come from? <<< sigh >>> Sophie Thompson's turn as Ms Bates is virtuoso acting of the best (oh, napkins, sorry!) and the rest of the cast is not disappointing - Toni Colette brings much Muriel to her Harriet, and Ewan McGregor is convincing charm - Alan Cumming and Juliet Stevenson are the perfect "impossible" couple! <br /> <br /> Of course, the sets and costumes and the beautiful soundtrack add to the feeling, almost Hobbiton-like atmosphere of the movie - although it goes as far as cinematography and art decoration, it's almost a case of visual overload. Very pretty, but a little more austerity could have conveyed a better sense of time. But the good thing is, the movie doesn't get too serious, and there's lots of fun - and a little cool editing - like sinking in saccharine Merry Old England fashion. <br /> <br /> My special favorite is the ball scene - a beautiful acting and directing here, and the closing dance summarizes the relationship between Emma and Mr Knightley just gorgeous. Too bad the final proposal scene just goes a little too long - cut two shots (I can think exactly which one!) And that would be much more in line with the rest of the movie. <br /> <br I just realized (by reading the imdb lists) that I saw Jeremy Northam in at least three movies without being aware that it was him. He seems to be far more than an actor than just a delicious English beat. Hmm, I think I should visit my video store ... <br /> <br /> Lovely movie. My favorite Jane Austen adaptation so far - but perhaps Ang Lee's sense and sensitivity is strictly speaking the better movie, this one is closest to my heart - and I've seen it many more times! See it if you can - and don't be too hard on its little imperfection. <br /> <br />
