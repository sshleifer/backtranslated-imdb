From the first five episodes of Hammer's short-lived "Hammer House of Horror" series, this fifth episode with the wonderful title "The House That Bled to Death" is probably the creepiest one. As a huge fan of the Hammer Studios Gothic Horror movies for many years, I wonder what took me so long to finally watch the series recently. So far I've only seen the first five episodes, and I have a strong feeling that the best is yet to come, but even though the series is as entertaining as the first five episodes, I remain satisfied. While the second and third episodes were good to watch for their morbid and inventive dark sense of humor, this fifth entry is definitely one of the first five to deliver the most real Horror. The episode begins when an elderly man kills his wife from unknown motivations. Years later, William (Nicholas Ball) and Emma Peters (Rachel Davies) moved home with their little daughter Sophie (Emma Ridley). However, soon after they moved in, the family had to find out that there was something terribly wrong with the house, which was apparently being pursued. The second episode directed by Francis Megahy is much better than his mediocre previous entry, "Growing Pains" (Episode 4), and the fairly unknown actors perform well. The film is also well-made in terms of effects, filmography and score. "The house that brought to death" is a solid episode that delivers the elements my fellow Hammer fans would like to see in a Short Horror story. The film delivers a creepy atmosphere, true scare moments and intelligent twists, and is exciting and highly entertaining from the beginning to the end. Overall, it is highly recommended for Hammer fans.
