Maybe I identify with this movie because I live in NYC and suffer from bad insomnia, but whatever, I have to praise the filmmaker for a most wonderful job. to do what she did with no budget ... wow, that's all I can say. really good. Just as no money was spent on this movie, it still blew me away. I'm sure you look it up if you can. great direction, fantastic score and of course a script that will beat you on your ass. see it.
