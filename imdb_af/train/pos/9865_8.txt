I saw the movie with two grown children. Although not as smart as Shrek, I thought it was pretty good. In a kiosk surrounded by children who were on spring break, there was no sound, so I know the kids loved it all. There parents also got engaged. The death and apparent death of characters resulted in appropriate gasps and comments. Hopefully people realize that this movie is made for children. As such it was successful, although I liked it too. Personally, I like the Scrat !!
