Firstly, the only reason people like this movie is because they can't stand a few parts of the story being "changed". Well guess what? Peter Jackson's movie was not a perfect version either. Well enough ranting. It's a very beautiful movie. The backgrounds are beautiful and from well-known Tolkein artists. The film covers about half the trilogy (Fellowship of the Ring and up to the battle of Helms Deep in the Two Towers) and moves at a good pace. The voice throw is, and most of the characters seem like I thought they would. Samwise is a little too ugly for my taste, but Aragorn looks AWESOME. The movie has a good score that fully supports the movie. If you enjoy good fantasy stories, but hate reading (the books are even better), this movie gives an effort to keep in mind that it was made 20 strange years ago. <br /> <br /> Also of particular note: Peter Jackson's Fellowship adjustment follows almost exactly the same as Ralph Bakshi (Jackson often said how much he admired Bakshi's efforts).
