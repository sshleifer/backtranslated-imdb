One must see everyone - if you have to borrow your neighbors' child to see this one. Easily one of the best animation / cartoons released in a long time. It took the movies Antz to a whole new level. Don't make the two mistakes as if they were the same movie - although the movie plot is basically similar. Just enjoy it.
