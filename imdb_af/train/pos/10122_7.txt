I found it a little difficult to follow to the extent that it seemed to be in the middle while trying to make head or tail of who was fighting and why. One of the problems is the cultural / language one. Here we have a Chinese / Taiwanese / Japanese problem of which we know little and because we only read English subtitles, it inevitably loses some of the subtleties. Another problem is that there are just too many, just half, running out. Yet it seems unlikely that there is a completely bad Miiki movie and it certainly is not. Much of the attractive and bottling violence, a window on some less than orthodox sexual behavior, plus the family aspect. All in all, a decent ride, but perhaps the storyline, may actually be helpful before you look at this one.
