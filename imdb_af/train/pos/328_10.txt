Fascinating I have approached I am Curious (Yellow) and it is a great tension companion piece. I will read several articles about his widespread controversy and explicit sex. What I got was not, but a thorough and challenging theater experience unlike any other. I strongly believe that the majority of the commentator who felt the movie was "lame" or "boring," approaching the movie as if it were pornography. Perhaps it is pornography, as pornography is something that will stimulate the senses, but it is intentionally non-erotic. Lena, the protagonist, throws her all into her performance and gives it a realistic and humanity that is simply convincing and enduring. Her breasts can be soft, her nipples are extremely large, her thighs thick, and her face blunt. But by the end of the film, the audience came to identify her and accept her mistakes as a human. This touch gives her even more credibility from necessity. If the director had ejected a Briget Bardot bomber, the effect would have been destroyed. I cannot recommend this piece of thought anymore. Be prepared to invest a lot of thought into this deliberate film. The patient and modest viewer will be well rewarded for the way most other movies can dream.
