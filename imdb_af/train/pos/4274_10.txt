I love this movie a lot, but it's a fact that you can't understand it unless you come from the former Yugoslavia. Most of the actors are now dead and these were the best actors in ex-Yugoslavia. I appreciate that this movie is now on Divx and I can have it in my collection. Macedonia. Serbia. Montenegro. Bosnia and Herzegovina. Croatia. Slovenia. <br /> <br /> All these things were ex-Yugoslavia, a melting pot of the Balcan nations. It could be a dream land, if Slobodan Milosevic, Franjo Tudjman and other nationalists did not poison the nation's thoughts with their ill ideas.
