Henri Verneuil represents the commercial theater in France from 1960-1980. Always strong at the box office, usually telling dramatic and exciting stories of casino robberies, mafia score settlements and World War II. Verneuil can be considered to give us two solid hours of entertainment on Saturday night. He worked with the cream of the male actors of his day: Gabin, Belmondo, Fernandel, Delon, Sharif, Anthony Quinn. I ... comme Icare is the only time he directed Yves Montand. It is a peculiar static film that takes place mainly in offices and conference rooms. It does not contain one chase scene and hardly any violence. <br /> <br /> Montand gives a good performance, if somewhat dry, and well supported by other actors. I couldn't help wondering what Costa-Gavras could do with this story, based on Z (the Lambrakis murder) and L'aveu (the torture of Artur London in Czechoslovakia by Stalinists).
