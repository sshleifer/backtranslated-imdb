Just Cause takes some of the best parts of three films, Cape Fear, A Touch of Evil and Silence of the Lambs, and mixes it together to get a good movie from a movie. <br /> <br /> Sean Connery is a liberal law professor, married to a former Assistant District Attorney, Kate Capshaw and he is a crusader against the death penalty. Blair Underwood's grandmother Ruby Dee buttonholes Connery at a conference and persuades him to handle her grandson's appeal. He is in the death penalty for killing a young girl. <br /> <br /> When Connery arrives in this rural Florida country, he is against a tough sheriff played by Laurence Fishburne. He is so relentless in his crime solution if Orson Welles was on the side of evil. <br /> <br /> Later, after Connery set aside the verdict with evidence he has uncovered, he feels good about himself. At that stage, the film takes a definite turn from Touch of Evil to Cape Fear. <br /> <br /> Saying everything doesn't seem to be soft. The throws become uniform achievements. Special mention should be made of Ed Harris, who plays a Hannibal Lecter as a serial killer on Underwood's funeral school. He will crawl your skin and he begins to reconsider some of those comfortable liberal sites where he has based his beliefs. Many of my confirmed liberals came out, thought very differently if they became a crime victim. <br /> <br /> Of course, the reverse is equally true. A lot of conservative law and order if ever they are on the wrong side of the criminal justice system wants to ensure that all its rights are indeed guaranteed. <br /> <br /> Criminal justice is not an end, but a process and an end to it for the whole of society. I think if it's just a morale, it's likely to be.
