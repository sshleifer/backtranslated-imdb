It's very funny. It has a good role, each one giving good performances. Especially Sally Field and Kevin Kline. This is a well-written script by Andrew Bergman (Honeymoon In Vegas). I don't like soap operas, though I never see them. But I love this movie because it's so crazy and from the wall, it's the hell out of the blunt soap they have on television. According to me, this is the best movie of 1991.
