This story is a complex and wonderful story of the last Harem of the Ottoman Empire. We comforted it well and we saw the inner working of a world now over and learning about the people who lived there. <br /> <br /> I enjoy the story, characters, acting and scene. A few scenes suffered from rapid editing and the subtitles disappeared too quickly, otherwise a wonderful piece. <br /> <br /> The main character Safiya is played wonderfully by Marie Gillain, whom I am delighted to have done a fantastic job without doing it. The scenes with her and Alex Descas (Nadir) are beautiful and beautiful. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone who is watching Hollywood less and more authentic in the world they emulate.
