For me, movies and acting are about telling a story. The story of David and Bethsheba is a tragedy deep and can be felt by anyone who reads and understands the biblical account. In this movie I thought the storytelling by Gregory Peck and Susan Hayward was at their best. Understanding and understanding the story of David and his journey to become the King of Israel has made this story increasingly compelling. You can feel his desire for a beautiful woman, Gregory Peck showed the right human side of this man who was bigger than his life. Susan Hayward's fear, reluctance, but then obedience to his authority as her King beautifully portrayed by her. One can also feel David's anxiety that Uriah spent the night at the gate instead of at home. As well as the sadness when he was killed in battle. Raymond Massey's powerful and authoritative condemnation of the king made me feel. The sets were really enough and the atmosphere credible. All in all, I think it was one of the best movies of its kind. I gave it a score of ten.
