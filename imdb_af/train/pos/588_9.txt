I saw all of Robert Redford's films and appreciated his love for the American people and the country. In a river running through it, Redford shows the lyrical romance and visual splendor of the high Rocky Mountains of Montana as if it were a 19th-century landscape painter of Thomas Moran or Albert Bierstadt. This film loves the visual and the word with text by author Norman Maclean, and beautiful camera work by Phillippe Rousselot (Serpent's Kiss, Reigne Margot). <br /> <br /> Redford's role is perfect. Tom Skerritt is the Rev. MacLean, a man whose teaching methods fly-fishing as well as the Bible, Brenda Blythen, the mother, and his sons, Craig Schaffer and Brad Pitt, create a family whose interactions reflect the same issues that everyone with growing teenage boys, and later complex young men. Both Schaffer and Pitt are completely credible than the brothers whose love for fly fishing and each other will bind them forever. These are the relationships between men, father and boys, brothers and their wives to the outside world who are the grounds of a river through a river of narration that is lacking in so many Hollywood films produced over the past year. <br /> <br /> What makes these relationships special, however, is the attention Redford gives to the language spoken in conversation. This is a literate writing, beautiful to hear and unforgettable when paired with the beautiful Montana rivers and mountains. The words and setting are similar to performances by a role that increases on their material. While the idea of ​​fly fishing may seem like a strange device to establish a story, it is not so indescribable in Redford's case law. Given the material, Redford's ode to a simpler time and life is autumn over and over.
