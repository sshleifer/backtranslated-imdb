I watched all 6 episodes on DVD. The whole play is excellent - no doubt. There wasn't quite enough action for me, I have to say. No real tension as such, just enough first-hand character development. Nothing like Tinker Tailor in terms of "whodunnit". If you like to tell a good story slowly and carefully, then that's for you. Peter Egan as principal Magnus Pym is excellent. <br /> <br /> The film portrayed the life of a traitor. A man who should have been a loyal member of the British Intelligence Service, but who was psychologically damaged by his unhappy childhood, became deception in all respects. As a child he worshiped his father, but his father was time and time again as a crook and a man. Pym did not betray ideology or money, but because he had to deceive closest to him (wife, son, mentor). Pym is severely damaged by the influence of his father - it has consumed his moral fiber. He has no true love or loyalty in him. <br /> <br /> Heavy psychological things and not very light moments in the 6-hour range. Very well done though.
