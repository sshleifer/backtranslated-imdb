First, it is an overview of the two slides that came at the "Wonderland" DVD rental. <br /> <br /> The two movies included in the rental, "Wonderland" and the Johnny Wadd documentary, destroy the myth created by "Boogie Nights". That myth was that the characters involved in the adult film trade were far more than slimy lowlifes who would do something for money, and denied that they were nothing but horrific self-centered whores. It is incredibly similar to what the book "Wiseguy" and the movie "Goodfellas" did at The Godfather Fable and most of the rest of the gangster romance. Now, what made me look most annoyed at these movies, and will probably annoy someone who has seen and kept Boogie Nights, how foolish and believing is supposed to be educated and sophisticated. "Dirk Diggler" in "Boogie Nights" is undoubtedly John Holmes, who did not have a redeeming quality other than "Dirk Diggler". Holmes was a criminal sociopath who abused anyone close to him, was completely consumed by his quest for self-satisfaction. He was undoubtedly an important participant in the brutal murders at Wonderland Avenue in Los Angeles in 1981. The film lies the great lie that "Boogie Nights" was and strengthens Linda Lovelace's description of the cruel and pathetic business known as the adult movie entertainment industry. It has to be required, both features on the Wonderland DVD, for anyone who had positive opinions about the story in the movie "Boogie Nights".
