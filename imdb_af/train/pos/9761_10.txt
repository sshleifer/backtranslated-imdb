Now there's a movie straight out of my childhood, my family used tape; but it has completely overpacked and disappeared over the years. Now I was happy to watch the whole movie on youtube.com; I loved this wonderful movie when I saw it as a child, and after watching (online) again, I still do today. My favorite song from the movie is "Candy Hearts and Paper Flowers" (I will always remember that lovely song forever). <br /> <br /> I was amazed at the opening credits (who's animated), that some of the animators are dating to 1930's (WOW! It's like 47 years).
