As the first feature film with Robert De Niro (although not released years later), it is worth the watch. De Niro's role is not big, but amusing as one of the two friends who are first trying to prevent other friends' marriage, later pursues him to force him into it. Anyone dying De Niro fan will get a kick from an early show by probably the best actor today.
