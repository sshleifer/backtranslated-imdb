Robert Urich was a good actor, and he made this TV movie credible. I remember remembering how I was this movie when I was 15, and when I saw it a second time, my opinion remained the same. People lost who they were when entering this exclusive club in a computer-rich California town. Urich is trying to figure out what's wrong with his family, and I like the Halloween space suit idea, brilliant. This film is about the battle of man's booze. TV quality, which is bigger than the big budget, gangs of New York. I wonder if Robert Urich was the compassionate man he portrayed in many of his movie? I hope so! 6 or 7 out of 10.
