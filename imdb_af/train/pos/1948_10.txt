This is a good end to the show. The fact that Adm. Janeway could do a double switch on the Borg, was wonderful. The fact that she had allowed her to be infected infected the queen with a "poison" that ended up in the core of the Borg. The way they ended it also left a few, not much, for a reunion movie. However, they brought them "home" and the way they did it was fantastic! It was sad to say goodbye to part of my family. End it with Tom and B'Lanna with their baby just as they enter the Alpha quad. was a great way to start a new start. It would be nice to have a reunion movie of some sort - just to see where their characters will be today.
