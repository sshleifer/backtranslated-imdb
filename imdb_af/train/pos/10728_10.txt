The perfect space fantasy movie. A group of children accidentally get into space and have to come back, but do them, sure they do. It wouldn't be a family movie if they were all dead. Then it'll all be sad. You don't want Kate Capsaw, the leading lady to give a Golden Globe show, but unfortunately she or Lea Thompson also won one. It sucks so badly. I can't say enough, this movie is so nice, Lea Thompson-oord, a perfect girl for this movie. This movie is probably the best. <br /> <br /> Sorry, but better than Star Wars. Star Wars is so overstated and space camp is underestimated. It had to be the other way round. <br /> <br /> Excellent 10/10/10, maybe 11/10. I'm not good at math
