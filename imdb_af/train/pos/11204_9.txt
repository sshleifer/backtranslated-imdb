The symbolic use of objects, form editing, the position of characters in the scene ... it's all used with such a joyful surrender by Hitchcock that you can really see how a fertile genius he had. The way the woman moves from one corner of the ring to the other as the battle progresses, the editing when the wedding ring is placed on her finger ... while it may seem a little obvious to today's standards, in the silent era in which they spoke volumes about the story without a word being spoken. Even the title has at least four meanings I can see; the boxing ring, the wedding ring, the bracelet that the lover buys and the love triangle in the heart of the story.
