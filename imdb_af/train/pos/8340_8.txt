It's a very funny, lazy, light romantic comedy. You can't go wrong with Meg Ryan's cute in love with Albert Einstein's genius. Usually I am not a fan of completely fabricated fictional stories about real people, now dead and unable to defend themselves, but I think the late Einstein would have gotten himself from this one. <br /> <br /> It's the 1950s ... Princeton, New Jersey in the spring. The story revolves around a beautiful, young, savage mathematician, Catherine (Meg Ryan), who is all ready to marry, a behavioral researcher named James, simply because he has the brain she is looking for in the father of her future. children. However, it is love at first sight when her car breaks down and she meets a car mechanic named Ed (Tim Robbins). Because she doesn't think Ed is intelligent enough, her uncle, none other than a matchmaker Albert Einstein, plays in his efforts by three ominous, all theoretical physicists. Uncle Albert must make Ed look well-suited, such a charade that portrays him as a physicist ... of course with amusing results. Walter Matthau is his usual hilarious self and completely removes the character of Einstein. effectively. With his three professorial friends, Kurt, Nathan and Boris, there are many believers. The true Einstein had a real human side and this film takes it just one (scandalous) step further. If you suspend all the logic, you can almost imagine this foolish story happening! <br /> <br /> It may not be rocket science (despite its main character), but it's a wonderfully sweet, refreshing movie. One of the best of the comedy romance genre.
