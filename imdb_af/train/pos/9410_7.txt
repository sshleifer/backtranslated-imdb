I enjoyed this movie. But I was surprised to see people call it a comedy. It was almost amusing, but really, it wasn't very funny at all. If I expected it to be a comedy, I could have been disappointed with the movie, but I found it not pleasant and pleasant. Perhaps this was because I identified the protagonist as an engineer. I was less worried about satire of capital or labor, and more in the basic story of a man fighting for his invention. A man who is less interested in monetary gain because of his invention than he is seeing it comes into being and is being put into production. He is completely heroic when he refuses to take the big money and the hot woman in exchange for the suppression of his invention. So I find it interesting that people here compared to Jurassic Park; I compare it to The Fountainhead.
