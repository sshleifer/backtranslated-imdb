If you like animal movies, this movie will please. My wife loves animals and animal movies, she especially likes the parrot in this movie. It is aimed at children, but I laughed most of the humor. The French fashion character made me laugh, adding balance to the writing. It's a Disney movie, with its juicy, happy, family monkey, but I like to leave the theater with a positive impact.
