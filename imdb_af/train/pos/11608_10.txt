It's a good movie. From reading other reviews, I can see that I am not the only one who shed a tear. Tamilyn Tomita acted with such skill and belief, she made the end sincere and unforgettable. In the hands of a lesser actress, her last scene would have been tiring and stubborn. One would never guess that this movie was done on a strict, limited budget. The cinematography is beautiful and there are a number of major names actors. The writing is so wonderful, I can see why they all wanted to be in it. If you see the long, long list of credits at the end, you'll see that half of Hawaii is filled to make this movie happen and for good reason. The soundtrack (available on CD) is absolutely beautiful and sets the mood throughout the film. My only "complaint" is that I almost don't want the movie to end.
