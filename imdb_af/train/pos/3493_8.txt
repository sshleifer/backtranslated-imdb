This movie is underestimated. I loved it. It was really sweet and hearty. A struggling family is not made in a dysfunctional family that is so typical of movies. The movie did not make it a problem that they have little money, or the Dominican Republicans are like Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Instead, Victor is immature and needs to grow up. He did slowly, along the end of the film. He had a way to go, but it was a genuine effort to move forward. His grandmother is very cute and the scene where the little boy throws away laughed me for the longest time. A true cordial indie
