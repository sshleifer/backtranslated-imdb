This warm comedy confronts some bizarre characters. Especially the two leading characters. Jack Lemmon plays Felix, a hypochondriac whose wife has lost him because she could no longer stop his cleaning and cooking attacks. So he tries to kill himself, but every attempt fails. Walter Matthau plays Oscar, his friend, a messy, unreliable sports reporter who divorces in a baby apartment in divorce. He offers his angry friend Felix a new home in his apartment. And soon the trouble starts, because two such opposing characters can't live together for a long time. Felix turns Oscar's disorderly flat into a clean exhibition platform. He cleans and cooks all the time. After a short while, Oscar felt persecution mania ... Movies at a theater level and performed excellently. Above all, Jack Lemmon's game is wonderful. He's the perfect clown. He makes us laugh, but in a tragi-comical way. Look for the wonderful scene when both men invite their two female neighbors for dinner, because Oscar must touch something softer than a bowling. While preparing the liquor, Felix sat with the two young ladies in the lounge. To get out of this embarrassment, he starts talking about the weather. A moment later he changed the subject and talked about his ex-wife and children. Suddenly he started crying and as Oscar returned with the drinks, there were three crying people in the lounge. The film is full of such amusing and at the same time screens. An intelligent, entertaining comedy with lots of heart. 10 out of 10!
