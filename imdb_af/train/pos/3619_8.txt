Despite Disney's best efforts, it's a nice movie about following your dreams. I was surprised that it did not hit me as exaggerated sentimental; This movie was playing right. Dennis Quaid was very, very good at the role, saying something for a sports movie. I can't remember how much sports movies have little things that bother me; here everyone looks the part. This movie is surprisingly good and I predict it will be surprising as it is a G-rated movie that does not require the viewer to stop thinking. Ebert the contrary, this movie is a success.
