One day I heard a few friends saying that "Scarface sucks ... tried an idiot to make another godfather in the early 80's." Now, I usually listen to idiots / watch CNN so I decided to stay away. Then my friend handed me the DVD and said, "This is # 1 with the pelicans," confused, I tried it. This is the best movie ever made. It's more realistic than all this crap about racing stolen cars that are too expensive for someone who can afford that area (* cough2Fast2Furiouscough *) There are some humor though ... these are the Pelicangs and the 80's music. Still, what's better than Al Pacino wearing a m203? I give it a ***** ****, ideal for fans of Al or GTA: Vice City.
