If you like cars, you'll love this movie! <br /> <br /> There are some fantastic actors in the movie, especially Vinnie Jones, with his typical no-nonsense attitude and hardcase look. The others are also not bad. <br /> <br /> There are only two minor mistakes to this movie. First, the poor plot, but people do not look at this movie for the plot. Secondly, the glorification of the great theft car (car crime). But if people really believe they can steal a Ferrari and get away with it, they look good and hope you have a good time in jail! <br /> <br /> When I first read that Nicolas Cage had to act, I thought, "... sweet." But then I thought "... you suck!" but when I finally watched the movie, I realized "... he sucks!" Just joking he plays the role very well. <br /> <br /> I will end this unusual review by saying: "If the premature demise of a criminal has somehow the general film that looked like the audience under the glossy veneer of criminal life relieved and inspired to change their ways, then this death brings an inherent nobility, everyone must be so happy You can say, "Poor Criminal." I say, "Poor us." <br /> <br /> ps - Angelina Jolie Voight looks pretty nice!
