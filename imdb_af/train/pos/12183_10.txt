One reviewer points out that it doesn't matter what Welles actually says or does, he moves you. I agree. He was and remains a unique force in film. More than a threefold threat that can act, write and direct, he has a genius that is uniquely suited to film. One might consider whether he would have been a painter earlier. This film certainly strengthens that impression. A musician, a theater actor, an heir of Shakespeare? hard to tell, but I'm very grateful to his movie camera and he captured him on film. I like the accent. I like the face, the size, the style, the mind and the games. I love all his movies and wish there was more. I especially love how other actors reacted to him on film. Many were never better or at least somehow different, because he was o there solid. Even at the end when his beauty was ruined, it was perhaps his own intention that he was impossible to ignore and he had every scene in which he was. Rita was a beautiful blonde - a Lana Turner looks alike, but perhaps even more beautiful and even the eye goes to Welles and one more wish a minute, another movie, another hour in his company. Therefore, we all wish that we could cut the lost bits of his films, because we know, we all know that there is no part of him that is not worth our time. Watch it and be thankful for the opportunity.
