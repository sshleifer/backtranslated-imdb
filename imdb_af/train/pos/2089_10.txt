"The Good Earth" is a good movie you no longer hear. There are many major disasters and events, but it is also a non-passionate love story. All these things happen over a little over two hours, which is short according to today's standards. The special effects and costumes are great for the period. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised that Luise Rainer received an Oscar for such a restrictive role. She basically has only three emotions: submissive, hungry and heartbroken. <br /> <br /> The performances by Asian and Asian American actors are great. <br /> <br />
