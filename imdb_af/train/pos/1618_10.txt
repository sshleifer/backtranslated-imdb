This movie is brilliant in every way. It makes sense to the complexity of loving relationships, but never to readings. The writing never condemns any character, not even the fearless Johnny. It also benefits from spot-on, production design, casting and performances. The fact that Cher is so perfect in the movie and is more like Cher than she ever was, is a miracle to me. I look at Moonstruck at least once a year and I saw it again on Christmas evening with my 16-year-old twin daughters and they also love it. It has something for everyone with a heart and finally makes you filled with joy.
