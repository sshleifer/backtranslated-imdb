I recently got the chance to see "The Waterdance" and loved it very much. I don't really understand why it mentioned it, because there's not really a dance going on, except perhaps for the dance at the comic strip near the end. We are introduced to the main characters by the film, casualties in a hospital. The story shows a love affair between a physical sisabled man and a healthy woman, a very sweet story. Unfortunately, you don't get movies today. I'm not caught up in a timing. I'm not saying that everything in the 80s and early 90s was better than today, but I really think the movie industry is getting worse and there are many things we can learn from old movies. anything from 1920-1998.
