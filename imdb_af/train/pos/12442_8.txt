On an impossible schedule and no budget to talk about, the movie was much better than you'd expect, certainly much more true of the books and comic book of Peter O'Donnell than the previous two films. You can read the strip that is currently being read in the reprints of Titan Books or in Comics Revue every month. It is one of the greatest adventure comics of all time. The movie is not nice, but unlike most low budget movies, it makes the most of what it has, and it keeps you interested. On the DVD extras, the interview with Quentin Tarentino, which is naturally stoned, is a gas. Some people have been guilty of Tarentino for linking his name to the film, but without him it would never be made. He is a Modesty Blaise fan, and has chosen a good writer and director. All things considered are worth 8 stars.
