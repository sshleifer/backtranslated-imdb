Distortion is a movie that surprised me so much. A kind of multi-layered drama that focuses on a man who writes a play about his life experiences that is happening to him right now. To be more consistent, he feels his wife is cheating on him, and he hires a private eye to snoop at him. His wife has no idea that this is happening. Meanwhile, the actors in this play have also misled some whoopdedoodles on their sleeves and with, we will tell unscrupulous people in the world of Israel. The whole thing culminates in a theater with all the actors present and the predictable (but not really) happening. <br /> <br /> The director of the piece really likes things with the ensemble cast of characters, and changes in a way that makes you pay attention, it's a fun movie, actually, I don't don't mind and I would recommend people to check.
