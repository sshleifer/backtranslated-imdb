It's a little disturbing to have a character named Gig Young in a movie ... played by Gig Young. But this film is where Gig got his name and also a good career boost after playing small parts under a different name. <br /> <br /> I'm going to go against the majority of other comments and say I really enjoyed this movie, mainly due to the lively performance of Barbara Stanwyck and Fiona. She was funny, angry, vulnerable, caring and well-versed as the eldest of three daughters whose mother died on Lusitania, and whose father was killed during WWII. <br /> <br /> As the "man" of The House, Fiona has been steadfast for years to establish her father's will. It would allow a Donald Trump type named Charles Barclay to get home. But Fiona has a secret about why she hates Barclay so much. Geraldine Fitzgerald is the middle-aged sister, married to an Englishman, but longing for her youngest sister's boyfriend (Gig Young). <br /> <br /> If you're a Stanwyck fan, it's a no-fuss.
