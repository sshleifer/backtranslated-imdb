This one has a lot for it - Sinatra, Styne, Cahn, Pamela Britten - and a lesser amount of foam - Iturbi, Grayson - plus a little ho hum - Kelly. It was Sinatra's first real film where the producer published a goat and you could see it on the screen (previously he was in two low-budget, Higher and Higher and Step Life), but if only on the Sinatra pipes went deep and six Grayson's plus Iturbi's ego-tripping piano balls, we would be left with a much tighter film and a better showcase for Sinatra. As it is, he is counting a lot in all his songs from the two duets with Kelly. We hate to leave, I thanked her - for his own solos, What makes the sun, the charm of you and I fall in love too easily. Despite this, life remains the best Sinatra musical of the forties on one tenth of the budget.
