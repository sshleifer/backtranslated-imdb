Of course, the average "Sci-Fi" Battle Star Gallactica will hate this. It makes me happy. I don't like those cute sci-fi shows, especially Battle-Star Gallactica, and so I like this show. <br /> <br /> The creators of the show had a lot of heat to make it (the unconventional science -fi way) and it was worth it. I read on Wiki that they wanted everyone, including women and not just sci-fi. <br /> <br /> It's probably the most promising show since Lost. It has the most interesting, smartest and deepest screenplay of any show in some time and it is truly unique. <br /> <br /> What I like most about the show is that it's kind of like a great Anime game! From young teens who shoot guns, to and very well balanced and complex writing, to robots, remind me of something that came from Japan, except a little better (most Anime is too confusing).
