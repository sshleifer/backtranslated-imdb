I just saw the World Preem of Fido at the Toronto International Film Festival and thoroughly enjoyed it. Here we have a welcome reworking of a genre commonly regarded as a pioneer (surely 'extensive and successful') by George Romero. But it's a Canadian movie by a Canadian director and it's a comedy! And, YES, I actually think it's better than 'Shawn of the Dead'. Possibly credible and perhaps more important, enjoyable performances by Dylan Baker, Carrie-Anne Moss and young actor K'Sun Ray, which I suspect we will see much more in future features. However, I have to admit that I enjoyed the best turn by Tim Blake Nelson as neighbor Theopolis, and basically playing a willing animated version of Victor Van Dort from the Corpse Bride (or for those who have watched the movie, T even better read here as the Corps Pride?) And of course, Scottish actor Billy Connolly in his least animated but somehow deeply moving role than the titular character. Just think he would not have got this role if it wasn't for Peter Stormare's prison break obligations (as revealed in Q&A next Thursday night's performance). I can't help but speculate that the writers have drawn much inspiration from Day Of The Dead's Zombie Bub. I'm not eager to ever disclose any plot details during a comment and I won't start now. It's enough to say that Fido is NOT one of the most expensive, graphically avid Zombie movies you can trust on Romero. On the contrary, it is a film that will constantly elicit you and although (and I had to think carefully), there is a fair dose of blood raising and violence, the delightful humor, so well enhanced by the surrealistic environment created by director Currie and his fellow writers , go a long way to making it look like it's a feature that PG-13 needs to be judged. I encourage you to see this little Canuck jewel. I will definitely buy the DVD if it hopes to come by next summer.
