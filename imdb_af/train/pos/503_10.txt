After 7 years of looking at those awful nonsense, called Star Trek Voyager, I had a nice feeling. Next Gen and DS9 were bloody good stuff and Voyager ruined TV Trek. It probably opened the best pilot for a Trek show. The crew was really good as the choice of actors for the parts. Scott Bakula played a typical first time captain in deep space and his unbeaten way of doing things was a refreshing change to the well-known captains of the past. The rest of the crew was really nice in their roles and I think they came after a good first season. When the show was canceled early, I was very disappointed. In a mirror we immediately showed what the throw was capable of. Sorry a movie or television movie was never considered. So much storytelling and establishment of the federation left to tell, including the onset of hostilities with the Klingons ..........
