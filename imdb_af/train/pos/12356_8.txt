Contrary to some people's summaries, the women portrayed in the film are not geisha. They are (prostitutes) living outside the best-known pleasure districts, and their lives and experiences represent the lives of a large number of Tokugawa era women. I can't say the stories were very enlightening, but their charm lies in just how typical they are. The themes are universal and everyday: love, friendship and sacrifice. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed a lot of art and acting. I felt like I had a look at a time and place that I could never see otherwise. The actors, especially the 4 women who played the lead, were a thrill to watch. I would only recommend this movie to people who want a taste of Japanese culture, or for those who enjoy quiet and emotional stories. This is a good example of both.
