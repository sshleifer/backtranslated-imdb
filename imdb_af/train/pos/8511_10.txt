This movie recovers the term "Spring Breakumentary." Hans, the fat one of the group, shows his talents like these generations Chris Farley. Johnny Kansas, "the king of the $ 1 bet," shows he is no longer in Kansas by stopping the game consistently. Kyle's laughter is contaminated, and also offers a little eye-candy for the ladies (like Matt). The dwarves, while having their moments, did not dance to the Mexican hat as it deserves. And last, we got our protagonist, Ed. He gives hope to all of us who stumble, stumble, gang, pale people who are still looking for that special someone. And that hope is a small place called Cabo San Lucas. While these crushers just missed out on the theaters, it's a must hire, since we're all associated with one of these Spring Breakumentaries.
