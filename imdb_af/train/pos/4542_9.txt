Centered in the center and from the skirts of Detroit, this comedy was a terrific new comic duo. "Noriyuki Pat Morita" is a very funny man, a police spokesman for Japan tracking down an industrial secret thief, who stole a 'proto-type' turbo supercharger, reluctantly goes to the United States around the thief after being ordered by his commander. Pat's character clashes with 'Jay Leno's' character, a quick talk' but to the businessman-player Detroit cop. However, as they cross paths, the honorable 'Ways' of Japan meet the all-out-old police-investigating 'Ways' of the old Detroit police. The two stumble and start over, but then develop a "rythym" that originates in an explosive two-layer power station, which resolves the matter cold. After battling a city crime boss for the stolen 'equiptment' and closing the case, these two go together to despise each other to be friends and work well together. A bit worse for wearing and in need of an extended vacation at the top of it all, they manage to come to a winning conclusion. I gave it a 9-estimate. Lewis's direction makes it an almost perfect comedy. Fun for all ages. I highly recommend it. (***)
