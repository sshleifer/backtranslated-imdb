This movie is a riot. I can't remember the last time I had such a good time at the movies. I saw some good comedies in my time and usually they are pretty funny. But this one is wall to wall, good lines. I think Best in Show is the last movie that I laughed so hard and so. The movie was not stopped when they cleared the 5 minute sentimental plot. Other than that, it's a constant barrier to one liners and goofy situations. I want to see it again before it leaves the theater because it's like the Zucker movies where you don't get all the jokes for the first time. You should see it two or three times to get it all in. <br /> <br /> As far as the real movie goes, it could have used better editing, it's sometimes slick, but we have to be forgiven for that. All the characters are good. It's not like an Adam Sandler movie where he's trying to be funny and everyone else is suffering from him and kicking the joke. I think I will remember all the main characters for years because they are all so nice. No victims in this movie. Also, thank you, they had a 45-year-old actress playing his girlfriend. Catherine Keener plays her and she is a sweetie in this movie. You just wish that women like her really existed. She is not a "10" like the other top ladies, but her smile is hotter than Julia Roberts overblown. <br /> <br /> If you see the trailer for this movie, you may not think too much about it. I assure you, the trailer is not doing it right. They do not give away all the good jokes. Just a few of the mediocre people. <br /> <br /> One more thing. I hope critics put it on their top ten list. Many of them complain that comedies do not get the recognition they deserve and then at the end of the year they do not put it on their list. That means you're Ebert !!!
