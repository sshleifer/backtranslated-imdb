I watched the movie with a homophobic friend, my wife and her female friend. So I had views of all kinds of directions. Mostly, the film made me laugh, the sexual tension wasn't really there and the only noticeable actors were Tudor Chirila and Maria Popistasu. Yes, I think she played her role well, even if the writing wasn't appropriate. There were good Romanian actors, they didn't have complex roles. I welcome Puya's entry into the movie business. I don't know why, but I think he's a good guy, I just hope he'll be a good actor. <br /> <br /> The woman loved the movie, and I think chords could have been. played and about which I had no ear. If the film tried unusual sexual behavior and their consequences in today's Romania, it failed. There were no consequences. Just imagine that the girls are actually a boy and a girl, and the same story just becomes a boring, uninteresting plot. <br /> <br /> I have no idea why it has received all the BAFTA awards. In my book it had received the "Better luck next time" award. (bafta = good luck in Romanian).
