SPOILERS <br /> <br /> In the words of Jean-Paul Sartre, "Hell is other people". In "The Odd Couple" Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau show just how accurate it can be. Like Felix Ungar and Oscar Madison, Lemmon and Matthau create two good friends respectively who decide to live together. As the two begin to get slower and more frustrated, the laugh comes thick and fast ahead of Felix, leaving Oscar a changed and more clean person. <br /> <br /> Jack Lemmon as Ungar is absolutely fantastic as the neurotic, cleaning-obsession divorce dealing with life as a single man. Walter Matthau, unlike Lemmon's character, is as good as the sloppy sports writer who just wants to play poker to earn money for his child benefits. <br /> <br /> Lemmon and Matthau are great in their selected parts, for some grade depending on the beautiful writing by Neil Simon, and at the same time because they work well as a team. If two friends who are inherently different in lifestyle, although similar in relationships with former women and children, these two, late, great actors create a partnership that is virtually impossible to be recreated. So great, that the world shouted so much for something similar, those two years before Matthau's death and three before Lemmon's, the characters are reunited in an inferior successor. This idea, while following Hollywood's annoying obsession with successors, may have worked to some extent, but at the same time it can never get close to replicating the genius of this original movie. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, it's not really possible to say anything else. With Simon's incredible writing, full of humor and laughter, the creators of this movie were already hit. However, the decisive role of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau as Felix Ungar and Oscar Madison is the most important part of this film. "The Odd Couple", with its traditional soundtrack (which even earned a tribute in "The Simpsons"), is an excellent script and it is brilliant leaders, a tribute to cinema and a feature of history to remember.
