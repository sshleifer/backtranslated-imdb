I think that's what this movie wants us to say at the end of the movie! of Damn Australian? I still don't know, but what I know is that I really liked this movie, but it can't be my favorite movie! <br /> <br /> Big story with big actors but with a terrible end ... To make you cry and say 'Oh, she's so good'. Still, who made it? What really happened? Who is that man? No answer to these questions ... <br /> <br /> Mysterious movie with a good point overall ... I give it an 8/10, go on the 8.5!
