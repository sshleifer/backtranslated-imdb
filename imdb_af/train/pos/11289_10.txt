There is something wonderful about the fact that a film made in 1934 can be head and shoulders above any Tarzan movie that followed, including the inflated and boring 1980's Greystoke. As soon as the viewer passes the first three scenes, which is boring, Tarzan and his Mate take off like a shot, offering non-stop action, humor and romance. Maureen O'Sullivan is beautiful and beautiful as Jane and runs off with the movie. Wheeler is also solid. Highly recommended.
