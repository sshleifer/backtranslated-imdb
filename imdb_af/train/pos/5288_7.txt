This amusing Bugs Bunny cartoon sees the return of the unknown Marvin the Martian and his sidekick K-9 the green dog. <br /> <br /> This time, instead of destroying the Earth, Marvin is on a mission to land, capture an Earth and catch it back to Mars. Of course, the creature he chooses is Bugs Bunny. Initially, Bugs Marvin and K-9 find a trick or a treat, but realize it can't be right if Marvin drains the Bug's rabbit gun with a radius. Bugs are trying to get out of the situation in some ways, including Marvin persuading K-9 to plan a mutiny. Eventually he is caught using an Acme jacket that radiates bazooka. Surprisingly, for an Acme product, it works as advertised, and Bug's is forced to use his mind to get K-9 to release him. The tables are quickly turned around and the two disgruntled Martians are excited and Bugs are trying to fly their saucers back. to Earth. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed it, though the end is slightly poor compared to the rest of the story. Marvin's voice changed slightly here and he became emotionally visible when he was angry, but it didn't make me any less like him or her.
