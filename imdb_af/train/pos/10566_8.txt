Never saw this movie and enjoyed the singing and dancing by Cagney and the other role players, namely: Dick Powell (Scott Blair) who had a good tenor voice and Ruby Keeler (Bea Thorn). James Cagney plays the role of Chester Kent, who writes musicals and eventually goes to produce Prologues that are featured between feature films in the 1930s. Chester has problems with people trying to steal his ideas for his performances. It's a very entertaining movie with lots of comedy and lots of laughter. Joan Blondell, (Nan Prescott), donated a great supporting role, which was also very young and beautiful. Dick Powell was great as a singer and dancer and just started his long and successful screen career. Enjoy.
