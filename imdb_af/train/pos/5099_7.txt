The only reason I got this movie was that it is on the LITTLE MISS MARKER DVD and I recommend watching it, though you don't like it, as well as the better known movie. <br /> <br /> We have Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard as a man and his companion. The film starts out quite lightly, but is planned more dramatically than Coop first to use his daughter to withdraw a considerable amount of cash from his son-in-law, but to meet the girl and see the discipline, she will be among his brother . -In-law chooses to keep her. However, he has problems on the straight and narrow path and so the drama develops. <br /> <br /> Cooper and Lombard are good and Shirley still manages the scenes she enters. There is little music in it and Shirley has only one song. However, it is entertaining and worth watching with LITTLE MISS MARKER.
