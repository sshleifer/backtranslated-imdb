Believe it or not, the Last Case of Inspector Gadget is what helped me over the whole Gadget thing. <br /> <br /> My name is Miriam and I'm twelve, so of course I wasn't close when Inspector Gadget was. at the top of his career. Sure, I heard from him, but I didn't really know him. <br /> <br /> As I read, notice that I never have the original ranges (I want to do that!). It's about the only Gadget thing I've ever watched (although I'm now obsessive) and I'll focus on what I like because everyone else is so negative. For all your pessimists, I also have some disadvantages. = P First, for a childish sense of humor, you can watch this movie very funny. I thought it was, so sue me. I also thought the animation and character designs were good, and I'm also glad there was more Gadget in because he is my favorite character. (I don't like Penny.) Then there was Claw (his voice was terrible) and the Madcat; I thought they were doing pretty well too. The gadget's idiot was pretty good in place, if not a little exaggerated (that is, its thumb-handy thumb.) Would make a good screen shot though. = P) Oh, and I like the song that ran in the credits. Yes, I'm strange. <br /> <br /> And, like all movies, there are also some negatives. <br /> <br /> Speaking of cars? How about this? You can say it's aimed at younger boys. It won't bother me that much if there's not the fact that the cars basically saved the day. I would have preferred to have Penny and Brain taken their place. And apparently Gadget loved his car more than naturally. A little weird, at least. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the Chief was right for Gadget. I mean, she, yes, he wasn't always the most beautiful of people, but he didn't hate Gadget, from what I read. Like the Inspector, his personality was exaggerated. <br /> <br /> Well, that's pretty much everything I have to say about this movie. I thought the animation made up for the car-centered plot and it was generally pretty decent; More than the live-action Gadget movies (gender, gender, BUTCHERED!) At least. Maybe I'm just biased because it's my first in Gadget, or maybe my mind is distorted, or maybe I'm just strange, but I really liked this movie, even though I'm the oldest, it is recommended for.
