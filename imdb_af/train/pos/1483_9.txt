A sophisticated contemporary fable about the tension that works to loosen and eventually untie the vows of marriage. The main thrust of the story comes from a 'homie' spoken by a country priest following the loyal promises of a young cosmopolitan couple from Milan. In it, the future course of the marriage is spelled out, which springs from the stress of modern life. The "moral" of this story in a story is that it is necessary for a marriage to work out, both now and in the past, that the relationship between family and friends should be applied. This film was a family member by local domestic Italian standards. It's a terrible shame that this movie isn't available in DVD or VHS.
