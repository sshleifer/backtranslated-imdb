I just saw this movie and fell in love. There is a bit of something for everyone, and it's free for everyone when it comes to the romance between Lachlan and Lil. When they are on the beach, I almost cried ... there is the unspoken realization that time is the most precious thing and it is clear when they are together. This idea is taken from different angles, from marriage to sibling to find love in the least conventional places. The movie makes you almost long for that kind of despair when you know it will be your last tomorrow. Crowe was especially wonderful in his role as Lachlan. I've always had a soft spot for the accent, but I almost melted with his portrayal of his character. The way this movie was shot is also beautiful, with the music, the backdrop of the open fields, and wonderful acting. All in all, it's a wonderful movie that pulls all human emotions.
