"The Incredible Smelting Man" is an incredibly coarse, trashy and energetic Z-grade production that every self-respecting camp horror freak simply has to see for himself / herself! The ideal way to describe this low budget 70-jewel is like a shameful copy of Hammer's "The Quatermass Xperiment" ... only a thousand times more dirty! Astronaut Steve West is the only survivor of a disastrous space mission, but appears to be the bearer of a terrible disease that makes him radioactive and causes him to melt! Shocked after seeing his face in the mirror (can you make him guilty?), Steve stepped out of the hospital, left a path of tough pussy and fell behind body parts. Doctor Ted Nelson must find him urgent, as the disease also establishes Steve with a memorable appetite for human flesh. The premise may be quite stupid, but this movie is very entertaining and contains great makeup effects from Rick Baker's hand. The face of the face looks like a rotting pizza and his heavy breathing makes him sound like Darth Vader! Another big advantage is that William Sachs' script doesn't waste any time on boring scientific statements or emotional speeches. The repulsion starts immediately and lasts until the last moment of the film. Just enjoy this silly horror jewel and try to make your brain activity as much as possible, because if you start thinking about the many stupidity in the screenplay, you miss all the camp god!
