Fox's epic narrative of one of America's greatest pioneering efforts comes on DVD with some outstanding "Extras". BRIGHAM YOUNG (The "Frontiersman" was added for European release), telling the story the great pioneer leader inspired by members of the faith in the Mormon (Church of Jesus Christ of the Last Days Saints) to the Salt Lake Valley in 1847 After mussels murdered their prophet / leader, Joseph Smith (played by Vincent Price) was screened in 1940, just as America would come to World War II. It was a daring move on Fox chief, Darryl F. Zanuck, and it was a fresh air for the Mormon people, as it was the first film attempt to show their faith on the screen. Now, Fox, who along with James D'Arc, curator of the excellent Motion Picture Archives at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, brought this movie to the DVD format in an outing edition. Mr. D'Arc, who did his doctorate on the film a few years ago, made one of the most in-depth comments ever made for a DVD. He separates the fact from the fiction and lets listeners understand why these films are so much appreciated by the church leaders, though the decorations of the truth run throughout the film. One of the fun pieces of information is about Dean Jagger, the actor who plays the title role. Many years after the film, he married a last-holy woman and was eventually converted to the LDS faith. There is a lot to learn about D'Arc's knowledge and it's great to have it as part of the DVD! There are over 100 photos of the Fox & BYU Archives included on the disc, plus the news line of the incredible premiere at seven theaters in Salt Lake City. Thanks FOX for another great DVD - and thanks, James D'Arc for your great comment!
