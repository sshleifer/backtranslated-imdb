This is one of the funniest movies I've seen. It had rough moments, but they were full of charm. It's Altmanesque script, brilliant physical humor, and relaxed friendships were a pleasure to watch, and a part of life that most of us relate to. and I can say with some honesty that I was scared of Steve Carell's nipple. I was really. Surprisingly, this is a good, trivial comedy that is essentially about love, and the many relationships we may find along the way. Catherine Keener was fantastic as Trish, and all Steve Carell's friends were flawed but friendly and fun. The idea that they suspected that Carell was a serial killer was a hilarious metaphor for a forty-year-old virgin. but the simple truth was that he first wanted to fall in love. Original, charming and very funny. highly recommended.
