It is a beautiful film visually. The images of the Mexican desert, the old mansion, the characters in their picturesque costumes ... are all a real work of art. <br /> <br /> The story looks a little loose, but it's because it's not meant to be. to be realistic. It is taken from a book called a hundred years of loneliness, and it is supposed to be a call to the isolated, extraterrestrial atmosphere of Latin America "so far from God and so close to the United States". The tremendous debt that Erendira owes her grandmother is symbolic of the international debt burden of Latin America, although there is very little significance. <br /> <br /> If you appreciate a slow, richly textured movie, this one is for you.
