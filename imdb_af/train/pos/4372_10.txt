Rob Roy is and underestimated epic of passion and action! NICE MILD SPOILERS INSIDE. Liam Neeson gives high performance as Rob Roy MacGregor, one of the best in his career. Jessica Lange is literally like his wife Mary.They has the most passion and chemistry I have seen in a couple of years. John Hurt gives his best snotty aristocrat performance. Tim Roth depicts one of the big-screen villains. His rape of Mary is offensive and harrowing. He is really a beautiful bastard in this movie. The final duel between Rob and Cunningham is one of the best swordsmen ever. Well Scripted ans obtained, and Michael Caton-Jones direction is flawless. 10 out of 10.
