As Peckinpah did with STRAW DOG, and Kubrick with a CLOUD CORN, director John Boorman delivers an effective film about Man's Violent Side in DELIVERY, probably a definite horror movie of the 1970s. Burt Reynolds, Jon Voight, Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox depict four Atlanta businessmen who decide to take a canoe trip along the Cahulawassee River in North Georgia before being called up in the Reynolds' "One Dead Dead" . /> <br /> But the local mountain people are taking a painfully clear view of these "city boys" who cherish their bushes. And the next day, at the end of the river, Beatty and Voight are attacked and sexually assaulted (the movie's infamous "SQUEAL!" Sequence) by two evil mountain men (Bill McKinney, Herbert Cowboy Coward). So, starting as nothing more than a lion by the Appalachians, it has now turned into a nightmare in which we come to see four main players to see the thin line that exists between what we consider civilization and what we barbaric. regard. /> <br /> James Dickey has adapted the script from his own best-selling book, and the result is an often gripping and disturbing player. Often known for his "SQUEAL!" and "Dueling Banjos" series, LIVING is also a very pulsating ordeal, with the four leading men beautiful in their roles, and McKinney and Coward make two of the terrifying villains of all time. A must-see movie for those who are willing to take a chance.
