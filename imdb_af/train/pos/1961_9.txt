I just returned from the first performance of Basic Instinct 2. I was thinking it would be based on preview critics, and I was pleasantly surprised! If you like the original Basic Instinct, I think you'll only enjoy 2 if it's no longer. Great story, always wondering and thinking. The music is wonderful, reflecting the original theme. Don't expect Academy Award material to see it for pleasure and pleasure. That's what movies are designed for - escapism. I can't think of a better way to escape than to escape with Sharon Stone who is as sexy as she ever was. Think about seeing this weekend again. Go see it!
