This is a beautiful film that is so superficial that my wife, daughter and I found it irresistible. The plot is just crazy but "rings true" to the world of soap operas in all its outrageous unlikelyities and impossibilities. <br /> <br /> I especially enjoy Kevin Kline and Sally Field's performances. I don't play anyone better than Kline to play THICKheaded. Veld's character's really desperate need for attention and affirmation - and her almost bipolar swing in the mood - played well against the backdrop of Field's famous (infamous?) "You love me!" Oscar declaration. People who can use themselves with such a large grain of salt are too rare in this world. <br /> <br /> I think it's the only movie where I wasn't impatient with Whoopi Goldberg characterization; I thought she was "mocking" in every note she hit. Robert Downey Jr., Teri Hatcher, Cathy Moriarty, and Elizabeth Shue were also prominent. Just a good movie if you're in the mood to go for the ride and leave!
