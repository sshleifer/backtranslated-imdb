When I heard that "Hammerhead" was released on DVD and eventually found it at my local DVD store, I thought "well, just another cheap Nu Image monster movie". These guys around Boaz Davidson and Avi Lerner have made cheap but very entertaining B-pictures over the past few months, but also some very disappointing movies. So I didn't expect much, especially after watching the rather disappointing "Shark Zone" just days before. But "Hammerhead" was an excellent revival of the 1950's monster movies. We have a mad scientist, a group of people in a dangerous situation, screaming women and ladies in distress, plants we eat and of course we have the creature, a great mutant mix between a man and a hammerhead shark. Everything you need for an entertaining monster movie. The only thing missing is graphic sex scenes and nudity that you expect in such movies, but since the movie was made for TV, it's understandable why these scenes are missing. And it doesn't matter, because "Hammerhead" is action and horror entertainment at its best. There are two reasons why I have given it seven out of ten points: First, the monster is not seen very often and the performance of the destruction of the creature is done too fast and poorly, and secondly, William Forsythe is just not the right one guy for the "hero" part and fall in love with the beautiful Hunter Tylo. Other than that, I can highly recommend this movie for any monster movie fan out there. Grab a cool drink and some popcorn yourself, watch this movie and enjoy it. Jasper P. Morgan
