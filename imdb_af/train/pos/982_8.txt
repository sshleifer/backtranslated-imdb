It is one of the western countries that, though, virtually alone in the unparalleled quality of its dialogue. Very little can keep it in the long run. That said, the rest is pretty bad. Yet I give it eight, because there is no other Western with such a consistently good dialogue with perhaps the exception of The Wild Bunch, Junior Bonner, and maybe some more. <br /> <br /> It's been struggling with weaknesses, John Drew Barrimore, the most brilliant. But this did have a memorable scene. Nothing like that. It's right after Kid Wichita kills the sheriff and goes to Jack Elams' place to fetch him in battle. Wonderful things. Right up with the best in any western.
