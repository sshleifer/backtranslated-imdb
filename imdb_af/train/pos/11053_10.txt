I was not born until 4 years after this wonderful show was broadcast, but fortunately I managed to catch the mid 90's reruns and the rest is history ...... I was addicted. The premise was pretty simple; Two hard-hired Nemesis agents, Richard Barrett and Craig Stirling (William Gaunt and Stuart Damon) are, along with a knowledgeable (if not young) doctor and biologist (Sharron Macready), leading the bamboo curtain to pick up a dangerous biological agent. track. by red china. As they escape, their plane is hit by firearms and they fall into the heart of the Himalayas where their lives are saved by a mysterious and previously undiscovered civilization that cures and improves the trio's senses, thereby exciting the scene for many. adventures to come ... <br /> <br /> The series lasted for 30-hour episodes and I think it was his relatively short-lived, one season races set up for cult status. <br /> <br> Monty Berman, the manufacturer, was notorious for making things as cheap as possible, and sometimes the performance suffered from incredible tough sets - especially in episodes such as Happening (a Australia-based studio). and the "snow" sets "Deep Deep Deep" and "The Beginning", but if you can come by and focus on the characters and story lines, the show was really fun, it had a wonderful mix of adventure, and lots of lethal humor (mainly from some wonderful one William Gaunt linen). <br /> <br /> The chemistry of the three leads was fantastic - you get the feeling that they were really. the show and it is read out in the 2005 reunification documentary where the three are reunited after more than 35 years to remind the show (and laugh at Anthony Nicholls terrible wig !!) They all shared equal screen time and all their moments to shine, I have to say, I've always been A Richard Barrett fan. I loved his sardonic humor with the dangerous edge. He was certainly a man you didn't cross, and those eyes ....... the bloody eyes you have probably seen on TV. I also followed Bill Gaunts' career with interest. But Craig Stirling would definitely have had his legion female fans and I'm sure Alexandra Bastedo had a whole rope of male fans over her. <br /> <br /> The show also had plenty of guests to attract. with Donald Sutherland, Jeremy Brett, Peter Wyngarde, Burt Kwouk, Anton Rodgers, Kate O'Mara, Jenny Linden, Paul Eddington and Colin Blakely. <br /> <br /> Notable episodes for me were: "Auto Kill", "The Interrogation", "The Fanatics", "The Mission" and "The Gilded Cage", but I'm sure everyone has their personal favorites. <br /> <br /> If you have a chance to watch this show for the first time, or to watch it again after many years, remember to see it in the context of the time it was created and just sit back and enjoy - the characters and the chemistry of the three leads that made this great show and I don't think I'll ever tire of it. <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
