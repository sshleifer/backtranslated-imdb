It's not exactly a good movie, but I admire the authors and director to try something a little different. The film's main theme is fate and small, seemingly insignificant things that change the future a lot. In some ways it reminds me of the sliding door of the movie, but instead of focusing on one random event, it seems that random random things happen repeatedly and each one helps build after the cute conclusion. Plus, a weird bald guy seems to understand it all and he speaks about it in one short scene - like being a kind of almighty, but there is absolutely no explanation from him in the movie (like the two guys who in the clock tower in the HUDSUCKER PROXY). <br /> <br /> The DVD jacket just shows Audrey Tautou. This is central to her success in AMELIE, although she is just one of the actors in the film and there is not one of the lead roles. The pace is alive, the acting fine and the conclusion is not bad at all. The only reason I didn't play it higher is that some of the characters were a bit uninteresting and I think the movie might be tackled with a few less subplots.
