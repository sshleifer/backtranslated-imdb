"Stories of the Century" was a half hour series and appeared in the first syndication during the '54'55 television season. It was also the first Western TV series to win an Emmy award. Play veteran West actor Jim Davis as railway detective Matt Clark, Clark's series and his fellow railroad detective partners (Mary Castle and Frankie Adams for the first half of the season and Kristine Miller as Jonesy in the second half) against historic western Outlaws of different periods ranging from mid-1860s to early 1900s. The series was very satisfying, easy to watch and fairly realistic, mainly because of Jim Davis' easy-going charm. He was like a true Western character. Another note. When Matt Clark arrived in town after a long drive, he looked as if he was on a long ride, as he would be covered in dust. <br /> <br /> Very good early adult western.
