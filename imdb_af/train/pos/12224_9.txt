I saw the whole movie last night and I found it very exciting. It was at least not like the teen slasher movies that come out every now and then. The search for the killer and the "partner" relationship between the hero and the so-called bad guy were parts I liked about the movie. Also, I remember once at the edge of my seat during a particular scene in the movie. I think this is exciting. Maybe I'll be able to watch the movie again later. ..
