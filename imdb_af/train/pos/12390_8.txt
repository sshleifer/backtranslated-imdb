Bizarre horror movie filled with familiar faces but stolen by Cristina Raines (later of the TV's Flamingo Road) as a nice but somewhat unstable model with a nice smile paid for her suicide attempts by guarding the Gateway to Hell! The scenes with Raines modeling are very well captured, the mood music is perfect, Deborah Raffin is beautiful as Cristina's pal, but when Raines moves into a creepy Brooklyn Heights brownstone (inhabited by a blind priest on the top floor), things really cook. The neighbors, including an incredible godless Burgess Meredith and the kinky couple Sylvia Miles and Beverly D'Angelo, are a deadly fate, and Eli Wallach is a lot of fun as a naughty police detective. The film is almost a cross-pollination of "Rosemary's Baby" and "The Exorcist" - but what a combination! Based on the bestseller of Jeffrey Konvitz, "The Sentinel" is surprisingly haunting, full of shocks brought by director Michael Winner, ending a thorough depression with skill. *** 1/2 from ****
