Cat Soup at first looks a very random animation movie. The best way I could explain it is that it is rather acidic. Although not quite random. The story is about Nyatta, a young boy and his sister Nyaako. Nyaako is very sick and dying, but Nyatta sees her soul being taken away by death and can regain half. The story is about striving to bring Nyaako back in full. <br /> <br /> Although much of the content in this movie looks completely random, it is not. Most of them are symbolic of life, death and rebirth. You can also see references from other stories, such as Hansel and Gretal. This odd cute short film has an interesting story, with a deeper meaning than you see on the surface of the screen.
