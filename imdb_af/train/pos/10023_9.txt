Having seen several films by Villaronga, I had a nice opinion about him - he focused too much on the personal aspect of the characters and forgot about a rhythm of the movie. That's why his movies never had the attention of the general public, although he had good critics. In ARo he follows the same line, but really improves on the rhythm, especially in the end of the movie. Honestly, I slept through the first part, because although the first part gives the necessary information, it is very slow. Yet the second part is absolutely wonderful and makes the whole movie the best movie ever made by Villaronga. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
