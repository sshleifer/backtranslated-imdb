TRICK OF TRIAL is a good example of Hollywood who played the "backward metal music messages" that kicked Tipper Gore and her Washington women in the mid-80s (other, less successful entries in this mini-genre). close the horrible BLACK ROSES and stupid the street). I was a toddler at high school when TRICK OF TRIAL came out and couldn't wait to see it. It seems to be disappearing from video stores by the end of the 1980s, but I bought a cheap DVD for a short while, and it brought back many enjoyable metal memories back in the day. Any teenage metal nerd may be related to the trials of Eddie "Ragman" Weinbauer (Marc Prize of "Family Ties") in this movie while being persecuted by the lash "beautiful" people in his high school for his heavy metal fashions and musical taste. Eddie's favorite rock star is Sammi Curr (who looks much like Tommy Lee of Motley Crue), who is killed in a hotel early in the film. Eddie is unreliable until he receives a test print from Sammi's final unpublished album from a radio DJ (Gene Simmons of Kiss in a short comedy). Eddie soon discovers that this LP, if played backwards, enables him to communicate with the ooze spirit of Sammi Curr himself! Soon, Sammi gives Eddie advice on how to get even with his preppie martyrs, but if the messages escalate ("Waste'em ALL ... no fake metal!") Eddie tries to destroy the album, resulting in Sammi coming back to life via Eddie's stereo speakers. Sammi devastates the big dance at Eddie's high school and takes the stage to drop the crowd and dissolve some unlucky "false metalers" before Eddie tries the day and the girl of his dreams. (SIGH) No, it's not terribly scary in 2006, but it wasn't even scary in 1986, but TRICK OF TRIAL is a movie that will bring a smile to the face of any 1980s metals. cult band Fastway. Well worth finding out if you've ever hit your head or have a taste for B-grade horror movies (or both, like me).
