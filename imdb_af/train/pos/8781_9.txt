I consider myself a connoisseur of boxing movies and as such there is only one thing that prevents me from calling a man who made the best boxing movie ever. This is the Robert Wise / Paul Newman movie "someone there is like me." The movie can be number 1, but "Gentleman Jim" is a close number 2. <br /> <br /> The movie not only makes the rise of James J. Corbett, but also shows the sport of boxing. an important transition period. In the late 1800s, boxing ran away from the brutal days of screeching to the more "gentlemanly" days of the gloved, Marquis or Queensbury rules. And the sport was away from the days when it was an illegal spectacle and to a time of acceptance and respect. <br /> <br /> "Lord Jim" is not a realistic look at those days. It's romantic and, yes, even a little hokey at times. But always delicious. Errol Flynn is perfect as the "Lord" Jim who is not really a "gentleman" but merely a quick talk from a working class family. Alexis Smith is quite surprising as the higher class woman with whom he has a love / hate relationship (and we all know it is love that ultimately wins the game). <br /> <br /> At the end of "Lord Jim", the great John L Sullivan (whose famous line was NOT, "I can leak anyone in the world" of course ... romance) hand over his belt to Corbett. It is truly one of the best scenes in any sporting movement ever made. Realistic? No. But wonderful. Hey, if you want realism, see "Raging Bull" rather. This is a much more realistic boxing movie. But "Lord Jim" is much more fun.
