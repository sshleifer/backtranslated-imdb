Woody Allen's second movie in London. Tha Tarot Card killer is dead prostitutes in London. Aspiring journalist Sondra Pransky (Scarlett Johansson) gets a hint that he can be Lord Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman). She began to romance him, but quickly fell in love. She is helped by the stage dentist Sid Waterman (Woody Allen) who doesn't like what he sees. <br /> <br /> I like these better than last year's overpriced "Match Point". It was shorter and moving much faster. The plot is old but I was entertained and it made me guess at the end. It's not really a comedy, but a mystery with some very good comic lines (all of Allen of course). It's not one of Allen's best, but it's much better than its worst. <br /> <br /> For the most part, the acting is very good. Allen is bad, but he played this character a million times before and it gets annoying. But Johansson and Jackman are just fantastic - they look fantastic and give two very attractive credible performances. Allen (surprisingly) works on their sex appeal - there is a sequence in which they are both in their bathing suits to show their beautiful bodies. The only real debit is that Allen is still uncertain about how to shoot London. He's not as off-set as he was on "Match Point" - maybe he'll just get better than he does. <br /> <br /> Appreciate. I give it a 8.
