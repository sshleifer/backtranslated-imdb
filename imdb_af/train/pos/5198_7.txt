What can be said of Mr. Moore said? He is the grandfather of rap, he is the king of the Z-level blaxploitation flicks, and here he is back as his best-known character, Dolemite! Can you dig it? This movie is one of the most crazy roles of politically wrong humor, trippy kung-fu, nudity, cheese, violence and many other things you'll never get in most modern movies (or any movies, really, haha!). The stand-up routine he gives early is not to be missed! Anyway, D2 is definitely an entertaining way to waste an hour or so. Dolemite: "He thinks he's bad and doesn't have a class! I'm gonna rock this gun at his * beep * a **!"
