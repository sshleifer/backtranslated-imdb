I just can't figure out how brilliant the combination of Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon is. It's as if the movie doesn't even need additional characters, because you can never get tired of the dialogue between these two. <br /> <br /> Lemmon was already in several well-known films such as Mr. Roberts and The Apartment and Matthau were fresh from his Oscar victory for The Fortune Cookie (another Billy Wilder film also at Lemmon). The specific movie wasn't as big as this one, because the story couldn't run that long (I think it was almost 2 hours). However, this is already halfway, although the launch of events that stop at Lemmon at Matthau's apartment is a bit long (so was this sense). However, this is a small problem and for the rest of the run you have a wonderful time. <br /> <br /> I've already commented on how the sequel to this movie sucks and I won't go deeper into it. The reason why it is such a joy is probably that the film is made just as the innocence of American movies fades into oblivion. There are some sexual references, but they are dealt with in such an innocent manner that you couldn't even get a "Well, I never ..." from the most gruesome person out there. It is nice to see a movie of a lost era and that was probably why the successor didn't work, because you had Matthau and Lemmon quite a few f-words and that didn't fit them. <Br /> <br /> Of course, now they're both gone and you can only be happy to still enjoy it in a great movie. I think the only male actor in this movie still alive is John Fiedler. Edelman recently died. So there you have it. One of the best comedies and movies ever. <br /> <br /> Add: I recently learned that John Fiedler was so dead to all his fans. I am very sorry. I didn't have a lack of respect and I will try to be more careful about what I will blah blah blah blah next time.
