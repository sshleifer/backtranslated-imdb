I was really surprised with this movie. Going into the sneak preview, nothing knows about the movie except for the one trailer I saw. I thought it would be a Dude. Where's my car, a crap party. I expected bad sex jokes and farting and a pathetic main character that would eventually be laid, because that's just how movies work. Instead, I had a clever, surprisingly original movie about a decent, average guy who never had sex. <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie is full of sex jokes and vulgarity and occasionally hey-look-a-nipples, but it's done a lot in the spirit of Bad Santa rather than Sorority Boys. All the characters are people you probably know in real life, redeeming friends who are just trying to hook up a brother and live their lives. <br /> <br /> I thought this movie was going to be total crap, and I was very surprised. Yes, it's nice on top (it's a movie about a 40-year-old virgin!), But it's done very cleverly. <br /> <br /> In the end, you really get this guy laid out, who says a lot about the movie, because honestly, do you really care if Ashton Kutcher got his car or not?
