I remember it on television in the late 70's, and it stayed with me! It's beautiful, hard and colorful - a great children's movie. I recently tackled it for a couple of friends at a party. And of course they thought I was crazy and expecting something to happen to the dolls. A "Meet the Fever" But no, it's a healthy clean pleasure. <br /> <br /> Jack Wild is in fine shape, like Mama Cass, and somehow attractive witchy poo. <br /> <br /> If you like banana claws and you're in your 30s, it will re-create the surreal childhood on Saturday morning. Vibe! <br /> <br /> Even if I realized now that Puf was a bit of a crap - like everything he did, being caught and run away! Quality TV movie - if you, like me, are in death metal, you'll love it!
