I saw a special prospect on this today. I have to let you know, I'm not a big fan of Dane Cook or Steve Carell, so I really had no expectations in this. I finally enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> Then in Real Life is the story of a widower with 3 girls spending a weekend with his family. While at a bookshop, he met his wife's dreams, just to find out she was his girlfriend's brother. <br /> <br /> This movie is pretty good - the soundtrack, cinematography and acting are all top notch, especially Steve Carell. My problem with that was mostly that there was a lack of character development, mostly with Dane Cook's character. We never look at the relationship between Dane and Steve's characters, and I felt it could help a little to show what Dan's inner conflict was about Dane's girlfriend's love. Other than that, Dan in Real Life is definitely a solid, sweet movie - definitely a good break from all the horror and action movies we've got this year.
