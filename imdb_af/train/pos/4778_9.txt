Like his early masterpiece "The Elephant Man", Lynch proves to his opponents that he can tell a straightforward, simple story without losing his artistic touch. It is a true story of an elderly retired man (expertly played by Richard Farnsworth) who decides to drive a tractor over a few countries to pay a final visit to his estranged brother who is now at the death door. A beautiful score of Badalamenti, a beautiful picture of rural life (love the air maids) and a handy handy hand that reveals human basic humanity is a beautiful piece of life movie. His very slow pace can let some viewers sleep, but those who stay for the ride will eventually be well rewarded.
