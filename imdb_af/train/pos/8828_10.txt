I was so happy I got this short movie. I'm always so disappointed that short films are hard to come by. When I saw this and saw that it was nominated for the Live Action Short Film at the Academy Awards, I was so glad I actually had a movie for which I was rooted. <br /> <br /> The plot is pretty simple, director, writer and star Nacho Vigalondo tried to come up with a reason that people would suddenly break into a song and dance number as in filmmaking. The result is extremely entertaining and the song is really catchy. <br /> <br /> It's a well-made short film, well edited and the actors all do a good job. And the last shot of the movie is perfect. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie.
