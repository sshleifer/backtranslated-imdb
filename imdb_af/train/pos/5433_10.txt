This movie is one of my all-time favorites. Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen, and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. what a cast. Not to mention Sam Jaffe as Gunga Din. Drama, action, adventure and comedy all rolled up in one. The last battle scene to this day gives me cold fever and the end always leaves me with tears. If you didn't see it, I'd highly recommend it.
