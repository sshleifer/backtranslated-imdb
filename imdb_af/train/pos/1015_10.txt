I'm waiting for every new episode, every time with anticipation! The new look of sci-fi created by Stargate SG-1 is a wonder I hope will never end. Combining the past with the future is a new twist that is fascinating to me. Season # 9 in itself must be excitement. I wish Richard Dean Anderson would appear more regularly in the new season, because I love his dry white as much as his temper tantrums in his character as Jack O'Neill. The other characters add their own uniqueness to the show that makes it a winner, season after season. You cancel this program in the next three years and you are making a serious mistake. Also, you need a bigger role for the Asgard - they are just too cool.
