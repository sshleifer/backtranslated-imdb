If you are a Crispin Glover fan, you should see it. If you're a Sean Penn fan, you should see it. If you are a movie fan in general, you should see it. If you don't know who Crispin Glover is and you have no idea who Sean Penn is, this movie will probably still have a lot of value, but the more you have seen before by Crispin or Sean, the better. <Br /> <br /> This movie is so funny, but it's also pure genius. There's nothing I know about, like this movie. It's his own genre. I doubt anything like that will ever be made again. I can't say anything more about exactly why without even spoiling it, and some of the other reviews here have already done a good job of doing so. <br /> <br /> In response to any of the reviewers here who gave it a bad review, I ask that you see the movie again. In fact, there is no point at which this movie can be reasonably mentioned. It is perhaps the funniest, most entertaining and least boring movie ever made. And it just gets better with age and repeated views. A timeless classic that unfortunately can do very little. <br /> <br /> Beaver Trilogy is the brilliant work of director Trent Harris, also responsible for the incredible Rubin and Ed, who also starred Crispin Glover. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, copies of this movie are rare and difficult to find. I managed to find a VHS version after some diligent searches, and there are a few ways to find what I know. But I really wish someone would post it on a DVD.
