Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega are the mismatched couple who come in the car and go over the desires according to the need of one or the other. Morgan Freeman is beautifully human, with respect to everyone, while Paz Vega is the edgy cashier behind the "10 Items of Less" series, intimidating clients and bored. Explore, discover, and learn from each other. To do this of course, they must be vulnerable, interested in change, and have a sense of humor, which they both have. I wish this movie was realistic. I wish this kind of story more often. I wish we didn't go to the movies to realize that we can connect with each other, even though we come from many different backgrounds. The message of the film is in the open heart and makes us wonder about the possibility of another world where we meet each other - a world where peace can be a possibility.
