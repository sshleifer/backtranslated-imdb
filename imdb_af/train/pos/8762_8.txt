"What will you do?" is a question that will remain in your mind for weeks after looking at the emotional Brokedown Palace. You will also wonder if Alice (Danes) tells the truth or not - a problem left unresolved and right. It is a particularly well-activated and beautifully shot movie. Although sometimes slow, the pace is reflective of the story line - but much of the movie will have you on the edge of your seat; wants to know what happens next. The end will also let you imagine in the shoes of the main characters, which Brilliant is played by Kate Beckinsale and Claire Danes. Bill Pullman's performance is also commendable.
