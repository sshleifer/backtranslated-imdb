The movie begins very slowly, with Wallace Napalm's lifestyle, an assistant at a photo-service delivery station. His wife is confined to her single-arm home because of an arson sentence. Wallace is a member of the voluntary fire brigade, and takes a fire fight seriously. <br /> <br /> When we see Wallace's dull walk, something new and sudden suddenly comes in: a travel carnival comes to town. One of his stars is Wilder Napalm, Wallace's brother. He's a clown, but he has a special talent. <br /> <br /> So do Wallace. They are both pyrokineticists or "pyrotics", people who are able to start fires through mental energy. Wallace secretly keeps his powers; Wilder lets his acquaintances know what he can do. <br /> <br /> Spoiler: Some of their differences go back to a children's incident where they accidentally caused the death of a vagrant. Wallace refrains from using his powers; Wilder wants to go public on national TV. <br /> <br /> The case is getting complicated, Wilder wants Wallace's wife, whom they both dated earlier. She is being harmed and becomes one of the reasons why the brothers eventually have a literal fire. <br /> <br /> The movie is entertaining, but not fun. I think enough to have a copy in my library. This is a good horrible movie.
