The characters were lively and interesting, the plot was excellent, the pyro-effects were masterfully achieved, and it took a basic love triangle story and cast into a science fiction element in it. I could identify with many of the characters and their motivation made logical rational sense in the framework of the story. <br /> <br /> The camera work was great, the sound is clear and accurate, the background music is perfectly chosen for the effect. , the singing firefighters produce a beautifully talented memorable strangeness, the brilliant sets, and the special effects of a talented talent. <br /> <br /> I'm a bit surprised that a whole mini-carnival in a chain store's parking can be powered by a single lantern outlet. It seems impossible to say the least. However, the battle between the brothers near the end of the movie was brilliant. Having Jim Varney in a non-clown role was also a wonderful touch, as the semi-serious role of a carny played well.
