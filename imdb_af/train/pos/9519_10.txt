Tom Hanks is in such hits as Forrest Gump, Saving Private Ryan and The Green Mile. For the most part, his roles were good guys we were encouraging. In Road to Perdition, his character, Michael Sullivanis, is a little different. <br /> <br /> In Sam Mendes's film Road to Perdition, based on Max Allan Collins' graphic novel, he shows the story of a man and his son. on the road during the Great Depression in Chicago. What is different about this little road trip is that Sullivan is a hit that is being hunted by his former partner. His boss or former boss, John Rooney (Paul Newman), loves almost his own son, Sullivan's partner, Connor (Daniel Craig). <br /> <br /> Having done the wrong way, Connor is the only Witness of his fault with Sullivan and his son who were not supposed to be there. So Connor tries to take Sullivan and his family out, but only get the wife and other son, Peter. Sullivan fuses the hit and jumps home to find Michael Jr. sitting at the table ... just sitting. With his wife and child dead, Sullivan takes the path to find answers. <br /> <br /> The story follows the two as Sullivan tries to make things right in memory of his wife and child, and for Michael who feels like he has to blame for it. He felt his curiosity killed his mother and brother. Tyler Hoechlin does a tremendous job as Michael Jr. He brings maturity and also a feeling of being young. His loss of innocence was well behaved while traveling from town to town. He left nothing behind him. <br /> <br /> Mendes's previous hit film was American Beauty, who received five Oscars, including the Best Picture and Best Director. This film did not do as well at the Oscars, but won only one award for best filmmaking, but received five other nominations for music, sound and a best actor in a supporting role for Paul Newman. This photo is a wonderful story that takes you on a journey through the Middle East and in the legend of Mike Sullivan: man, hit and devoted father. This movie is a sleep movie to be watched for the coming year.
