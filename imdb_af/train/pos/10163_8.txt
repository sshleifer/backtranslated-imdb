It had a good story ... it has a good fit and all characters are cool. <br /> <br /> Over the past two weeks I watched a lot of movies and it had to be the best. I saw in the two weeks. <br /> <br /> Jason Bigg's character was the best. <br /> <br /> Although small, it was created from the beginning. <Br /> <br /> It could be a romantic comedy, and I don't like most, but writing, direction, performance, sound, overall design, was just really well thought out. <br /> <br /> This movie has become quite high on all the movies I've seen lately - and the rest was great budget or better known. <br /> <br /> Good work in writing.
