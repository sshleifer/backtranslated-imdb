I think I usually approach film festival comedies with the low expectation that they will always be "strange" and that any intended humor will only be at the expense of the characters' simplicity in the face of a complex context. What was the exception of Big Bad Swim was that the director was able to maintain the integrity and development of his characters in his film while still in the scene to the scene, laughing out loud in the scene. There was a sophistication, perhaps also due to the sharp work of the DP, I rarely saw in an indie movie, and even rarely in a comedy. From special note here: Paget Brewster's turn as Amy is the math teacher. After seeing this show, I can't understand why Brewster wasn't discovered by a bigger audience. She brings the necessary mix of anger and parable to the role that really helps this photo reach its potential. This is a tremendous job that is earned from a bigger audience. I look forward to more from the director and this role!
