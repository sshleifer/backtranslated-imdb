Father of Pride has been the best new show to hit television since Family Guy. It was another masterpiece of the talented people at Dreamworks Animation. Like the Simpsons, the show centers around a nuclear family (of white lions, in this case). It also features many memorable supporting characters, including Roger, the orange-eyed, Vincent's Italian-American flamingo, the eccentric white tigers Blake and Victoria, the faux patriotic Snout Brothers and Chutney's elephant. The other stars of the show are the Sigfreid and Roy. They are incredibly eccentric and do everything in a grandiose manner, entertaining the most everyday activities. The combination of cute animal characters with lots of adult dialogue and controversial issues (drugs, bias, etc.) is the source of the brilliance of the program. <br /> <br /> The fault for this show's failure lies with NBC. They chose not to broadcast the episodes in any particular order (perhaps influenced by which gas stars they could promote) rather than the more logical production series. Several times the show was suggested for an extra half hour of such a drink as The Biggest Loser (as if 60 minutes wasn't enough)! Indeed, this is a bad indication of the future of television as art as an original and daring show like this, while Fear and American Idol dominate. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the full range was released on DVD and the show now has the opportunity to get a bigger one. 10/10
