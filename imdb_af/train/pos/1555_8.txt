After watching the untidy WW1 spy runner this weekend, Mrs. Lili (1969) watched Julie Andrews on television this afternoon. Suddenly I thought I saw a far superior WW1 spy thriller. All I could remember was that it was manufactured by Dino De Laurentis. It just took a brief search on IMDB to find Fraulein Doktor. Once I recognized the title, the memories came back. It's a pretty well-crafted story about real-life events, such as the death of Kitchener and the German offensives of 1918. It also has a female spy that is much more credible than Julie Andrews! As with other reviewers, the first and strongest memory of the well-crafted combat tones and of men and horses was in gas masks. If you're interested in war movies and especially the first time, it's a movie worth seeing if you have the opportunity.
