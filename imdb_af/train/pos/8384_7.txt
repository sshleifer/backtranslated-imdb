I read somewhere (in a reasonable panning review) that this is something of a live action mecha anime, and I think they are on the right track. I first watched this movie when I was very young and I died to see it again, and when I finally did recently, all the memories have flooded. I don't think it should be taken too seriously - it's just a bit of good 80's almost-a-TV movie fun (it's against the backdrop of a pretty dark future, though this point isn't stressed too much). What I admired most about this movie was that the dialogue didn't keep it generic - no clicks, no predictable lines. All in all, just fun! Perhaps time is not so good for this little movie, but I can still appreciate it. It's not perfect at all, but it's entertaining and trying nothing more than that. Let the nerds and the comic shop guys worry about technical skills - who cares? See it for yourself and make your own decision. No one else's opinion matters.
