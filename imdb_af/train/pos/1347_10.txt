Great, exhaustive and passionate summary of American cinema, as seen through Martin Scorcese's eyes. Needless to say, there is never a dull moment in all its 4 hours of running. Many genres, periods and directors are all explored, discussing more from the perspective of cinephile rather than contemporary director. For anyone even remotely interested in American movies or theater in general. A masterpiece, and the best of the BFI's Century of Cinema series. <br /> <br />
