It's awesome! In Story Mode, you go from punk to pro. You need to complete goals that include skating, driving and walking. You create your own skater and give it a name, and you can make it dumb or realistic. You are with your friend Eric throughout the game until he betrays you and gets you off the skateboard team (you can choose a team to be on) and then start your own team! There are many levels like New Jersey, Manhattan, and even School II (not part of the story) of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2. You can unlock secret skaters like Iron Man, Gene Simmons, and another skater. You can create your own goals such as SKATE letters, COMBO letters, Tricktris, Gap, and more. You can create the goal pedestrian and write what they are talking about. If you get bored of doing so, you can do the pre-made goals in pre-made parks. The only thing I didn't like about this game was that it was sometimes difficult to drive the cars. 9/10.
