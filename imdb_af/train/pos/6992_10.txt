I won't say it's a bad movie; In fact, it's actually typical of the type of movie that the poverty driving studios released at the time. Filmed for Monogram, Bela Lugosi is very effective in his role as the somewhat demented doctor-scientist, making him a respected community member. In this movie, Bela and his henchmen have the nasty habit of stealing young brides and following their demise Bela's wife with a serum taken out of their body to keep her young. Lugosi is more than the job of making it a pleasurable movie, but the movie is suffering from ultra-wood acting co-stars Luana Walters and Tristram Kis. Kis (good name for a man in a horror flick) is especially bad in this case. I saw him in various movies and TV shows and he is always the same; stiff, wood and completely unconvincing. Miss Walters is only slightly better, but she also doesn't have the acting talent to make her role credible. Yet, the viewer can still enjoy the wonderful Lugosi action, a deadly scheme to finally foil! Despite the poor acting by some, "The Corpse Vanishes" is a pleasant movie for everyone to see.
