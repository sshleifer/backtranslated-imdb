First, Riget is wonderful. Good comedy and mystery at the same time. Nice combination of strange 'dogma' style to tell the story with good music and good actors. But unfortunately there is no 'end'. As far as I am concerned, this is unacceptable. I thought ... how would it be possible to continue the story without Helmer and Drusse? ... and I have an idea. I think Lars should make RIGET III a little different. I'm sure 3rd part without Helmer would not be the same. So here's my suggestion. Mayble a little stupid, maybe not. I know that Lars wants to experiment. So why not make a small experiment with Riget3? I think the only solution here is to create puppet-driven animation (such as Trey Parker team America) or even computer 3d animation. I know it's not the same as the real actors, but I believe in principle that it can work ... just as it is possible to make actors alive again. For Riget fans this should not be so big - if the animation is done in a good way, 'watcher' will normally consider it just after the first few shots of the movie. The most important thing now is the story. It is quite understandable that today it is not possible to create Riget 3 with the actors. So why not play with animation? And ... look at the possibilities it gives you! Even marketing one! Big director completes his trilogy after 10 years of doll animation. Just dreams? <br /> <br /> I hope to see Reich 3 someday ... or even just see the writing. I'm curious how the story ends ... and as I expect - everyone here does. <br /> <br /> salute, beat <br /> <br /> ps: I'm not talking about the "kingdom not hospital" by Stephen King ;-)
