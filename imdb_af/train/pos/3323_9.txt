I got this movie a month ago and now I'm a fanatic fan of Drew Barrymore's. I like a happy ending and this movie has a brilliant one with the truths of Red Sox thrown in! It's about a maths teacher who takes some promising kids on a math trip to a company where the successful Lindsey (Drew) shows them information. It then leads into the Ben (teacher) and Lindsey dating. But it is not easy to confess that he is a massive Red Sox fan. <br /> <br /> First of all, it's good, but its baseball gets in the way of Lindseys life. It's all fine in the end and it took one shot to run Drew over the field !! I did it for two quid in Blockbusters so I was happy. If you like movies like this, I suggest you see more of Drew's work like Charlie's Angels and 50 first dates or even her new movie with Hugh Grant in Music and Lyrics.
