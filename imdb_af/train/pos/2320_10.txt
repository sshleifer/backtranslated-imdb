Not only is this movie a good movie for basic cinematography (script, play, play, etc.), but also for realism. This movie can take place in any farm or rural environment. It doesn't matter if the movie is in Louisiana or if it happens in Kansas. The story and the messages it contains will stay the same. This movie shows family values ​​and connections for an older audience, while at the same time showing youthful behavior to younger viewers. Everyone who sees it will go away with something they have personally touched, I know I did. The end gets too close to the house for me not to burst into tears every time I see it. The end emphasizes the importance of farm safety, and anyone who ever worked on a farm should see this film. Not paying attention and carelessness gets you into dangerous situations. <br /> <br />
