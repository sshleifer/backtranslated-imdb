In the year 1990, the world of Disney TV cartoons was definitely the best. Shows such as Chip n Dale Rescue Rangers, DuckTales and Gummi Bears have been popular, and now Disney has made another big cartoon and that cartoon brought birth to the Disney Afternoon. That cartoon is called TaleSpin. It's about Old Jungle Book character Baloo the Bear as he works in the plane business. In the series he meets Kit Cloudkicker, former Air Pirate and good cloud surfer, businesswoman Rebecca Cunningham and her hyperactive daughter Molly. This series is very funny and has very good words that you cannot understand as a child but understand later in life. It's a smart written series and it's great to add to your DVD collection. Parents, buy it for your kids and let them see all the terrible Nickelodeon cartoons. If you like TaleSpin, watch "Darkwing Duck" and "Goof Troop". Spin it!
