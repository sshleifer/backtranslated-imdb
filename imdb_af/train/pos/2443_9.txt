This movie cannot put the Catholic Church in the best light, but it tells a story based on true events. Unfortunately, not everything is alive, including religion, all delicious and rosy. Sometimes people and groups do things that looked like the right thing at the time, but in retrospective do not look as big as they ever did. A love story tells the story of a family, yes it includes religion, but really the story is about a family, and the family's ability to stay together no matter what is thrown at them. This film is also based on true events that did not say that this story, scene on stage, is true, but if you look at news stories of that time, you will see that no churches help in a way that helps was with the family. Both churches are guilty of the Catholic church in the first place forcing such a regulation on the family and not responding to the violence that accompanies it and the Protestant church to tell the mother that she is just her husband and his priest must obey. and do not rise a fight. In this case, both leave this family. I believe the film is a good job of showing this battle in both the church and the family. It does not in any way form the formation of the Catholic Church, but the opposite, it shows how one incident can change the ideas of religion and how one person can have an effect that reaches much more than themselves.
