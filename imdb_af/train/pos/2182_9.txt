This brilliant film features a variety of talented actors and musicians on top of their form - Levant, Crosby, Martin, Rathbone, Manone are at home in the story apparently provided by Billy Wilder. One would like to know more about how much he had to deal with, because it is a particularly clever variation on the sterile master / fertile story - almost an entertainment industry's dried up, but in a lively art world and play through an exploited subclass of nobodies and non-WASPs. Looking at the past six decades of music, television and film in the US, it is difficult not to see the underlying insights of this film as prophetic.
