Goodbye Friend aka Adieu L'Ami / Honor among thieves is not perfect, but it is a neat and entertaining thriller that captured the mismatched muted French Algerian war veterans Alain Delon and Charles Bronson in the same basement vault, one to steal ties. send, the other to clear the two million wages that are over the Christmas weekend. Of course, things aren't quite that simple, even after opening the safe, resulting in a few neat twists and turns. On the debit side there is a very bizarre striptease scene in a parking lot. Bronson has a very annoying Fonzie-like catch that he uses on the most relentless moments, Brigitte Fossey, who may play the most boring mishonceived hairstyle of the 60's (it makes her look like a naked woman whose wig is from the top of blowing her head through a high wind), is something of a liability ?? "I'll cook spaghetti! I'll learn to make love good! I'll read Shakespeare!" Speech is hysterical in all the wrong ways? and it is a pity for the terrible last line / shot, but otherwise it is a surprisingly entertaining and unpretentious number worth finding out if you can find a decent pressure. <br /> <br /> The Cinema Club UK DVD offers only the English soundtrack, but as Delon agrees and the rest of the cast is fairly well-dubbed, it's not a big problem, especially since the widescreen transmission reasonably good quality.
