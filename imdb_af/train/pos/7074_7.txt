Terry Gilliam traveled to the future again (he already did it in Brazil) to tell this story about a virus that destroys humanity. <br /> <br /> The script is totally crazy about some easy tricks about it. but it is quite entertaining and Gilliam proves that he has imagination (the futuristic scenes are just great). Regarding the film, Bruce Willis and the beautiful Madeleine Stowe (all that happened to her?) Are just OK, but Brad Pitt is so annoying. When he plays roles that are out of his hand, he is so forced and he is not credible to anyone. He just has to play very successful young men. <br /> <br /> * My rate: 7/10
