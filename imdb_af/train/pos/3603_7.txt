"Girlfight" is much more of a coming-of-age story than it is a battle flame. And what a relief to have in an urban school, with naturalistic, realistic Latinos and credible use of Brooklyn project institutions. <br /> <br /> It made me realize that almost all Hollywood high school movies are in luxury suburbs or small towns. (Even the somewhat comparable "Love and Basketball" focused on teen African Americans was in suburbs.) Although these children are part of the same peer problems, the issues are shrinking compared to the other struggle of these kids, where high school graduation can be the most important achievement of their lives. <br /> <br /> The feminist element here is in its originality, while you hold your breath to see if she can have a relationship - and a victory - on her terms. A very obedient sympathy goes to the man who is challenged to stand up to a bend expectation situation. <br /> <br /> The movie goes a bit here and there, but it's not a cheap rocky excitement. fights movies, as the practices and battles have complicated outcomes, and all relationships - especially with fathers and father figures - take more center stage than the center ring. <br /> <br /> There were many interesting music credits at the end, but I didn't really notice the songs. <br /> <br /> (originally written on 10/7/2000)
