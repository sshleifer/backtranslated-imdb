I loved this movie. First of all, the smooth graphics seem strange to the grainy imagery, but I quickly got inside. Thousands of footage had to be shot and I really admire the work being done to cut it off. If you are easily shocked by drugs or violence, it may not be the movie for you, but here are some great characters (and some real tossers). Technically I also enjoyed it a lot, they had to use a new de-interlacing algorithm, or maybe it was just that the footage looked so dark anyway, but I was not annoyed by the usual artifacts seen in video after movie transfers is not. (Open water drove my nuts, mostly because cheap, progressive cameras are now available and I see no excuse not to care for one if you want to screen in the theater). Sorry this is my own little rant. I definitely recommend this movie if you were ever involved in the music scene, it has some tragic moments, but most of it is hilarious, I can be accused of laughing at another accident, but it's a classic piece.
