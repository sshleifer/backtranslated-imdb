Oh, I loved this movie. I think it had everything. It made me laugh aloud over a dozen times. Yes, I'm a girl, so I'm writing it from a girl's perspective. I think it's unfortunate that it only scored 5.2 points. Too many guys vote? It was far above other romantic comedies. Just because I'm a woman, I don't enjoy all the chic flicks, on the contrary, I prefer other genres. Romantic comedies tend to be level and not as funny as they intended. But as I said, this movie has everything, almost, in my opinion. Great writing, good one-liners, fine acting. Although Eva Longoria reminded Parker character of Gabrielle of Desperate Housewives, but so what? It was incredible. I'll keep this movie for rainy days, days when I feel low and need some laugh.
