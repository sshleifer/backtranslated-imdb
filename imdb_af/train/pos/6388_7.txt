Here's what I knew about Atlantis before I watched it: <br /> <br /> * It's officially Disney's first animated sci-fi adventure. I don't know how accurate it is (I like nitpick), but it made me aware for the first time when I described it. <br /> <br /> * - The preview looks mostly damn cool. It was apparently "too cryptic", according to some critics after the fact. <br /> <br /> * It did seem so bad that Disney said, "Screw it, let's release Spy Kids again". <br /> <br /> So, with all that was said, how is the movie? <br /> <br /> Hella-cool. <br /> <br /> I'm a sucker for animated fantasy that involves anyway stirring music and turbulent special effects, but "Atlantis" goes all out. It's a setback for all the CGI candy shots in "Beauty and the Beast" and "Aladdin", so much so that it's almost an effect animator's best-of-show. The characters may not be so memorable (except perhaps for the medical officer of the ship) and the plot is a bit dull, but it is not a movie you watch for the plot. <br /> <br /> Here is a controversy that is bothering me. The "failure" (as in, it has just "taken in", like five hundred million or something; I know animators who kill to see fifteen dollars) of this movie compared to the popularity of Shrek and "Monsters Inc." has been seen as evidence of the death of traditional animation. I don't think that's true. How do you count on the "South Park" movie? What about "Final Fantasy"? Really, the story and the artworks are all, not the method. I don't know what Disney's return movie will be, but I don't think they are still out of the picture.
