I love Kristen Dunst, especially in Elizabethtown. I think she's the kind of actress who shouldn't have acted better in front of the camera, but just be herself. She did it, and she looked so natural in Elizabethtown. In this movie, however, she tried to add more artificial performance, especially in the first half of the film, so she looked more like a sober editor. While holding herself in the other half in her daily job, I couldn't tell her to be an editor in any way. That's why her performance doesn't stay in this movie. <br /> <br /> The movie is generally enticing and inspiring. Young's character is full and reasonable. Anyway, the movie tells a great and sophisticated story. <br /> <br /> The only major flaw is that it has not shown a turning point in the hero and heroine's love story. I am completely confused when they kiss at the end of the story because it is quite unclear to the two people.
