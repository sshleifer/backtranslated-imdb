For someone who remembers Jane in the Daily Mirror cartoon, this is an exercise in nostalgia. In that context, it is wonderful, but younger viewers will undoubtedly unleash the comedy and will miss the point that the actors are cartoon characters. The plot line is also a bit slack for today's audience, but reflects the naivety of the 40's and 50's very well. Jane, you must remember, was part of the escapist fantasy of the war years, created to strengthen the morale of the troops. She had a double meaning for the strip in comic strip. <br /> <br /> The story has something in common with the stories of Edgar Rice Burroughs and Rider Haggard. The theme would have been a well-known reader in the era, a bunch of stupid Nazis who have been questioned by some English-speaking England, and of course in the African jungle. <br /> <br /> For Jane fans, a must see. For the rest of you, a damp squib <br /> <br />
