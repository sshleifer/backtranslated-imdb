WHITE FIRE was recommended to me by a man who owns it on two separate DVD releases and on VHS. He claims it is one of the funniest and coolest low budget action ever made. I don't usually watch movies because they know they're going to be bad, but I've made an exception to this one ... and I was very happy to have done so. <br /> <br /> It is filled to the edge. with action (much of it surprisingly, graphically gory), sleaze (isolated to nudity with an important female character, but so much of it in one scene that it becomes hilarious) and an excessive awkward dialogue, all at laughter - impressive tone of film. <br /> <br /> Ginty, the unusual searcher of THE EXTERMINATOR (and many other low-budget action tournaments), is amusing in the lead and gives the best performance he can get. Williamson is better than usual, with unparalleled joy (and he's only halfway through). The rest of the role play is also fun to watch, especially the villains. One of them is a sadistic sex paw that speaks to an accent that seems to be a mish-mash of Spanish and Italian. She is priceless. <br /> <br /> Again, I can't stress enough how good it was. It is not so bloody that it is uncomfortable, but it is unusually violent in parts, with some meatballs going in the shooting, and it has a terrible torture that nobody will soon forget. Even when Ginty is swamped by a bad guy, he easily gets a chain saw and the brilliant moments that follow will have any action fans who offend their beer. <br /> <br /> Don't miss WHAT FIRE. It's a movie - as sensible numbingly stupid - action classic.
