In 1948 it was my all-time favorite movie. Betty Grable's costumes were so surprising that I wanted to grow up to be her and so dress up. Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., was irresistible as the Hungarian official. Silly and fluffy, as this movie can only appear when I was eight, it was important to me to say something about the relationship between men and women. I saw it the other day again; I was surprised to find that it still did.
