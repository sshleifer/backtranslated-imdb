Let me make one thing clear. For the most part, the mentality of those running the show in Hollywood shows me in general, and even more specifically, the treatment of beloved, iconic characters from the comics pages. Why? Well, let's take a typical Hollywood board meeting scenario to illustrate, will we? .. <br /> <br /> Executive no. 1 "Hey, there are a lot of dollars today taken from superhero movie." <br /> <br /> Performing no.2 'Good point, let's hurry! ?? We'll do a lucky dive in a hat and randomly pick up a superhero to base a movie! '(The dip takes place and a well-known superhero name is pulled out) <br /> <br /> Executive no.1' Great! Now, who can we get the part? "<br /> <br /> Executive no.2" Who is a big boxing star now? " <br /> <br /> Executive no.1 "* Great actor name * is the thing this week." <br /> <br /> Executive no.2 "But does he really fit the role? I mean he doesn't look like the character." <br /> <br /> Executive No. 1 "Who cares? is a big name; anyway, we'll make the movie with him. '<br /> <br /> Executive # 2 "You're completely right! And besides, we fill the whole movie so beat full of glittering special effects to satisfy the moronic masses, that no one will ever question it! '<br /> <br /> The above scenario clearly illustrates one of the reasons I generally have ominous modern superhero movies. pathetic decisive of the iconic lead. Of course to be fair, there are exceptions to the above rule; when Hollywood gets it right, take the decisive of the original (and still easily the best!) Superman; Christopher Reeve and more recently Patrick Stewart and Sir Ian McKellen in the X-Men movies <br /> <br /> But back to the general negative feature What Hollywood showed today would not be great if our studio managers were ALWAYS choosing actors who really fit the roles? Well, in this less than ideal world, one movie maker believes it or not, by throwing actors based on their actual deal with their comic book counterparts. His name is Sandy Collora. Unfortunately, Hollywood has not allowed Collora to have a full length movie, but fortunately for us, he has given us seductive cans of what the ultimate outcome is probably in the form of two (so far) well-known super hero short features. One is the wonderful Batman: Dead End and the other is this mock trailer for a completely fictional movie called Worlds Finest. <br /> <br /> Let's not cut our words here? It's absolutely fantastic stuff! <br /> <br /> The casting of Mr. Universe winner and male model Michael O'Hearn (who looked incredible but was totally messed up in the dark-brown Barbarian), made the perfect choice to play the iconic steel man. In fact, in terms of physical conformity, there has undoubtedly never been a closer approach to the comic character. <br /> <br /> At this Clark Bartram is fresh from his beautiful portrayal of the Dark Knight in Batman: Dead ends; Again, another highly judicious piece of casting! <br /> <br /> What can I say? ?? If it were indeed a true full-length movie! Hollywood studio drivers ?? take notice! THIS is how it should be done! <br /> <br /> As a final note, I am once again dealing with the divided responses that this short film of fans have evoked. Incidentally, the most sharp and fiercely negative responses come from it (as with Batman: Dead End) of a younger, less kinematic experienced audience; betray a fact by their somewhat grammatical primitive rations and liberal use of basic diction. Such an unhappy state of closed mindset is indeed a sad phenomenon, though one that our prospective studio CEOs in Hollywood will undoubtedly find great satisfaction. After all, these very same wrong individuals are probably the exact same kind of CGI addict, uncomfortable popcorn, which in the majority of the shit that comes out in Hollywood is enjoying today.
