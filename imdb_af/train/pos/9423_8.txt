I can't say whether the British comedies produced after World War II are produced at Ealing Studios, are an acquired taste or not, but I'm totally addicted, and The Man in the White Suit is one of the best. No need to go into the familiar plot about the threat to both the textile industry and the textile unions by an indestructible dirt resistant fiber. Suffice it to say that the pendulum and arrows suffered by the naïve idealistic Sidney Stratton to pursue his police mission make for a comical delight. Many of the well-known faces from the world of British character actors - nervous Cecil Parker, southern fiancé Michael Gough, and the relentless relentless Ernest Thesinger - made wonderful appearances. Guinness - as always and forever - is fantastic, and Joan Greenwood loves Daphne (just as she calls the word "Daddy", makes the whole movie worth seeing.) <br /> <br /> " Knudsen !!! !!!! "
