This film, recently named as a public audience at the Palm Springs International Film Festival 2005, is inspiring and moving. A well-known conductor, forced to retire by illness, returns to the small town of his birth to become the leader of the church choir, eventually finding fulfillment in his music. Through Swedish attributes to keep things within yourself and the distinctive character of a small Swedish village, this film develops each of its characters well. beautifully directed, acted and sung, it brought tears to many eyes and smiled at everyone. Hopefully it will find distribution in the United States. <br /> <br /> If you can, see it!
