I nominate this and BABYLON 5 as the best TV series ever made. Both stand out in my mind because, unlike the early STAR TREK series, there is a consistent evolution of sites and characters. Looking at the original STAR TREK and STAR TREK: TNG, it was good show, but there was no overall theme or plot that all the episodes linked. In many ways, you can usually see the shows completely out of order without understanding what happens. It was less the case with DEEP SPACE 9 (with its huge battles that had already taken the final season) and the other TREK show, because there was more of a bigger story they united. This coherence seems to have evolved as a concept with BABYLON 5 and has seen it to a greater extent with SG-1. The bottom line is that this series was slowly evolving in many ways like a family or a long novel. Sure, there were a few "throw away" episodes that were not linked to the rest, but it was very few and far between and was usually pretty funny. <br /> <br /> Speaking of funny, I loved SG -1 keeping the mood light from time to time and wasn't so terribly serious. This way I actually enjoyed it more than BABYLON 5. Jack O'Neill was a great character with his sarcasm and love for Homer Simpson. It's really bad, he disappeared later in the seasons of the series. <br /> <br /> To really appreciate SG-1, you need to see it from the start and see how complicated the sites are. This cohesion gives the exceptional accommodation power. And if you don't like SG-1 after giving it a good chance, sci-fi is probably NOT the genre for you.
