Erich Rohmer's L'Anglaise et le duc makes a perfection companion for Peter Watkins' La Commune (Paris 1871). "Both films, shown at this year's Toronto International Film Festival, ironically illustrate how history is formed by storytellers. Ironic, given the tragic events that occurred during the US feast. <br /> <br /> In Paris during the French Revolution, the movie is based on Grace Elliott's (Lucy Russell) "Memoirs", a first-hand version of how she survived those heavy but dangerous days, and also describes her relationship with The Duke of Orleans (played by Jean-Claude Dreyfus), which, unlike herself, is a supporter of the Revolution. <br /> <br /> Where to form, you do not know whose side of history Rohmer is going to come down. Of the French "New Wave" filmmakers, Rohmer has often been criticized for being too conservative. In the midst of the rebellious youth Viet-Nam days of the late 60s and 70s, he has romantic pies such as "Claire's Knee" But don't sell the old boy short, he is always a student of human nature, not an ideologue, and 'L'Anglaise et le duc' still holds it out. <br /> <br /> Rohmer's characters are never the "bad guys" or the "good guys", they are primarily people who exhibit a full spectrum of human potential and limitations. That's why his movies are always challenging and this movie is no exception. <br /> <br /> Now for the technological nuts and bolts. <br /> <br /> Although Rohmer's 80s road is still at the forefront of film innovation. The look of "L'Anglaise" is like something you've never seen before. You guessed it, the old guy - like several of the festival's directors this year - went digital. <br /> <br /> All of the films' outward appearances seem to be in their original 1780-Paris settings. As a matter of fact, you may be so distracted by the wonder of the authenticity of the movie, look at me for a second show to catch the subtleties of the movie's psychologist - and yes, I'll say it - political insights. <br /> <br /> This year, Toronto features some of the world's most edgiest filmmakers, as well as the world's oldest. And the old masters are standing there on the slopes of the theater right next to the little ones. <br /> <br /> Long-lived youth. Long life age. And long live Erich Rohmer. <br /> <br />
