Yes, a real classic! This is what the British drama is about, realism and minimal use of special effects (and over inflated budgets). I recently saw this drama when it was last shown on British terrestrial TV in 1994. It must really be seen by anyone who likes a scary plot, not big names, but not-the-big, big acting. The copywrite is now in the possession of someone unknown and as such, this great drama is unlikely to be soon. I recently won The Woman In Black on VHS, and now I can enjoy this wonderful British drama again. You should also enjoy it! <br /> <br /> Mark R. Horobin
