The John Van Druten Broadway hit is brought to the screen with maximum strength in this romantic fantasy about a contemporary witch who defeats a successful Manhattan publisher. James Stewart can get the best bill, but it is Kim Novak who steals the show as one of the most seductive witches ever to cast a game on the movie screen. The main pairing is actually one of the movies' weaknesses: gray-haired Stewart looks a bit old for the role and although it's easy to see why he's getting tough for Novak, it's a little harder to understand what she's find him attractive, because it does not seem to match temperament and look. (This is one of the surprising thoughts of the story that witches and warlocks are portrayed as Greenwich Village beatniks and bohemians.) The Stewart-Novak mating will have generated significantly more heat in Vertigo, released the same year as that movie, but then Vertigo had a compelling tension story and the benefit of Alfred Hitchcock's direction. <br /> <br /> The movie's comic moments are mostly given the star supporting role, including a young Jack Lemmon, Elsa Lanchester (their aunt) and Ernie Kovacs (!) as a shocked writer. Hermione Gingold even shows in a hilarious cameo as a kind of Grand Hitch. There is a lot to enjoy in this movie - white, romance, and a good roll - that is, if you can possibly take your eyes off the enchanting Miss Novak. I saw the movie half a dozen times, and I can never.
