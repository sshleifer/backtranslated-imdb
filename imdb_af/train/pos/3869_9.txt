A few years ago I saw the movie at the Viennale, where the audience kept it. I also liked it, Summer Phoenix performance still haunts me, so I decided to comment. <br /> <br /> The story unfolds in London in 1900, where a Jewish girl decides to become an actress. She tries desperately to become one, but it is not until a man treats her badly that she realizes on stage that she has talent and that she connects with the audience and emerges as a stronger person. <br /> <br /> There were some reviews, where her performance was broken, accusing her of not being dull, and not being able to bring life into her character. I think it's her strong point, that's exactly what Esther Kahn must be and Phoenix makes a bold decision to make her Esther a little boring girl. So her transformation at the end is more powerful than it could be otherwise. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is wonderful, the images of London around the turn of the century are very dark and sad. You can see how unpleasant life was. <br /> <br /> The only mistake in my opinion is the length of the movie, you get rid of the characters. After all, it is only to find the actor in yourself, so there are no dramatic actions in the film. . It's Phoenix credit that we won't lose interest in the movie after the first hour.
