I saw Breaking Glass for the first time in 1980 and thought it would be one of the "Movie Classics". This film is a good look at the music industry with a large film of artists. It's a movie that has to be in the collection of everyone who wants to enter the music industry. I can't wait for it to be available on DVD.
