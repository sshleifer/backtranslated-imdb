If you didn't see this excellent 90's movie about life (in L.A.), you missed a special surprise. It is one of the most wonderful and powerful movies ever made for Americans in the 90's and it even carries on in the world we live in. It covers everything from raising a child, prejudice (more than one way), love, adultery, empty nasal syndrome, selfishness, etc. and the list goes on. This story builds to an ultimate climax and then, when nothing else matters, it always goes back to love with friends and family and love for life. It helps us dig deep into ourselves and make us search for what we want from life. Let us ask ourselves questions. Have we done enough to others, we are like this, etc. ??? Sit back and enjoy a wonderful and emotional movie that I am sure other people will enjoy for a lifetime. <br /> <br /> Take note of Mary Mcdonnell, Kevin Kline and Danny Glover's amazing show throughout this movie. These actors are incredible and truly show the true glow and meaning of what message is sent to us. This is 3 of my favorite actors for life after having seen this movie 10 years ago. I still enjoy it again. Also enjoy the amazing soundtrack and don't forget to count how many times you see the helicopter fly and try to figure out it's symbolic for the movie? Hmmm ... I almost forgot it's probably Steve Martin's very first serious acting role in any movie he ever did. He also does an excellent job in this movie. It may be a surprise for you. Sit back, relax and enjoy really good movie making .....
