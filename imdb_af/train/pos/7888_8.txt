Elm Street Return's dream character Freddy Krueger, the great character actor Robert Englund, is back in this sequel to the nightmare 5, dream child. I got the number correctly. There were so many, and this one is one of the best, especially for the cameos; Rosanne Barr (then Arnold) Tom Arnold, Johnny Depp (who had the very first nightmare in 84) Alice Cooper (Sanger). You will see Freddy as a tormented child, a teenager who loves pain and as a family man (creepy) the effects are very funny and creative. The movie also includes Lisa Zane (Billy's sister) Breckin Meyer (road ride) Yaphet Kotto (Alien, living and dying) and Amanda Donahue (dad knows best) one of the people who saw it in 3d, and the end . I love 3D movies. I missed the first 3d wave in 1953 (I wasn't even born). The second wave was in 1983. I love all the Freddy movies. This one stands out as one of the better ones not the first to be absolutely brilliant, Freddy has become the new monster of the 80's and 90's. With Jason Voorhees, Chucky, Micheal Myers and Leather Face. Can you suggest a movie with everyone? I recommend it to all Freddy fans and horror fans alike. this is Freddy such a cut up.8 out of 10.
