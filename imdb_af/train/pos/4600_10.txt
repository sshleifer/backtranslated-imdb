It is sad this movie is the top, it should be at least in the top 250 movies here. It's still the best action movie ever done. The action movies of today are badly done. The actors and action directors don't know how to fix and fight it. just a few how to do it mainly from Hong Kong like Jackie Chan. The stunts are so clever and wild, I don't think we'll see the people as ever. The start where Chan and his team take the hill car through the mountain village is just amazing. The end battle stunts is for me the best battle stunts ever in the movie. The terminus that slides the poles sliding through the glass of Jacky is severely hurt.
