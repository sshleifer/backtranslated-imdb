No movies caught my attention like this one has. You see, I've seen this movie again for more than twenty-five years. The one and only time I saw was as a teenager who was the year it was released, 1977. <br /> <br /> What I remember about the movie is that it touches the deepest emotions has. so deep that there is still an overwhelming desire to look at it again. The plot that this movie provides through the human element of father / son seeking and searching is sure to touch every human soul who sees it. Why this movie has not been brought out of storage and as often as many other films deeper in depth are shown, I do not know. <br /> <br /> Postscript: Receipt of movie and after watching it again, was delighted to see my memory was true. Grading reflects film content. Would like to watch this movie on DVD, as this production took off in 1977 on a used VHS tape of the overall quality.
