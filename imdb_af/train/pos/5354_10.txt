Why didn't Dynamo have any pants? Where did they go? It has never been explained. That's why this movie was so wonderful. Plus Starsky has given his children the AIDS !! Great acting too. Richard Dawson deserves the best supporting actor! A I D S My favorite line from the movie was "It hit the spot" A I D S. This movie was for "birds". I tried to give this movie the "stinkeye", but it continued. What am I doing wrong? !!!! I thought the "HATEBOAT" was funnnny lol;) I'd like it for a show. Why wasn't Dynamo a pants? I know his arm was skewered but ... What goes on with the crazy futurnette. Why didn't that family error, Ray Combs, get a net? He could have used one. AIDSSSSS
