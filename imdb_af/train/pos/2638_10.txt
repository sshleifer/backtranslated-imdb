One of the best movies for all ages. You will never be able to watch LION KING again without thinking about the extra history this movie adds. Almost 40 years old, I went to work with my wife and two boys tonight and I didn't laugh and have enjoyed a movie long ago. <br /> <br /> Take time out and watch it with the kids. . It will remind you how Disney was when you were a young man.
