I was very impressed with this movie. I will have to judge it as one of the better classic era westerns. I say this for the whole thing: the acting, adult dialogue, no-nonsense story and excellent cinematography. <br /> <br /> Director Anthony Mann, who did several well-photographed film strings at the same time, also has some westerns like this one. It looked the same movie noir. Mann and Jimmy Stewart worked on various Westerns during this period. . If you like this movie, I recommend the Mann-Stewart movie "Bend Of The River." <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, the story of a man, Lin McAdam, (Stewart) coveted Winchester 73 rifle, a weapon he won fair and square in a game. It is then stolen and transferred from villain to villain. All these villains are interesting characters. <br /> <br /> Stewart helps this interesting story: Shelley Winters, Dan Duryea, Stephen McNally, Millard Mitchell, Charles Drake, Will Greer and J. C. Flippen. All of them are fun to watch. However, it was a piece to see that Rock Hudson is playing an Indian player ("Young Bull"), but you can't have everything.
