I loved this movie. It's hard to get a glimpse of post-partum Vietnam, and this movie-sensing and exciting bombs and gunfire did it. I had no idea that I would be affected by it. What a wonderful look at how stranger feels. It was hard to watch, honestly. We all understand the battle and the Apocalypse Now-type drama, but it's so different. What happens when they come back and try to live a life? They can't. This made me very aware of a large group of men who were lost in America. Unable to relate, cannot sleep, cannot have love affairs, cannot deal with "normal society". They feel completely apart. This is a great tragedy and one that is not addressed enough. Yes, we changed our attitude to Vietnam veterinarians, we are keeping them now, but what? It doesn't seem to be different to them. It's too late? So it was a good movie, but I cried a lot. I have no other criticism.
