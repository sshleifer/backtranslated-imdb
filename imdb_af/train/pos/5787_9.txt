Many of these are dated in this episode (like most Twilight Zone episodes), such as the Woman's incredibly sexist military "uniform". And some things are so incredible, like the easy availability of clean water. Still, consider the year it was made and the time, and you soon understand why this episode is as special as you look. It has a good sense of hope, something missing from many Twilight Zones, as well as an interesting female character (despite the fact that she rarely speaks), something else rare on the Twilight Zone. "Two" is a good example of how the Twilight Zone in more than 20 minutes can tackle more emotion and drama than most two-hour movies today. And it's great to see two people who became American icons in their careers early on.
