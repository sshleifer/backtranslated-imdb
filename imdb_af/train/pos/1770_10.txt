In the previews, "The 40 Year Old Virgin" boasts the image of another immature sex skirt over a 40-year-old lonely man who suddenly feels the urge to do it simply because he doesn't have it. Too many previous bad experiences have dampened his enthusiasm to the point that he completely avoided women. And then the unexpected happens: he falls in love. In addition, there is a movie about it, and it is called the 40-year-old Virgin. <br /> <br /> The virgin of the title is Andy Stitzer (Steve Carell), who is indeed 40, works as an employee at an electronic store and collects vintage action figures, all of which show off his beautiful bachelor path be for everyone to see. He has a beautiful home theater system and looks at Survivor with his two cute neighbors. He is a pretty picturesque definition of the lonely guy who has to go out and talk to more women. <br /> <br /> Now is the real novelty of this photo: it is the impossible task to actually deal with its subject. in a cute, mature way. It's a movie that can easily be turned into the hands of a more transparent team of filmmakers. It could have descended into endless sex holes and jokes, but grateful, this photo is never so low. Certainly, there are sex and jokes here and there, and even a few prods are aimed at the gay community (which in no way should be regarded as gay bashing), as two of the characters exchange insults against each other while a video game ("Mortal Kombat: Deception," no less - the ultimate testosterone-driven versatility for guys). <br /> <br /> As someone approaching fast 20, McFarlane collects Toys action figures and he never did the act himself, I found this movie amusingly and in a way that a similar theme movie could never have been do not have. I could relate the character of Andy Stitzer more than anyone in the theater, because I was the only teenager present at this show; everybody seemed to be over the last 40 years. A bit arrogant, I know, but would you ("you" be italics) still be able to relate if you were the only teenager at an afternoon guard of the 40-year-old Virgin "? <br /> < Of course, Andy has never had sex and woke up every day with a morning rise, and he is asked by his friends to do extraordinary methods for the attention of the opposite sex. Andy, a virgin, about 40, initially gay his three friends and co-electronics colleagues David (Paul Rudd), Jay (Romany Malco) and Cal (Seth Rogen) because he had never been to a woman., The truth is, Andy loves women, but past traumatic experiences (which are hilariously one after the other in a play-back sequence) have brought him well. > <br /> David, Jay and Cal each start a mission to get Andy, help them all, but you know that they just escaped will end in a disaster, as one day proved to Nicky (Leslie Mann), who experienced Andy through the worst drunken driving experience. I think anyone doesn't want to go through and he has a rather awful encounter. with Beth (Elizabeth Banks), the beautiful girl working in the bookshop and eventually revealed to be a total sex enemy. <br /> <br /> Things decorated for Andy when he meets Trish (Catherine Keener), the friendly woman who works at a store across the street who sells things on eBay for people. Hmmm. And with that beautiful set of action figures, you can figure out what is ultimately a huge financial expense on him, that is if he can ever do the act. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, this is the sex skirt we were waiting for. It's about a very real problem. Many of the lonely guys are probably going through, and nothing is wrong to be a virgin, but let's look at the big picture: How many of us, "Lonely Guys," want to be a lonely man forever? The important thing we've learned in this picture is that Lonely Guy has to be himself. I don't think he has to go through the body as Andy does (it is his adornment to be honest, and according to this site and various other news reports, it really was, and so was the blood on Carell's shirt afterwards). <br /> <br /> "The 40-year-old virgin" was regulated by Judd Apatow and written by himself and Carell, which arose as a shit that provoked Carell. Carell is sweet and human, as his character is not a leak that approaches this thing with his eyes. It is probably one of the most intelligent bodies I have ever seen and is not offensive because its characters are treated with dignity and respect. Even Carell's friends, who give bad advice to cover their own relationship uncertainties, can be fundamentally related. <br /> <br /> The way the 40-year-old Virgin plays is indeed funny in The End, but I'll show it to you, the viewer. Certainly, if anyone goes through the things Andy does and still has the power to attract a woman as sexy as Catherine Keener, it's true: it's never too late! <br /> <br /> 10/10
