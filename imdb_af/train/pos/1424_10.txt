Rather annoying that reviewers are comparing it to Planet Earth ... From * Course * Planet Earth is better - it has much more of the same. The Earth is like an extended trailer for the Planet Earth series, and as such it is inevitably inferior and simplified. But it does not compare to that. <br /> <br /> As a document-length documentary (or actually a little something), it pretty much surpasses everything you'll see throughout your life (unless you choose the Earth in long-range helicopters for years) complete, and wait for months in the most extreme environments to get a glimpse of the extraordinary creatures on earth, who cannot see it.) <br /> About the story: yes everyone in the United Kingdom - many of me include - adoring David Attenborough, and there is little excuse for him not to tell here, but it hardly earns a star or three. He was not a presenter on Planet Earth, just a narrator, and I'm sure he's modest and gracious enough to realize that anything more viewers get into is a good thing. <br /> <br /> Anyone who sees it will be overwhelmed by his awe, majesty and glory. All reviewers agree. Those who love it (ie everyone) will / must continue to buy a Planet Earth. So three cheers for his movie release, and a big boooo for anyone cheap enough to buy it on DVD rather than the Planet Earth set. But as artworks they are not in competition here. <br /> <br /> The Earth is big enough for both.
