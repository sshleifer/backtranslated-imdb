I couldn't wait to get my hands on this one when I read about Fred Astaire working with George Burns & Gracie Allen in a movie with a screenplay of P.G. Wodehouse and music by the Gershwins. It's definitely worth seeing, but the coherent quality of the Fred & Ginger movies. <br /> <br /> The story will probably be better to read in a Wodehouse book, where humor is better. The acting is quite painful to watch (especially the young boy and the daughter). <br /> <br /> But ...! The funhouse dance is worth more than most movies. I never knew Gracie Allen could dance, but boy did she in this movie. Have you ever tried to stay on one of those latches? Imagine tap dance on one in high heels! She loves Astaire and adds greatly to the overall quality of the picture. <br /> <br /> Several nice songs, especially fun, are great work if you can get it and a tight upper lip. <br /> <br /> Recommended for fans of Astaire, Burns & Allen. I had to go back and watch the funhouse dance once the credits rolled.
