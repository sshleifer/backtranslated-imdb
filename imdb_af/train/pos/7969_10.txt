Homeward Bound is a beautiful movie. You know the part where shade falls into the ditch ... thing, I cried *, since I was only six, I cried! It takes a lot to make me cry! The dogs and the cat are excellently trained. A lovely family movie, * not * for completely hardened non-fluffy people or animal hats, but can be used for soft-as-crap. people like me. <br /> <br /> A good movie overall, 10/10!
