Boris and Bela do well in this movie, whether they are together or riding the same boat. I saw this one in 1972, and just bought it from Borders this year. This time I watched with my children, I noticed 2 things: This was the attention of a 3, 4 and 5 year old; and I caught a few things I didn't have when I first looked at it. Very quick story with an unpredictable end. A must for movie buffs !!!
