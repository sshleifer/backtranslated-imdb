I must say, looking at Hamlet from a student's perspective, Brannagh's version of Hamlet is by far the best. His dedication to remain true to the original text must be bothered. It helps the play on the screen, and makes it easier for people who keep the text as they watch, as we did, to follow and analyze the text. <br /> <br /> One of the things I've heard has been criticized many times by the decisive big Hollywood names in the play. I find it helps viewers to recognize the characters more easily, rather than having actors who all look and sound the same, helping in the confusion normally associated with Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> Also, she helps flash many people to clear up ambiguities in the text. Like how far the relationship between Hamlet and Ophelia really went and why Fortinbras was just at the castle. All in all, this version not only features brilliant performances by actors who are both familiar and not familiar with Shakespeare. It is presented in a way that one should not be an English Literature Ph.D to understand and enjoy it.
