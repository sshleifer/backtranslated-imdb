In my opinion, my left foot is a great biopsy about one of the world's most talented writers and painters. The performances were crushing, the soundtrack was great and the casting was perfect. I thought Christy (Daniel Day-Lewis) was a very talented man, although I couldn't understand what he said most of the time. In addition, when he threw a tantrum, I became a little scared. Also, it's just as sad that he suffers from cerebral palsy. Finally, if you are the hard-going fan of Daniel Day-Lewis or biopics, I recommend this great biopsy to one of the world's most talented writers and painters. You're in for a good surprise and a good time, don't miss this one.
