For a low budget movie, it was really good. I put it well above your average action B movie. Sean and Corinne delivered in this movie and they didn't give a camera. Watch out for the comedy of Jeanne and Jared. I didn't think the producers would even consider it, but the runners-up deserved so much. <br /> <br /> I'm looking forward to more of Sean and Corinne's involvement in the movie entertainment industry. Sean's character was very sincere, and sexy Corinne's character was quite stubborn and up to date. She linked well to the action sequences and performed confidently. It was a good idea to throw Billy Zane as the smart and witty villain. His charisma on the screen is always a pleasure to watch. The chemistry between Zane and Sean's character was pretty good. The action sequences were not cheesy and apparently linked through the entire movie. Of course there were errors, but it comes with the area. <br /> Overall, this was a good movie in light of the budget and the fact that it was made for TV. Sean and Corinne did a good job because they were newcomers to the game. I hope Jeanne, Jared and the rest of the Next Action Star cast get their chance to engage their fellow stars in entertainment as well. <br /> <br /> Final Judgment: *** / ****
