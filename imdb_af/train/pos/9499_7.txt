A boy and a girl are being pursued by a local warrior because the boy (by accident) killed the warrior father (or anyone he is). And they travel through the nature of Africa's most ruffled areas. <br /> <br /> The acting in this movie is not as good (except that elephant child). But it's a very good adventure and it's not much censored, there is blood, flesh and nudity (which eases the movie a bit). <br /> <br /> I give this movie a 7 because of the image of African nature and it's action.
