What can I say, I grew up to watch Hum Saath Saath Hain, Hum Aapke Hain Koun and Maine Pyar Kiya. Soraj has always been different. Movies are part of our lives in evolutionary times. Soraj creates something difficult to find. Love and joint family that are loving and wonderful. Vivah is a trip for a couple who makes arrangements to arrange and love the marriage. Shahid did good work. Anupamji as always brilliant. Amrita Rao looks different, though I feel the others don't fit me in that role. We saw her in Ishk Vishk and Ab ke baras, and Main ho on Na. So keep the other role she doesn't. She was excellent in Main Ho on Na and ishk vishk, but she might have put more in the role. Anyways great going to work by Barjatya. This movie rejuvenates the values ​​we have forgotten. Sweet movie of the year. Great music and lyrics. I'm not sure it's a remake, but a somewhat brilliant story that is original. Soraj's movies are quite clear, so we always expect something different from him. Great work by all the crew members and everyone. Beautiful family movie to enjoy with your parents, brothers and sisters, friends and loved ones. I give it 10 out of 10.
