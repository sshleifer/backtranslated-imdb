** Warning! Mild Spoilers Forward! ** <br /> <br /> (Yes, I realize it's hard to spoil a historical documentary, but I reveal some of the background and methods.) <br /> <br /> It's an exceptional documentary not only because of the remarkable footage, but also because of the story behind it. Because the Naudets did not exhibit to tell the story of 9/11, but rather of a firefighter, the men's emotions and the viewer's connection with them is more real and powerful than they would in a standard retrospective. be. <br /> <br /> In a movie sense, "9/11" is a textbook. If the events were a real script, it would be great, as the characters were established, then threw a curve to respond to. This is all the more wonderful considering the pain and emotion of the raw footage that the directors had to go through to put this story together. <br /> <br /> The first part of the movie looks at life within a fire station; specifically how a newcomer assimilates him into a veteran crew. The part alone is pretty good, and if the documentary is allowed to run its intended course, it would probably have been solid. The brothers seem to be realizing the process of becoming a NYC firefighter. <br /> <br /> Of course, hell breaks loose. The chaos that follows the attacks of the WTC is clearly seen, as several characters we've got hit in the frightening situations. Not only seeing the attacks, but also the first-hand reactions is a very moving picture of extreme human emotion. <br /> <br /> The aftermath, in which firefighters are discovered to be lost and found, is human drama at its peak. Life and death depend on the balance. Unlike many movies, the viewer knows not only who will live and die, but really cares for them. <br /> <br /> The only negative thing I have to say about this is that the Robert DeNiro (what I want) was blurbs uninformative, unnecessary, and not the story at all. They were probably added just to attract more TV viewers. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: The best documentary I've ever seen. Nonpareil depictions of raw human emotion and drama. 9.5 out of 10.
