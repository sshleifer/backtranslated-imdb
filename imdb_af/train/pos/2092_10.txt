I watched this movie with some curiosity. I wanted to see if 1) Paul Muni could play Chinese and 2) Luise Rainer earned her Oscar. I got away from the movies that YES think! After seeing Muni in just one movie where he was quite hammy, I expected the same kind of performance. Luckily I was proved wrong. Although some might criticize him as being too childish and stereotypically simple in the Hollywood idea of ​​Asians, I thought he was just right in the role. Keye Luke, if he had the chance to play a leading role, could have played the same way. <br /> <br /> I was particularly impressed by the camera work and the use of crowd scenes, especially during the resignation of the palace where O-Lan was once a slave. The graphic and grim atmosphere of the fire squad and the drought made it an epic, very different from others of the same time, where it was luster and shimmer. I watched this movie from start to finish. I can't say the same for the epics of today.
