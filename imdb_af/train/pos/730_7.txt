I love this movie I remember there was a very well done scene in this movie where Riff Randell (played by PJ Soles) lies in her bed smoking pot and then she starts visualizing that the Ramones are in the room with her singing the song "I want you around" ... very cool things. <br /> <br /> It was fun, energetic, quirky and cool. Yes, I will admit that the end is over and over ... but it doesn't matter because it's fun it's a very fun movie. It's sex, pot and rock n Rocll forever <br /> <br /> I read that Cheap Trick was the band originally in this star. But I don't know if it's true or not
