Although we know how the story ends, it's a gripping movie on the wall that plays almost like a political excitement. During the calm before the storm, we meet Hugo Chavez as a charismatic, larger than life-mate who has an unbreakable bond with the mestos that make up 80% of the population, but previously excluded from Venezuela's political process and its oil wealth . He looks as dedicated to them as they are to him. He travels the country at a fast pace, reaches out to the camps, reaches out to large crowds, nods and kisses ordinary people, accepts letters on paper trays, and hears pleadings for help. People are excited that one of their numbers made it to the highest office in the country. There is an electric sense of hope and optimism that changes for the better, coming to the festering barrios. <br /> <br /> But not everyone is happy with the situation. The pure-blooded Castillian Spaniard elite who are a small minority but have previously controlled all the wealth is full of bitterness and resentment. One of the most unintentional hilarious moments in the film is when an Ann Coulter lookalike complains to a resident meeting in an exclusive gated community about the mesto's, "they have no concept of battle or sacrifice." Minutes later, a speaker told the meeting to "beware of your housekeepers - they could be Chavez supporters." Duh! Of course they are. <br /> <br /> In a late-night interview with film staff, Chavez reveals something about his soul, as he tells the story of his grandfather. He can be a sensitive, poetic person, though with a fearless, even a little, sense of humor (as we saw when addressing the UN and Bush calling the devil.) <br /> <br /> start the storm gathering force as coup organizers call a mass protest and manipulate their supporters cynically to change the route at the last minute and march on the presidential palace. It is surrounded by Chavez supporters and violence is inevitable. <br /> <br /> Another element of the plot falls in place as snipers on roofs burn on the Chavez supporters, some of whom flee back. Fox News's local equivalent shows this return fire and claims that Chavez supporters are defeating the protesters. Then the camera pulls back and reveals that there are no protesters - the street is empty! The protesters took another route. Needless to say the footage of the empty street was worked out by the witches anti-Chavez private TV stations (which broadcast a constant propaganda propaganda that Chavez spiritually sick and sexually fixed on Fidel Castro broadcast.) Immediately after the coup we the authors and their media propaganda masters openly watched on television how they manipulated the situation with reckless negligence for the lives of supporters and opponents. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers remain at the heart of this chaotic, rapidly changing situation as the military coup surrounds the palace and threatens to bomb it. Chavez finally gives up to avoid bloodshed, but refuses to resign and is beaten to a foreign island where a plane is waiting to take him - where? The USA? How can the remaining cabinet members avoid and seize this heavily armed conspiracy of right-wing generals and extremely wealthy businessmen closely linked to the Bush administration? Watch the movie and find out! <br /> <br /> As your only knowledge of Hugo Chavez and Venezuela from the US media, you know nothing. He is not an "untrue tyrant" and does not rule by decision. He is very popular and has been elected and re-elected several times with more than 60% of votes (something George Bush Junior has never achieved) and the dedication he inspires in ordinary Venezuelan people is ultimately the reason why the coup fails. <br /> <br /> It's an extraordinary movie about an extraordinary man in an extraordinary situation. The skill of the filmmakers is inconspicuous, and the story unfolds through the voices of Venezuelans on every level of the barrio to the presidential palace, the turbulent scenes, the chaos and confusion that a coherent whole emerges that is tense. and move. Not to be missed!
