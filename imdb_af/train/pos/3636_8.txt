It's a good movie, about one person's dreams and the ride or pressure to realize it. It's a beautiful and inspiring movie. Why do some people have to find fault with every movie that comes out, especially the stuff. Dennis Quaid gives a good solid performance in this true story of Jim Morris, a science teacher and high school baseball coach who is pushed by his team to take another shot at a professional baseball career. With the excellent supporting role, including Brian Cox, as the crusty, former naval officer who left so much of his son's achievements without his support. It was good to see him as something other than a villain in a movie. If I have one complaint to this movie, it is the following: Never ever sign Royce Applegate again the national anthem. <br /> <br /> In general, this movie belongs to those handful of great baseball movies like "Field of Dreams" and "The Natural." It counts two inches and a big "well done."
