Following a sitcom plot, it is so indifferent that the fact that her character works simultaneously both within and without context, remains the rest of the cast, the kind of experimentalism that sitcoms can really use. The supporting characters mounted the performance in a sitcom reality that offers a contextual counterpart to Sarah's erratic persona who, apart from general insensitivity, has no specific repetitive characteristics of behavioral expectations, makes her less a character than a canvas in every episode if not scene. Sara's ability to see everything from an out of perspective enables her to parody aspects of social behavior that are subtle enough to usually be unnoticed. Every time she speaks, it's like a standalone 5 seconds. She dominates a lot, shows the many things that can make a smile or change in voice height, but never with one idea long enough to make you comfortable and satisfy expectations. It can be the most creative, original and experimental TV show ever.
