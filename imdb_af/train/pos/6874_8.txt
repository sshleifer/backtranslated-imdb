A series of vignettes, most of them 1970's spoofing television, but also with some digs at government and corporate America. One of the longest segments, "The Dealers," is not so funny to me and I do not know what it is parodying. However, some of the others are completely divided. I especially enjoy the cooking program. Most of the dirty words I know are used in the movie, and if you object to the full rapture, stay away.
