As the first of the TV shows is presented on the expanded box, "Barbra Streisand: The Television Specials", released last November, is being released for those who do not want to pay for all five special offers on the dollar. As an investment, it is indeed the best of the bunch, just because it is Streisand in its purest and most eager way to impress. Being so brilliant is an important component of her legend. Taking a long-term contract with CBS to deliver hours-long variety shows, an almost extinct format these days, Streisand was 22 in this CBS special first broadcast in April 1965. At that stage of her career, her fame was limited to a handful Best-selling albums, some brilliant TV shows on variety and talk shows, and her successful Broadway races in 'Funny Girl'. <br /> <br /> In black and white copied, the program is divided into three separate parts. With the creative transition use of "I'm late" from Disney's "Alice in Wonderland", the first segment shows her clever childhood by numbers as much as "Make Believe" and "I'm Five". The second part moves with a comic monologue about Pearl from Istanbul. The second part moves to Manhattan's upscale Bergdorf Goodman, where she is elegantly bought in a range of glamorous outfits while singing the songs of the Depression era like "I had a lot of Nuthin". "The best things in life are free" with comic irony. Back to basics, the third segment is a straight concert that includes a torch version of "When the Sun Comes Out", includes a "Funny Girl" medley and ends with her classic, melancholic start. "Happy Days Are Lord Again" about the end credits. Also included is the brief introduction she signed in 1986 when the special first was issued on VHS. For those who only know Streisand for her expensive concert tickets and political fundraising, this is a real caretaker in why she is so respectful.
