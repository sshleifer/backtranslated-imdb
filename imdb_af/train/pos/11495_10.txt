We saw it at one of the local art movie theaters in the Montrose area of ​​Houston, TX. This was a total surprise compared to the writing in the theater's newsletter, but we were both blown away by the artworks. It was beautifully done and (apparently) photographed in the Munich area in a blast (German name for Chateau). It is a very explicit exploration of the sexual relations of a group of twenty men and women who are off the daily limit. It's fantastic on more levels than I can remember. We came to the movie home and talked until 4:00 the next morning until 4:00. <br /> <br /> The version we saw was in English (mostly). There must be at least two versions since the first reviewer (probably the original) German version. I searched and searched for a videotape version, but never showed up. Would love to have a VHS or DVD version of this one. It explores relationships at a fundamental level and is also a good tutorial on how to relate to your partner. If someone knows the author / director, please convince him to release again, preferably on DVD these days. I can't even imagine being tired of watching the sincere performance of the actors, who are probably all in their forties. Please, please bring it back.
