At the scene in NYC in the late 80's / early 90's, I personally can say it is one of the most important documentaries covered over this period of time. No Madonna came up with the idea of ​​Voguing, but that's where she came from! Instead of exerting violence on each other, or in fiendish cat fights, people allowed to "fight" within the confines of everything that didn't touch each other (which would justify an automatic disqualification). To see this kind of extremely talented / well-orchestrated "throw-downs" in the clubs was nothing short of spectacular and all the big names of the day are here ... Pepper La Beija, Paris Duprée, Xtragavaganza, etc. .. everyone remembers in such periods as Malcom McLaren's song Deep in Vogue. It doesn't matter who you were or where you came from, because sorting through the doors of this "magical kingdom" has become something bigger than yourself / you were important / and most importantly creating your own. movements and imagination ... and anyone from anywhere could become King (or Queen), as the case may be. The words and whites were just as sharp as the moves on the floor. All the excitement, excitement and magic of the very urban NYC energy is captured in this film. BRILLIANT !!! PLEASE READ DVD for the world to see !!! Thank you!
