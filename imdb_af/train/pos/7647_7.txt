Okay, so it borrows a bit from "It's a Wonderful Life," but it was 44 years before this movie, so why not try again. Belushi has a rotten 35th birthday. He didn't get his Wheaties, his coffee and lost his job. The capper is when she herself describes "big blue piece of the sh **" car breaking at the end of the day. He heads into an empty bar to ask for a tow. While waiting, he was recognized by the bartender (Caine) as the child who lost the town's championship ball game 20 years earlier. It made him think how life would have been if he won the game. He finds out when Caine serves a motion in a glass that gives him a home, the prom queen (Russo) as his wife, and makes him president of the sports operating company of which he is concentrated. Caine reveals himself later as the one responsible for this change, but Belushi isn't quite on board. He never fully adapted, and in a plot development that didn't kill the movie, but still strange, he tried his wife (Hamilton) from his real life judiciary, now married to someone else. The good step is that they don't spend too much time on it, as they actually rip a "Ghost" while Belushi always tells Hamilton things she just knew. It also features a hokey-dramatic element, such as two of his lovers kevetch in the shadows, new wife Russo, and his unbalanced lover Cox. But the keys to the movie are the rather long start and cheerful ending. Also good work from the big and recognizable cast, like Belushi is very nice, very attractive ladies selected, and Caine is quite easy to go than the title man. Strange that it was Belushi's second movie of 1990 that gets him an alternative lifestyle of wealth, found in 'Care of Business'. Although similar, both films are on the same level of believers. So it goes for a fun exploration of "what if?"
