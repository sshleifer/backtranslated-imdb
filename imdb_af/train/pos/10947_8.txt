The Sarah Silverman program looks much like Sarah's own action; It's so up front, with the bias that you can't take it to heart. The fact is, though, most people will "get it," it doesn't mean that everyone will appreciate it. It is a very polarizing and one-dimensional display, so if you don't like it after 10 minutes, you can also give it up. If you like it after 10 minutes, keep quiet because every episode has been as good as the last. Like all shows, however, it's not perfect. Personally, I like the program, but there are some big mistakes with it. Racist songs are funny, but sooner than Silverman seems to realize - a problem I had with "Jesus is Magic." Silverman seems to have given a quota for songs per episode that doesn't need it. Not to mention that while the lyrics to the songs she writes are good, the music is, well, not. <br /> <br /> Another thing to keep in mind is that while this show is for some reason calling on fans of Monty Python, sincere citizen brigade, etc., it's nothing like those shows don't. I can watch Monty Python all day, but I can't watch more than half an hour at a time. It gets flat very quickly. The repetition value for this show is also too low - the second time around an episode is pretty funny, and for the third time it's, in my opinion, boring. <br /> <br /> However, that first time is very, very funny. Give it a shot.
