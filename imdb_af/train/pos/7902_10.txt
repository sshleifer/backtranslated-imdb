The film is extraordinary in gay iconography and extends beyond aesthetics to music and film. Throughout the film there is a childlike wonder as seen through the eyes of the main character. Her sadness takes the world around us is comic and beautiful. In a way, it's a girls' slacker movie. Watch here you are a relaxing, entertaining mid-night movie. Buy it if you want to, take the world of media and love together (?).
