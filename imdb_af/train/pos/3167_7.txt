It is one of those films exploring the cultural clash of Eastern born people in Western cultures. <br /> <br /> Lovers of Tokyo Time are a sad film about the inability of opposition to pull because of great cultural differences. Ken, rock n'roll fanatic, marries Kyoto, a Japanese girl, so she can stay in the United States when her visa expires. Marriage is expected to be temporary, that is, until Kyoto returns to legal status. But, Ken, who gets lost in every relationship, loves Kyoto and is trying very hard to work things out. This, in spite of his friend's urgent need to release Kyoto and to get rid of all obligations to girls, is bad for rock n'roll, except to write some songs on broken hearts and everything. <br /> <br /> But Kyoto comes from a strict traditional Japanese education, and doesn't expect to marry Ken for so long. Not only that, she is homesick and wants to return to Japan. It is sad because it is ultimately someone who Ken thinks he can love and be with everything, except the one time he thinks he has found someone to feel like that, the girl doesn't expect so long. It's not that she doesn't like Ken, it's just that she's used to a clear way of life. She says, "I can't tell him how I feel English, and Ken can't tell me how he feels in Japanese." It's a rather sad love story with a killer 80's techno-nintendo soundtrack. <br /> <br /> I picked myself up to love Tokyo Time, as it reminded me of one of my favorite 80 movies, Tokyo Pop. And for those of you who loved Tokyo time, look at Tokyo Pop (a New York singer goes to Japan and joins a Japanese American cover band), except it is a movie with a happy ending. <br /> <br />
