This is a cute little horror spoof / comedy with Cassandra Peterson aka Elvira: Mistress of the Dark, the most notorious horror host of all time. It was the intention to be the pilot vehicle for Elvira and was so successful that it was taken up by the NBC network. They filmed a pilot for a television series to play the busty babe in black, but unfortunately the sit-com never made it past the pilot stage because of his sexual references. However, this movie is very amusing. Elvira is the contemporary Chesty Morgan and the queen of the one-liners. This film was followed a few years later by the mutilated Elvira's Haunted Hills, which was meant to be a decline of the old Roger Corman movies, but fell flat on his face. Watch this movie instead of a much more entertaining experience!
