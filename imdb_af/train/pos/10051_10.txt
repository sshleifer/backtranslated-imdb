Family problems abound in real life and that is what this movie is about. Love can keep the members together through the trials and trials and that is what this movie is about. One man, Dad, has the maturity and courage to keep the family in the face of adversity. The children grow up, everyone is difficult to realize that, no matter how old or older they are, the parent still loves their children and is willing to give them a pillow when they fall. All the actors depicting their characters had excellent achievements. Yes, I had a tear down the road because I had similar experiences, as well as a young adult and later as a parent. This truth in life is one that every young adult and older person will be able to see, although some will not realize it until they are also parents. A must see for those who care for their families.
