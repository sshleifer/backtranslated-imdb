One of the best movie dramas I've ever seen. We do a lot in church and this is one that can be used as a resource that emphasizes all the good things actors can do in their work. I recommend this one, especially for those interested in acting, as a "must see". There are several scenes of notes. For one, the cemetery where Hamlet meets Yorick (everyone knows the scene by just going to school), and his interaction with the skull was extremely well done. The logic used in this scene was great - I suppose Shakespeare's will is more than anything else. For a moment I really enjoyed the scene where Hamlet, Horatio and the character Robin Williams played the upcoming duel.
