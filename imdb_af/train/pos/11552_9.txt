Here's another movie that doesn't really need much of a recommendation. This is a classic comedy, very funny and entertaining and that of course inspired a successful television series, which many would say was even better (I also enjoy it personally). <br /> <br /> For some it is difficult to warm up Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau as Felix Unger and Oscar Madison when they were weaned on the TV show with Tony Randall and Jack Klugman (or vice versa). But what we have in both cases is four good actors who, in real life, looked so much like their movie counterparts that they could make these attributes their own. It is Neil Simon's humorous material that is the key and where the laugh really comes from. <br /> <br /> For those who have somehow never heard of THE OLD COUPLE, it is the story of a neurotic and offensive neat freak (Lemmon) by his long-suffering wife of a 12-year-old wedding is poured out and living in the Manhattan apartment of his messy and totally irresponsible friend (Matthau). Combining these two unlikely housemates together within the same four walls makes for many difficult predictions.
