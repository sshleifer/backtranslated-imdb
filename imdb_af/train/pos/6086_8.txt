I saw this movie a year ago and found it to be quite Laugh-Out-Loud funny. A true winner, in my mind. It underlined the experience of a stupid comedy, but also had a real plot. Much like the hit comedy, Elf, in fact. It had some serious moments. When Stiller shot Black's horse, it was an ordinary sober moment, and you found yourself laughing at his bumbling antique. You can actually find common ground there because I'm sure many people have done something they don't want a friend to find out so your friendship doesn't end. <br /> <br /> When I found out how many people do not like this movie, I was completely amazed. That absolutely terrible movies like Napoleon Dynamite have ratings higher than it makes me wonder about the common sense of people on IMDb. Take my advice and rent it. If you don't laugh at least once, I'll compensate you for the rent. = D
