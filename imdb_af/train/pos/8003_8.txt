This movie is great to watch with the woman or girl. There is a lot of laughter and some very interesting little nudist stories here. The actresses are all very interesting and definitely worth watching in their natural beauty. The Maslin beach life is full of diverse nudists and personality types. The Australian coastal landscape is easy to see. What a place to say, and one day it can be hid from me. I enjoy this movie a lot and every time I see it, I enjoy it more. I'd love to see more of these characters and I always wonder what happened to them. Although the plot is somewhat soft, this movie is of course a great excuse to just sit down on the couch and enjoy the wonderful and famous Maslin beach with these wonderful nudists and their own personal stories.
