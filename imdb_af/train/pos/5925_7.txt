Because of all the negative reviews of this movie, I almost didn't look at it. However, I was pleasantly surprised that it was a pretty pleasant horror movie. The play wasn't nice - except for the wonderful Alice Krige - but some of the dialogue ("Just watch yourself lunch.") Was quite amusing. <br /> <br /> In general, an above-average Stephen King effort - 10/07.
