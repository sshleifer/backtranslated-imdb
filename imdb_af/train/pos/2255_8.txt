Not a bad martial arts movie. Battle scenes were good. Michel Qissi did his first film without Van Damme well. Story worked without false language and too much blood. Author writer Jeanette Francessca has a good line for the story that works. It would be great to see something different from her in the same genre. She likes the art and has a strong female flower. It was definitely worth watching. I recommend this film to all drama and martial artists.
