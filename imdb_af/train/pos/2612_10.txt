This is a very good movie. I heard mixed reviews while in production waiting for his release! Shout at the director and all the actors. The supporting role gave Eva Mendez what she needed to take it to the top. As everyone else says here, the last part of the movie sounds. Katie Cassidy did a wonderful job with her character because she didn't do much work when this film was made. She has quite the career ahead of her. I was surprised at her performance. I totally enjoyed the movie, questioning my values ​​in life and priorities and being a better person for that! A good message lies within the film. Leave it alone so that everyone can enjoy!
