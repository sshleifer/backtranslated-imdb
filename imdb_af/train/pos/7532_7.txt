The New Batman Adventures (also known as Gotham Knights) take place 5 years after the last episodes of Batman: the Animated Series (B: TAS) and are only broadcast for 24 episodes. It's not a horrible performance, but it's just not as good as the original Batman Animated Series. I started with all the things I found were not very good. <br /> <br /> First thing's first, the animation itself: long and sweet, Gotham is no longer dark, the air is always bright red and orange, B: TAS did it too, but it was on a dark palate drawn. The color of the sky was more ominous. In this show, the color of the sky is too bright. It looks like any other kid's program and doesn't look unique to Batman: TAS has done its dark, cool art style on Gotham. The art style is OK but no longer reminds me of Batman. Each character consists of straight lines, squares and triangles that make characters less human. In the original series (B: TAS), characters look more like signed versions of real people. The animation can be more consistent here than in B: TAS, but it's definitely not so good. <br /> <br /> Next, some of the episodes look too dumbed and childish, but some of the topics are even stronger than in B: TAS. (Two-Face tries to kill Tim Drake / Robin 2, and some villains get a little tricky treatment). This leads me to my next point. <br /> <br /> Because this is supposed to take place in the future as well as the last episodes of the Batman animated universe, many villains are abandoned or abandoned forever. Poison Ivy seems to drown when a vessel explodes; Two-face kills almost penguin, killer Croc and himself, so he has been moved to Arkham forever; Joker falls into the exhaust tower of an industrial plant (although he will later return to the Justice League Animated Series); Catwoman moves away to France, leaves Batman, etc. Just because the series ends, doesn't mean they have to get rid of some big characters! The villains' motives are also bad. There is nobody! In B: TAS we learn that these villains are spiritually tormented and their lives destroyed. That's why they do the way they do. In this shoulder the villains only commit crimes to advance the story. It's like Batman, not just to save any reason in the people he's fighting. He does not strike senseless. This Batman is a colder and meaner version of the character, but as he does this work for years, I can see why he's so hard. <br /> <br /> Next, the redesigned character models: they are terrible. Gordon cut down about 100 pounds ... is he sick? Many villains watch STUPID (Joker, Riddler, Catwoman, Mr. Freeze, Mad Hatter, and Killer Croc is one of those WORST). Although I think some characters look better (Bane, Scarecrow, Batgirl). Harley is about the same, and Ivy (which is still hotter) has a light green skin. <br /> <br /> With the series of bugs, some episodes are huge. Over the edge, Mad Love, Beware the Kruiper, Girls Night Out, Old Wounds, Legends of the Dark Knight, and Never Fear, is my favorite here, in my opinion. All the crossroads with Batman in the Superman Animated Series were also fantastic. <br /> <br /> The absolute WORST part about this show is how the creators say they love the animation of this series more than the original one. On the DVD features of the original Batman Animated Series, they talk about how proud they were with the art style, and how difficult some characters have filmed, but they eventually succeeded (for example, the difficult animation needed to animate Clayface ). On the DVD features of the New Batman Adventures, the creators say basically: "To hell with B: TAS, it's a fresh, new re-vamp, it looks better and we love running the series! " (Alright, that's an exaggeration). When the creators threw the wonderful art of B: TAS away, it really irritated me! <br /> <br /> It's not a bad performance, but I don't like it as much as the original animated series. At least the show doesn't speak to his audience, so I still recommend it. Although some of the episodes in this new series are fantastic and worth watching. <br /> <br /> Superman: the Animated Series and Justice League: the Animated Series is a great sequel to Batman: the Animated Series and The New Batman Adventures, also giving them a watch.
