In the process of establishing the audience's empathy with Jake Roedel (Tobey Maguire), filmmakers burden the North and Jayhawkers. Missouri has never withdrawn from the Union and the Union Army was not an intrusive force. The South Africans fought for constitutional rights: the right to own slaves, crook legislators and judges, and employ a political offense system. There is nothing noble in it. The Missourians could easily have traveled east and joined the Confederate Army. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that the story has nothing to do with ambiguity. When Jake leaves the Bushwhackers it is not because he has seen a mistake in his way, he certainly does not give himself the virtue of the cause of abolition.
