On paper, this movie will sound incredibly boring. The idea of ​​a 75-year-old man riding a rowing carriage along the countryside certainly doesn't have much appeal, but the real power behind the movie is his charm and intelligence. Writers will not find a better study of what makes a movie like The Straight Story. <br /> <br /> The perfect example of this is a scene in which Alvin meets a runaway teenager. She is pregnant and afraid of what her parents would do if they find out. Alvin tells her a story about his own children, long ago. He took each of them a stick and broke it, which they could easily do. Then he cut them and packed the sticks and tried to break them. "The bundle," he said, "is family." So many other films will be forced to continue and make sure we knew that an individual could be broken, but together the members were stronger. "The Straight Story" realizes we are smart enough to understand it and let us consider the thought and draw our own conclusions. <br /> <br /> Alvin's journey across Iowa is full of such refreshing, non-Hollywood character interactions. Every interaction is full of warmth and humor, and Alvin is so cute with his mower that we can't help but if he travels to Wisconsin to make peace with his brother, Lyle, who has had a stroke. And the simplicity of the final scene emphasizes that the true story here is not the destination, but the journey. It's a journey in which Alvin shares his life with everyone he meets - for their benefit and ours. It's a slow, simple, relaxing ride designed to remind us of everything we've lost to America's urbanization. <br /> <br /> "The Straight Story" is the rare live-action "G" movie that should not be missed.
