It was a well-written story of making the Batman Sitcom and actually reuniting our heroes on a great quest as well as offering their TV shows history. Unlike the Brady and Partridge family of documentary movies, we look not only to Adam and Burt's past and present, but also to see them back in action. Filled with Kapow's and Katwines and the Riddler (s), Batman is back in a good story, telling us not only a satisfying conclusion to the Batman series, but filling in the modern fan on all the Hollywood stories what about them 'I've been heard in 35 years. <br /> <br /> Kudos !!!
