I was hoping it would be good as a fan of Timothy Dalton's James Bond, and although it wasn't his earning 3rd Bond outing, it was a laugh. Belushi brought in good humor, and dalton picked it up nicely, but was probably underutilized. his part was like an addict version of jack nicholson in some good men. The other British in it was a little shocking, but everywhere it was a laugh.
