1.) This movie was incredible! I watched it while I was in town next to the one where he grew up! I went and saw the buildings where the story took place. Overall, I loved this movie, one of Jake Gyllenhaal's best! Also my favorite parts were the scientists and all the time with his father. They were so sad, it looked. Homer wanted to follow his dream and his father somehow didn't care. The tagline is true. "Sometimes one dream is bright enough to lift the air." 2.) The way this movie was shot was immaculate, it was all so credible that it could be recorded during the 1950s. Clothing was accurate and they also put their snake down. Recommend this movie!
