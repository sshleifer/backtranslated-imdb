ELVIRA, MISTRESS OF THE DARK (1988) <br /> <br /> Directed by: James Signorelli <br /> starring: Cassandra Peterson, W. Morgan Sheppard, Daniel Greene and Edie McClurg <br /> < Plot: Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) closes her TV show and heads to the small Christian town of Fallwell, Massachusettes to gather on her aunt's legacy, hoping to make big money opening a show in Vegas to make. Unfortunately for her, everything she gets is a creepy old house, a poodle and a magic cookbook. While in Fallwell, Elvira is trying to earn money, catch up with teens, win the heart of a stud (Daniel Greene), avoid burning at stake, and keep her cookbook Grumpy Uncle (W. Morgan Sheppard) who plans to use the book to end the world. <br /> <br /> My thoughts: I love Cassandra Peterson and her alter-ego Elvira. She is a very successful, beautiful and funny woman, and as Elvira she is all the plus morbid and hilarious naive, not to mention, she has an incredible few clappers. In this movie her charm is used well. <br /> <br /> I love the whole 'fish out of the water' movie. You have Elvira, with her low-cut black dress, her big black hair, and her big twins, and she's in a Christian town where most girls don't even have authority. It also makes her love story with Bob (Daniel Greene) much more entertaining. <br /> <br /> W. Morgan Sheppard is as big as Elvira's uncle / nemesis Vincent, stealing the book to use it for evil. He has a lot of presence, but still doesn't get in the way and steals Elvira's screens. <br /> <br /> What really makes the movie is not the plot, but the jokes. Everything from boob jokes to horror spoofing is here and leave me much more than anything from a SCARY MOVIE sequel. I hear there are about 56 boobs in this movie, and any Roger Corman B horror movie fan will love the spoofing in this movie. <br /> <br /> If you love Elvira, you'll love this movie. Also look at ELVIRA'S HAUNTED HILLS.
