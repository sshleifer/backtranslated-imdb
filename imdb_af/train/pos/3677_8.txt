Fortunately, I recently saw it on a plane to Singapore (I missed it at the Cinemalaya movie festival). Paris, you t'aime is a collection of 20 short films (about 5 minutes each) of 20 directors showing love in various bags of contemporary Paris. <br /> <br /> One of my phat segments is "Parc Monceau" at Alfonso Cuarn (Great Expectations, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban), who was shot in one continuous shot and Nick Nolte. <br /> <br /> The Coen brothers' Tuileries were hilarious by Steve Buscemi as a subway tourist! Juliette Binoche and Willem Dafoe in 'Place des Victoires' were haunting. <br /> <br /> For a short while, Maggie Gyllenhaal as an American actress / druggy in 'Quartier des Enfants Rouges' portrayed anticipation and sadness. Time was just brilliant. <br /> <br /> Elijah Wood as a vampire victim in 'Quartier de la Madeleine' was pretty surreal, while Emily Mortimer and Rufus Sewell played a cute couple in West Craven's 'Pre-Lachaise'. br /> <br /> Natalie Portman was as beautiful as usual the actress friend of a visually impaired French boy in 'Faubourg Saint-Denis'. But despite the many depictions of young love, a more mature performance by Gena Rowlands in 'Quartier Latin' was also aww-inducing. <br /> <br /> This movie is perfect for those with ADHD, because every row is driven and carefully managed. Think of it. <br /> <br /> There are also a number of memorable quotes. One in particular is this of a deceitful man who eventually leaves his mistress to stay with his dying wife in her last days: "As if he was in love with a man, he fell in love with a man."
