Although I bought the DVD when it first came out and watched it several times, I have never written a review. <br /> <br /> I loved it when I first saw it and I still love it. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it seems that it never made enough money to motivate someone to follow up. I have to assume that QT is still in the right control, but to Kill Bill if he makes a movie that is so in the comics and books, as My Name is modesty, with another difficult female head, someone who does not know not, it sees as a deviation. <br /> <br /> Peter O'Donnell wrote his stories to focus more on psychological tensions rather than action thrillers. <br /> <br /> The rope of wills between Modesty and Miklos is very true of the source material and is tense, exciting and fascinating for anyone who doesn't have to have gore and explosions. Alexandra did a good job of playing how O'Donnell's character could take control of the situation. <br /> <br /> I find it especially ahead of the curve following the much needed reboot of Batman and James Bond. After two painful past attempts, although not nearly as well known to the public, it is a reboot of the Modesty character, and it's really sad that probably no more films will be made about her.
