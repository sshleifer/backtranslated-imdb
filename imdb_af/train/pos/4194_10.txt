Samuel Fuller brings his usual playful and stylish direction to this spicy, pompous story and manages to create one of the undiscovered jewels of the 1950s. <br /> <br /> Richard Widmark plays a spicy thief's tough guy (a role he has made perfectly over many movies), bringing a young woman's (Jean Peters) wallet to a New York -metro fetch and with it a piece of popular microfilm. It is 1953, so of course the microfilm is the property of Commie Spies who will stop at nothing to get it back. When the girl appears on Widmark's waterfront hut, sent by an abusive boyfriend to recover the movie, Widmark feels the opportunity to shake her and her "comrades" for big money. The plot thickens, people start dying, and Widmark and Peters fall in love. <br /> <br /> Fuller handles the love story uncomfortably, but more of a sense of indifference than bad writing or direction. It was as if he had included a love story under coercion, and it deliberately made it incredible, as love stories were so often in Hollywood movies. Peters gives a remarkable performance as a tough New Yawk cookie, a part-gangster moll and a part-daughter in distress. When violence acts against her, we really care about her well-being, and it is typical of Fuller's apostate, pre-time-style that a happy ending is not necessarily a discontinued conclusion. <br /> <br /> But the ultimate success of "Pickup on South Street" rests squarely on the world-tired shoulders of Thelma Ritter, who plays Moe, a fiery lady who makes money in any way she can, or it is now sold or acts as a police informant. Ritter gives the performance of her career; In a breathtaking monologue, she wears it without ever touching the whole sad job of her character's life and the hopelessness she wakes up every morning to a world of struggle, crime and hardship. It is as if every character Ritter ever converged for a moment to give all the emotions, they didn't have the chance to sleep in that other movie. The scene is the highlight of Fuller's film, and a highlight of the 50-year-old theater era. <br /> <br /> Degree: A +
