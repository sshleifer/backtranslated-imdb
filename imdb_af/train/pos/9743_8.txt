We first saw this movie as part of a festival of new Argentine films in 2000 at Walter Reade. Although we like it, we didn't think it was extraordinary. Looking at it for a second time, we found another meaning in this look at life in Buenos Aires. <br /> <br /> The film takes place in one of the darkest days of Argentina, as the DeLaRua administration has ended. The country was in turmoil after the economy, which flourished earlier in the 1990s, under the artificial climate created by President Menen. It was a time when bank accounts were frozen in dollars and people got themselves a nightmare. <br /> <br /> The story begins just as Santamarina, a bank employee, is dismissed because the economy collapses. Instead of receiving his wife's sympathy, she excluded him from the apartment and became a homeless man for all practical purposes. He goes to the streets to try to meet ends. <br /> <br /> The other story introduces us to Ariel, a young Jew, who is interviewing a job in a Spanish company. It's almost a miracle he gets the job. His father, Simon, owns a small restaurant in the Jewish quarter of "El Once" in the middle of the city. Things go from bad to worse when Ariel's mother suddenly dies. Only Estela, the young woman in love with Ariel, comes to help father and son. <br /> <br /> Santamarina, who is a clean man, must convey wherever he can. He picks up a ladies room in one of the metro stations. When the servant Elsa finds himself naked, she gets furious, but she comes to her senses when she realizes the unfortunate circumstances of this better-timed man. They get romantic, and Santamarina in one of his travels through the street refuse, finds a baby. Elsa, while surprised, wants to do the right thing. But Santamarina convinces her of the meaning of an innocent life in their lives, their love will cement. Ariel, who met the beautiful Laura at work, started a turbulent and heavy sexual relationship with his beautiful co-worker, unknown to him, involved in a lesbian relationship. Ariel, who photographs free weddings and weddings, feels a passion for Laura, but he realizes what Estela offered to help his father and still love him. <br /> <br /> Daniel Burman, whose "El Abrazo Partido" we thought was excellent, did wonders with this movie. Things are being put in the right perspective after a second show and we have to be sorry we didn't see it for the first time. As anything, the nuances of the screenplay, Mr. Burman and Emiliano Torres wrote, make more sense because they reflect the turmoil of what the country lived in the dark days. <br /> <br /> Daniel Hendler, who plays Ariel, already has Mr. Burman worked together for surprising results. He's not a movie star pretty, but he's handsome. This actor produces a tremendous sincerity in his work. Enrique Pineyro is another beautiful surprise. His Santamarina is disarmed. In spite of all the bad things that happened to him, he has a rosy attitude towards everyone he meets. Stefania Sandrelli, the interesting Italian actress, makes a big contribution to the movie with her Elsa. Hector Alterio, one of the best Argentine actors plays the small part of Simon. The beautiful Chiara Coselli is seen as Laura and Melina Petrielli appearing as the noble Estela. <br /> <br /> "Esperando al mesias" proves that Daniel Burman is a voice to be considered in the Argentine theater.
