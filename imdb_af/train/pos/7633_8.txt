By reading the various external reviews of Roger Ebert and other well-known film critics, I hesitate to acknowledge how much I like this movie, although I only have an in-Japanese video version of it. <br /> <br /> Apparently, many critics seem to consider it a minus that the story supply was previously used, especially in the wonderful "This is a wonderful life." For me, a good point of departure is a good point of departure, no matter how many times it is used, and I will be happy to see more movies using this particular point of departure - the disgruntled man who gets a chance to get a fresh perspective on to get his own life. by a bit of a divine magic. <br /> <br /> I think people and critics of a more intellectual are not so drawn into the story, but I'm not going to movies to criticize them with notebook in hand - I'm going to movies throw myself in them and let them take me where they want. <br /> <br /> Looking sentimental like me, you'll be well rewarded by seeing this picture. The performances are excellent, and the movie was very well thrown. Wonderful choice of music too. Michael Caine is wonderful as the sympathetic bartender. Jim Belushi does a good job as an "average Joe" kind of man wondering if his life hasn't gone. Linda Hamilton, always excellent, is again right on target here than the loving woman. Jon Lovitz entertaines as usual, and even some surprising moving moments in "Mr. Destiny." <br /> <br /> No, "Mr. Destiny" is not "It's a wonderful life," but who says it should be? On its own terms, "Mr. Destiny" is a pleasant, well-made, funny and moving movie. I watched many of my Japanese videos many times, and I'm sure I'll see it several times more. If it somehow makes me a "lowbrow", so be it! I'm just glad I didn't read any reviews of "Mr. Destiny" before I saw it. <br /> <br /> I think I should have the courage of my beliefs and give the movie nine or ten stars, but I couldn't help but doubt if I had read all the critical reviews!
