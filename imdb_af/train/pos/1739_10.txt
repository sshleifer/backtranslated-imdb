Looking at a NASCAR Maniac like me, the movie is interesting. You can see many cars from 1983 onwards. Even difficult, the racing is not so realistic. But I have to admit that I didn't see a race before 1995, because before that time they didn't show any NASCAR matches in Germany) <br /> <br /> From a Burt Reynolds fan I'm, the movie is basically what we saw from Reynolds in the 80's: Burt behind the wheel of a fast car, like in his Bandit Movies. <br /> <br /> If you like NASCAR and Burt Reynolds, this movie is a must-see. If you just love one of these 2 things, I also recommend seeing them. If you don't like NASCAR or Burt Reynolds, give it another chance, but remember, this movie was far from the Oscar Academy Award. <br /> <br /> This is the typical humor of the 80's. If you like movies like the Cannonball Movies, and Police Academy, you will also like one.
