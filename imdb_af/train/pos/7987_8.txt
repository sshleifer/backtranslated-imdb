Man on the fire was warm. I love a classic story of good revenge, and a better reason for revenge than the kidnapping of an innocent girl. <br /> <br /> In this movie, the writers did an excellent job building the relationship between Creasy (Denzel Washington) and Pita (Dakota Fanning) so the viewer would understand and actually feel the drive. Creasy had to save Pita. It was also good that Creasy wasn't a choral song trying to save Pita through the "proper" channels, but rather used torture tactics and street-ready. Some may say, "Torture is wrong, anyway," and you can be right, but if you see the pain that Creasy goes through losing Pita and the sheer passion he has to get her back, you can't help. With Crease and pulling him even more mercilessly. There would be no progress if Creasy used diplomacy to deal with the various deadly gangsters and criminals and he knew. <br /> <br /> Creasy's quest ended with the return of Pita to her mother and Creasy being in the bad guys vehicle. But Creasy's death did not reduce the effectiveness of the movie, it really improved by showing that Creasy was willing to die to get Pita back. His death was noble in fact. <br /> <br /> Denzel does an excellent job like the authors. This movie deserves good points because it was definitely a good movie.
