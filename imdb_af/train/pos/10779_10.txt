A classic cartoon, always nice and funny. It has an interesting plot completed with lovely characters. Road Rovers is a worthwhile show, it's a short 13 episodes, and if you ever get the chance to see it, you need to. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to find. I think Warner Brothers Studios should release a DVD that already contains 13 episodes. I will definitely buy it if they do, and if they do, you have to buy it too. If you have kids who love dogs, they will keep track of road shutters! Road Rovers needed more attention while broadcast. It was definitely an original and very special show that would have been much more appreciated than it was.
