I went to see Hamlet because I was between work. I thought 4 hours would be good, I was a fan of Branagh; Dead again, Henry V. I was totally overwhelmed by the direction, acting, movies captured by this movie. Like other reviews, the 4 hours go fast. Branagh does not play Hamlet, he is Hamlet, he was born for this. Looking at this movie, I constantly try to find mistakes, I looked at the goofs and didn't notice it. How he could move the camera in and out of the hall with all the mirrors is a mystery to me. This movie was shot in 70 miles. It is a pity that Columbia did not release a Widescreen version of this on VHS. I own a DVD player, and I want to take it every day about Titanic. So, listening to Columbia, put this movie out of the way it should be watched! And I don't know what happened during the Oscars. It must have been the best photo, best actor, best direction, best cinematography. What movies did they watch? I was sorry for Branagh at the Oscar when he made a tribute to Shakespeare on the screen. They had to give a tribute to Branagh for being one of the best movies of all time.
