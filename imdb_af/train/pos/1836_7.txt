Time for a hit! <br /> <br /> Waqt Dir-Vipul Amrutlal Shah Cast-Amitabh Bachchan, Akshay Kumar, Priyanka Chopra, Shefali Shah, Rajpal Yadav and Boman Irani. Written by -Aatish Kapadia Rating- *** <br /> <br /> Eureka! We got it! Yes, ladies and gentlemen? In Vipul Shah's 'Waqt', we've probably found this year's first bona fide hit. Replaced with all the necessary ingredients of a commercial Bollywood prize, 'Waqt' has all it takes to click a movie with the Indian audiences. This is the kind of movie that a distributor feels happy and considering to make his next visit! In this 'saga of Indian emotions' then we have a happy family (isn't it always?) Of three. Ishwar (Amitabh Bachchan), the postman turn millionaire (don't ask how! ... there's something to sell toys while letters are being delivered and it's serious - who gives a damn!), Married to Sumi (Shefali Shah ) is a daughter father of Aditya (Akshay Kumar). Ishwar must make a serious decision about his son's careless attitude to life's responsibilities. However, his love for Aditya is delaying the serious cause. However, if he is confronted with a situation that will test his race against time, Ishwar has no choice but to throw Aditya out of the house - hoping that the new trouble can make him more conscientious of his own life. But this supposed solution becomes a problem in itself, as the gap between the loving father's son increases and the fences continue to grow. <br /> <br /> You don't have to be a rocket scientist to realize that such a story offers enough opportunities to interfere with comedy and drama. So, pre-interval you have the initially funny, later annoying comedy track of Boman Irani and Rajpal Yadav; and after-interval there is the gift for your kerchief moments between Aby and Akki! Author Aatish Kapadia (he also wrote the original Gujarati play 'Aavjo Vhala Fari Malishu' on which the film is based) does a good job of keeping the story fluid. The dialogues are sometimes prone to conflict. It doesn't help that songs like an acne appear on a teenager's face and miss the proceedings. Obviously some numbers could be worked out. In front, Vipul shows that he has a natural flair for storytelling. 'Waqt', as well as his earlier debut attempt 'Aankhen', keeps you interested in the last line. On a personal note, the seasaw of emotions was a little jerky to me. But with the response of the audience, it was working. <br /> <br /> Lastly, "Waqt" is all about his performances that entail a whole point in overall rating! Amitabh Bachchan is reliable as always. His energy is visible and so is his age! Shefali stands in a fine animated show and suits the superstar at every step. Boman and Rajpal leave home with their histrionics. Priyanka has little to do than to fulfill the perfection role of a heroine. However, if it all comes down, 'Waqt' is Akshay's vehicle. I have always maintained that Akki is as good as the role that suits him. Put him in a 'Mujh Shaadi Karogi' and he is fantastic, but in a 'Bewafaa' he is very bad. Here, Akki is probably at its best. Whether it's his comic timing or his emotional versions, he's close-perfect. There is also an action scene for his fans! Ironically, his previous best effort in 'Aankhen' - with the same director and Big B on his side! <br /> <br /> 'Waqt' is not a memorable movie at all. It is not one that will appear in the better films of our industry. But this is one for the masses. And at a time when the industry is desperately waiting for a universal hit, Waqt can only do the trick! <br /> <br /> - Abhishek Bandkar <br /> <br /> Trivia- This is Akshay Kumar's second consecutive movie to 'Bewafaa', in which he performs on stage during the climax! <br /> <br /> Rating *** <br /> <br /> * Poor ** Average *** Good *** * Very good ***** Excellent <br /> <br /> April 22, 2005
