Hi, I'm a chess lover since the age of about 6. I suspect I'm pretty obsessed with chess, but hopefully not as much as the central character in this movie. <br /> <br /> In this film, the central character reflects a true chess player named Curt von Bardeleben who committed suicide in 1924. He is known for a match he played against Steinitz, where a beautiful combination was played by Steinitz. Instead of resigning, he simply walked out of the tournament, never returned. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the social character of the central character is a bit of the more serious granny you sometimes get in chess tournaments. Chess I think it's a great sacrifice, and you can sometimes end up unbalanced in other areas of life. A great example of this is the shameless Bobby Fischer. Although he was a genius, he was also greatly disturbed in many ways. <br /> <br /> In the film, a World Cup match is depicted, between an Italian Grandmaster and Luzhin. The format is a knockout, which actually used Fide's world governing body as a format - from 128 players to just 2 in the final. But it was a group knock-out - which also portrays a realistic format where the winners of each group play against each other. <br /> <br /> The position before adultery in itself makes for a fascinating chess puzzle. In fact, I did a youtube video to explore the winning combination in detail - enjoy! http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=XZPtdtPhwdM Best Regards Tryfon
