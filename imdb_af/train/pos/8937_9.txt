It was a good example of how an interesting movie can be made without using big stars and big effects. Just say a real story about the struggle of two African American women over a turbulent century. <br /> <br /> This movie challenges us all to look at our own prejudices and see that people are people, not white, black, etc. <br /> <br /> Good movie with good message.
