Soylent Green IS ... actually a very good movie. <br /> <br /> I would never have thought so. I don't like Heston much in his sci-fi efforts. He is one of the actors who, like Superman, gets hold of most of the time. I prefer more vulnerable heroes. And indeed, he cuts his way through many Soylent Green as well, but since he's supposed to play an excess bully, I don't really care. <br /> <br /> I can understand why some people will turn their noses on this movie. Soylent Green makes no effort to create futuristic visuals (which you know - it looks like 1973), and it is lacking in action. But I admired the film's vision of a complex, corrupt and highly stratified society, and I was so glad to see Edward G. Robinson have such a moving, funny final role. Nice little character moments - like sharing some precious food with Heston - really make the movie. <br /> <br /> Today's message from Soylent Green is quite relevant when nobody knows what government or hell is. corporations are up. Funny, isn't it, to see Heston in a prototype Michael Moore movie ...
