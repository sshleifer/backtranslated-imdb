This is one of the first movies I can remember, or maybe the first one. Exactly the beautiful kind of movie than introducing a child into the world of violence and addiction, where we live. A little Babe, Casino and Constantine, everything is well mixed in a cardboard, and we get it. I don't know if it was really rated for kids, but I think it was very cool, very funny and interesting. I hate when a movie (especially a cardboard) can have a good end and its devastation, because every character must have a happy ending, even if it is strange (I'm not a bitter person). But it was OK, he just went to heaven and they let it down. <br /> <br /> All this is just a critic. It's a good movie, something new. touch and I have to go
