Paul Reiser did a spectacular job of writing this movie. Peter Falk shows his life. It is an Oscar worthy. It was one of the most beautiful and funniest movies of the year. Traveler's white is fantastic and he is as good as it gets and as he was in his long-term TV sitcom "Mad About You". Peter Falk did a masterful job as his father, and Peter, now 78, laughed and laughed at the same time. The supporting role was equal to the task, especially the beautiful, beautiful Elizabeth Perkins. It's a movie for 2005. We bet everyone in all ages and religions will love this movie and somehow link it to it. We have mothers and fathers and brothers and sisters like this in the movie. We all had the good and bad times together and wish things were the same, but different.
