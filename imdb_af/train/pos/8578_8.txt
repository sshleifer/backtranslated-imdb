This film is one of the best American B movies of the 90's. If you're looking for a serious movie, look elsewhere. However, if you are looking for some action, lots of laughter, and a tongue-in-cheek difference about police fighting fighters, it's worth watching. Everyone chews the landscape a bit, but it's really what the movie is about, and everyone is pretty funny. Donald Sutherland and John Lithgow have good chemistry and have to do another movie together.
