I was bored one night and Red Eye was on and thought why. <br /> <br /> Red Eye is one of the best movies in a long time. <br /> <br /> I mean I just got in <br /> <br /> The story is new and different. <br /> <br /> The movie also features two great cues in the film with Rachel Mcadams as Lisa Reisert and Cillian Murphy as Jackson Rippner. <br /> <br /> The acting is just brilliant and you get the feeling for the people in the movie. <br /> <br /> The music is just great, it gives you chills and can also make you relax. <br /> <br /> I just love how the movie did just as well and it never gets boring. <br /> <br /> Red Eye is just phenomenal. Nothing more and nothing less. <br /> <br /> It's an excellent thriller. <br /> <br /> Overall, I enjoy Red Eye so much that I can see it again. <br /> <br /> If you like Red Eye, I recommend Elektra and Cry Wolf. <br /> <br /> I give red eyes 9 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Big movie
