I own this movie and have watched it several times over the years since it was released. Prince does not hit us with his phenomenal play or something, he is a musician and I feel like this is what he has shown here. He is just the best to tell this story through influence. Most of these movies are straight and teenage-like, but it's the director's / writer's error, but it's still a good movie with even better music. The principals and moral beliefs in Persrein are fairly strong. If more movies were to rely on the basics, we were taught as young children if we had a better environmental environment, as art reflected life that reflected art.
