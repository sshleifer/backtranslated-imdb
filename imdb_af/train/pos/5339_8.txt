I just saw "back bedroom doors", and this was the first soft spot movie with a solid story behind what I've seen for a while. <br /> <br /> We start with two neighboring couples - Vivian and James Fenway (Julia Kruis and Eric Carrington), and Lillian and Gabe Harris (Nicole Sheridan and Chris Gustafson). Vivian seems to be a housewife, James is a lawyer running for district attorney, Lillian works in real estate, and Gabe is a successful plastic surgeon. Do you have everything? Now, let's get it. <br /> <br /> Tap Abby, beautifully played by the porn star Chelsea Blue. She rents the house across the street from the Fenways and lives completely herself. At the start of the movie, James looks out to his window and sees Abby engaging in playing time with her friend, Gigi (played by productive porn Monique Alexander) and secretly wondering how it would be with her. The next day, Abby becomes known to all four, and apparently a good woman living just an alternative lifestyle. She made a pass at Vivian, who suddenly looked and said to her, "Oh, I am ... not so." Everything looks okay ... until the plan is implemented. <br /> <br /> First, Abby appears at Gabe's office, naked, and asks Gabe to get a boobie. Here we get our quote from the movie: <br /> <br /> "Tell me about Gabe." "What do you want to know?" "Is Gabe happily married?" "I'm married." "There are problems ..... let me guess. Your wife stays home and does everything you ask. But she's a good girl." "Yes." "She's not a bad girl?" "None." "Does that have a lock on it?" <br /> <br /> You know what happens next ... Abby gets it with Gabe, right there in the exam room. Then she puts a small display in her window for James, who comes and does not waste time having sex with her. What James does not know is that the teddy bear on the piano with the flickering red eye is really a camera that cuts off all the festivals (which is so obvious). Abby later had sex with Gabe again, and this time Gigi enters to make it a three-way. Now that Abby has something for both men, she asks $ 100,000 from everyone to buy her silence. Not only can she destroy James's run for office, but she can destroy Gabe's practice. <br /> <br /> While Gabe and James wrestle with their debt, Abby finds time to seduce Lillian - who "experimented" with women in college. It was a long time ago, but you won't know that she sees her in action with Abby - she looks like an old pro. While Gigi goes with the plan, it looks jealous of everyone The sex her friend has. "It's just business," said Abby. Confessions and excuses are surely to follow, just like some exciting information about Abby's true identity. She seems to have done the same things to different men in different places. Gabe and James use this app to return to Abby's extortion. <br /> <br /> Now, after sex. The sex scenes were pretty good, and considering all the women involved in this movie, except Julia Cross has a long porno background, I would have expected nothing less. Nicole Sheridan's four screens were the best of the movie, with the three-way in a near second. Monique Alexander only nodded once, but she was a relatively small character. Julia Cross was a great character and has become the same number of times. I suspect that, after being surrounded by experienced hardcore forwards, she didn't have so many sex scenes. <br /> <br /> Packing, "Back bedroom doors" had a great story, which improved the overall grade. of the movie. I regard it as riotous. <br /> <br /> Women: A- (Nicole Sheridan was good at this movie - better than her later presentations in Fred Olen Ray's comedies. She can at least do dramatic plays - she was not as bad as the antagonist I would give her an A only. Julia Kruis was her usual self. I wish Monique Alexander had more time in this movie. <br /> <br /> Sex: B (Solid, very solid sex scene. Nicole Sheridan's performances were almost hardcore quality and Chelsea Blue also looks good on her screens, but the two girl offers have not scorched, but they have become hot on the screen. <br /> <br /> Story: B + (I love the dialogue and the main story, Chelsea Blue's performance was good for the genre, and I was impressed with Nicole Sheridan's turn in drama. <br /> <br /> Overall: B (It was a nice softcore flick "I'm glad I could see this one, as I was pleasantly surprised. If Chelsea Blue ever wanted to do this, she would be welcome anytime. It also applies to Nicole Sheridan - though she is probably better off doing comedy. I don't care for hardcore girls who can do with cartoons.)
