I found it a beautiful fit, very lively and fun. With the exception of some big mistakes, the cast is wonderful. I have to mention some of the previous comments - Chynna Phillips is terribly disappointed as a teenager. At 27 she is just too old (and yes, it shows) and the song "funnels" for Broadway style music is missing. Vanessa Williams is a decent singer and for a non-dancer she is adequate. However, she is not Latina, and her character is definitely. She is also very stubborn throughout, which gets annoying. <br /> <br /> The girls from the Conrad Birdie fan club of Sweet Apple are really brilliant - with special kudos to Brigitta Dau and Chiara Zanni. I also enjoyed Tyne Daly's performance, although I'm not usually a fan of her work. Finally, the dancers Shriners are a riot, especially the brave three in the bar. <br /> <br /> The movie is suitable for the whole family and I highly recommend it.
