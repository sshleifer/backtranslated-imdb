Anyone who has lived through the ages of the Nerds and Girlpower will appreciate this movie. It's one of those movies that is all in a "spring break movie". PLUS it makes fun of the college movie genre. It's funny, it has a role to die for (Amy Pohler! Rachel Dratch!, Sophie Monk!, Parker Posey! Jane Lynch! Amber Tamblyn! Missy Arrows!) And it's guaranteed to make you laugh out loud. Author / actor Rachel Dratch is a comic genius and Sophie Monk is such a big villain. Wilson Phillips! OMG! (I just repeat ...) It will continue with girls who like Miranda Julie, but feel like eating ice cream and as if they're stupid.
