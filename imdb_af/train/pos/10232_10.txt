Having seen most of Ringo Lam's movies, I can say it's been his best movie so far, and the most unusual. It is an ancient china era full of kicking martial arts, where the place of an underground army full of falls and dungeons plays a major role than any of the characters. The action is fantastic, the story is tense and entertaining, and the set design is really memorable. Unfortunately, Burning Paradise is not available on DVD and it is impossible to offer your bags even if you are near the second largest China town in North America (like me). If you can get it, don't give it up.
