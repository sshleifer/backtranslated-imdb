This is one of the best reunion offers ever, with Adam West and Burt Ward who parody themselves and have fun while doing so. It is incredibly the amount of effort that went into detail, especially to select the feel of the 1960s, the Batcave set, Wayne Manor, the costumes and the actors selected for the younger versions of West, Ward, Burgess Meredith , Cesar Romero, and Frank Gorshin! This 90 minutes worth of time is a delight for all fans of the classic 1960's "Batman" television series. I note that "Batman" cuts from the movie, not the series itself, are probably due to legal restrictions. Let's hope the three seasons of the show are on DVD.
