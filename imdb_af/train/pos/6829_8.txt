Gena Rowlands plays an actress who loses her grip on reality when she sees the death of a fan of her. She is becoming increasingly confused with reality, and as a result her emotional turmoil affects her work as an actress. In the sense that she breaks all the rules and improvises everything, but still succeeds in engaging her audience, the film makes it interesting (as a little self-evident) as a parallel of Cassavette's own struggle as a film maker. There are so many ideas reversed, and as a result it becomes a bit obscured (I'm still thinking about the relationship between the dead fan and Rowlands under many other things), but the way they are presented in their race. , make it a consistently interesting and thoughtful movie. It will be good on a double bill with Mulholland Drive. <br /> <br />
