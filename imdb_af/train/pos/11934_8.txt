Initially, you think of another Disney movie, it might be good, but it's a children's movie. But if you see it, you can't help it, but enjoy it. All ages will love this movie. I only saw the movie when I was 10 and now 8 years later I still love it! Danny Glover is great and couldn't play the part better. Christopher Lloyd is hilarious and perfect for sharing. Tony Danza is as credible as Mel Clark. You can't help but enjoy this movie! I give it a 10/10!
