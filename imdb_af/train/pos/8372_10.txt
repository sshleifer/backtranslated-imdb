What a masterpiece. To take the cold war conflict and transport it to the future. This movie is satire of the highest order. In my humble opinion, this is about Dr. Strangelove. <br /> <br /> The clever name of the two superpowers, such as the Confederation and the Mark. Cons are commies and Market, The West! outstanding. The clever use of gen Joxs was before his time. We just really see the dangers of genetic engineering. Robot joks took charge of the case in 1989. <br /> <br /> The message of this film is about the humble man's comrade and how it can overcome the government's wishes. These movies screams DON'T KNOW YOU SHOULD KNOW, YOU WILL DEAL IF EVERYTHING. <br /> <br /> EXCELLENT 10/10
