I haven't seen this movie in years, so my knowledge is a bit rusty. I remember remembering that this movie was Braveheart's movie twice. It's just more realistic and has more credible characters. Ridb Roy looks like one would think Rob Roy could look, messy hair and beard with simple clothes. Liam Nesson also has a Celtic look over him, looks like a Scot and looks more like Rob Roy. It's a comparison that makes some people angry, but compares it to Mel Gibson and William Wallace. Gibson is presumably a man who has the legend, causing him to be described as a 6 foot 7 giant while Gibson is almost a foot shorter. The story contains a bit of romance, conspiracy and a story story. Sounds like Braveheart? But instead of a film calling "freedom, freedom and nationalism," we get a film that says honor, love and justice. This makes it a more interesting movie. Much like Gladiator. The film is fantastic and Liam Nesson is a very strong leader in this quest. The story is great about how it deals with heroism and humanity. The scene where Mary is raped and she walks out of the burning house with a look of true Scottish power, is followed by her in an extreme panic washing the semen from her cross. This is something a heroine in Braveheart will never do. Overall it is a beautiful and almost flawless watch. Go see it!
