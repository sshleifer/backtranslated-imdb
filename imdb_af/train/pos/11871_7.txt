Written by Oliver Stone and directed by Brian De Palma, SCARFACE paints a picture that is not easily forgotten. Al Pacino turns into a beautiful show as Tony Montana, a Cuban refugee, as a powerful player in the drug world because he ruthlessly manages his own kingdom of crime in Florida. This gangster flick is hard, violent, loud, rough, unpleasant and must keep the record to pronounce the word "f - k" most times. Almost three hours, and yes, it can be repulsive. A naughty constitution puts you in the seat of the death of a ruthless criminal. <br /> <br /> Also interesting characters are Michelle Pfeiffer, Steven Bauer, Robert Loggia, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, F. Murray Abraham and Angel Salazar. Pacino seems to be one of the largest of his generation. He manages the reality to his character who leaves a strong impression. It won't be a movie for everyone, because you think you've run out of disaster. Is it powerful enough for you? Crime doesn't pay long!
