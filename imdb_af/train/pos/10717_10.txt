Excellent display. Instead of looking at the same old sitcom type, showing where it's the same old thing, just different stars, this refreshing display gave an amazingly entertaining view of office situations. We are away from any television for 2 years and after returning, from all the available programs, we look forward to watching this show at W. Shame on Global to pull the plug on this one. I thought this would be a winner. Let's be realistic about things, FEW Canadian SHOWS make it. Everyone I talk to enjoys this show and I believe it was crazy for Global to leave. I think they would stick it out with the typical hidden performances of the states instead of pulling behind a Canadian show that had a lot of promise. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy many programs on TV, but come on people, let's keep the variety. This unique show has given a very comical view of a slightly exaggerated realistic side of office life and relationships, with unique characters that you don't see today or in the past on any sitcoms. Bad that the world must say no to this one, foolish mistake.
