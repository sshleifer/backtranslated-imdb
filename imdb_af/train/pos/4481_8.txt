The only reason I give this movie 8/10 stars, not 10, is because 1) Sinatra is terrible and 2) Kelly's love interests leave much to be desired, (IMHO). Love that Dean Stockwell, Quantum Leap - Al, is the little boy. The Jerry Mouse dance series is one of the most entertaining and wonderful dance series I have ever seen. Tom and Jerry are still a personal favorite of mine and my daughter. I am 28 and she is 4, so while the character is less iconic than Mickey, he is still a favorite of many children and adults today. Kelly is always fascinating, his eyes full of fun and excitement. In every movie I've ever seen him, he always steals the show. One of the best dancers of the 20th century. It's no wonder Paula has Abdul Kelly's movements "sampled". I will also mention Gene Kelly as one of the most beautiful people of the 20th century. If you just had to watch one part, don't miss Kelly's dance with Jerry Mouse. You will NOT be disappointed.
