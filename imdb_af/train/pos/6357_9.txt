I found this to be a very entertaining little child movie that is actually applied to adults more, with lots of jokes and humor just what they will understand. A few things are inappropriate for the kids, but just a few. Othewise, "The Grinch" (Jim Carrey) breaks so many jokes you can't love them, from sexual to cultural to insider Hollywood to races. <br /> <br /> The movie is very colorful and looks good on DVD. The little girl here, "Cindy Lou Who" (Taylor Momsen) is really cute and the costumes and hairstyles of the little ones here are nice to see. Anthony Hopkins's voice is also pleasing, so with his narrative it raises the film further. His rhymes are nice to hear. <br /> <br /> I saw it in the theater, even though it was fair, but on DVD it was much better. I saw three times and it got better every time.
