I waited and waited for this movie to come out, the trailers had been on for years, it was worth it. I'm not a big fan of watching movies over and over again, but I can't wait to get everyone out to buy! Not a big fan of Jim, but it suited him perfectly, there was so much to see and the 'feel good factor' is out of scale, ideal for Christmas. I think Ron did a fantastic job in making it into a movie. If you haven't seen it, do it when you see it again, I know you want it!
