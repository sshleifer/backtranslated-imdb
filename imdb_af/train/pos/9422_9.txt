When I learned about Sir Alec Guinness's death, it was the first of his many films I thought I would see again. What a wonderful droll commentary the movie offers even after all these years. And Guinness helps to weave the charm in every frame. His eyes and face are as light as the white suit he wears. Both he and the film should be considered lifelong favorites.
