Dana Andrews is one of the actors I have probably seen in a dozen movies but has never really registered for me. Taciturn, often coagulant, plays the same kind of roles and looks a bit like the similar Glenn Ford, he is an actor struggling to really appreciate; but once you hit the right movie. <br /> <br /> And that's it. Preminger's gentle look at New York's lower body is as dirty and seedy as any 50's noir, and Andrews is in his element as a tough policeman Mark Dixon who just doesn't know how to play the game: he hates criminals too much to always play the rules. Early in the movie, he accidentally killed the witness of a murder with an illegal crap game created by a mobster who hates Dixon for personal reasons. He spent the rest of the film trying to cover his involvement and bringing the gangster to his kind of "justice". Along the way he gets involved with the estranged wife of the man he killed (Gene Tierney) and must also try to get her father out of the murder. <br /> <br /> Beautifully photographed by Joseph LaShelle, with loud and sparkling conversation by Ben Hecht and a truly powerful ending with elements of tragedy and grace in just a minute or twice, this is another noir for For centuries and my favorite Preminger movie so far - it's just as good as the more-heralded Laura.
