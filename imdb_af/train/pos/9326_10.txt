I have to be honest and say I bought this movie, not because of the content, but because David Cubitt is in it; I know ... level or what? - But come on, Mr. Cubitt is a fantastic actor to put it softly. <br /> <br /> I didn't really know what to expect to watch this movie, I want to write the others, and those on other sites, but I have to say I'm almost out of the world in the world pulled from the brothers. David Cubitt as Theo, and Colm Feore as Ryan, are as credible as the two estranged brothers. The film moves through their relationship as they try to get to know each other after their fathers death. The scene where Theo finds out that Ryan is gay is brilliantly played, he literally walks on a scene and tries to go without Ryan noticing - of course he has. <br /> <br /> The film is very well researched and is therefore incredibly sad, moving, uplifting and celebrating life in parts. I got rid of this feeling sad about what Ryan went through, but also knowing that he was given hope and unconditional love by ex-drug addict Theo. I agree with the other reviewer who finds the scene where Theo says he is going to be a dad and I go a little further to say that I actually expressed my thoughts at Ryan when he cruelly says Theo 'What makes you believe that you can be a father 'and Theo simply says' you'. Theo then walks away, but the small exchange of dialogue speaks volumes to the almost self-assured aspect of Ryan, who is sharply educated by the simple retort. <br /> <br /> A brilliant pregnant movie about all scores, acting, directing, writing etc. is done so well. I can't really find anything else about this movie, except to say it's very difficult to handle the death of a loved one, but it gets excellent, forever. Respect for the subject and the outpouring of love (without indignation and mawkish) speak volumes in this rather selfish world in which we live today. Well done to everyone involved. <br /> <br /> Not many movies bring me to tears and pause to think about life in general, and also to be happy for all the things I have and not for things not to grieve I do not, but this movie, it was incredibly uplifting consideration of the subject.
