Great brilliant movie of Broadway music. Nathan (Frank Sinatra) likes to roll the dice and organize illegal crap games. Blonde loving Adelaide (Vivian Blaine) wants to marry him if he gives craps. He decides on one last game when Sky Masterson (Marlon Brando!), Which is big bets in the city. He thanked Sky for not being able to get missionary Sarah Brown (Jean Simmons) to go with him to Havana. It may look like a strange plot summary, but so is the movie! <br /> <br /> It's a real mixed bag. There are some wonderful things here. The songs are all good and the dance is incredible. The real show stop is at the crap game at the end. Brando is also pretty good here - it seems strange that he sings and dances to him, but he pulls it off. I have to admit that big, bulky Brando who pulled down difficult dance moves was great fun! Sinatra is also pretty good and Blaine is just as wonderful as his long-suffering friend. Her song and dance numbers are definitely highlights here. <br /> <br /> Now for the bad parts - Jean Simmons is a great actress, but she's stuck with a colorless roll and can't do much with it. The movie is too long at 150 minutes. The screens between Brando and Simmons really did and needed to be shortened. Also, most characters speak very accurately in English - contractions are never used. Maybe it's great to get out of the gangsters' mouth, but I crumbled it, and it made me throw it out of the movie. <br /> <br /> It is worth catching up on the songs and dances, but its length comes after a while. I give it a 7.
