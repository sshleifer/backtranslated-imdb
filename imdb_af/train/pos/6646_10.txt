Mahatma Gandhi, the father of the nation in his quest for India's freedom struggle, ignored his own family and son. This movie is about his son Hiralal being neglected because of mahatma Gandhi's service to society. The film begins in South Africa, where Mahatma Gandhi works as a barrister and the cause of India's freedom against the British. Hirarala arrives in South Africa to help his father who is a legal representative, as gandhi was involved in the liberation struggle, he wanted his wife and children to join the community as a service. Hirarlal therefore has no chance of completing his training and failing his exams, marrying his love gulab (bhoomika Chawla) against his father's wishes. Hiralal has ambitions to travel to England and become like his father, but his own father refuses to give him a scholarship offered by a businessman to his family and instead give it to someone else who says that scholarship should not be limited to his family and should be open to the most deserving student living in colony. These angers hiralale and the rift between father and son rise, hirarlal hates his father to neglect him and blame him for being uneducated and unemployed. Hiralal struggles to meet ends and solve country streets through failed business attempts and in great debt, he loses his wife and children. Akshaye Khanna gives a star performance as Hiralal gandhi .. all kudos for him, the direction and the writing are fantastic, the picture is excellent. overall an excellent movie and a must see. I give it a 10/10
