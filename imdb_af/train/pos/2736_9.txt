A unique movie ... one of the best of all time. Acting, script, Quincy Jones' score, cinematography, editing, etc. - Not great. As most viewers know, this movie is based on Truman Capote's book on the famous killing of a Kansas farm family (the Clutters) by some young guys during a wrong robbery. I have never seen a movie that has so brilliantly changed a true story into a sounding movie. <br /> <br /> The actors are firmly on the board, but the focus is on the killers, Dick and Perry, and the law enforcement team they follow. Scott Wilson, like Dick Hickock, is incredible. Crispy, tortuous and without compassion he appears so charming, oily and credible. Robert Blake as Perry Smith is also extraordinary - lonely, and at once empathetic and cold-blooded. Who can fold these features in one individual and let's buy them? He does, and it is brilliant! A key point of the book is how it crossed the intersection of these two very different sociopathic individuals to create the critical mass to commit such a stupid and atrocious crime. These two actors make it beautiful. Both had moments in their subsequent careers, but these performances are high water points and stand for the acting period. <br /> <br /> Police are also wonderful. The investigation is John Forsythe, but the other three detectives are also good. Unlike contemporary movies where producers consider it necessary to provide police with superhuman assets or foibles, it is only true flat-footed, working with determination and skill. They look so real. I have never seen police on the screen so powerful in their authenticity; and I saw that most of the crime leaves go back a lot. Actually one of a kind in this regard. <br /> <br /> PARTIAL SPOILER COMING (this movie is unique because you already know what happened, but I warn you for the record). <br /> <br /> Of course, the best scenes of the best crime shows and movies are the interrogations - the intellectual fights between policemen and villains, Mano and Mano. This movie has some of the best interviewing movies you'll ever see on film. Watch Dick and Perry try to bend their way and unravel slowly, unaware that police have the goods on them. But the police have to prepare their suspects thoroughly to break their alibis and hopefully proclaim confessions. These are some of the best plays you'll ever see. Think Glengarry Glen Ross without showboating. <br /> <br /> To help translate the sad and terrible corners of this true story, ICB was filmed at the real Clutter House, and I heard the Clutters were played by movie students to make them feel real to give. It works. It looks like decent, simple people. This makes the crime so tangible and sad. <br /> <br /> I'll stop here. This is not a good movie, but it is one of the best movies ever made, and so unique to watch every movie.
