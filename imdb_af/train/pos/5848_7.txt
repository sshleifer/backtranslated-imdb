And I got it high 7 ..... <br /> <br /> Why? Because it bloody bloody well. By the time there were so many other shows linked to toys / games, this show was unique because it had overlapping stories. As others have said, it was before his time. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is why the show is doomed. They have so far released 4 DVDs with 16 episodes of the series. I hope more will come out. <br /> <br /> This compares to 20 years after it first came out. I don't know I like it, despite the sometimes turbulent animation, and that IMHO is just wrong. The writing was almost top and before the competition ........ <br /> <br /> I hope for more DVDs or even a set of all the episodes in good order ... The DVDs are good, but I don't think the stories are in their proper order, but despite that, the show ripped.
