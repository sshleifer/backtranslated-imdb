It's a good movie and nothing more. And for that it is very nice to look. Certainly it is about political issues. But what? I'm sure she's not trying to make 'Good Night and Good Luck' here. Let's try not to do anything other than it is. <br /> <br /> And very pleasant about it! <br /> <br /> Do we remember what was 1984? According to the media, we have become very sophisticated as far as we look or not. I tend to disagree at this point. Goldie knew it was fun and she did it. <br /> <br /> Like its lightest fare: Protocol, Overboard, Homeowner, Wild strikes, Private Benjamin, Looks like Old Times, Dirt, Death becomes her, First Wives Club and the remake of Out-of-Towners, know GOLDIE what she does ... she plays every role for the camp you can get out of there! Goldie knows her very well, and she knows what she can do really well. <br /> <br /> She always laughed and laughed at me. I loved her in Laugh-In and every thing she's ever been to. She never tried to be anything else but who she was ... and that is that bubbly, giggly, girl next door who looks very nice and has a smile and a laugh that will always touch me and remind me that life is pretty short and you just have to be relieved, because before you know it ... you are old, tortured and suffering from one of the inevitable ailments of life. If it's even coming so late. <br /> <br /> I appreciate Goldie for what she is: a lovely, comic actress.
