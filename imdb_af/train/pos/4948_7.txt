It is a beautifully crafted simplistic film that examines a theme, giving each viewer something different that they use. The point of departure is simple: An unnamed celebrity actor (Morgan Freeman) decides to explore for an upcoming role by visiting a store and watching people. He has particular interest in the cashier at the "10 Items of Less" track (Paz Vega), which he finds a friendly, strong and curious presence. <br /> <br /> Both actors play brilliantly and bring solid dimension to characters who are a character study. Not a conventional character study; they each represent worlds. The cashier's life is fueled by a hard and frustrating "real world", while the actor is so devastated in his fantasy that he cannot do simple tasks like phone numbers. He easily admits that he is sitting on a face when talking to people, and the whole point of investigating real people shows that he is not one of them. <br /> <br /> But not only is the actor inspired by real people for his work. ; We also see the reverse process. Several characters recognize "Him" and refer to how he inspired them with his movie. <br /> <br /> The cashier's favorite song Al Pasar la Barca, about how a girl refuses to hide behind beauty and prefers to pay (ie: do honest work) for boat trips, couldn't be better picked do not become. It is in line with the Vega character, the only shop employee with any brain or ambition, who is willing to work hard to succeed. (It's quite an aspiration, for someone who looks like Paz Vega.) It's a strange little movie, probably on a shoe liner. If you don't mind it is difficult to make a pacing and talky approach. The characters are perfectly confronted, and the effective acting makes them encouraging. A beautiful watch.
