The first time I saw it, I had half of it, but I looked and I later knew it was about a Salem gate trial. They focused on the Sara Good family. She is known for the curse of a priest who has become true. In the film it shows her daughter casinos and her husband the spirit of Ann Putnam. Sara's husband comes to the future and hunt this girl to save her soul. what happens at the end of the movie. Dorcas is portrayed as a 5-year-old witch, who is being burned at stake. What never happens Ann Putnam saves her from the flames. The girl is safe. She went to Ann Putnam's grave to see that it was not empty, but it was only because she was accusing her of witchcraft and killing her. Now that Ann Putnam saves her, her spirit has been redeemed, and she has not been poured out for the Salem gate trials.
