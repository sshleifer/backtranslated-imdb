Say the things you used and make the world go away. <br /> <br /> Well, Dave (David Hewlett) and Andrew (Andrew Miller) were in a pickle, one for eclipse and the other for kissing. a child. No one was guilty, but faced with complaints and their home being torn down, they ended up in now, nothing at all. The whole world, except for their home, went away. <br /> <br /> It's kind of weird, but funny too. What would you do if you were alone in the world? The two friends just enjoy each other's company and do what they want. But it quickly becomes fast, it seems. <br /> <br /> Then they start to improve their lives by hating memories. The sound effects during this were wonderful. <br /> <br /> Things got really strange at the end. This film was the product of great imagination, and written and directed by Vincenzo Natali, with the help of the two stars. It just needs to be seen.
