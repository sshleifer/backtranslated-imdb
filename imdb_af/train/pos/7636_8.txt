It was a few years since I saw it, but remember it and want to see it again. It has become a "therapy" for me with a personal experience of my own. <br /> <br /> A thirty-five year old man complains about a high school baseball game where he missed the ball and lost his team. He thinks about it 20 years later, "if I just hit that ball" and how his life would be better. Then he gets a chance to find out .... and gets a little more than he had negotiated. <br /> <br /> It reminds me so much when I was in high school, I tried twice for our drill / dance team and didn't make it. This team was the closest thing to a sadness in my school. If you were on it, you were "all that." I didn't try my last two years of HS and after the second time I really made it difficult. I hit my leg hard and cut just before tryouts, and wore panties to cover the bruise, and it didn't make me. It was in 1987. <br /> <br /> Over the years, even sometimes, I think, "If I didn't just hit my leg, I'd never wear those stupid boots." Now I'm not sitting and thinking my life will be better or even different if I made it, but when I saw this movie, I realized that we never really know how different things can be by changing one thing in the past no. . Who knows, the events would have changed to the point that I would not have met my son's father. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone who has that moment in the past they wish they could change. Be careful what you wish for !!!
