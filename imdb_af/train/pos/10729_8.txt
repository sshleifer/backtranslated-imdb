A few summer campers were actually accidentally sent by a robot in space. And the oxygen in the ship was short. They had to send someone to a space station around the gas tanks, etc., etc. To get. <br /> <br /> First, this movie's plot is not possible in real life. But it gives warm feelings to anything that is possible if you set your heart. <br /> <br /> It is great to see those young actors who look the same after so many years. (I saw this movie for the first time in the year 2000, it was filmed in 1986.) There are quite a few people in the movie still working in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The view was good from outer space. It doesn't seem unreal. It's about 2 hours, it runs so fast that you won't even see. You know it's not really, but you're just sucked to the end. <br /> Overall, this is a good family movie. <br /> <br />
