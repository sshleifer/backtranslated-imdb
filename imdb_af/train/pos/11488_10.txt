Last week I rented Zero Day from the local video store. I have never heard of the movie and I had my discussions about it. Just after I watched the box, I knew the movie was an Indian movie and therefore the quality would be less than a mainstream movie. <br /> <br /> I can tell you that after I finished on Saturday night, I started right from the beginning. The film was clearly based on the basic outline of what happened at the Columbine High School in April 1999, but what struck me was how credible the two main players were. My first time watching this movie, I wasn't quite sure I had left the real tapes left by the Columbine shooters. In the back of the head I knew what I was watching, could not really be, but at the same time the play was so convincing that you should keep your head shaking. <br /> <br /> Is the movie disturbing? Absolutely! Will you see things that will question you about the merits of the movie? Probably. I think what most people find disturbing is that they actually felt for the two main characters, Calvin and André (played by Cal Robertson and André Keuck). Why is this problematic for some people? Calvin and André are planning a massacre at their high school. I know for myself, I felt a tremendous sadness for André and Calvin. I had empathy for them because their lives came so terribly. They fell so deeply that they started a journey that could be stopped if only people around them noticed their fate. <br /> <br /> Zero Day is a phenomenal movie. This gives you a careful and personal look at events that most of us will only conclude on the news. It reminds you of the lives involved. And this makes you confuse how people come to this point. A week after I saw this movie, I thought about it. <br /> <br /> Those who didn't see Zero Day remember the following: The movie is independent with little or no budget and the movie is shot on camcorders. The material in the film is disturbing. It's not Hollywood's mainstream and there's no happy ending. <br /> <br /> But if you can put it all away, Zero Day is a movie that will stay with you and may help you open your eyes a little.
