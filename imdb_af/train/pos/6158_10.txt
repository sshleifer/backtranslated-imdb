What can I say about a story like this? This magical story followed me from my early childhood, with warm memories in my heart. The characters bring you to so many whimsical places that you want more from each scene. For example, in the market there were so many different flavors of lore. I loved the exotic dancers who accompanied the steel drums. <br /> <br /> The story line was wonderful. I wanted so badly for Landsbury to keep the preliminary children and stay with Mr.Brown for her, and find the other half of the game so that the men could win less weapons. <br /> <br /> I'm still a kid inside, and this movie appeals to my inner child like no other. This movie is my definite favorite of all time. I hope that all children can see and take these classics and be transported to another time.
