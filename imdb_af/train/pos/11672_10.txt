Excellent pirate entertainment! It has all the good ingredients to keep your attention - an exciting story of intrigue, a fiery lady pirate, called Spitfire Stevens (Maureen O'Hara), who is attracted to the irresistible Mr. Hawke (Errol Flynn) who is on a secret mission of his own. They make a nice romantic couple on the screen - sigh! <br /> <br /> Anthony Quinn is the average, bad pirate who weighs and defeats his ominous web of divide. I noticed Mildred Natwick's well-known face playing a supporting role as Mrs. MacGregor, the protector of the young Princess Patma (Alice Kelley). <br /> <br /> There are beautifully filmed scenery of coastlines, ships and the bay. . Much of the action also includes sword fighting collisions, ship battles, daring leap from Errol Flynn (Robin Hood aboard the ship!). Of the flaming redhead myself, I once heard in an interview from Maureen O'Hara that she had a big command of the bullwhip and could fly Flynn in a sword battle in those days, but it would not be necessary to do so here. don't test. <br /> <br /> Very enjoyable movie.
