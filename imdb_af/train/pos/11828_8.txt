"Dick Tracy" is one of our family's favorites - the actors are great - the arts are exceptional - the music is magic. Stephen Sondhemim's songs are sterile: "Back in Business" is energetic, "Earlier or Later" is just right, "he said. It's a wonderful experience. <br /> <br /> Stephen Sondhemim's songs are sterile : What can you lose, "is haunting - even songs such as" Live Alone and Like It "add to the story <br /> <br /> Love of the volatile top performances of Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, Glenn Head, Charlie Korsmo, Mandy Patinkin, James Caan, Dick Van Dyke, supporting villains ... The list is too long. And yes, even Madonna and Warren Beatty are wonderful. Written with a smile a minute (how many times have we looked at each other and said, "Wait a minute - I have a thought - it's gone!"). <br /> <br /> But, one of the most telling things in this movie is that everyone involved has a good time - and above all, the enjoyment of the viewer. So, if you don't already have one, why not give 'Dick Tracy' a chance - accept it for what it is - a Sunday comics come alive - and in a wonderful way !!
