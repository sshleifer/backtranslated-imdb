I was a young film student in 1979 when the Union of Soviet Filmmakers came to Sofia Bulgaria and presented Konchalovsky's Siberia. Tarkosvky's "Stalker" and Danelia'a "Herfsmarathon". I was amazed by the cosmopolitan dimension of the art form. Then and then I saw "Siberiade" 4 and 1/2 hours epic and was speechless. Better than Bertolucci's "1900". Far! <br /> <br /> Hope Andron will somehow get negative and one day "make full-length directors' recovered version!" On DVD of course! I also fought against most of my colleagues in defending this movie, which looked like Soviet movie with bad taste! Time is on my side.
