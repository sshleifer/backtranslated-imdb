I think I'm part of the silent minority who enjoyed this movie. Is this one of the best of the "Nightmare" series? Maybe not, but I had a lot of fun with it. Freddy Krueger achieves his evil, wisecracking potential. As parts 4 and 5 came to be similar to the series, I got this so-called final night installment ("New Nightmare" the actual final), bringing the series out of its slump. There are some good nightmarish grounds, including one where Breckin Meyer plays a stoner who gets waste, falls asleep and sticks in a video game that controls Freddy. It's both a very original and hilarious sequence, especially when we see it from the dream, like Super Mario. And Freddy ties out the funny one-liner, "Great graphics." And since the film was made about 10 years ago, it brought memories when Freddy started to control the Powerglove game. Anyone who remembers the first 8-bit Nintendo remembers the Powerglove. <br /> <br /> The cast is excellent. Lisa Zane is perfectly thrown into the lead. I haven't seen Yaphet Kotto since "The Running Man," and I think the last time I saw the movie was about 5 years ago. He is another great, underhanded actor who possesses a powerful screen presence. And who can forget the cameos? The best one is by Johnny Depp (of the first "Nightmare") who plays a spokesman for an anti-drug brand. <br /> <br /> The 3D order in the end is really great! So for those who want to watch this movie - rent or buy it on DVD! Hopefully all the expenses come with the 3D glasses, but I'm sure the video edition has removed the 3D element. <br /> <br /> I didn't see many things wrong with the movie. It even worked out on Freddy's background. The movie is a good mix of humor and scares, and the tailings are great. Could it give the franchise better justice? Of course it can. But Rachel Talalay did a good job. And to find the perfect conclusion is easier said than done. <br /> <br /> And in the end, I loved the montage over the opening credits. Fans of the series will be delighted and will regard it as a tribute to beloved Freddy. <br /> <br /> My Score: 7 (out of 10)
