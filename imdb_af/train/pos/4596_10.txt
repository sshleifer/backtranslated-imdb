This is Jackie Chan's best movie, and my personal favorite. After the disappointing U.S "The Protector" directed by James Glickenhaus, Jackie took the concept and hit it in Hong Kong. It's probably Jackie's most violent movie, with the audience touching on the groundbreaking stunts. <br /> <br /> The action is fast and furious, Jackie and his crew have made a lot of effort in the battle design. Bones are broken and blood is in the process of making this film as you see in the credits. <br /> <br /> The writing is a simple police and robbery bag, nothing special, after all it's written around the action. I have to say that the English version has a bit of dodgy dubbing, but it shouldn't be too much for you. <br /> <br /> So, get the boys around, crack the beer and enjoy. By the way, the film was nicknamed 'Glass Story' by the stunt staff. Why? I'll find out for you!
