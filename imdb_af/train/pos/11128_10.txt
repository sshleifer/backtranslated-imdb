First, I would like to say how good it is. It is amazing and sometimes shocking. And to say the least, I'm 11 years old and it's my favorite movie, I can definitely be a boring movie, but it's all but boring. It's like a journey through humanity. His sharp realism shows through this monumental masterpiece. It is a heartbreaking story of two downs and authors (VOIGHT AND Hoffman) who build a common friendship. Joe Buck (VOIGHT) is a naive Texan stud coming to New York to make it rich by entertaining women. Soon he will meet Rico 'RATSO' Rizzo (HOFFMAN), who is a poor man who is barely able to pay rent. Ratso becomes Joe's manager, but soon both men can't find Joe a job that steals their food. As they try to survive on the streets of New York, we realize how difficult it is. They can't get Joe a girl before they meet a lady at a party. Joe makes money and soon Joe Ratso takes on a Ratso's dream spot, Florida. The last five minutes are heartbreaking, but some of the best moments in the film. From MIDNIGHT COWBOY we get a sharp and sometimes disturbing urban view of life.
