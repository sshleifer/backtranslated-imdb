Nay Sayers of this movie is probably bitter with some serious unrequited love. It's a good movie for anyone who is able to understand Johnny Mathis's song, or any song from the era: Bobby Darin's, Beyond the Sea ... or Stan Getz's, The Girl From Ipanema, et al ... <br /> <br /> I measure movies how many times I have to see it before I'm satisfied. Chances have had me some good times. <br /> <br /> I also look at the synergy between the cast. . I thought they worked well together. <br /> <br /> Open your heart and let the comic magic of movie transport you. <br /> <br /> "Alan
