* Possible Spoilers * Although it's done before (and better) in 'Midnight Express' and 'Return to Paradise', Brokedown Palace still beats me. <br /> <br /> Here is the story of two young girls traveling through Thailand and being arrested on drug trafficking charges. Was it Clare Danes' Alice? Was it Kate Beckinsale's Darlene? Was it the handsome stranger they met on their journey? Neither of them really matters, as it is a story of friendship and trust and the limits on which they can be stretched. Throw Bill Pullman as an unenthusiastic lawyer and Jacqueline Kim as his Thai bride (and better lawyer than he is) and we have a nice little story that keeps the audience's attention. <br /> <br /> Brokedown Palace is nothing extraordinary, or notorious for any reason - it's not an original concept, it doesn't show sensational violence leading to the wannabe avant-garde crowd talking about "eager realism" or "difficult hit truths" - it's just a good story with some good performances. Bill Pullman is the weakest with his lazy draw and grave talk. I was very bored with the character. <br /> <br /> While being decent, Kate Beckinsale is nothing spectacular. She works well, but it's not exactly an unforgettable performance. <br /> <br /> Jacqueline Kim, however, is in fine shape. He makes a pleasant and defined character where there is really not much to work with. <Br /> <br /> But don't make a mistake - this is Clare Danes' movie. I've been a fan of her work for a long time, and that's no change. She enchanted in every scene she appeared, and if not for her, the movie would probably be in boring fare. I especially welcome her performance in the scene between her and Darlene's father. <br /> <br /> The movie also has a brilliant soundtrack. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
