I am glad I saw this film seen in the past by the director's other films. I thought the production values ​​were great like the costumes and bridges. It was interesting to see how the concept of spirit and demons was dealt with. <br /> <br /> I agree with some of the other comments on the scenes. They were sometimes difficult to follow. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, a moral story. It would be interesting to know what some Japanese viewers of the movie thought. This is a movie I would like to see again. <br /> <br /> Some scenes like those where Benkai and the Prince fight on a "psychic" level are well done. <br /> <br /> I came out of the theater and thought what just happened here. Intense.
