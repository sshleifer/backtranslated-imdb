I enjoyed this movie. I thought it was an excellent political excitement about something that had never happened before - a Secret Service Agent is getting bad and involved in an assassination. Unfortunately, for Michael Douglas's character, "Pete Garrison," they think HE is the mole, but he's not. <br /> <br /> He's just a morally defective agent who has a relationship with the First Lady! As he does, he cannot give an acceptable polygraph exam and it suspects the number one when it is revealed. There is a plot to kill the president. <br /> <br /> "Garrison" is forced to go on the lamb but at the same time he is still trying to do the right thing by protecting the president. Douglas does a good job in this role. I don't always care for the people he plays, but he's an excellent actor. Keifer Sutherland ("David Breckinridge") is as good (at least in this) as the fellow SS boss hunting Douglas until he is convinced he has told the truth. When he works, the two of them work in the finals to discover and then stop, if they can, the plot. The crooks are also interesting. Also, I've never - and unfortunately - will see a first lady who looks as good as Kim Basinger. <br /> <br /> It's just a smooth action movie that is start-to-finish. Are there holes in it? Of course; probably a number of them, and a reason why you see so many critical comments. However, it is unfair here. It's just not intelligent enough for the geniuses here on this site. My advice: chill, just go for the ride and enjoy all the action and plot. Yes, it gets a little Rambo-ish at the end, but otherwise it gets high points for entertainment ..... it's about movies.
