One of the better Vance movies succeeds more in interesting plot and inventive direction by none other than Michael Curtiz. This time, a generally hated financier was shot dead in the head - in his closed and bolted upstairs bedroom. Philo Vance, who has heard of the situation while on his way to Italy, decides to end his holiday and try to solve what he thinks is a murder and which everyone is considering suicide. William Powell loves Philo Vance as you will find. He never seems to push and is always very smooth in what he says and does. Powell is assisted by a host of talented actors. Some leading character characters and actresses such as Mary Astor as a cousin who hated her uncle, Ralph Morgan as the dead secretary, Paul Cavanaugh as a competitive dog lover, Arthur Hohl as a mysterious butler, Helen Vinson as the next door blonde and two really good performances by James Lee as Chinese cook and Portly Eugene Palette as a sensible police detective. In the mix add a wonderful comic twist by Etienne Girardot as a public reminder, who always misses his meal. This is the depth of suspects, and a story that turns lots of plots and turns turns the Kennel Murder Case into a fast, surprising puzzle.
