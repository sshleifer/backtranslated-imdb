After seeing the Peter O'Toole version recently, I was ready to be surprised by the clever writing in this version. Little time is spent on the battle, which I prefer. Instead, we get all the many motives underlying both French and English (which kept Normandy) politicians and priests who killed her. Even the worst hypocrite of all of them, the Archbishop, leaves us with the idea that "Of course she was innocent. The innocent always had to suffer for the ambitions of the powerful. She had no idea what she said, no idea. of the implications of blasphemy or of the church. Unskool, she had no idea what the church's position on such matters was even. "<br /> <br /> Preminger was true to the myths surrounding her death and I appreciated The band's preview of the flames and fires. Why? They used gas in the movie, and 2 of them stopped. Suddenly the air pressure blew out and the flames jumped upright. Luckily for her, they don't have to repeat the shot because it was so realistic: she was burned !! Beautiful traumatic introduction to an Iowa girl for her new acting career. <br /> <br /> John Gielgud performed well. He is the English politics that orchestrates the performance. He also makes the point that when you die someone you don't want to be around to see them die. Next time you can shrink from your 'duty' ... not that such delicacies want to bother the soul of our will-president. Our Christians, even the most anti-Semitic, have no problem falling back on the Old Testament when it comes to the death penalty, even if it is violated by Jesus' words. Bring on public prosecutions like this girl. Melt burned meat can bring our respectful people to our souls' senses. <br /> <br /> The only small "pick" I have about this movie is that we are not shown why the priest who so demanded her is so suddenly indignant, even to the point of madness. There must have been more character of his character, more dialogue - if the sudden 'senses' come, it doesn't make sense. <br /> <br /> And whether Graham Greene deliberately or not, St. Joan is such a confident little startup, you are almost but not quite, she is happy to meet her turnout. And when she denied life in prison, for some reason I thought of Anne Sexton, the poet who had accused Sylvia Plath of stealing her death when she committed suicide. You have to wonder! <br /> <br /> If there was ever a good example of obsessive thought and logic-dense compartments, this is one. St Joan had to have been Buddhist and silenced the "voices in her mind".
