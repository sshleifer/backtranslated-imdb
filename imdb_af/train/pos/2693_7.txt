Although the story is essentially routine, and the "surprise" ends, nothing but a bad joke on the audience, you can see what these good actors have attracted to the project. It gives them the kind of roles in which good actors can shine and shine. The film is made blameless - for its time. This was made again in 2000 as "Under Suspicion" and if you just want to see one version of the story (that's all it deserves, really), I recommend the latter, with Hopkins's recent direction and the more explicit references to plot points which can only hint the original. The end, however, still blows. (** 01/01)
