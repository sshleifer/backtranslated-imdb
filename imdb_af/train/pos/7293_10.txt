What do I say about such an absolutely beautiful movie? I saw it at Atlanta, Georgia Dragoncon, as it is my capital. I am very much a sci-fi aficionado and enjoy action type movies. I got up all night and was ready to call it a day when I noticed this movie playing that morning. It's not a sci-fi or action movie of any kind. Let me just start by saying that I'm not a fan of Witchblade or Eric Etebari after watching a few episodes (his performance in it was cute and robot). But he really managed to win me in this show. I really mean conquering me. After seeing Cellular, I didn't think there was much in the way of this man's actions. But his performance as Kasadya was simply incredible. He was exceptionally convincing as the evil demon. But there was so much detail in this character, it surely surprised me. I watched it later online and found that Eric won the best actor award which is well worth taking into account his best career and respect. Now I read about the fx of this and the production of this project and let me just say that I didn't pay attention to them (sorry Brian). They were very well done, but I was even more impressed with the story - which I think was even more its purpose. (Watch movies like Godzilla with great effects just got me right). I couldn't sleep after this movie thought it over and over in my head. The situation of an abusive family is never an easy one. I showed the trailer to my friend online and she almost cried because it affected her so much that they were abusive. This is a film I constantly consider and will highly recommend.
