I saw the first film in my plays and acting at Tulane. I was amazed at how beautiful and raw this documentary was. It is a sincere look at the unsaved reality of a life of loneliness. The family is fascinating and I thought it showed Little Edie in her core. ** As a lace note, my professor even told me the whole movie was filmed, Little Edie surprised one of the camera men. ** The beauty that I find comes from the naturalness of the family's dysfunction. This is evident in the relationship between mother and daughter who can not only function in society and begin with the wish of Little Edie's rehabilitation to society. Overall, the film is of aesthetic quality and is the portrayal of surprising beauty. Two thumbs up!
