This little appreciated movie is one of my favorites. I can watch it over and over. Dreyfus and Braga are masterful, but Raul Julia steals the show! A tannie cheek, scary humorous Gomez Addams, with just the right tone for this relentless spoof of this often told story. <br /> <br /> Generally, the remaining and untouched Moon over Parador shows you reality and joins the fun of the screen. Two thumbs up!
