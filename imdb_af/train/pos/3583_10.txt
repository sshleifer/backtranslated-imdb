It was a good movie, but it had the worst end. I think I've ever seen !!! The actors were wonderful and showed great talent. The whole story was twisted and unforgiving, which made it entertaining. As good as the movie was, the whole movie was judged by the end, which was terrible! Perhaps a sequel could eliminate this bad end.
