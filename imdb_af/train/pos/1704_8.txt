"I went here to get away from this kind of thing!" The small village sheriff complains. <br /> <br /> "It happens a lot in Chicago?" Asking his deputy. <br /> <br /> Well, no, not really. The plot is that a group of Martians miss a Halloween backlash from Orson Welles World War as a version of a true Martian invasion and come to the conclusion they must enter the action! What follows is a lot of accidents involving the Martia's random attempts to conquer the village of "Big Bean, IL". Everyone believes their kids are in really good costumes, except for the Sheriff's daughter and her friend, a kid in a duck suit. <br /> <br /> The Martians themselves are comical, and you get the impression that they are no threat to anyone except themselves very early. It's a fun family movie.
