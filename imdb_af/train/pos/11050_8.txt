Well, magic works in mysterious ways. This film of 4 prisoners, who are trying to escape with the help of proverbs, written by another prisoner centuries ago, was a wonderful occult thriller with a surprising end and a lot of tension. Even if it had something of a play (almost everything happens in the cell), it never got boring and it performed very well. In the tradition of "Cube" you are trapped with the characters and even if they were criminal, you developed some sympathy with some of them, just to change your mind through the twists that the story takes. Some events caught you and there was always a hint of madness in the air. Quite intense and entertaining and as I didn't expect (a friend hired it), it was a positive surprise!
