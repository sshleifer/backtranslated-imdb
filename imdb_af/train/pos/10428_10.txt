Wonderful movie that should be boring in theory, but delivered with subtle and incredible play I have long despaired of finding. Rather than relying on clich√©s and overly dramatic moments, the plot unfolds through a series of incredibly realistic moments. The main characters are not perfect, and so with regard to them as people you can know is easy. The film is not trying to laugh, or an ideal on the audience, but simply the possibility of true love in any circumstances. <br /> <br /> I'm now restless and waiting for the weekend so I can see the sequel. A moving, thoughtful, funny look at love I think should be an absolute romantic classic up there with Casablanca and Breakfast at Tiffany's. Will even soften the hardest heart.
