I question anyone who says they don't care about this movie. Some reviewers said it did not have enough action, some said it was too long, and so on. Don't listen to them !!! If you like Shawshank Redemption and / or Braveheart, you'll definitely love this movie! <br /> <br /> The appearances are great! Tim Roth, John Hurt and Jessica Lang are allsuperb and Liam Neeson does an admarible job and is a very impressive character due to its size. The Cinemaphotography was brilliant and breathtaking. It's on the few movies I've seen in my life (along with Shawshank) that were virtually flawless of casting, directing, writing, acting, etc. <br /> <br /> I was surprised it wasn't in the top 50 or 100 movies reviewed. I felt so passionate about having just registered with IMDB so that I could let everyone know the right kick. I saw this movie about 10 times (every time with another person) and everyone loved it! You have to be awake and pay attention for the first 30 minutes, as they put quite a few characters in the beginning. If you have the attention longer than most of these young children, write reviews for the movies on this site if you like this movie! Come on ... all 3 Lord of the Rings movies in the top 9 and the Matrix at # 32?!?! It should show you the age group of most reviewers here! <br /> <br /> This is a top 50 movie !!!
