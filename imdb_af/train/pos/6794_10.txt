I read through most of the comments posted here and all I can say that most of these posters have major problems in life. Unlike most games, this show was fun. Mr. Shatner, whose glasses in ALL he does, was again the hit of the show. He is really bubbly personality shining like a beacon where he ever goes. He's fun and lets you smile and that's exactly what the show does. The dancers and questions, the round-about fashion they offered, only add to the appeal. And while there is a lot of money at stake, it's fun. The pressure (tension) that exists in most game shows does NOT exist here. Several people who posted messages complained about how much time the dancers played and picked questions. & C, like Millionaire doesn't have similar time spreaders. All I can say is that most of you have missed the whole concept. The idea here is to enjoy FUN & ENJOY. There is something for everyone. Qustions for your knowledge, eyebrows (the dancers), tension, Mr. Shatner's wonderful, fun-filled personality test. Well, if it doesn't get parents, I feel bad for you; and if that is not enough, you can get rich! I really miss the show. From ALL shows the games that were ever going on, and to be honest, I hate games, that's the one I really wanted. The only other game show I've ever had was Match Game.
