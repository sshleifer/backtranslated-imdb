I remember when I first saw this briefly, I really laughed so loudly, as with many other movies I've seen, no sound came out! Curly is really great at the singing opera in this one, I'm surprised he didn't consider a career as a professional singer, because he was really good! <br /> <br /> If you noticed, it was filmed near the end of Curly's career as a Stooge, you could really tell he had changed because he lost weight and was thinner, his voice was deepened , his face was to be fed with wrinkles, although he could still pull it off, he looked like he was fifty at the age of forty. This was because he had very small strokes before his great one who ended his career. Be still able to pull it out in his last! <br /> <br /> If you don't mind Curly getting really sick, it's actually one of their funniest shorts. I know I didn't think Curly really changed, because I still thought he was wonderful! <br /> <br /> 10/10
