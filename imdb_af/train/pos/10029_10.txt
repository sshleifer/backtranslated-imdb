Why are people bitching on this movie and not about terrible movies like The Godfather. Titanic is the largest film of the 21st century. With great acting, directing, effects, music and generally everything. This movie is always dumped by everyone because one day somebody said they didn't like it anymore, so most of the world decided to agree. There is nothing wrong with this movie. All I can say is that this movie is not just the Oscar of all time, the most money ever made and unfortunately one of the most underrated movies I've ever seen. In addition, it is truly the best movie of all time. The only movies that come close are like Star Wars and the Lord of the Rings trilogy or anything from the Masters Hitchcock or Spielberg or Tim Burton. These are all good movies and directors, but no one agrees with James Cameron's TITANIES Masterpiece.
