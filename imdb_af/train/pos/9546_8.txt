Directed by duo Yudai Yamaguchi (Battlefield Baseball) and Jun'ichi Yamamoto "Meatball Machine" is apparently a remake of Yamamoto's 1999 movie of the same name. I doubt I'll ever get the chance to see the original, so I'll just comment on this. First of which is the "Meatball Machine"? A simple in now pretentious low budget industrial splatter flick full of great makeup effects and gore. It's not something you will eventually write books, but it is entertaining if you dig this kind of cinema. <br /> <br /> "Meatball Machine" follows the well-known plot. Boy loves girl but is too scared to ask her on a date. Boy finally meets girl. Girl is infested by a parasitic alien creature that changes her into a murderous cyborg. Son, in turn, also changes in the said thing and goes on a quest to save his love. Will he succeed? Who gives a damn, as long as there is blood and death, I'm happy. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple, relatively clicked, but it's good enough to put the film's course straight into a bloody confrontation. between the two front characters. There is a subplot that focuses on how the parasite infected by the girl came to their lives. And yes, it also shows more violence. I am happy. Acting is what you would expect from a no-budget patrol. It's not really painful for the ears, but it's not really good either. <br /> <br /> The movie's greatest attraction in addition to the violence and gore (as I haven't mentioned enough yet) is the cyborg designs. Done by Keita Amemiya whose work in creating foreign creatures and costumes for both movies and video games is well known. The Nekroborgs as they are called in "Meatball Machine" look incredibly detailed. Without the use of CGI Amemiya's designs is a breathtaking fusion of meat and metal, painfully wonderful in their appearance. Be able to turn different parts of the body into cool weapons such as saws, rocket rifles, shotguns and so on and so on. Although you can easily recognize the cheapness of the movie, Nekroborgs is an A movie class. <br /> <br /> "Meatball Machine" is "Tetsuo The Iron Man" mixed with Alien, all done in low budget and extra. ketchup off. It's an amazingly entertaining movie that ignores the modern special effects and proves that the platter genre is still alive and kicking.
