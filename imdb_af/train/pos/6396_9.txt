You think you had a hard time? You should watch this movie. Carl Brashear is the symbol of courage and determination. What this man had to go through to become a naval diver should inspire us all. And much, after seeing this movie, I learned that what is shown is not even half of it! Cuba Gooding, Jr. is doing his best to date as Brashear. De Niro, as usual, is good like the southern redneck that trains him. George Tillman in his second major feature (after "Soul Food") made a quantum leap as a movie maker. If you want to be moved and inspired, surely you should check this one.
