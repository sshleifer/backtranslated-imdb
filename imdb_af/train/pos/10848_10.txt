... Heads, hands and feet - a bond from the past, just like Alien Fruits. A triple dreamy there. Those who claim they don't like this movie are either heartless or under 40, and had no experience of the right thing. Sad to them. It's a painfully well-behaved little picture that is a great way to surrender an hour or two, and will probably not even fade on the second show. Stephen Rae, Timothy Spall as the heavy drummer (in many ways, the most beautiful figure of all), and Bill Nighy - a new name for me - as the neurotic singer and foreman turn everything into super-performance, and Juliet Aubrey has beautiful Do Eyes to deal with some sharp acting as Karen, trying to keep the band together as they are spectacularly self-destructive. <br /> <br /> The Syd Barrett / Brian Wilson echoes are loud and clear, Mott the Hoople in front of one in all their inflated ridicule, and the writing is never over a minute. Don't compare it to Spinal Tap or The Rutles or The Full Monty - it's unfair at all. The closest comparison is The Commitments, and it's not bad. And any film that reminds you of Blood Wine Pig - a band I never remember seeing, but the name stays on - well, it shows that someone in the team knows what they're about. <br /> <br /> A little joy, and thanks for the memory. <br /> <br /> Oh yes ... and I still have one - tight little fingers; a-a-and what about SteelEYE Team ... Spooky TOOTH ... Ten Inch NAILS someone? (You must see the movie or be on the go)
