This movie is an eye-opener for those who can only have the glamorous lifestyle of the stars. It tells you how people who want to do well can't. Plus the bomb blast scene is very real. <br /> <br /> What you read and learned just doesn't happen! <br /> <br /> Can your BP level increase by 10% <br /> <br /> All actors played their part very well. <br /> <br /> Some scenes can / could be avoided to include teenagers. <br /> <br /> This movie is quite mature in nature. <br /> <br /> Not a movie that can be seen with family. <br /> <br /> Casting is great !!!
