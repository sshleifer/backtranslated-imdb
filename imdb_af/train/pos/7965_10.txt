This movie was wonderful ... it made me laugh, it makes a bang, and most of all talk animals in it !! This movie must be seen by all kinds of people! this is one of my favorite movies, and i just love to comment on it !!! It's so sad and a wonderful story that makes a big and hearty movie! My favorite character is shadow. This is because I think he is the most interesting and charming. I had a golden retriever like a shadow, I miss him so much !!! He was my best friend and I knew that when he died, he would be in a happier place, but I miss him with my whole heart !! this movie is the best i love it and everyone should! Keep your pets, whatever they do, cherish them forever !!!
