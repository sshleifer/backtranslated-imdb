To my surprise, I enjoy 'Spacecamp', I remember about 13 years ago, and recently I rented it again. I was very impressed. It is clear that the special effects in the current space films such as Armageddon and Deep Impact are much better than those in SpaceCamp. However, this film had a story - a very stereotypical eighties story where you can hardly name the next line of dialogue before you hear it. But that's what I liked about it - they no longer make movies like this, so it was a refreshing change. It was interesting to see Kelly Preston, Leaf Phoenix and Lea Thomson in early roles, with Tom Skerrit and Kate Capshaw adding substance to the light and soft plot. Absolutely love the robot called Jinx, it was very cute, but unfortunately it had more emotion than some of the main characters. The film was almost inspiring in its own way, and it was interesting to note that it was filmed at the NASA Space Camp in Alabama (I think).
