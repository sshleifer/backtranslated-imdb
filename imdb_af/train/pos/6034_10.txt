Last November I had the opportunity to see this film at the Reno Film Festival. I must say it was a lot of fun. Aside from some technical errors, it was a good experience. I loved writing and acting, especially the guy who played the lead. There is a lot of heart in this movie, much to know. I had a chance to talk to some of the filmmakers after it was finished, and they looked really nice. All in all, the whole movie was just a positive experience, and I would definitely recommend it. The story was entertaining and cool, as a woman I had a lot of trouble with the chief, and I really could understand his problems. The movie does a great job of giving us people we can sympathize with. The friends in the movie are really well written, they are realistic. I know people like this, I just wish Imy friends and I can sound as cool as these people when we talk. The whole movie is just really cool, I wish there were more movies out there. <br /> <br /> - Jayden
