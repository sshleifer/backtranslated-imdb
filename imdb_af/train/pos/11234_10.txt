It is a brilliant and well-made contribution from a group of fans. If it is made in a back room on a green screen, it is storyline complex and twist, and it is characters that show realistic depth and dimension. The cgi created by the crew is awesome. Although this may be a bit shaky during the first season, it has been well thought out and well shot. Some supporters may have thought that the Star Trek Franchise has ended the early cancellation of Enterprise, but these fans do not accept an answer. I recommend it to fans and newcomers, 10/10 hidden border staff. <br /> <br /> Make it so ...
