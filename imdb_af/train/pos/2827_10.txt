It's probably one of the worst movies ever made. It's terrible. But it's so good! It's probably best if you don't see it expecting a gripping plot and something terribly smart and entertaining, because you're going to be disappointed. However, if you want to see it, you see 50 million vases and Goro's fantastic hair / bad English, you're in for a real surprise. The harder you think of the movie, the worse it gets, unless you have a competition to see most plot holes / screws, in which case you have more hours of entertainment. I really recommend this movie for the bored or the hard-hap-smap fans. And even then, the latter has to be a little careful, because Goro's Japanese supporters were a little upset about it, they thought he was selling himself out. (He wasn't really, not when Johnny Kitagawa (who was the executive producer) could do it for him).
