A trio of friends, sergeants all in the British army, throw them over Imperial India. Tough to each other, they meet their biggest and most deadly challenge when they meet the revival of a horrible cult and its demented, irreconcilable guru. Now they have to rely on the lowest servant of the regiment, the aquifer GUNGA DIN, to save the queen's soldiers of certain massacres. <br /> <br /> More based on The Three Musketeers as Kipling's classic poem, it's a wonderful adventure epic - a worthy entry into Hollywood's Golden Year of 1939. Filled with excitement and humor, while romantic interludes To a minimum, it holds the viewer's importance and holds it to the (sentimental) conclusion. <br /> <br /> The performance nuances of the three stars, Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen and Douglas Fairbanks Jr., are virtually fruitless. to discuss, since they are actually all third of a single organism - inseparable and for all purposes & purposes, indivisible. However, it does not diminish the fun, just to see if they have a wonderful time. <br /> <br /> (It is interesting to note that McLaglen boasts a premier World War I military career, Fairbanks has a star record in World War II - mostly in ominous matters and earns no less than 4 Honorary knights after the conflict, while Grant allegedly worked on British Intelligence, had an eye for Hollywood Nazi sympathizers.) <br /> <br /> The actual acting laurels should go to Sam Jaffe here go, sad in the title role. He infuses the humble man with radiant dignity and tremendous courage, making the last line of Kipling's poem ring true. He is unforgettable. <br /> <br /> Montague Love is well-stalled as the regimental major, while Eduardo Ciannelli is Evil Incarnate as the Thuggee guru. The rest of the film, Joan Fontaine, Robert Coote, Lumsden Hare, is effective but has little to do. Movie Mavens will recognize Cecil Kellaway in the little role of Miss. Fontaine's dad. <br /> <br /> The movie tackles its villains. The demonic Thuggee cult, worshipers of the devastating Kali, Hindu goddess of destruction, was the curse of Indian life for 6 centuries, ripping rituals to 30,000 victims a year. In 1840, the British army, in conjunction with a number of princesses, eventually managed to suppress religion. From now on, it will be the stuff of novels and nightmares.
