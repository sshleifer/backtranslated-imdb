The first 2 parts aim to reduce the rise of wasteful wars and to govern by nationalist savages. The third part speculates that advancement and exploration of the moon and beyond is the key to ensuring a meaningful use of human talents and resources. It has speeches that some viewers are dismissed as naive or bombastic, but it excites others. It depicts a spacecraft / launcher and a helicopter, along with ingenious mass communication devices, elevators, flat panel panels and wireless intercoms. This is probably wrong about windowless buildings in the future. But it depicts a childish vision of unlimited scientific / technological research. <br /> <br /> For me it looks like a movie about a group of rational thinkers led by a Spinoze-like morality in their quest to immortalize themselves and live ethically through scientific advancement and a united world government . The advancement characters (like the two cables) believe that humanity can live forever by retaining our experiments and progress for future generations, which always stand on our humanity as if it were happening on giants' shoulders. <br /> <br /> Arthur C. Clarke (2001 author: A Space Odyssey) introduced this movie to Stanley Kubrick as an example of an excellent SF movie. Kubrick hated it and said he would never watch another movie based on Clarke's suggestions (source: Clarke's special millennial introduction to his 2001 novel). Although the former Clarke kept it at the top of his list, someone asked him about the best SF movies. It has a beautiful Menzies art design, but mediocre special effects (especially the toy tanks). <br /> <br /> I loved it personally and think it is excellent of modernity's zealot. It's a little naive about the likelihood of creating a society without crime for a long time. It also seems indefensible about the inevitability of progress. It seems to me that we can just as easily return to the dark ages or at least as stagnant in science as we kill ourselves by overcrowding or by our inability to escape the next major natural disaster. But it gives a good picture of the importance of taking risks against public and child educator outrage for possible threats of space accidents and deaths. This allows us to choose the side of progress on smaller desires for safety or comfort or happiness: <br /> <br /> CABAL: "Too much (rest) and too soon, and we call it death. MAN no rest and no end, he must go ahead - conquer beyond conquest, this small planet and its winds and roads, and all the laws of mind and matter that limit it, then the planets are around and finally abound the stars And if he has conquered all the spaces of space and all the mysteries of the time, he will still begin. "<br /> <br /> CABAL:" If we are no longer animals, we must our little bits of happiness sail and live and suffer and succeed, no more caring - than all the other animals do - or did. {He points to the stars.} "That's it - whether it's all the universe - or nothing?" (Quotes from the script). <br /> <br /> If it seems like a rationalization for the whole society to progress, then the councilors (of the world government) will look technologists. But these "technocrats" allow their citizens to become artisans or other passions freely, and they must be repressed by government bans, laws of science and experimentation, and other mandates and restrictive use of force that will change their critics in tyrants . <br /> <br /> In fact, a large group of rebels in the plot feel stalked by all the advances in science and technology of the council, and so they try to put an end to progress and the council's freedom to experiment. , is terminated. However, progress-oriented counseling will not suppress the acquittal of the rebels, but only prepare a peace gas in times of distress and just want freedom and space to follow its progress. <br /> <br /> It's also a story about the freedom to do science as much as it is about the wonders of progress. Many people in our society would actually agree with some of these basic sites, except in cases of social bias (for example, many want to ban cloning) or naturalism (some do not want us to move freely, and rather we will only be wiped out on the real time while it is addicted to the earth) or fear / reason (some believe we are not ready for advanced science / technology as we can destroy ourselves). But Cabal (the president of the council) has an answer to the danger of danger: "Our (scientific) revolution did not abolish death or danger. It simply made death and danger worthwhile" (script).
