I had the opportunity to watch the filming in the Slavic Village Broadway area. I couldn't wait to see the final copy. <br /> <br /> See this movie at the Cleveland Premier last Friday, I didn't laugh. aloud on a comedy in a long time! It's a good slapstick. The Russo Brothers did good work. The whole movie does their best comic acting ... No slow or dry segments ... George Clooney is one of my favorite actors and he is wonderful as the lame safe breaker in this movie. I was the apron of William H. Macy as villain "Riley" and Michael Jeter's "Toto" they hold in your "stitches". I believe they have the funniest roles in the whole movie.
