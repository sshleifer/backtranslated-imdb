Just finished watching the movie and wanted to give my own opinion (and justice) to the movie. <br /> <br /> First of all, getting things right does not make this movie something other than a solid action. comedy movie. It is not aimed at revolutionizing the film industry and obtaining critical awards, nor does it want to be regarded as one. If you really want to enjoy this movie, I suggest you throw away your critical attitude and your longing for a good plot because you won't find anyone in it. Let's continue in the movie. <br /> <br /> I had low expectations for this movie, simply because it didn't have a strong plot (yes, movies, I also underestimated this movie), but I never expected myself to watch this movie so much to enjoy. I enjoyed it even more than the Stephen Chow movie (which I find to be Kung Fu Hustle's best effort and would have chosen a 9 as well). Action is stiff and epic while the comedy falls in the right places. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS warning, I think The action can be unreal, but why would I want to see a serious basketball movie? There are many other sports films (drama) that have done well, why create another? SPOILERS STOP <br /> <br /> I'm not even sure why you're reading it. Go ahead and watch it. Just remember, don't think - just look, enjoy, smile, laugh and <br /> <br /> Every time they (the film industry) create masterpieces like Pulp Fiction or The Godfather movies, and sometimes they create movies that are better off in the hope dump. I'm not saying Kung Fu Dunk deserves the recognition that the previous examples again when we talk about Stephen Chow-ish comedy, this one is a top ten. Highly recommended if you love: -no brainer movies with really good action -Kung Fu -Daath Trance -Kung Fu and comedy -What's the cock, watch it. you will have a good time. <br /> <br /> 9/10 the cast of Kung Fu Dunk. ^ _ ^
