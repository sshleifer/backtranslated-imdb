This movie is available from David Shepard and Kino on the Hollywood front There was Fort Lee, NJ, although it is a shortened version with only the rear screen sections. I'm not sure Blackhawk Films just had a movie. print these parts, or they worked out the other scenes. The original Blackhawk version has a movie writer. The full feature survives, but the imprint for this version had some nitrate decomposition, and a few sections look bad, so maybe the Blackhawk version has been edited. <br /> <br /> Targeted by Maurice Tourneur, the film Tourneur has himself, or more likely a caricature of himself. The same can be said by director Emile Chautard and future director Joseph von Sternberg. <br /> <br /> Country lass Mary (Doris Kenyon) longs for a romantic man to wipe her off her feet. She dreams of a troubadour that will woo her, but is constantly interrupted by the only available local boy, Johnny Applebloom. <br /> <br /> Means Hile, a New York movie company (actually New Jersey) filmed westerners in the countryside. Mary sees an Indian (in full headgear) and raises an alarm - a scene filmed by the film company spoiled. She is immediately attracted to the movie star Kenneth Driscoll (Robert Warwick). He encouraged her to leave her home and try to become an actress in the big city. <br /> <br /> When she arrives at the studio, she discovers that everything is fake. The doors and walls are just apartments that are hastily mounted for the set. The ugly walk of the Western hero or the happy leftover of the heroine is also merely observable. The sets are at a large rotating stage, so the sun's angle can even be manipulated. The black maid at the studio records all the pictures of the movie stars. The signs on the wall say "Positive No Smoking", but everyone smokes anyway. Even the titles of the film (which are nicely illustrated) emphasize everything fake about the cinematic life. <br /> <br /> Movie star Driscoll is just as disillusioned with the whore of everyday movies. He makes a temporary division of girl Vivian (June Elvidge) to pursue this "exciting" country girl. His plans are bumpy when Mary's screen test is a stinker. We don't see the real movie, but the audience's painful reaction to it. <br /> <br /> Maria was devastated, but she didn't want to admit everyone at home that she was a failure, so she went to see Driscoll and dressed with him in the studio cafeteria with other extras as policemen, soldiers, cowboys, etc. <br /> <br /> Mary decides to stay with Driscoll. At a party with their movie "friends," she agrees to marry him, although there is not much love between them. Surprisingly, her mother appeared, with a cake especially for Maria's birthday. This causes Mary to re-value her future. <br /> <br /> This film has all sorts of fascinating scenes from studios, movie sets, changing rooms, editing rooms, etc. If you've always wondered what happened afterwards The screens when a quiet movie is made, look at the movie behind the curtain.
