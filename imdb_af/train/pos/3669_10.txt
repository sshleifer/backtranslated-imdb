This film captures the absurd essence of a remaining American patriotic actor - one who believes his work (and politics) is so important to the American people as the opinions of the President himself. Alan Bates endorses this attitude perfectly like Michael Baytes, and I will definitely remember Bates as this character. It's a movie for Canadians and Americans. It is a valuable piece of cinema, which she can hear through the magic of making a movie, how easy it is for the producer and director to lose full control of the will of the actors and countless outside forces. Wonderful, "Hollywood North" does not suffer from the topic it portrays: Peter O'Brian accurately and accurately controls, and commands both the serious "behind the scenes" section of the movie and the movie inside the movie, "Flight to Bogota" with clarity and insight. If you're interested in the white and strength of Canadian theater, Hollywood North is a great place to start.
