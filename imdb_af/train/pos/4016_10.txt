This wonderful little film has all the elements that made the Spaghetti Western so exciting and fun: GREAT music (by one of the few .. not the only .female composer to work in the genre, Nora Orlandi), EXCITING ( and many malignant for the day!), and BEAUTIFUL scenery and sets (already in Almeria, Spain, of course). It also has a very good story with a nice tragic romance edge. The actors do wonderful work - with truly striking performances by Lawrence Dobkin and Rosalba Neri (the most important role for a female in a Spaghetti Western. Outside Cardinals in Leone's "Once Upon a Time in the West"). Without placing any spoilers, let me just say that this movie is one of the best ends of any movie I've ever seen!
