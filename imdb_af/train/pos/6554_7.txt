OK what I say: <br /> <br /> The movie was excellent. I'm a big Nancy fan and I've read 1-56 original books and I've read further. I'm now at 96. Beware of villains who give this movie a lower grade than it should have. All clues indicate a wonderful movie! I loved the whole thing. So what Nancy is in the present time. She is still old-fashioned as she is in the books! People who haven't read more than 5 books complain about Nancy's view. I read them all and I think Emma is perfect and Nancy was perfect. I found parts of the movie spooky. I loved the exciting car racing and got aways. I loved the clues. I solved the riddle myself! It was really great. I suggest you see it since people complaining know nothing about A who is a good movie and B about Nancy Drew. Go see it. It may not be worthy of Oscar, but it's really a good movie.
