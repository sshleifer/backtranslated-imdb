I agree with everyone who posted. <br /> <br /> I've been watching it a while ago, but I'll tell you, when I hear some music from this anime, I am reminded of the story, the beautiful animation, the characters and the feeling that I got it when I watched it, and it makes me cry (such a happy but sad feeling). However, I find that the love story has been somewhat chased in it and has not explained it well, but it did not ruin any part of the viewing experience. <br /> <br /> I was so much into this anime Afterwards I just had to do research (and watch the end a few more times) and I got all my answers and much more. I love how they set up historical legends to fit in with this anime. It was wonderful and just wanted to explore me a lot more. (I have always been very interested in some historical figures related to this anime) <br /> <br /> I think it should have been a longer series, but if all they had to do was work beautifully taken out. I would recommend it to anyone who loves emotional anime with an excellent story, well-built characters (some mysterious) and some fantasy action. <br /> <br /> Even though it was on an H game, it didn't have any of those things in it and I actually prefer it. (I have no problem with adult anime, in most cases I prefer it)
