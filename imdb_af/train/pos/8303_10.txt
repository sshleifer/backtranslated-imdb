This movie literally has every single movie cliche and everyone works to its advantage. Straight from Lethal Weapon Gary Busey wisecracks, shoots and chuckles through this movie with such reckless abandonment it can't help but entertain and entertain. There are tanks, helicopters, machine gun fights, grenades and ice-vans, and if they aren't good enough to watch this movie, how about the best one ... Danny Trejo. And if you don't know who Danny Trejo is, you probably won't like this movie.
