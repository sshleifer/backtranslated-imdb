My favorite Jackie Chan movie will always be "Drunken Master" (1978), followed by this film of 1985, "Police Story." In it, Chan plays a Hong Kong super-colon who is a notorious crime shepherd and his gang, and is then assigned to protect the man's friend (Brigitte Lin) so that she can change the evidence of the state. As the story goes on, the gunman sends his goons to send Lin, but Chan takes matters into his own fists and feet, while the girl, Maggie Cheung, keeps bay. Like 'Drunken Master', Police Story has many of the signature tunes and over-the-top martial arts / action choreography that Chan has become known in a royal climb in a busy shopping mall. In his role as director, Chan exceeds excellence and gives a charismatic and funny performance that accentuates the action. While highlighting the overall slapstick humor of "Drunken Master" at heart "Police Story" it is just a police story, an avid cop thriller that will be copied over the years. <br /> <br /> 10/10
