The cult film for every true Russian intellectual. Everything is brilliant, especially observant: it is beyond any praise. The film, like the book, is full of symbols: my favorite is the brightest symbol of Razrukha (spoken Russian word for "devastation", often on the period of lifestyle chaos after the 1918-20 Civil War) open dirt in the brick wall that in the snow end, peep the pitch hole of the doorway. <br /> <br /> Now the movie is released on DVD with the full picture and 5.1 sound, there are well translated English subtitles, although some obscene words from Sharikov have been replaced by the more light versions in the translation. I don't know the DVD is available overseas, but if you do, it's really worth watching. <br /> <br /> Finally, a fact: about 50% of Russians today, mostly youth, can be identified as Sharikovs to a considerable extent. This is the post-Soviet effect: Soviet people seem to be completely unprepared for the information attack of Western civilization. Television manufacturers and filmmakers have made the entertainment industry and the mass media incredibly aggressive, insatiable and unthinkable, making it the darkest instincts of every Russian. Even among internet users, every third uses the obscene language in forums and chats, as it is incredibly common in spoken language.
