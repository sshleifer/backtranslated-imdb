"Pecker" proves that Waters does not intend to change his sticky ways in his age. Many things have changed since Waters started making films in the 1960s, but 40 years later he still does what he wants to do. Over the years, the Waters movie budget has increased significantly. This is one of his most recent productions, but I was surprised to see Waters still having that "trailer-park" touch. Edward Furlong plays Pecker, a child obsessed with photography. He lives a reasonable life in Baltimore, MD, with his friends and family. But Pecker draws the attention of a New York art dealer (the always-sighted Lili Taylor), and changes his life for the worst. Again, Waters makes fun of art, fame and heterosexuality. It's not one of his best movies, but there are a few big stomachs here ("Memama" has the best lines in the movie!). It's consistently smart and funny, and has a very "fierce" sensibility that I got in Warters's movies.
