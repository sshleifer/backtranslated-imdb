I didn't approach "Still Crazy" with a real expectation. Just another rock movie, I thought ... good nostalgia for the baby boomers. This movie is partly it, but so much more. Brian Gibson, the director, previously healed a biography of Tina Turner and is very successful in his style. I think it's appropriate that it was his last movie. <br /> <br /> The role-play is well-chosen. Bill Nighy is perfect in his role as the group leader. Actress-turned director Bruce Robinson appears as the group's excited guitarist. He does an excellent job, although he hasn't appeared on film since the late 70's. If you're looking for a nice and funny movie (with some good songs), you've found it. <br /> <br /> 7.4 out of 10
