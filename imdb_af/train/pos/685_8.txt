Ghost Story (The New House) is a terrific horror story. It comes from the Circle of Fear and the Ghost Story series of the early seventies. The beginning and end of each story is told by Sebastian Cabot. Remember him from the early family series, Family Affair in the 1960s? This particular story has Barbara Parkins and David Birney as lead actors, and as main characters in the story. I saw it recently, and I was so scared! If you're alone, I wouldn't recommend viewing it. This story is great, no gore or swear words, but very scary. Barbara Parkins played the young bride. David Birney played her husband. But the actors were very good at their parts. If you like scary, fun, scary ghost stories, you'll love this jeweler. I gave it a high rating. I recommend this story.
