Goebbels's motivation to find out was not investigated. In the aftermath of Stalingrad, the Empire decided to go for 'total war'. It's called in the movie. Part of this was to use women in the war effort, which Germany had not done before. A women's SS massacre would have confronted Goebbels with a disastrous relationship with public relations. His preference was to leave the problem as quiet as possible, on the grounds that the Jewish men could always be rolled up later. I understand that the majority survived the war. <br /> <br /> His other problem was that the 'Red Berlin' had never been very enthusiastic about the Nazi cause and had to be treated with caution. Once again, a massacre of women could cost the Nazis what a mediocre level of support they had in their capital. <br /> <br /> It was interesting that the majority of SS uniforms have spots that indicated that the men they wear were not of German nationality, but were of German origin in other countries such as Lithuania or Latvia
