I have to point out that, before reading this review, it is by no means a statement against the Iranian people ... if you really want to read something about this, hopefully you will see that I am against politicians in general is ... but if you take offense, I can't help you! <br /> <br /> Not in Iran, because this movie was banned there (see IMDb trivia for this movie). It's a pity, because the movie is great. If it wasn't for "Grbavica", this movie would have won at the International Film Festival in Berlin. <br /> <br /> That's right (it was the runner-up or second-place if you wanted to). Why? Because it's a film about oppression. It is not even a complete women's issue. It's about the government trying to keep people off. An analogy so clear that the government felt the need to ban the film. But by banning nothing is solved and / or they can disappear this movie! <br /> <br /> Another reviewer had a good summary line: "Comedy about a tragedy", it does well!
