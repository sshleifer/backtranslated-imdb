Strangler of the Swamp was created by a low budget studio PRC and is definitely one of their best movies I've seen. <br /> <br /> A man who was hanged for a murder did not revenge as a ghost did revenge on the people who accused him. He used a rope to strangle his victims and after several deaths, including the old man operating the ferry across the marsh, he disappeared. The grandmother's granddaughter takes over the ferry herself and falls in love with one of the local men and decides to marry. <br /> <br /> This movie has very dim atmospheres, which also makes it very creepy. <br /> <br /> The film includes Rosemary La Planche, Blake Edwards and Charles Middleton (Flash Gordon) as the Strangler. <br /> <br /> Strangler of the Swamp is a must for old horror fans like me. Excellent. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 and a half stars out of 5.
