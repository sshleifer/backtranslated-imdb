Ben Thomas (Smith) plays an IRS agent who practically gives the store away for everyone's surprise. What is the kind of IRS Agent? <br /> <br /> Most of us all heard the line through an IRS Agent, "Hello, I'm from the IRS. I'm here to help." Our smile then spreads in a bell saying, "Yes, right." <br /> <br /> As you go further and further in this story, you can't portray this man. He easily goes to those who are being audited. What is his motive? Is he from another planet, an angel, a rich man who wants to do good? He helps so much that we want him to be our auditor if we are of course audited. Hey, IRS, are you listening? (joke, just estimate) <br /> <br /> The pass of the movie is perfect and so much that clues were ignored that would tell me what was really going on. Intense, repeated intense, focused on Ben and staying there. The whole movie only works because of Ben when we try to find him and I have not seen any clues (what are you talking about, Willis?). If you didn't read the box before watching the DVD movie, it was the better way to go here. By the end of the movie I finally put it all together. Well, that was obvious. And yes, it's at the top, but still a good story, mostly because of Will Smith. <br /> <br /> Will Smith was nominated for a Best Actor Prize. The rest of the cast was also very good. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's above and beyond the big play and when you finally get all the answers, realize that the message of the movie is wrong. What is the message? Believe me, you won't need too many clues to figure it out. I didn't. <br /> <br /> Violence: No. Sex: Yes, but nothing to get excited about. Pale. Nudity: No. Language: No.
