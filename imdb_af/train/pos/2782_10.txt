"Bend It Like Beckham" is a film that has very little exposure here in America. This was probably due to the fact that the film was strong British in dialogue and terminology and dealt a lot with soccer (soccer here), which may also have some problems in America. This is unfortunate because this movie is absolutely fantastic and has earned a lot. more coverage above. I think the basis of the storyline (following a dream) is something that many people can link to, and in the end, "Bend It Like Beckham" seems to be a good feeling with a source of inspiration and very good acting. I wasn't too enthusiastic to see this movie initially, but now I'm not sorry. I recommend this movie!
