I saw this movie in my childhood. And after 10 years I didn't remember anything about this movie, but I found out. I also don't know how to find this movie. It's my life. My all time favorite movie. My words will not have the true meaning of what I have in this movie. I'm following this movie. It's a brilliant mix of fantasy, comedy, romance, horror, erotic, anything and martial arts. The story of the power of love is quite touching and hot. This is a masterpiece of Hong Kong Cinema. <br /> <br /> Sinnui Yauman is undoubtedly one of the best ghost stories ever made in film. Written by Songling Pu and directed by Siu-Tung Ching, a Chinese Ghost Story has it all. Ling Choi Sin played by Leslie Cheung is a young man in luck who is looking for a monastery for housing, deep in the woods, a place where villagers are very scared to go closer. The trek alone is dangerous with wolves, and a crazy taoist monk lives at the temple. <br /> <br /> Ling Choi Probe meets Tsing, a beautiful and mysterious young girl who also lives in a deserted temple. She is forced to deceive men for her evil mistress, but when she meets innocent Ling Choi Sin, they fall in love. <br /> <br /> Ling Choi Sin is kind of a clumsy fool, but his heart is in the right place, while Tsing tries to protect him from the other spirits in the forest, trying to protect her from the monk who try to kill spirits in the forest. There is great martial arts, even a monk who is in a drunken song when he performs ritual taoist swords. The movie makes many traditional old martial arts acrobatics, with magic and flying through the air, jumping from tree to tree, with elegant long gowns and scarves, but the movie really flows and everything is effective. <br /> <Tsing must be married to an evil tree monster who cannot be good and we feel her fate in her home where we meet her sisters and stepmother who are not really nice. <br /> <br /> In the end, with a deadly tongue, they must fight a tree witch and with Yin go deep into the heart of hell to fight a thousand-year evil to save their souls and Ling's ashes back Bringing to her home for a proper funeral so she may have a chance of reincarnation. <br /> <br /> A beautiful story that really gives attention to detail. One is touched in many ways by this movie, you will laugh, cry and just have fun with the great martial arts and cinematography. And although Yin and Ling Choi Sin eventually drive under a spell of rainbow in the morning sun, we never know if Tsing got a reincarnation, but we know her.
