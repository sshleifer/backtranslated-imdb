This movie is a remake of two movies that was much better. The last one, Heaven can wait, was wonderful, I suggest you see that one. This one is not so good. The last third of the movie is not that bad and Chris Rock begins with the comic pleasure he has shown to where he is today. However, I don't know what happened to the first two parts of this movie. It plays like a very bad "B" movie where people sound like they're in a bad TV sit-com. The situations are forced and it is as if they are just trying to get the story over so they can start the right movie. It really looks fake and the editing is just bad. I don't know how to release this movie like that. Anyway, the last part is not bad, so wait for the video and then see it.
