I saw this movie more than once. It was at stake with many of the ghostly things that were shown in television films at the time. The only problem I had was with the title for obvious reasons. Immediately think of Drake's famous biscuit bacon! From the first part, 'Hound of Hell' would have been enough. <br /> <br /> Richard Crenna always drives a sense of seriousness about anything he does, anyway - whether the plot is good or bad. But it was a nice Halloween prize presented by the CBS network. I loved the part where Crenna goes to a dark country to find the mystic that will help him conquer the evil beast. He asked the taxi driver how to find this man. Great dialogue between the native taxi driver and Crenna in terms of the cabby denying his own people's ethnic beliefs. "Aw, Mr Barry, I left those things when I came from the mountains ..." - referring to the mystic who rarely sees or advises people, and no one knows how to really contact him. <br /> <br /> As for the supernatural price, this movie is still enjoyable.
