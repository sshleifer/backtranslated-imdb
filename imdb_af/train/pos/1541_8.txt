<br /> <br /> Today, this movie has just seen and enjoyed the Seattle International Film Festival. <br /> <br /> Great writing and direction, excellent and credible interaction between the movie and the great comic timing. <br /> This movie touches on universal family and divorce themes. As a result, I can see the European, Asian and American audiences alike that match this movie and their own lives. <br /> <br /> If all that was not enough, it has the potential to be the best underground date movie of the year ... someone distributes it in the US, please! <br /> <br /> Finally, thank you Maria Flom! It's really a good movie.
