Despite the occasional stationary play and 'seen-it-all-before' story, it's a disappointing movie. <br /> <br /> It has tension, the scenes with the devil are actually pretty scary, some of the visual effects are fantastic and best of all, no ridiculously ill-placed humor to harm the movie, because too much (wannabe) horror movies are in them now. <br /> <br /> honestly, this is not the biggest movie ever made, but it actually pulls you in and at least an attempt at character development. <br /> <br /> I was glad I looked at it
