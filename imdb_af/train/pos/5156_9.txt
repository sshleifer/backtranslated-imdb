I agree with many of the negative reviews posted here for reasons I will later discuss. But these miniseries are powerful and convincing because the talented role really captures the dark truth of Hitler's world. <br /> <br /> Peter Stormare is perfect as Ernst Rohm, the brutal Brownshirt leader. Every scene he has with Hitler is explosive! Hitler is so angry, he dominates everyone except the dull, primitive Rohm - and he just sticks it to Rohm. The interaction between Stormare and Carlisle alleviates the way Hitler relieved Rohm's brutality, but later sacrificed him for political reasons. <br /> <br /> Jena Malone turns in a heartbreaking performance such as Geli Raubal, Hitler's damned cousin and the victim of his inexpressible perversions. Without revealing any of the sexual rubbish directly, Jena Malone plays all the horrors of the slow extinction of a young girl's spirit. She uses her eyes and voice to represent all the horrors that will be visited on millions in the years to come. And she's brilliant! Zoe Telford has almost Jena Malone with her portrayal of Eva Braun. Eve is clearly ill, cruel and heartless - but at the same time it is almost pitiably dependent on her Adolph's twisted tenderness. The abolished image of love between them (which indicates the backbone of tingling truth of Hitler's enormous self-elevation) is cold and erotic. <br /> <br /> Liev Schrieber gives a deliciously wispy performance as Putzi Hanfstael, the spineless man in town who is tempted by Hitler's promises of wealth and power. While a brute like Rohm has just the idea of ​​crushing skulls under his boots, Schrieber's character is one of most Germans who are abusing Nazi violence, but can't resist the quick and easy route for money and power. His poor-willed fury about Hitler soon lost his wife's respect, played with style and sensuality by the beautiful and royal Julianna Margulies. They offer a true portrait of marriage and betrayal. <br /> <br /> These shows combine the mini-series, which sometimes bridges bad points in the writing. There is an exception. Unfortunately, Matthew Modine's acting chops are just not sniffing. His noble lunk-haid journalist ruins every scene he has - the viewer can almost wait for Rohm's brown shirts to bump the piece, just look at his ignorant, low-colored, low-cost Hollywood golden boy. But the story still works. <br /> <br /> Now, regarding the factual inaccuracies of the script, Hitler's perversions and cruelty are rendered in a vibrant, compelling drama. But the battlefield record of Corporate Hitler is severely distorted. As if the audience cannot handle the idea of ​​evil and courage in the same person, the authors make Hitler like a cowardly coward who "begs" an iron cross. As if someone in the Kaiser's army could get a medal, just to risk it! The movie made Hitler look like a coward in the trenches when he was a fearless soldier. They also suggested his comrades despise him when he was in fact widely admired by officials and men. The depressing thing is that the mini-series is so successful in proposing Hitler as a monster in honest ways - but they couldn't resist the cheap shot. <br /> <br /> All in all, Hitler: RISE OF EVIL has underlined a growing success through powerful performances.
