Just selected it on DVD and watched it again. I like the bright colors against dark image. Not a great Beatty fan, but it's an excellent popcorn movie. Pacino is amazing, as always, and indeed, this movie marked the period where Madonna was her absolute sex. I wish she'd been holding the "Breathless" look for a while. Charlie Korsmo's first very big role, except "What about bob?" The makeup effects were then the forefront and still holding the bulk. Beautiful scenery and atmosphere transport you directly into a comic strip environment. The cars, wardrobe, buildings, and even street lights and a good tone, not to mention the perfect lighting, although the screens with very red may become a bit irritating, as it fades a bit. Just wish Beatty got the chance to make a successor. All in all, a fun few hours.
