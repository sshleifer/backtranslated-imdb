Without a doubt, Beat Street is the best movie about the breakin scene. Everything about it is mockery, the clothes (puma), the music and the most important dance! The storyline is basic, but hey, what is there to tell a story? The whole point of the movie is to show what children of that moment did in time, which matter to them. It shows that teenagers are generally good, but everything that was important to these everyday children was music, dance and friendship. After watching the DVD recently, I was amazed at how well it was the test of time! The clothes did not look dated (possibly because Puma has a massive return), the music still sounds fresh, and the dance is still fascinating to watch. A film that should see anyone aged 10 to 25 as part of their youth culture.
