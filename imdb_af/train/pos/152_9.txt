I saw 'El Mar' yesterday and thought it was a good movie. It starts with a childhood episode in the life of the 3 main characters: Ramallo, Manuel Tur, and Francisca. Then we jump to a hospital where the 3 friends meet again for about 10 years. <br /> <br /> Religion, sickness, love, violence and sexuality make anger throughout the film creating and intense and stress-filled film. <Br /> <br /> I see people complain about the movie that is too stingy and I think they missed the point of the story. It's a violent, intense and sad story. People are expected to suffer. To cry. To get hurt. To bloom. And I think that what the film shows is not being done for pure shock or being presented in an unpleasant way. I know that some people "keep their movies" clean, even those with violence in it. But sometimes a movie has to make you work uncomfortably. This is one of those movies. And a big movie is it. <br /> <br /> The only mistake I found was that there were 3 or 4 moments if some summaries were not 100% clear, and only after they reached the end of the movie made sense. But this was not of great importance to the overall story, so I still give this movie a 9.
