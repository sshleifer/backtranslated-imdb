Alain Chabat claims this movie as his original idea, but the theme of reluctant lovers who eventually get it together is so old, if not older, than Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> Chabat is a "vieux garcon", fortunately single and he does not want a member of the opposite sex to disturb his life. He has a problem, 5 sisters and a matriarchal mum - the G7 - who decides to be married. Give the beautiful, charming Charlotte Gainsbourg what should be a simple plan. Charlotte should sit as Chabat's girlfriend and then simply not arrive on the day of the wedding. No longer talking about the G7's marriage. Of course, the best plans have a habit of being out of control. <br /> <br /> There are many strong supporting roles of Lafont as mother and Osterman as the fierce brother of Gainsbourg. <br /> <br /> There are some fantastic scenes that Charlotte must first charm and then rebellion the family. French farce with English.
