I thought it was one of the best successors I've seen for a while. Sometimes I felt like I just wanted someone to die, Stanley's death of the annoying characters was brilliant. It was such a good movie that you were happy when it died that way. My only problem was in some scenes that someone with a home camera seems to have filmed it and it was weird. Judd Nelson is cute, at least in my opinion, and he was excellent in the role of Stanley Caldwell. Brilliant movie.
