Indifferent and rather entertaining sleeper about two very different brothers, who are not just so-called "fire starters" (think Stephen King's gay party of a book of the same name), but also forever in conflict with each other about a woman who has a pretty nasty habit of being a piromaniac! Good special effects (especially at the end), impressive performances of a reasonably talented trio of actors and replenished by a very interesting and oddly-sounding soundtrack, make Wilder Napalm a unique movie of a movie to watch ... if you can find it is it! On a personal note, I was fortunate to pick it up (so to speak) from the two-dollar bin at my local video rental store. (*** out of *****)
