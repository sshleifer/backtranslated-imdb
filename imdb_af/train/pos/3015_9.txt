Why can't this type of compact, entertaining secret be filmed in the new century? It keeps the viewer thinking and guessing all the way. The cast is a great ensemble. William Powell is displaying true quality. Who knows - maybe he reacted to his future as Nick Charles. He is a joy to watch. One can also see why Eugene Pallette made more than 200 films. He is a great supporting character actor and his excellent chemistry with Powell is great to watch. Mary Astor does not work on an average in a very greasy role. All the other hands break in to make it a very pleasant way to spend 73 minutes. I suspect Michael Curtiz had a ball to direct his one. Bravo!
