It was only a week since I saw my first John Waters movie (Female Trouble), and I wasn't sure what to expect the second time. <br /> <br /> While the previous movie was shamefully over, Pecker is actually a funny movie that puts art critics in New York to a T. The one who can't think what these "experts" are so attractive about modern art will enjoy seeing these pretentious snobs so full of themselves about Pecker, a boy who just got a broken camera and his friends and neighbors start shooting. <br /> <br /> Edward Furlong (Pet Sematary II, Terminator 2: Judgment Day) was surprisingly good like Pecker. There wasn't much meat on any of the roles in this movie, but he really seems. <br /> <br /> Christina Ricci (Prozac Nation) comes in another good show than Pecker's girlfriend. In fact, it was a banner year for Ricci (Buffalo '66, The Opposite of Sex, and Pecker. <br /> <br /> Lili Taylor, who had the only good role in The Haunting, was also an important part The movie is really enjoyable. <br /> <br /> There are many funny scenes, but I have to say the best was when a crown shouts, "We want to forest!" "We want to forest!" wants to forest! "I thought it was a Republican convention until I saw the police. <br /> <br /> I'm going to have to look more for Waters's work, especially Hairspray, now it's in the news.
