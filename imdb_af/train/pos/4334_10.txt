Who doesn't want to go with Peter Falk on the road? The old man's right eye has more character than most actors today. This is the kind of funny and touch movie that we all seek as a counterbalance to all the bombastic special effects drills. Women will love it for all the awake romantic advice for men, and men will love it for his on-and-off / son character study - one big little scene after another. And it just has enough of a border to find a real indie. Obviously, this is a loving work for Paul Reiser who understands how to be both a father and a son, as well as having laughter and tears as you move through life. The nicest part, however, was the Reiser watch Falk. You could say it was his character who received a new appreciation for his father and a fellow actor who enjoyed Peter Falk's special craft. Really beautiful. Let's hope this movie will soon make it into theaters across the country so everyone can have a chance to laugh and cry with Paul Reiser and people.
