When I first looked at it, we borrowed from our local library a year ago and watched it about 3 times. We just looked at it again and I enjoyed it much more than I did last time. :) :() <br /> <br /> The movie is mainly about two dogs named Charlie and Itchy (pronounced by Dom DeLuise and I love Dom DeLuise!). Charlie is a half gangster and half a good, what I want. Itchy is his sidekick. Charlie is murdered by his friend (NOT) and sent to heaven. When Charlie comes back, it's the start of a wonderful adventure. <br /> <br /> The five main reasons I absolutely CRAZY about this movie: One: I love the characters (except Carface). My favorite three is Charlie, Itchy and a little girl named Anne-Marie who comes a little later. Two: I love the history of this movie. It was introduced during the ban in the United States. Three: The Don Bluth animation (as usual) is wonderful. The backgrounds are also good. Four: There is a strange excitement in this movie that keeps me on the edge of my seat. Five: The songs in this one are nice. My favorite song starts with "I need Brazil, the blow, the excitement" ... <br /> <br /> So, look at this beautiful movie whenever you can, you won't be disappointed! :);) :()
