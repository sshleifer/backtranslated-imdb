Although written by Stephen King, an overstated writer if ever there was one, it is actually quite entertaining B-movie. Vampire, capricious creatures living in the candlelight house and draining the power of virginity, great cemetery scenery, heroic cats and very beautiful virginity. The soundtrack even has Enya's music, an idea I really liked. I'm sure King is disappointed with this little movie, although it has crappy dialogue and ideas, all of a real and boring King pot boiler. (Although Sleepwalkers, if I understand correctly, is a script without any novel or short story behind it). Still, touching sewage smells shows he didn't use a ghost writer.
