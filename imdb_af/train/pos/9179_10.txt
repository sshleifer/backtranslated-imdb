This is the best version (so far) you'll see and the most noticeable for the Bronte work. Dalton is a little hard to think of as Rochester explains Jane Eyre "not attractive". But his actions conquer it and Zelah Clark, as she is, is also a complete and credible Jane Eyre. This production is a long watch, but it's worth it. Almost direct quotes from the book are in writing and if you want the very first true 'romance' in literature, this is the way to see it. I own every copy of this movie and read and read the original movie. The filming may look a bit dated, but there will never be anything like that.
