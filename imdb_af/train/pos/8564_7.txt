I don't expect this movie to be well understood by viewers from Romania. It says something about the value, or perhaps the lack of universality of the film, but also tells about how different history and even the lives of ordinary people in Romania were compared to other countries, even in Eastern Europe. <br /> <br /> The film is a novel by Marin Preda, a controversial novelist who died during the Communist rule, shortly after the book was published. It tells the story of an intellectual, professor of philosophy whose life is being crushed after being captured on false allegations at the end of the Stalinist period. Actually, the first part of the film tells the story of his struggle for survival in prison, the second describing his preliminary to regaining his life after he was released. His release is actually clear, Romania of the 60's is asking him about different kinds of compromises and crimes, but his struggle for survival is just as tough morale as in prison. <br /> <br /> The movie is performed by some of the best Romanian actors. Stefan Iordache, who plays the lead, will be a mega-star in another time and another, we can get a good look at his wonderful play. Although it suffers from a hesitant story sometimes told in non-essential details or character stories, the film is still an important feature of the Romanian theater, as well as the process of restoring moral and historical values ​​in Romanian society.
