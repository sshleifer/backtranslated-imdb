After living my whole life in Ontario, in the same town where Marlene Moore grew up, I heard stories of her from my parents, grandparents, and relatives. When I found out that they would film a movie about her and that the start would be shot on my street and her house was very close to me, I was excited. If you read the book Rock a Bye Baby, about Marlene Moore, you get the image of her as a human being, she is considered uncomfortable by people who really had the chance to know her with the exception of her own family who is often her as a child, with the exception of one of her brothers. Even if you live in my area and are intelligent enough to listen to those around you who know her from school, you will find out she was really wounded before she even sat down, she was always defensive and what looked like like a reluctance to learn in a school environment, was actually embarrassing about the fact that she couldn't. <br /> <br /> Marlene did not earn the living she was given, with the lack of help she needed urgently to receive. It was the government and the people around her who helped further in her death by not understanding her needs and why she did what she did. I still feel angry that she was in prison for self-defense of a man who tried to rape her. As her brother once said, "They didn't know what to do with her, so they locked her and killed her." I believe with my whole heart. <br /> <br /> Rest in peace Marlene, you deserve it so much.
