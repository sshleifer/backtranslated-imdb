Note that I didn't say it's better ... just better. The lack of social commentary and realism helps to make things move. <br /> <br /> I was actually so surprised that it wasn't a Troma movie, as it contains all of the Troma brands, including acidic liquids, rogue crap after every murder, a ridiculous rape scene ( which is difficult to get upset because the rapist is a snowman and dumb delegates. <br /> <br /> There is a lot to love: <br /> <br /> 1. A snowman, who is noticed that he has no legs or feet, manages a police cruiser in the town. <br /> <br /> 2. While it is supposed to freeze near (or below), no one's breath is displayed and there are no signs of car exhaust when cars are running. <br /> <br /> 3. The snow reminds you of floe or Styrofoam peanuts as real snow. <br /> <br /> 4. A teenage girl gets the chicks for her boyfriend just a few hours after her brother was horribly murdered. She speaks to him to break into the sheriff's house, from all places, to tackle it. But first she told him that he had to build a nice fire in the fireplace and open wine. <br /> <br /> 5. After the teens, Jake's head is cut off by a sled runner, and his father argues with the sheriff whether Tommy, the sheriff's son, has something to do with it. The sheriff argues that Tommy would not fight Jake because Jake is "at least two feet longer than Tommy." At the moment someone sounds in the background, "No more!" <br /> <br /> 6. When the evil snowman finally begins to melt, the sheriff struggles with a flat snowman made from a kind of fabric for a long time. It is much better than Tarzan struggling with rubber crocodiles or gladiators struggling with stuffed lions. If I were an actor, I couldn't have a straight face at this point. <br /> <br /> All in all, a fun movie. There is not so much blood.
