I was overwhelmed by Jim Carrey's work. I keep getting this movie in my head. The Grinch likes Martha May, Cindy Lou (who is very annoying, her sweet innocence), who tries to get the Grinch in Christmas, the childhood of the Grinch (very funny!) And besides, the poor obvious End of Christmas' It's all about gifts. I have to say I feel dumb from the theater with a lot of babies and toddlers who laugh and so on, but this movie was a good, consistent adaptation of Dr.Seuss's short film and IS for all ages.
