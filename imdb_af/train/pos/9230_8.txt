There is so much that can be said about this movie. This is not your typical nunsploitation. Of course there are nudity and sex with nuns, but it is almost the story. <br /> <br /> It was in the 15th century Italy, at the time of the martyrdom of 800 Christians in Otranto. The battle between the Muslims and the Christians plays a good role in the film. It was interesting when all of the Muslim huts were running, that the mother would ask superior: "Why do you fear Muslims, they will do nothing that the Christians have done to you?" Surely there was enough torture on both sides. <br /> <br /> Sister Flavia (Florinda Bolkan) is sent to a monastery to disobey her father. In the process, she sees and endures many things: the stallion of a stallion, the rape of a local woman by a new duke, the torture of a nun that was conquered during a visit to the Tarantula division and " struck when she stormed with a Jew. The torture was particularly gruesome, with hot waxes thrown on the kidney, and cut off her nipples. <br /> <br /> Sister Flavia is obliged to continue to get in trouble because she is the male dominant society she lives in. She even asks Jesus why the father, son and holy ghost are all men. <br /> <br /> Finally, she joins the Muslim leader as his lover and they drop the monastery. Here's where you see more flesh than you can enjoy at once. But tragedy is coming. She succeeds in giving so much revenge, including the Duke and her father, but finds that the Muslim lover is treating her exactly the same. She is a woman and that's all there is to it. <br /> <br /> I will not describe what the holy men of the church did at the end of this heretic, but it is the torture of Saw or Hostel by decades. <br /> <br /> Nunsploitation fans will be happy with the treats, but movie lovers will get plenty of meat to digest.
