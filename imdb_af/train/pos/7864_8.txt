It's another tell-it-like-it is Madhur Bhandarkar movie. I am not sure why he has this obsession to show baby moles *** and g * y concepts to the Indian cinematic audience, but I find some of the scenes really disgusting! What's new? It is a nice piece composed by Bhandarkar, where he tells the story of an entertainment reporter by leading lady in the well-known film, Mr. A wife. Iyer, played, show. What makes this film different is that it also covers the stories of people that this reporter interacts with or with friends, such as her roomy, her colleagues, movie stars, models, rich people, and others in the Entertainment Page # 3 in her newspaper. . <br /> <br /> Remarkably, this is another good thing from Mrs. Iyer. She will probably be noticed for this role. She does selective roles but shines in it. She is remarkably de-glamourized and less beautiful in this movie. But then entertainment reporters aren't supposed to estimate the people they cover, right? Pronunciation: Madhur has come with another good film, which brings social issues into the spotlight. However, this movie loses focus and one is not sure what the director is trying to convey. <br /> <br /> Is he showing us the brilliance and brilliance of the rich? or is he trying to show us the life of an entertainment reporter and contrast it with the life of the REAL crime reporter? Is he trying to tell us how the government and rich people govern the press? or try to illustrate the issues of child abuse and feelings. The other concepts brought include the unwritten rule that young women should sleep with directors or co-stars if they want to enter Bollywood. <br /> <br /> He also talks about how flight assistants get sick and get tired. from work after a while to resort to extreme measures by many older people, etc. He also speaks of unhappy women and spoiled children in wealthy families. <br /> <br /> It was all good for me .. but maybe too complex for an average filmmaker, who just wants to ease a little stress from day to day
