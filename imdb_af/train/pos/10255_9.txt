This movie is the first of the six famous Guinea Pig Movies and is one of the best. At the same time, it seems realistic and unrealistic, just to know that the movie is fake. The story is about a woman caught and tortured in many different ways. A man in the beginning of the story receives a letter without a return address, and it contains a manga video showing the torture. The men who catch her test the limits of a person before they die. Some scenes are shocking, like the eyeball scene and others are not shocking as the girl is hit 100 times, because you see bumps in almost every movie. This movie is very gore, so I recommend it to people 17 or older. <br /> <br /> 9/10
