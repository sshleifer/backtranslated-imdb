I must admit that Holly was not on my watch list for the Edinburgh Film Festival. However, after the artistic director of the festival recommended this movie to an audience of over 200 people before performing another movie, I decided to see it. Wow! <br /> <br /> This movie is about the very difficult issue of child prostitution and does it without any compromise. I cried a few times during the movie and laughed at others. The main actress (Thuy Nguyen) is a Vietnamese newcomer (who was only 14 at the time of filming) and had to tackle this incredibly complex and difficult role. She reminded me of Keisha Castle-Hughes of Whale Rider, but the role here is much more demanding because she has to play a child prostitute. Chances are she'll win many awards. <br /> <br /> The main story is about a girl sold by her family to prostitution and held as a sex slave in a Cambodian brothel. She met an American (played by Ron Livingston in a strong dramatic role we didn't see from him), who spent her time helping her. However, by that time she was sold again and he was looking for Cambodia. The story turns and turns and the audience can never predict what will happen next. <br /> <br /> The play was strong across the board with a very interesting international role. Udo Kier (very convincing as a sex tourism), Virgine Ledoyen (social worker touch) and Chris Penn (one of his last movies). The Asian cast was also wonderful. <br /> <br /> Although the film deals with this difficult topic, it successfully focuses on telling a compelling, powerful story. It's shot in Cambodia (some scenes in real-life boards) that give you the feeling that you're almost watching a documentary. The DP seems to have used a lot of hand-held camera and close-ups and generally made you feel right there as part of the story. <br /> <br /> After listening, I listened to others. members of the audience while they were away and it seemed as if they were all amazed. It's not an easy movie to watch and I salute the filmmakers not to make a "Hollywood Movie". <br /> <br /> It's by far the best movie I've seen at the Edinburgh Film Festival. Notice shared by my husband and some other friends.
