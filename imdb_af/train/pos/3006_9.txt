While a 9 may seem like an unusually high score for such a small movie, it is compared to the hundreds and hundreds of series detective films from the 1930s and 40s of the very best and also compares favorably with Powell's later "Dun Man" "movies. Now, it doesn't mean the movie is the same as the Thin Man movies, as THE KENNEL MURDER CASE is not a comedy, but a traditional mysterious detective. Now you would think it would not be for Nora Charles or Asta or a traditional comic sidekick (something in virtually all series of detective films), it would be a disadvantage, but I didn't miss it because it was so an exceptionally well-written film - with a really interesting case as well as uniformly excellent performances by everyone. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with the dog program and is called the KENNEL murder case, although this Philo Vance movie actually spends some of the time at the dog show and dogs are not a super important part of the movie . Instead, a thoroughly hated man is killed and left in a completely sealed room - an idea repeated in quite a few other detective films (such as CRIME DOCTOR'S STRANGEST CASE). But how this is all explained, seems pretty credible and fits in very well. Keep my interest throughout. I certainly wish other detective films of the day had such intelligent written sites and exceptional acting as this one. This one is definitely a custodian.
