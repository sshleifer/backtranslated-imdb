Although Stardust seems to be a fantasy movie with predictable ending and average achievements, it certainly isn't. When I saw the movie, I knew it was going to be one of my favorite movies. And I was right. <br /> <br /> Stardust is more of a fairy tale than an adventure movie. It has this magical 'aura' from the beginning to the end of the movie. The storyline is well written, and it keeps you on the edge of your chair. Like every story, it lacks morality. Therefore, we know in our heart that the evil brothers will not take the throne, but the innocent boy who succeeds in overcoming every obstacle and trouble he experiences during his journey. We also know that true love is Yvaine and not Victoria, the material girl who is level and manipulative. <br /> <br /> I need to give extra credits to Claire Danes. She literally shines in this movie. Her eyes have this sparkle that suits her character. In addition, she and Cox have chemistry that makes the romance in the film even more noticeable. The rest of the film is well-known actors and actresses who of course make Stardust an interesting and "high-ranked" movie. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is fantastic, the sites are magical and the plot is interesting. was very disappointed that the film was not nominated for more awards. I must give at least 9/10 stars for this.
