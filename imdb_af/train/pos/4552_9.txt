Daniel Day Lewis in my left foot gives us one of the best shows ever by an actor. He is brilliant as Christy Brown, a man with cerebral palsy, who then learned to write and paint with his left foot. A well-deserved Oscar for him and Brenda Fricker who plays his loving mom. Hugh O'Conner is great because younger Christy Brown and Ray McAnally are big than the dad. Worth looking for outstanding achievements.
