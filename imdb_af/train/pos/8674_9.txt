Tis is a very typical Tom and Jerry short - a situation is designed, conflict arises and chaos follows. The characters behave appropriately, the natural tension between different characters leads to general chaos. The best (and funniest) part is when the peace treaty is in force and respected - all kinds of strange wonders appear before your eyes. A word of caution - it is very unwise to allow Tom to run your morning cleaning routine! Highly recommended.
