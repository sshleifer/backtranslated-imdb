I loved this movie. The scenery was breathtaking, the plot had some nice twists and turns, and the characters were well rounded. However, on two fronts Rob Roy far exceeded the average. First, I rarely saw a "popular" movie in which the quality of the dialogue was so high. There were many oral slashes and bumps to accompany the brilliant choreographic sword game. I can give many examples, but why should I? Just look at the movie. Secondly, this movie understands a rarely recognized principle. For a drama to succeed, it doesn't just need a hero, but a very credible villain. If you do not have one, there is not much joy in the roots of the good guys. And "Rob Roy" doesn't have one, but three - the count of Montrose, his henchman Kilairn, and Archie. Non-one-dimensional villains, but full and very nasty. It takes a little more patience than "Braveheart" - there is more dialogue, and the accent is a bit difficult, but it is a very smart and subtle piece. (As I said, I loved this movie!)
