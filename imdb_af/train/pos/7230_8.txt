"The Invisible Mouse" is a wonderful and other Tom & Jerry cartoon. It features the usual cat / mouse chase and battles, but differently this time around. Jerry accidentally falls into a bottle of invisible ink and is, of course, very happy about it because he realizes that he can prepare many "surprises" for Tom, scare him, torment and confuse him. <br /> <br /> So much as it is strange, it's also very cool and funny to see what we can't see: Jerry invisible. It's great to lift things up in the air without seeing who does it (we know who, right?) - it's like those things had their own life, or even like a matter of ghosts. It's almost as if Jerry is eating sweets and fruits while he's invisible. I really like that instrumental music that plays if he isn't visible. <br /> <br /> Some of the best jokes on this short are when Tom sees and hits Jerry's shadow, and even when Tom tries to choke with a frying pan and Jerry writes "missed me." I also like when Jerry Tom's chocolate milk drinks, becomes visible and with a happy look on his face. <br /> <br /> Overall, this brief has the basic ingredients needed for a classic cartoon: humor, entertainment, fun and some beautiful artwork.
