I classify it the best of the Zorro chapter versions. The exciting musical score adds punch to an exciting screenplay. There is an excellent support cast and mystery villain who will keep you up to the final chapter. Already, Hadley does a good job as Don Diego and his alter ego Zorro.Last, but certainly not least, is the great legal team of Whitney and English.
