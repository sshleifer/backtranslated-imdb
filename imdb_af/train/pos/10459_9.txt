I didn't expect to be so touched by this movie depicting a family like the one you'd expect to stay next door. They are ordinary flesh-and-blood people, not like the typical Hollywood prize. They face an all too common problem - bad disease. But the story line grabs the heart with a powerful lesson. Casting, scripting, direction, and acting coincide with a boom that deepens the viewer into the story. Give this movie your full attention and its message will truly inspire.
