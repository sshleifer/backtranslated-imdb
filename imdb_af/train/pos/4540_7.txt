This movie star Jay Leno as a Detroit police spokesperson, Tony Costas and Pat Morita, as a Tokyo police officer, sent to Detroit to get a stolen prototype from a car. A Japanese man traveled to Detroit to sell it to an emerging car company run by a man named Derrick Jarryd. Unfortunately, the men who were supposed to negotiate the deal killed him and took the prototype. An outspoken Derek Jarryd is trying to divert himself from Phillip Madras who led the men. But Madras (played by Chris Sarandon) has nothing of it and threatens Jarryd to force him to continue their partnership. Meanwhile, the same girlfriend in the same junkyard where the Japanese man was killed, also murdered a friend of Tony Costas. Tony's friend watched the litter. <br /> <br /> Tony sets the killer against his superior's command. Tony is on the robbery while the men obviously have to investigate the men. While Tony is investigating the crime, he runs into Japanese police and he fails to arrest him. Eventually they end up with the case. They make a strange couple and there are some really amusing parts, as well as some ridiculous scenes like Pat Morita, jumping and kicking straight through the windscreen of a moving car and kicking Madras in the head. But it's finally a pleasant girl-cop movie, at least in my opinion. Jay Leno is not an actor, but he is welcome in the role and Pat Morita is also good. Yet they make duos in one action movie for one of the more unlikely girlfriends. If you like boyfriend movies, movie of cheesy 80 or you want to see Jay Leno as an actor, then I recommend this movie.
