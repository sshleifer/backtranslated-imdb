I just saw ICE AGE, a very funny and very nice movie. The story is simple but effective, the characters love and fall out, but it really looks like the digital set design. <br /> <br /> More inspired by traditional animated movies than reality, the designs give you a very, very nice looking world in an amazing use of color. Sometimes the touch of reality becomes transparent (especially the water is impressive), but it is a fantasy world based on reality. Including many large landscapes, especially to reduce the cost of delivery. <br /> <br /> Pixar films shine with technical brilliance, this sparkling with effective uses of technical know-how. <br /> <br /> Enough technical chatter, the movie's entertaining, family-friendly and sometimes just hilariously funny.
