First, this movie is 34 minutes long, which means you can watch it three times in a row and spend even less time watching most movies. Second, you have to do it. This sensational short film explores the potential of animation by a world of playful or terrible but always powerful images. Cats ride in and drink from a water elephant, a circus with an air-consuming bird, and pigs eat their own fried meat - that's just the beginning. The screens and images, exceptionally on their own, flow together without clear causal links in a way that requires re-viewing. In addition, the DVD contains an amazing director's commentary, which, as the extremely savings dialogue, only enhances the performance. The commentary gives some interpretations of scenes, but also offers valuable quotes on the sharpening of Hairdressing, according to the following: "Well, the artists asked what we should do in this scene, but I didn't know myself. hard to say why it turned out as it did "(this is a bad paraphrase casually). Also the sound in the film is very high quality, very accurate and very moody. Overall, the absolute minimum show experience is as follows: <br /> <br /> First View: Watch the DVD without comment. Second Look: Look at the DVD with the comment. Third View: Rewatch without comment. <br /> <br /> But after watching it three times, you won't stop there.
