This impossible story is of a female witch pursuing a mortal man in a mortal world. Her "community" is open to its members, but she hides her witchcraft from the mortals. Hmmmm ... it starts to sound familiar. LOL. It's not your typical movie. Many "champion" performances by Jack Lemmon and Ernie Kovacs keep things dull. Kim Novak is always a pleasure on the screen, but I found her mating with James Stewart unusually (but not fatal for the story). <br /> <br /> With re-interest in everything that is witty and dark, this movie deserves to be discovered and rediscovered by old and new audiences ...... THIS IS A HEIGHT!
