I had the pleasure of reading Martin Torgoff's book, "Can not My Way Home". It is very full of information on the drug culture of America, over the years 1945-2000. This man knows her well !! I found that he was an excellent spokesman for this documentary. I especially enjoyed watching the movies of the hippie era and the 70's culture. The soundtrack was excellent. Whoever compiled it was definitely in contact with the songs of each era. Hopefully they will pack and sell them as a CD set. I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in how the 1960s LSD experiments forever changed the American culture as we know it. One thing missing was any mention of George Jung (played by Johnny Depp in the movie "Blow"), which was supposed to be for many of the dagga and cocaine that came in this country in the 60's and 80's.
