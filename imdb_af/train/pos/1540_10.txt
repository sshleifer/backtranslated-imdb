It's an amazing movie. I can't remember the last time I saw a Swedish movie that was lying there. It's funny, it's tragic, it's compelling, and above all it's part of the Swedish village. It shatters the clichés and lives deeper. It connects you, not just for the main characters, but for all the characters. <br /> <br /> Big city girl returning to her roots, her little hometown, to celebrate her father's 70th birthday, crosses roads with people she hasn't met in several years. Although the story itself is not unique, it offers a new approach. The centerpiece of the story is the relationship between three sisters (at different stages of life), which are not very close. Or at least don't realize how close they are. <br /> <br /> One important reason that makes it so easy to connect with people in this movie is the impeccable cast. First of all, I am more than satisfied that there is absolutely no so-called 'A-list' Swedish actor in this movie. Usually there are a handful of actors who can find their way in almost every major production in Sweden. This time, the production company has managed to keep it by throwing actors who actually love their profession. Sofia Helin is probably the first Swedish actress since Eva Röse to prove that you don't need words to convey an emotion. <br /> <br /> The writing is also very attractive. The dialogue is more than credible, and compared to other Swedish films of the past year or two, it is before miles. Maria Blom controls everything from the beginning, and if you didn't know it, you'll never guess it's her first time writing and directing a feature long movie. I can't wait for her next one. <br /> <br /> Once you start looking, you really want to see it.
