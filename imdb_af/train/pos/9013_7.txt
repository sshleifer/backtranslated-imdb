Although this movie has weak points, it is worth seeing. I chose it because of the cast, and applaud Bonham Carter and Branagh for the choice of roles other than what they took in the past. Both depict many troubled people, complete with warts, but make them enjoyable because of their humanity. The story touches, but these are the shows that are rising. Bonham Carter's "Jane" is a remarkable achievement, whose quest for romance has opened my eyes to aspects of the disabled I have not yet thought of, but was also interesting for other reasons. I felt the movie ended up suddenly, but better than an exhausted emotional manipulative end. (See "Stepmom.") The true English environment added to my enjoyment - it was England in the 90s, both urban and rural, without being depressed. .
