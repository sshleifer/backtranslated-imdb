Zero Day leads you to think, think again why two boys / young men would do what they did - commit mutual suicide by slaughtering their classmates. It captures what should be as a bizarre way of being for two people who have decided to be withdrawn from common courtesy to define their own / common world via linked destruction. <br /> <br /> It's not a perfect movie, but given what money / time the filmmaker and actors had - it's a remarkable product. In terms of the motives and actions of the two young suicides / murderers, it is better than 'Elephant' - in terms of a film coming under our 'rationalist' skin, it's a far better movie than almost everything you is probably to see. <br /> <br /> Defective but honest with a terrible honesty.
