I'm not usually in a particular show (except for the OC & Desperate Housewives ... hey I'm 20!), But not a joke, after one episode of Reunion I was addicted. <br /> <br /> I can't even say how bummed I was, it was time slot in conflict with Bush's speech last night because I'm really looking forward to the 1987 episode, which will fly next Thursday. Again, that conflict was detrimental because it was a new show, it had to build up another and with the second episode being pushed back a week, some measure of momentum. <br /> <br /> It says TV doesn't always have to be worthy of being Emmy. I don't expect Reunion to take any prices home, but I expect I can catch my attention all season. Ever watch the first few episodes of a beloved show years later? Sometimes you wonder how you ever got addicted. Character building takes a while. <br /> <br /> The one episode for every year's idea is wonderful, in my opinion. The only other show I can remember doing something similar is 24, with every episode an hour ... and with a gifted year it's more realistic than a day of event! Please give this show a shot. Relax on art form ... it's just TV!
