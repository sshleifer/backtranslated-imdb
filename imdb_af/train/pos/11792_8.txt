I'm going to go out on a limb and actually defend 'Shades of Gray' as a good clip-show episode that defends in the life and death struggle of commander William Thomas Riker, who played a deadly fatal disease. <Br /> <br /> The flashback sequence screens are fairly well implemented with the mood. Riker was like reviving his romantic episodes like "11001001", "Angel One" and "Up the Long Ladder". Tragic moments are highlighted as Tasha's death in "Skin of Evil", as well as elements of the pulsating danger in "Heart of Glory", "Conspiracy" and the aforementioned "Skin of Evil." Riker also showed courage by telling some humorous jokes, such as: An ancestor of mine was bitten once by a rattlesnake. After 3 days of pain, the snake died. "This episode highlights the psychological ordeal of Will Riker under extreme urgency. And, yes, I am biased in my opinion to proclaim Shades of Gray as a solid episode, because at the moment of its original air my face was in cover the sweat, wondering if Riker would live it alive and live to see other great, galactic, extraordinary adventures beyond the final border. <br /> <br /> Of course, in subsequent years, I seem to have a simple formed the opinion of this particular episode ... but as an award for "the best clip-show episode in the history of television", I believe this episode should be highly regarded.
