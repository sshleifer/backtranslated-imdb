Almost every review of this movie I saw was pretty bad. It's not pretty bad, it's pretty good, but not good. The character of Judy Garland could have been annoying, but she didn't allow it. Somewhere along the line, in the early forties I became a fan of overwhelming, tolerable, dominant Van Heflin. Judy's song is good, but the movie missed a big chance by not showing their relationship anymore. I gave it a 7.
