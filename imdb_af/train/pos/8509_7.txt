I hate reading reviews that say something like, "Don't waste your time, this movie stinks on ice." It still applies to that reviewer, it may have a kind of naive charm. If you like the other 'Whistler' series movies, this one will be viewable. If you like 40's noirish movies, this one will be viewable. <br /> <br /> This movie is not as good, in my opinion, as any of the previous series entries that Richard Dix considered. It's slower, and the plot is thin. You've seen the same narrative device used in many other movies, and usually better. <br /> <br /> But the acting is good, and so is the lighting and dialogue. It is just lacking in energy and you will probably find out exactly what is going on and how it all will end, not more than a quarter of the way through. <br /> <br /> The Whistler range is semi-noir, with character, mood, lighting, camera movement and angles more important than the story itself. But this movie is not noir. It's too light and Hollywood is innocent. Neither Richard Dix's character nor that of any of his ladies in previous films had to come to a good end. You just never knew until the end. <br /> <br /> Still, I would recommend this one for at least a single viewing. I watched it at least twice and both of them enjoyed a fair amount of enjoyment.
