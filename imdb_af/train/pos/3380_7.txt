I saw tons of science fiction from the 70's; some terribly bad, and others thought and truly frightening. Soylent Green fits the latter category. Yes, sometimes it's a bit of a camp, and yes, the furniture is good for a giggle or two, but some of the movie looks terribly predictable. Here we have a film, 9 years before Blade Runner, which makes it possible to imagine the future as something dark, scary and nihilistic. Both Charlton Heston and Edward G. Robinson are much better at this than the Ten Commandments, and Robinson's suicide scene is zealously predicted by Kevorkian and his ilk. Some of the attitudes are dated (imagine a movie maker getting away with the concept of "women as furniture" in our oh-so-politically correct 90s?), But it's hardly a movie from the Me-decade. to find what can actually make you think. This is one that I would like to see on the big screen, because even in a widescreen presentation I don't think the overall size of this movie will be the result. Look at that.
