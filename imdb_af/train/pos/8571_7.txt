It is probably a very good "successor", better than the first live action movie 101 Dalmatians. It has good dogs, good actors, good jokes and overall slapstick! <br /> <br /> Cruella DeVil, who had some head therapy, is now a lover of dogs and very kind to them. Many, including Chloe Simon, owner of one of the dogs Cruella once tried to kill, don't believe it. Others, such as Kevin Shepherd (owner of 2nd Chance Dog Shelter) believe she has changed. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Dipstick, with his partner, gave birth to three cute Dalmatian puppies! Little Dipper, Domino and Oddball ... With Eric Idle as Waddlesworth (the hilarious macaw), Glenn Close as Cruella himself and Gerard Depardieu as Le Pelt (another baddy, the name should give an idea), this is a good family movie with excitement and more! One downfall of this movie is that it has very painful slapstick, but not quite as excessive as the last movie. It's also harder than the last movie. <br /> <br /> Enjoy "102 Dalmatians"! :-)
