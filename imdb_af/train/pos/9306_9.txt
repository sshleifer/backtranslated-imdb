The world is a terrible place. But this movie is farce and it's fun. And if you don't like it, you won't ... and if you don't, it doesn't matter. It's up to you to play together. Every actor in this one had fun. It's just a joke. And that's good enough for me. Gabriel Byrne is invaluable. Byrne and Paul Anka who do MY WAY are, like "Vic" puts it, "... the best version ever". Well ... it's not a masterpiece, but it's not bad. I was warned to see it, but I'm sure I did.
