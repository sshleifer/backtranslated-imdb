It was my second time watching the movie (via the French-language version as opposed to the first, which was baptized in Italian) and I feel it is improving on later views. <br /> <br /> A compelling or slow build-on character shot that is beautifully shot and with the Parisian institutions is equally impressive. In the long run it is not the best Polanski and I will arrange it at number 9 in his filmography, but it is still a confident mix of subtle chills and, surprisingly, often broad comedy. It also has a good role, all in good shape, but especially Isabelle Adjani, Melvyn Douglas and Jo Van Fleet. <br /> <br /> However, I was a little astounded by the sudden compulsion for Trelkovsky to change into the previous tenant; apart from the owner of the cafe opposite the apartment building, to which he is given whatever Simone had, without asking him if he wanted something else, there is little to indicate (as far as I can tell) that it is all is wanted from him! Okay, so he found that Simone's possessions were still in the apartment, but what immediately drove him to wear her dresses and set herself up (even though he unconsciously started doing it)? Following his nightmare visions in the bathroom, the last part of the film (where Adjani disappears) is almost anti-climax - especially the scene where the landlord and other tenants testify to his attempted suicide as if it were an evening at Opera was. , a concept that was used by Jean Cocteau in the BLOOD OF A POET (1930) 46 years ago! <br /> <br /> The end is then predictable and unresolved: just what made the two occupants of this apartment jump out of the window?!; I remember this factor that also bugged me on the first show, and I'm sorry to say it's not clearer now! Note, the first two-thirds of the movie is pretty solid, but I wish Polanski was less dependent on obscure plot points.
