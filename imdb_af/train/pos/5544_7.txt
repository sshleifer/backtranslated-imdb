PRC, which was the lowest of the low gold actually, with this mellow little thriller. They did the same thing a year earlier with "Detour". This is probably one of the best low-budget movies ever made. <br /> <br /> "Strangler" is basically a uniform film, filled with fog and shadows, a technique used by most poverty-driving studios to hide the sets or lack thereof. But here it works well. The ghost of Charles Middleton (better known as Ming the Merciless) straddles the swamp to kill those involved in his wrongful execution for murder and generate the sympathy of the viewer. His last victim is the fianc√©e's daughter. He focuses not only on those who are directly involved in his destiny, but also on their family. <br /> <br /> Rosemary LaPlanche does her usual imitation of someone in a coma passing by for her acting. She offered her the strangler to stop death, but as a soup for the audience, the stranger saw the goodness of her gesture as a sign that his mission had been completed and he returned to the afterlife, somewhat chastised. If Ulmer (who directed "Detour") directed "Strangler", she would hang from the nearest tree and the stranger's work would be done. But who complains? It is not the story that is the great attraction, but the shrouded sets, lighting and the general mood of the piece. It stands, right behind "Detour", as PRC's best hour
