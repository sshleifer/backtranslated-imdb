My all-time favorite movie! I saw a lot of movies, but this one knocks them all! Excellent acting, wonderful story. You will love George as a "normal" carer. Although he is an actor, he is himself and a very sweet person. And also the most important thing: you will learn to respect and look at people with Down syndrome differently.
