Like Tarzan the Monkey (1932), just like that. There is more of everything, more animals, more varied African tribes, and scenes in which the mind should be. If it was good with three or four lions, forty would be better. Tarzan wrestle with crocodiles? The crocodile machine rinses in the water like a scroll pin, around and around, jaw flap. Tarzan could kill it with his ubiquitous knife if the blown saurian were to remain silent. Tarzan kills lions and rhinos and an increasing number of animals. His friends are real chimpanzees, people wearing larger monkey costumes, and elephants. In fact, do they use Indian elephants? Much more friendly and educable than Africans? With costume ears attached to their heads. The Human Story: Another white man, worse than the rest, shows Holt to go to the ivory of the elephant cemetery. Tarzan won't show them the way, so the bad guy shoots an elephant so they can follow it to his deathbed. Tarzan intercedes, and the bad man shoots him ?? But of course, he survives and returns to save Jane. Everyone else dies, Holt and the bad guy and every one of them "boys." People are spending, especially Africans, and there isn't much distinction between the black community who dies because they work for the white men traveling through the taboo country and the black community they kill. It must be the last Tarzan movie before the Hays code made Jane wear more clothes. There are a number of underwater screens in which Jane looks naked, and although the light is flickering and the glimpses are very attractive. Apparently one of Weismuller's friends of the Olympic swimming team did the latest scenes, not Maureen O'Sullivan. However, she moves through the film wearing the same lapless Wormholder (plus a bikini top), which shows a beautiful look of the hip and hip. They don't have much to say yet. They sleep together and hang out with cool animals and stay away from cities. No wonder they are happy.
