This series was just like you. Spielberg would expect. It's really one of those scary, funny, childish performances you won't forget. Just like Outer Limits (another great show), this small series doesn't do much. It was wonderful, and deserved to run longer. It was a good performance, which even children could watch, although some of the shows were a bit scary when they wanted to be, but everyone always had a moral end (like the Twilight Zone) that made you realize what situation you did not want to end up in or what you did. I remember remembering some of these on Sci-fi when I was 10, and even now I still enjoy it when I can. Really a fun, imaginative show. I loved it and still.
