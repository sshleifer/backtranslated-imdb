Resident Evil: code veronica is a great well-made video game, it has good graphics, very comfortable controls, a great story and a high fun factor. The story of this is Claire Redfield, who is taken to an island for umbrella offenses, and reacting Destruction to them is the main laboratory while looking for her brother. Code Veronica's graphics are very good, the fire and rain effects look good. The buttons are comfortable, but the button pattern does not match the Dreamcast control, and makes it difficult to get used to it. It's still fun to walk around a bit of disturbing space and shoot the intestines from the zombies. Code: Veronica also has some "Romance" between the two main characters. You can also play like Chris Redfield, from Resident Evil 1 The sound in this game is better than ever, for example, though I hate the new feature. When the giant spiders crawl, their feet are a disturbing sound and the guns sound much more realistic. Great graphics, outstanding story, comfortable controls and reali Stic sound make Resident Evil Code: Veronica a definite loved one. I give it a 10 out of 10.
