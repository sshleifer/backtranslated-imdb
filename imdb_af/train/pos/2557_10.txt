I myself am a child of heart, which means I love cartoons, still do! I remember watching Bugs Bunny when I was a kid, he was still my favorite. I thought man, it was a great "new" show on TV, and if my dad said, "Bugs Bunny, I remember him when I was younger" and I'm like: Dad, mistakes do not exist if you was not younger ". So I think he is definitely more than one generation, possibly 3. I love the show. It's fun for kids and adults, OK, everyone. It's very funny, my husband and I both in us 20s, love watching the programs, and we don't care about this show, bringing back many memories, happy ones, and also love the Christmas special with Tweety as Tiny Tim, it's cute. Toons character does not choose because they have changed over the years. When I was little, of course it was Bugs and Porky Pig. Pepe is cool, I always loved him. Actually, I have to say my favorite there. n 10 out of 10, because it is a good performance for all ages, very funny, voice performance is incredible, the only fault is that it unfortunately ends, 2 covers ago, but the re-runs are great!
