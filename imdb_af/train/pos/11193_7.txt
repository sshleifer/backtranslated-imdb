I like The Lonely Lady. Give Pia a break. She looks good and she has many beautiful eyes. What's not to like? The scene where she was raped by Ray Liotta with a hose was a kind of gross and cruel. In fact, a lot of things happening in this movie are cruel and cruel. But it's a trashy movie. Many trashy movies aren't bad. I did much better than Valley of the Dolls, which was not only trashy, but also boring. At least it wasn't boring. <br /> <br /> Pia becomes very nude and looks like a writer. Look at her talking about Pushkin and Byron with an old three times her age, is flat incredible. I'm sure Pia is a beautiful person in real life, but she not only projects the author's vibe. She looked much happier when she worked as a hostess for that Saturday night feast and wearing a glittering disco dress. <br /> <br /> A few of the screens are funny. The one she tells the two-time actor that she is pregnant, and he rolls his eyes and clips her to stop hanging around! For a long time, he is almost exhausting every bimbo fleeing. <br /> <br /> Pia's nervous breakdown scene is good. It was probably a mistake to go so supernova about it (the whirlpool of swaying faces and freezing cries - whoa!) And her subsequent catatonic stupor is so exaggerated. <br /> <br /> The acceptance speech is a hoot, though. I want to see someone do the speech in a drama class. <br /> <br /> Again, this is our garbage. You can be worse on any movie of the week back in the eighties.
