The first was good and original. I wasn't a bad horror / comedy movie. So I heard that a second was made and I had to see it. <br /> <br /> What really makes this movie work is Judd Nelson's character and the sometimes clever writing. A pretty good script for a person who wrote the Final Destination movies and the direction was good. Sometimes there are screens where it appears to be filmed using a home-color video camera. <br /> <br /> Great made-for-TV movie. It was worth buying the rent and probably worth buying, just to get that lovely honest feeling and watching Judd Nelson's Stanley do what he does best. <br /> <br /> I suggest newcomers should look first one before they see the sequel you will have a Stanley idea and get a little history background.
