Having enjoyed Joyce's complex novel so sharply, I was prepared to be disappointed by Joseph Strick and Fred Haines's script, given the fabulous complexity of the original text. However, the film was very well done and a fine translation of the book's tone, naturalism and lifetime. <br /> <br /> It definitely helps to read the original text before watching the movie. I suggest the latter seems to be untouched, with many strange episodes apparently randomly merged, without prior reading of the text to understand the plot. <br /> <br /> It's amazing to see how "dirty" the movie is, as it was shot in Dublin in 1967. The Irish film censors finally saw it unlimited for the general public in Ireland, as early as 2000 (it was shown to the public in a private cinema club, the Irish Film Theater in the late 1970s). Joyce's eroticism is not only naturalistic and resting, but it offers many wild "perverse" episodes. Remember that so many of these fetishes were unacceptable when the book was published in 1922. They have always been taboo when the film was made in 1967. <br /> <br /> It is astonishing and pleasing to note the cream of the Irish acting profession of the 1960s, respected players all, to pronounce Joyce's extremely offensive text with such gusto. <br /> <br /> Bravo!
