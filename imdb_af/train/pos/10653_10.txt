I know it is trendy to hate this movie. I saw hundreds of ghost films, including the original 1963 Haunting and most of the Hammer movies. This movie is not limited and does not hold back. That's probably why so many modern viewers didn't look it. However, many viewers can accept movies like Scream out of control because knife killers are easier to believe for most people than demons or ghosts. Actually, this movie had great scenes and the acting and special effects were wonderful. I saw it 15 times and it gets better every time. The director of this film made a number of interesting and attractive films and did not try the kind of realism of the 6th sentence. The Haunting leaves and is definitely not boring. Perhaps this film can appeal to John Carpenter fans more, but more of a traditional plot structure. The old Haunting was also a good film from 1963. It was even more frightening. See both and also The Innocents and The Legend of Hell House with Pamela Franklin.
