There is such a mess on the cable channel channels I have in common with this one. From the beginning to the end it got me and earned top points. <br /> <br /> Father of two sons hear messages from "God" to kill people he is said to be demons. <br /> <br /> When the opening points showed the director as one of the role players, it can often be a warning for a bad movie; exceptionally, it is the opposite here, as the drama is not from start to finish. <br /> <br /> There is not one moment in the movie when one is not completely amazed, because there are no unnecessary or unnecessary subplots, and the writing is first class. <br /> <br /> All the actors give absolutely convincing performances, especially the main kid actor who is exceptional. <br /> <br /> This movie is at least as good as the 'Silence of the Lambs'.
