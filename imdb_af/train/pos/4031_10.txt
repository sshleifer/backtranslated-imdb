I've been a Hindi movie buffer since the age of 4, but I never watched such a moving and impact film, especially as a Hindi movie. Over the past few years I have stopped watching contemporary Hindi movies and returning to the classic (Teesri Kasam, Mere Huzoor, Madhumati, Mother India, Sholay, etc.). But this movie has changed everything. It's one of the best movies I've ever seen. I found it not only to move but also found it to be very educational for someone who is a first-generation Indian woman growing up in America. It helped me understand my own family history, which was always very abstract to me. But to "see", understand and understand it, it helped me to feel the generations before me and the struggle that the Indian people endured. The film helped bring many things to my perspective, especially in the light of the current world events. I never thought a movie would change the way I can think so before ... did it. The plot is fantastic, the acting is excellent and the direction is flawless. Two thumbs up!
