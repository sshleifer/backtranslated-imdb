I remember it more than Nausicaa from the wind valley at an age when that scene was too serious for me. Laputa, whose title in the US influenced his release in the US to avoid confusion for his wide-ranging Hispanic audiences, featured the cartoon of the director's debut production, Conan. In fact, Pazu had the thick legs and immortal vitality of Conan - who jumped from a thousand stories, carried his girl in his arms and landed on his feet and then started running. It makes him the most animated and pleasant character to watch. The Techie fans of Nausica can be disappointed by the flying mistakes and retro technology through Laputa - the only exception may be the robot. Unlike Princess Mononoke and Valley of the Winds, the Laputa theme is not directly linked to the environment. If it's a theme, it's anti-warfare. The importance of living naturally - it is related to the flying castle, was unacceptably briefly discussed and not really followed. In general, I now consider the piece as being at a cross between feel-good and corny.
