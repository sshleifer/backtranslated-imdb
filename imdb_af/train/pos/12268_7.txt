Seven young people go to the bush in search of a bear. They were all sunk and killed fiercely by a crazy Vietnam veteran. "Trampa Infernal" is a beautiful, entertaining Mexican treasurer who reminds me of "The Zero Boys". The film is fast paced and there are some good dead scenes such as the throat stripe or ax in the neck. Unfortunately, there aren't many things to do, so grand guignol fans will be disappointed. But if you're a fan of slasher movies, this rarity gives you a glimpse. pleasant slasher to see. My rating: 7 out of 10. Highly recommended.
