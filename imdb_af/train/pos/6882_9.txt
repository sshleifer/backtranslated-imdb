I didn't watch the movie, but can't wait to see it! It looks very interesting and inspiring. It was one of the most interesting trailers I have ever seen: the questions it posed have really stopped me and made me think, the unique approach to boxing as a metaphor for the "battle" ... thank you god, someone is touching another box with the box. This movie looks so fresh and smart. And the actor is really hot. I especially enjoyed the short clip with the actor of the Rocky movies, very clever. I thought that the topic that is being overcome - overcoming contradictions and child tragedies - is timeless, and God knows many people need it. Bring it on.
