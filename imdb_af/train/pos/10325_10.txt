I was educated at Doc Savage and was disturbed by the green death as a child, but even then as I did, I thoroughly entertained it. I have seen many friends and colleagues who have seen this film and most affected by the variety of reactions, granted they think I am mostly strange, but there you are. "I don't know what it's about the Doc, but he always gets the girls" should be the ultimate line if you look at his sad men. This movie is a classic spoof on all the superhero genre, and was far away before that time, it shouldn't be taken seriously, moving over Austin Powers. Ron Ely is a God. It is a pity that this film has not yet been released on the UK DVD. I don't think it should be recreated and bastardized, as I said it is a classic, it can't be done without Ron. (Like Italian work without Mini and Michael Caine). I give it 10/10.
