Paul Verhoeven (genius and master film producer) returns with less than perfect, but still fun in a "dirty old man kind of way," Hollow Man. The first two acts are so good that the victim's final act disappointed. However, I give a recommendation to this movie because it has MIND BLOWING special effects (perhaps the best so far) and two dandy performances by the lead. Verhoeven's moral questions are, of course, challenging, and although the film has turned off a lot, this movie is pretty soft for old Verhoeven. <br /> <br /> Two major mistakes: Josh Brolin (aka walking monkeys) and the entire handling of the elevator. If there was an access loader, why were they trapped in the lab? <br /> <br /> A fun horror movie for a Saturday night.
