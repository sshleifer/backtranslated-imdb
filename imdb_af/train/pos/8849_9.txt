The Hanson brothers - Andy (apparently having his act together) and Hank (obviously not having his act together) need money. Andy comes with a scheme to get dough that will have consequences for the entire Hanson family. <br /> <br /> This movie delivers. It's a layered, thoroughbred ride that knows exactly what it does. As a crime drama / thriller I would like to compare it with 'No Country for Old Men'. "While both films have a wide range of character drama and excitement," Devil "is more on the thrill because of its fast pace. 'No Country' is a colder and paler film that you can really admire, while 'devil' is a bit nicer. There is definitely less violence in 'devil' than 'no country'. The acting liver also. Ethan Hawke, sometimes wood in the past, watches the jitters, sweat and the deer-in-the-head look at the besieged Hank. Philip Seymour Hoffman, as Andy, has the movie's toughest scenes and is rapidly becoming the actor. Whoever you believe can do anything. <br /> <br /> There is really not much wrong with this movie. It jumps back and forth without being confusing. Events out of control, but the film never does - the writing (from first timer Kelly Masterson), director (veteran Sidney Lumet) and editing remain as tight as a drum. In many categories, it's awards caliber things, but maybe movies like 'The Departed' and 'No Country' are all clamped out of the spotlight. If you like it, you'll like it.
