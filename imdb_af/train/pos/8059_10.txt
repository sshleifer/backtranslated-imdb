I watched this movie on Turner Classic Movies last night and was blown away by Victor McLaglen's performance. In every sense of the word is a "tour de force". The atmosphere of the 1922 Dublin created film and production design. These are truly well-known techniques that are used in the best movies of the 40's and early 50's. Very good attention to detail, while Frankie McPhillip's mourners (Wallace Ford) pray the prayer. Gaelic. Max Steiner's score is memorable. As in later films such as 1939's GWTW, he has allocated folk songs to borrow local color and a sense of place and time. John Ford: already a movie giant in 1935!
