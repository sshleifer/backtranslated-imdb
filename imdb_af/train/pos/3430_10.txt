I caught it at a show at the Sundance Film Festival and was angry at the absolute power of this movie. This is an investigation of the psychological effects on our brave soldiers joining the army, hoping that they will honor our country with honor and also be cared for by our government. The film describes the psychological changes that take place in boat camps, as the soldiers are being transformed into the "murderers of their country" and coming into the war and the aftermath of the house. It also shows the effect of death on the human psyche. It pays tribute to the Soldiers and never criticizes the soldiers other than other films, but rather criticizes a system that is not prepared to care and does not provide for all the physical and psychological needs of the returned veterinarians. <br /> <br /> This film is powerful, moving, emotional and thoughtful. It stands as a call to arms to support our troops, not just by buying stickers and going to parades, but actually listening to them and helping to change the way their health and to support welfare after the murder. <br /> <br /> The best movie of the festival so far, **** / ****
