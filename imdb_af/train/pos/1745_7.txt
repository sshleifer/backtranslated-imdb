How truly friendly, charming and cordial is this unpretentious old series; I was glad to see old Lugosi. It is immaculately friendly and alive. This is the document of a long, lost vessel. (The best TV series today can hardly compete with this old, moderately good series.) CHANDU is deep, deeply optimistic and hedonistic. It renews the mind. It's not stupid; Stupid are those who do not get the terms on which such magazines work. CHANDU has an irresistible sense of simple, unpretentious and friendly pleasure. <br /> <br /> Without leaving? Chandu is a western magician who also goes through this Eastern name and also loves and protects his cousin from a sect of murderers. <br /> <br /> Chandu practices his supernatural gifts in a fairly discreet and moderate manner. <br /> <br /> Regarding the pretty sexy cousin, Nadji, she is kidnapped by Ubasti's priest: the bad Vindhyan. The poor sexy girl is actually kidnapped in a sarcophagus after he slept with a flower; almost abducted from a boat; by a false policeman; the temple of Lemuria and its strange, fiery ceremonies resemble the KING KONG imagery ?? and is a barbaric mockery of the RCC ceremonies and rituals. <br /> <br /> Do you want to protect a girl as bravely as Chandu do? <br /> <br /> Lugosi looked like an old, libidinous and very heartless, drunk, and it only contributed to his performances. He is the prototype average drunk uncle, unashamed and cunning and oblique. It may look like a rather curvy tribute to Lugosi? Still, Burton's biopies from Wood have left me the impression of Lugosi and thereby a strong sympathy for the brave actor. I enjoy Lugosi's fancy performances. <br /> <br /> This series is unfairly based.
