When visiting American writer Edgar Allan Poe London, he is approached by British journalist Alan Foster, who becomes the target of a particular bet. Not believing Poe's claim that all his macabre stories are based on real experience, Foster accepts Poe's commitment and his friend, Sir Thomas Blackwood, that he can't spend a whole night in the Blackwood ghost castle. Once installed in the abandoned castle, Foster discovers that he is not alone, as he is approached by several beautiful women and attractive men and a physician of metaphysics - stating that they are all condemned to lost souls for the stories of their demise. Repeat the anniversary of their deaths! The first time I watched this wonderful bit of classic horror, I was enchanted all the time. I really found the movie creepy and at the same time sad. Babs Steele is undeniably beautiful. The music score makes the atmosphere twice as terror inducing. The topless scene made me feel like I didn't expect it. Synapse seems to have done a good job with picture enhancement, because this movie looks damned for its age, and it's the Uncut International version to get started. This is the movie that started my Babs Steele and Klaus Kinski collection.
