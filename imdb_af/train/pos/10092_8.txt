The brilliant Elizabeth Taylor stars in these lesser-known classics as a young girl from London who falls in love with a tea plantation owner of British Ceylon (currently Sri Lanka). On arrival, she immediately felt instantly and was forced to adapt to the new culture, as well as being constantly aware of the fierce elephant herd. William Dieterle, who also directed the life of Emile Zola and Portrait of Jennie, does a masterful job of bringing a somewhat dark and almost ominous undertone to this romance and the environment is one of the most beautiful things I've seen with the black has. and a white themed house and beautiful island landscape.
