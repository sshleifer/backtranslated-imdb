I remember seeing this movie when I was about 7; and then it shocked me. I have previously seen a violent movie, but I have never seen a movie with the consequences and reality of violence. This movie not only shows it, but it also shows how people can change their lives and choose happiness. What this movie did and the accident failed was to be truth. Crash has tried to show how racism was bad (and Crash actually has a built-in anti-Asian bias) and to come from a morally better position. Grand Canyon has gained things from such a raw and real perspective that it actually falls on a higher ground than collapse. Especially when you compare the ends. The end of the accident is this so-called neat little end that restricts everything. While the Grand Canyon simply ends on a quiet note, where you know nothing will change much in the character's life, but it's because life is just going, there's no end to it. No matter how good. You're bad. There is no end to a chapter to start another.
