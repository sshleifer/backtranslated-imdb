Joan Fontaine is a 'Damsel in Distress' in this 1937 musical lead, Fred Astaire, George Burns and Gracie Allen. The story about it is about a British woman (Fontaine) who fell in love with an American, wrong for Astaire, a musical comedy star. <br /> <br /> The movie, led by George Stevens, features some wonderful Gershwin music, including "Nice Work If You Can Get It" and "A Foggy Day." The best scene is the "Stiff Upper Lip" number, which takes place in a fun home. <br /> <br /> Astaire's singing voice sounds stronger in this movie than it does in others, and he has some excellent dance numbers. Burns plays the best publicity and Allen is Burns secretary. She is hilarious. The problem is, as others have noted, Fontaine, who has to dance with Astaire at the end of the film. Stevens could easily use a double because he showed the dance in a long shot, and it is under the trees. I thought it was a double, except that the dance was so bad. <br /> <br /> Despite its flaws, it's definitely worth seeing.
