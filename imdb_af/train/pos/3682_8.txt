Often movies of this kind come as a mixed bag with great work along with a little fool to fill the runtime. Whether it's the big name support or the project itself, Paris your t'aime never falls into this empire. I believe I can really say that the movie as a whole is better than its parts. Between the wonderful transitions and the fantastic end series, which merges characters into one last view of love in Paris, I think the movie would have suffered if any bat was removed. True, there are definitely a few standouts that overshadow the rest, but eventually I have a lasting image, even if it's just a split second of every short vignette. Love takes many forms, and the talent comes here, to surprise the audience by the shifts and elegance of the many facets of the emotion. <br /> <br /> Quartier des Enfants Rouges: Maggie Gyllenhaal surprised as a drug-dedicated actress shooting in Paris and meeting with her merchant. The revelation at the lock leaves you a bit out of balance as the imagination changes between the two hands. <br /> <br /> Quatier Latin: Ben Gazzara and Gena Rowlands (recreating a relationship of an old Cassavettes movie?) Bring some good-looking white and sarcasm as they meet to discuss their impending divorce. What about their conversation is true and what just makes others angry, it's nice to give a smile to your face. <br /> <br /> Quais de Seine: Director Gurinder Chadha gives us a touch of love that exists above religious and racial differences. It's a lovely little story of shameful love between two people who obviously feel a connection, but it can't really agree. <br /> <br /> Tour Eiffel: I will admit I am disappointed that Sylvain Chomet does not get an animated order. movie, Les Triplettes de Belleville. <br /> <br /> Tuileries: The Coen Brothers adhere to their strange sense of humor and delivers some good laughs. Steve Buscemi shines and sells the show without speaking a word. His face reactions to the oral abuse of a dissatisfied Frenchman are invaluable. <br /> <br /> Bastille: Here's a heartbreaking portrait of a couple just out of love to get it back in the face of the tragedy. Sergio Castellitto and Miranda Richardson shift as the couple having trouble and determine how strong the bond of true love is. <br /> <br /> Pére-Lachaise: A surprisingly funny little story of horror master Wes Craven. A bit of Oscar Wilde humor can add life to any relationship. <br /> <br /> Parc Monceau: Alfonso Cuarón seems to be practicing the incredibly long-lasting perfect in Children of Men with this story of two people in love, walking down the street. As Nick Nolte and Ludivine Sagnier eventually see in the near future, we also find the true context of their conversation of "forbidden love." <br /> <br /> Porte de Choisy: A very surreal look at the glamor of Paris. This is probably the strangest entry, but so intriguing that you can't look away from the madness that arises. Don't make your Asian beautician angry, whatever you do. <br /> <br /> Pigalle: An interesting look at a relationship that plays a role-playing that seems to be stagnant for years. A little variety of Bob Hoskins is needed to flame. <br /> <br /> Quartier de la Madeleine: Even vampires in Paris can find love between feeding hours. I don't know if it will be happy for Elijah because of it or not. Beautifully shot and muffled to allow the vitality of the crimson, this short is strange, but then it is also love. <br /> <br /> 14th arrondissement: Let Alexander Payne's strange sense of humor really add to this voice-over story of an American in Paris to find love. Her hard, uneducated French is a very strong contrast to the authentic accent that we listened to until this point. Just as unnecessary that it is both funny and completely true to the story. <br /> <br /> Montmartre: An interesting introduction to the proceedings. Paris can be a city that is considerate of everyday activities, such as finding a parking space, but when love is discovered, it will take the prisoner everywhere to continue the journey. <br /> <br /> Loin du 16eme: Catalina Sandino Moreno shows brilliantly The love for a child is through her subtle performance, as the story is sung by a young child, but still completely different. <br /> <br /> The place of the feet: My favorite story of the bunch. Seydou Boro and Aïssa Maïga are simply fantastic. The cyclical nature of the story and how the fate brings the two characters together twice so Boro can finally ask her for coffee is hard to see. Sometimes love at your last moment is enough to accept man's abandonment of this earth. <br /> <br /> Place of Victoires: One of the best stories about a mother trying to handle the death of her young boy. Juliette Binoche is devastating like the mother, desperate for one last look at her son, and Willem Dafoe is strange as the cowboy gives her the chance. <br /> <br /> Faubourg Saint-Denis: Sometimes one has to think he's lost to accept that he's not fully invested in the relationship. Melchior Beslon remembers, and tries to find where they went wrong through a series of sharp, quick cuts of his meeting Natalie Portman to finally see how much he needs her. <br /> <br /> Le Marais: Let it go to Gus Van Sant shows us a story about the gap in communication and understanding, as his films almost always go with some form of alienation. Elephant's photographer is an American work in Paris, the catalyst for Gaspard Ulliel's love and soulmate artist camps. Sometimes you don't have to know what is being said to understand what is going on in the breaks.
