I don't understand. I am not a critic, I do not evaluate the quality of the play, which I find credible, a good thing. My confusion lies with the content. Is no one else sensitive to the fact that these two unfaithful women justify their unfaithfulness to people who fight and flourish to guarantee the continued freedom of their families and their country. Wouldn't there have been a prologue to let us know if the men made it home and if so, what effect did they have on their fraudulent "women's" infidelity? While these women covered their prejudice from a sense of loneliness, did they think their husbands enjoyed being shot while confronted with death or disinfection daily? They didn't even think of their husbands! Only of themselves. Forgive me except when they wanted to kill their husbands.
