Shortly before the imposition of a morality code, the spirits of writers, directors and actors were obscured, the first movie adaptation of W. Somerset Maugham's "Of Human Bondage" titles to numerous filmmakers. It has no shock value today, just good acting. <br /> <br /> While the movie is great, it is Bette Davis' first major role and one of Leslie Howard's best achievements. Howard is the English wannabe Parisian artist Philip Carey who said softly and firmly that he has no talent and that his dedication is not a substitute for true genius. He takes the lesson to heart and returns to London and writes in a medical college (one that has no female students at the same time. At that time there would have been at least some. Perhaps writer / doctor Maugham didn't take care of distaff medicos). <br /> <br /> To have one day, Carey is captivated by a waitress, Mildred Rogers, Bette Davis in a morally loose and basically evil farrago. Her Cockney accent is as sharp as Eliza Doolittle's. His repeated attempts to meet her are greeted with the less-than-enthusiastic answer, "I don't mind," a sure sign for any man with his head screwed straight, that he sets the depths in motion. Maugham's Mildred supplemented her waitress with a bit of old-fashioned street walking, something that wasn't clearly brought here. <br /> <br /> Carey's particular prostration serves Rogers's atrocious need for financial support. He is desperately in love with her. She plays him as a Sunday care organ. No sex here. Recognizing that he is nowhere, he begins a pious relationship with Norah, a woman who loves him. Repeat Mildred, full of baby, and her usual need to be cared for. Leave heart-broken Norah. <br /> <br /> Another separation from Mildred and Carey begins a long-term friendship with Sally. She is enthusiastic by her father, who apparently sees the ultimate marriage as both a good thing for the two youngsters, and a chance to relieve one of his nine offspring. <br /> <br /> The movie is reasonable, but not quite, following Maugham's excellent novel. Howard's Carey is naive and vulnerable and for many of the movie his sad eyes are one of the dead who has a dual shotgun. Mildred is ominously evil, a user of the worst kind, her only concern with her own needs is hardly disguised as she tries to embrace Carey with a thin patina of loving words (and at one point offers her promise that she will do anything [ he] wants, "a daring statement for the times and one I really understood. <br /> <br /> Pre-code may be, but Mildred's quick march dissolution would be the League of Catholic Decency The end is lost to conventional sin, principal behavior triumphs. <br /> <br /> Director John Cromwell has excellent performances from his two main stars, one well-established and the other mainly due to this film, The atmosphere is 1930's London and the journey back in time is worth taking. <br /> <br /> Available on DVD. <br /> <br /> 9/10 (for Davis and Howard's appearances)
