And I'm a fan of Nicole Kidman. I will pay to see and hear her read the Moscow phone book, which may have been done to all I know when she spoke Russian in this movie. <br /> <br /> All four principals are excellent, but the movie itself is a number of good images and better scenes kept at nothing. <br /> <br /> While one is always willing to suspend unbelief while watching a movie, one asks too much from the viewer. <br /> <br /> It could have been very funny (whether in parts) or very frightening (in one scene), but the director didn't know which way to go.
