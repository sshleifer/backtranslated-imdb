It could have been a better movie. It adds points and the central story moves from Boyer and completes his mission to Boyer to end Wanda Hendrix's death, but Graham Greene is a writer who is really hard to spoil. His stories are all morality talks, due to his own considerations of Catholicism, guilt and innocence (many relative terms in his worldview) and human condition. <br /> <br /> Boyer is Luis Denard, a well-known concert pianist, who sat with the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War. He was sent to England to try and execute an urgently needed arms deal. Unfortunately for Denard he is literally on his own - all of his contacts seem to be a willing jacket for the Falagists of Spain. In particular, Katina Paxinou (Ms. Melendez) a grim boarding porter, and Peter Lorre (Mr. Contreras) a teacher of an international Esperanto-type international language. Wanda Hendrix is ​​the drudge of a girl (Else) who is for Mrs. Melendez works. The local diplomat, Licata (Victor Francken) is already a willing fellow member of the Falangiste. <br /> <br /> The British (Holmes Herbert, Miles Mander, and best - if not the worst - of George Coulouris) Boyer's cause do not give much hope (what he soon understands, Britain may be long ago). Herbert and Mander just returned to the official neutrality policy ordered by the Ramsay MacDonald and Stanley Baldwin governments during the Civil War. Coulouris here is a typical spot. Blimp-type - always impeccable in its own English diction. He is keen to show his aversion to foreigners in general. <br /> <br /> The one ray of hope is Lauren Bacall (Rose Cullen), trying to play her role as well as possible - but she really can't. She is an aristocrat - the daughter of a persian. It was Bacall's second movie, and (sad to say), her long career almost sank. She did well, but the spark she showed in her first movie was due to the dual effect of starring Humphrey Bogart and Howard Hawks. Boyer is a good actor, but he is not Bogie, and Herman Shumlin is not Hawks. Her next film returned to Bogie and Hawks, and her star went up again. <br /> <br /> It's a dark movie (like the novel). Boyer's mission never succeeds in that because he has too many hidden enemies anywhere in the place. But the villains are also losers - often with their lives. <br /> <br /> With Dan Seymour as a suspicious foreign tenant of Katina Paxinou (and the man who destroys her). It is worth looking at the Warner's many character characters who are doing their best with the weakness in the direction.
