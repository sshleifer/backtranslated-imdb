I first made this film on my way home from Paris to Newark aboard Air France in August 1996. The movie itself I believe is quite a masterpiece. It's the kind of movie people have to make. I still think Daniel Auteuil is one of the sexiest actors. In this French film he plays a divorced father and businessman who has lost his life for life until he has a Down Syndrome man living in an institution with other Down Syndrome patients. The actors, including the actor who actually has Down Syndrome, create a credible friendship and relationship between these two unlikely men. Daniel's life and we change forever with the Down Syndrome man. He realizes that life not only works and does not play, but for the living and loving, and that is what life is all about. The end is stupid, but I still think it's one of my favorite movies. It's enough to bring a tear to your eye.
