"Hate a minute" is a hauntingly beautiful movie. A psychological excitement that takes you on a journey through the nightmare, it's the life of a serial killer, Eric Seaver. Strong performances and excellent cinematography make this movie a "must see" for any film student or horror fan. The reality of the story and the human side of Eric separates this film from other psycho-killers. Some exclamations to the film's producer, Bruce Campbell as well as the film "The Evil Dead" add humor to everyone who knows the genre.
