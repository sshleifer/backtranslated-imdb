This movie is visually amazing. Who cares whether she can act or not. Each scene is a work of art composed and captured by John Derek. The sites, sets of designs and costumes function perfectly to convey what is found in a love story consisting of beauty, youth and wealth. In some ways I want to see this movie as a tribute to John and Bo Derek's story. And ... these comments would not be complete without explaining Anthony Quinn's role as a father, mentor, lover, and man's depiction of a man, who was lost when men were men. There are some of us who find value in strength and direction wrapped in confidence that contributes to a sense of trust, inclusion and security. Yes, they no longer make men! But how often do you find women made like Bo Derek.
