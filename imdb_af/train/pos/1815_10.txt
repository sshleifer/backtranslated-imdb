"Perhaps Spoilers contain * <br /> <br />" All the dogs go to heaven "is a good movie. I saw it in 1989 when I was two years old. I didn't understand it so well not, but as I saw it more and more I started to love it. I love the songs in this movie. My favorite songs are "Let Me Surprised" and "Soon You'll Come Home." These are beautiful songs The only thing that botheres me The movie is Charlie Dieing, when I was little, my sister couldn't even see that part, unlike this movie is wonderful. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the movie is when Annabelle and Charlie fly around sky.The sky is beautiful in the movie and the "bells" are very clever. I also love Itchy, I actually have 3 slides of my own. They are so cute. <br /> <br /> Overall, I love this movie and suggest everyone should see it, I give this movie 10/10 stars.
