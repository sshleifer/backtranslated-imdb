Actually, this is the story of two men who were part of the Portuguese Revolution. It was easy to understand the game, but usually directors from a historical fact start talking about something else, or they also show the period before or after this fact. Here everything happens during those few days when the revolution is taking place. It can also be seen as a kind of documentary. The film focuses on these two people, who usually look like not like ordinary heroes, because people's revolution comes. Although made out of the military army, you can understand that they were just "capitaes" as main characters. Nice colors and lights throughout the movie, great work for the director who is her first movie, does not fall into the banal way. Well-shown emotions and passion of people and crowds. The character of Maia (head one) is well made and there is also a good interpretation for Stefano Accorsi, who can show Maia's boundaries, it is not a hero.
