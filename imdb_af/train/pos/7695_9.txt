Good Times was a groundbreaking comedy about the first nuclear black family living in Chicago projects. Whether you live in the city center, ghettos, suburbs or rural countryside, this show is still a treasure to see and see a family, just a family, rather than a show of a poor black family. But they don't live in it. They find humor and have strong family values ​​and morals. Despite the story behind the scenes, this show was worth keeping on the air, except I didn't like killing the dad, which I agreed with Esther Rolle who fought hard for the keep family together. But despite all the battles behind the scenes, Good Times was a family show. We all loved JJ's dynamite and his antics. We've seen Janet Jackson's Penny grow up a bit. This show was groundbreaking to show despair in drugs, gangs and alcoholism. Without preaching, the Evans always tried to do the right thing rather than doing something wrong to get out of the ghetto.
