Although one of the standard "Revenge Price Plots", this movie is my favorite of Vincent Price's work. Gallico has the quality that is lacking in so much horror movie characters. If you see it, you feel him, you feel his frustration, the injustices against him, and you encourage him if he takes revenge, even if he scares you a bit with his original anger. As the film goes on, his character becomes tragic. He committed his murder, but now he must kill to cover it. And again to cover the one. And again ... your stomach is sinking with its soul as it takes off its spiral - like looking at a beloved brother, it becomes a hood. Even if the revenge story is of old, the plot devices themselves are original. Gallico uses his tricks to kill in more and more inventive ways. A disgrace, this one is not available for home weaving.
