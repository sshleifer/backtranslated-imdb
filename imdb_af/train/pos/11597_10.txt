I read so much comment that I also had part of remembering this movie and I didn't want to see it again, but I didn't know the name of the movie. Fortunately, as I did a search and found the title on this site, I read the comments left here and realized that it was the movie I remembered. Then I did a search and found the movie and was so excited to see the movie again 40 years later. Because of this site and your comments, you helped me and I would like to thank you all. I want to share how I could find this movie for anyone who was also looking for a copy. It was on the VHS version of the wonderful world of Disney's "call it courage" which contains 2 movies, the second one being the legend of the boy and the eagle. It has touched me now as much as it did 40 years ago and now I own my own copy. I think it's only available on VHS. I found it on ebay and I saw several copies of it. Enjoy it, I know I did it! <br /> <br /> It's a wonderful story about the love of a boy and the eagle he cared for. When it was time to sacrifice the eagle, the boy released the eagle because he could not kill it. After the boy was forced to leave the tribe after he freed the eagle, the eagle also saved the boy's life and more than that, taught him how to survive. The closeness shared by the boy and the eagle in the desert was so moving and the filming was really remarkable. What a wonderful era it was. I've never seen anything close to this movie!
