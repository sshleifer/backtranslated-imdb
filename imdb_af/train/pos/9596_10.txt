This movie documents a transforming experience for a group of young men, and the experience to view it is in itself transformative for the viewer. Few movies even strive for this level of transcendence, and I can't think of any other movie - documentary or drama - that it achieves. There is no other movie in which I both laughed and cried so much. Yes, it's about DMD and accessible travel; On these issues alone, it's a worthwhile business, but it's more. It's about friendship. It's about life itself, about life every day you live. And this is a wonderful, fun, adventurous story. That's why God created the theater! See this movie !!!
