Although not in the whole movie, Andy Griffith plays his role the best in this CBS TV movie. The plot is easy-Griffith's character dies and his last wish is that his wife and children scatter as if they were, the place he called (Mountains Somewhere). Although it will never be seen on television and never released on video, if you get the chance to watch it - take it.
