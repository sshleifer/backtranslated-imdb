Carrere, a young company director accused of fraud, 35-year-old Transsexual in the process of his transformation. Daisy, a 20-year-old mentally challenged idiot savant and Lassalle, a 60-year-old intellectual who was killed. his wife. Behind a rocket in the cell they secretly released. They discovered a book: the diary of a former prisoner, Danvers, who occupied the cell at the beginning of the century. The diary contains magical formulas that presumably allow prisoners to escape. "Malefique" is one of the creepiest and most intelligent horror movies I've seen this year. The film has a dirty, shady feel that is influenced by the works of HP Lovecraft, which creates a very creepy and disturbing atmosphere. There is a fair amount of gore involved in some imaginative and brutal deaths and the characters of four prisoners are surprisingly well-developed. It is a pity that Eric Valette is really horrible remake of "One Missed Call" after his beautiful debut.9 out of 10.
