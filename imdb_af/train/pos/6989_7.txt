This movie was on a very early episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000, but if I see this movie, I don't think of that great TV show. I believe it was a surprisingly good early 40's horror flick, with a very surprisingly good sound and image for a 67-year-old public domain horror movie. I actually enjoyed seeing Bela Lugosi and his bizarre staff, including his wife needing liquids from the glands of a young bride, an old hag and her two bizarre boys, one a huge idiot, the other a comic dwarf (Angelo Rossitto from 1932's Freaks). I also enjoyed the beautiful young female reporter, which is a kind of stereotype, but still fun to watch. My only problem with this otherwise decent movie is it's plot, even ridiculous and incredible for a movie. I don't want to spoil any of this movie, so go out and rent it, or better, buy it for a few bucks.
