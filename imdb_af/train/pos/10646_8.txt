This great movie is mainly made up of documentary footage currently on a DVD with Prelude to War. The great American filmmaker and storyteller Frank Capra made these films that simply and clearly pay attention to the main points of World War II and Hitler's rise. <br /> <br /> Every schoolchild, no, every American should watch these movies today because they are so enjoyable. History repeats itself over and over again! The Lord Chamberlains still lives and kicks; The tactics used by the Nazis of infiltrating countries through sympathizers and then the Communists and now by Muslim terrorist groups are still working to the benefit of this evil group. <br /> <br /> By allowing Hitler to remain aggressive as early as 1935 - France, America and England caused more than 50 million people's death. Americans, French and British today would like to do Hitler exactly the same, despite the fact that we learned from history what happens if we allow dictators. <br /> <br /> These great movies can be too simplistic for World War II history buffs. They do not tell the horrors that the Soviet Union caused, because when America teamed up with them, Hitler fought. This film tells the clear facts and motives that led to the terrible war.
