Ingrid Bergman is a temporarily impoverished Polish count in 1900's Paris, found herself by France's most popular general and a glamorous count - and it is on top of a shoe magnate. It is the failed premise that brings one of the most boring plots in film history. There is a backroom political attack by the general's handlers, a balloon daughter and ecstasy Bastille day-walker, but the heart of this wonderfully photographed film is the fierce upper and lower intrigue that fringed servants and just slightly more sustainable aristocrats. Yes, these are Rules of the Game redux. Before all this is done, Gaston Modot, the jealous game guard in Rules, presents a look - like a gypsy capo, no less! Things happen a little too thick and fast to the end, causing confusion for this non-French speaker, but what is the Elena and Her Men a very human Renoir masterpiece.
