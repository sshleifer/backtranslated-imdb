Castle of Blood is a great example of quality work in the horror genre that turned out in Italy in the 60s. The movie has all the right elements - old dark house, atmosphere, a decent story, and Barbara Steele. Steele makes most movies worth seeing. <br /> <br /> The story is about a ghost castle. People visited, but no one returned. Our hero makes a bet that he can spend the night in the castle and return to collect his profits. But the night he visits is a special night. This is the night every year when the dead return to revive their deaths. <br /> <br /> The only mistake I see in the movie is the running time. It feels almost tough. There is a large portion of the first act where literally nothing happens. Our hero stumbles into the dark and finds nothing important. But as soon as he gets something, the movie comes up and gets nice. <br /> <br /> Castle of Blood is a must for Steele fans and fans of Italian Gothic horror in general.
