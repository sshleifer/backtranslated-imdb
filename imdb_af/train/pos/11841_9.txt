It was a good movie with a good story. My children (10, 7, 5 and 4) all loved this movie, including myself. The music was also fantastic. No, the horses don't talk, but instead the story is told by Spirit. And to hear a story told by a horse's point when it was fun. <br /> <br /> I think the title says everything, "spirit". This movie really gives you a sense of family and home and friends. I would have to say my 4-year-old son and the 5-year-old girl was really touched by this movie, and even managed, they laughed so loudly and they finally cheered spirit. <br /> <br /> Enjoy "Spirit" with your family and add your mind with this heartwarming story. Your kids will love it. I think you will too.
