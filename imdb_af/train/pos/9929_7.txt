I doubt many of this film is based on a true story. At first it is based on a true story, kind of. I bet the only truth was there. There was an ex-model, after which the bounty hunter might be called Domino. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Domino starts with Lucy Liu, who works for the FBI. Domino is being questioned about what she knows about a $ 10 million theft. Through flashbacks we see Domino as a kid, then as a model, and how she is interested in being a bounty hunter. She basically tells two other bounty hunters, Ed and Choco. They joined her with the group. She is tough, can use any type of weapon and looks good if needed. <br /> <br /> They become involved in a scam that goes to Clarmont, a sponsor. Along the way, the group is launching a reality TV show, which is where Ian Zering and Brian Austin Green get involved. They are similar to hosts and had to be very desperate to appear here. <br /> <br /> I thought the story was entertaining and it laughed a bit. The editing didn't bother me. There is also a lot of violence, mainly with guns and blood. It could have been a little shorter. <br /> <br /> FINAL THICKNESS: Good enough to watch.
