Even early in his career, Capra was quite full of his camera work and his timing. It is a thin story - and sometimes predictable - but he does get very good performances from his role and has some intricate camera movements that intimately involve the viewer. The first part looks like a Cinderella story, although anyone with a brain can see the bottom falling out - the rich 'prince' will lose his fortune. <br /> <br /> However, due to its good cast and fast pace, it's easy to get caught up in the clich√©s. Then the movie becomes more original, as the couple have to find a way to make a living. The end is very predictable but satisfactory. I also want to compliment the title writing: very funny and fun.
