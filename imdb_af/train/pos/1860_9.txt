I went to see Antone Fisher not knowing what to expect and was most pleasantly surprised. The acting work of Derek Luke was excellent and the story line was excellent. Of course, Denzel Washington did his usual good work of acting as well as directing. It makes you realize that people with mental problems can be helped and this movie is a perfect example of this. Do not miss this one.
