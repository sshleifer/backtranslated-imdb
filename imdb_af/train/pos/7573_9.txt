One of the most terrifying game experiences ever to make you keep the lights next to your bed. Great storyline with a romantic, horrible and ironic plot. Fans of the original Resident Evil will be for a surprise of a recurring character! Not to mention that the voice workers have improved dramatically over the previous series. Don't miss the best of the series.
