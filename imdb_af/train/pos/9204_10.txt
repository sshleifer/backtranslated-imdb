The story for Her Rama Hare Krishna actually came to Dev Anand's mind when he observed hippies and their cases in Kathmandu where he was after the protest against his former Prem Pujari in Calcutta. He was low spirits because his film was opposed and burned a few Prem Pujari posters. But the life of hippies is again used in Dev's mind to be made into a movie. <br /> <br /> That was perhaps Dev Anand's best legal attempt. The film was a solid hit at the box and Zeenat Aman, as Dev's sister made a huge impact. <br /> <br /> This film was Dev Anand's call to the nation to maintain their moral values. <br /> <br /> It's about a Montereal-based Indian family and the brother's role is a very loving one for his sister. But the parents dispute and divorce Prashant (Dev) with mother and Jasbir (Zeenat) with father. She is repeatedly told that her mother and brother have died and she finally believes that she will never see Prashant again. <br /> <br /> She is being treated ill by her stepmother and she walks away from home. Dev becomes a pilot and he learns that Jasbir is in some hippies in Kathmandu. <br /> <br /> To reunite with his sister, Dev travels to Kathmandu and meets Shanti (Mumtaz) who must marry him later and also Janice who is actually Jasbir with a new name and new identity. She also forgot her childhood and Dev. Dev has to come back to his sister among all the other events that include suspicion as a thief in Kathmandu and the people after his life. <br /> <br /> It was a story well directed and acted - both by Dev Anand. We see more of Zeenat Aman than of Mumtaz. But the music by Rahul Dev Burman was well composed. Dev first offered the music to be compiled by Sachin Dev Burman, but Burman Da did not want Dev to do the movie. He was very close to Dev and his previous film Prem Pujari, although it was good but was in Calcutta. Burman Da wanted Dev to try a lighter topic because he thought hippie cult film could make people's anger against Dev worse. But Dev continued with the film, reassuring Burman Da and the movie was indeed a success. <br /> <br /> R D Burman sang Asha Bhosle's award-winning Dum Maro Dum. Kanchi re Kanchi re was another good number. <br /> <br /> Overall this is a good movie.
