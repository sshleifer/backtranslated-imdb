What a pearl of a movie, so good that they made a sequel. <br /> <br /> The movie really starts with a nasty monster eating a few people and a party where the two main characters first see each other's eyes. <br /> <br /> Bendan Hughes plays the eccentric Vlad, a little of whom this character has moved into town and uses the services of a particular broker to find him a home. . <br /> <br /> Hell, we've all seen vampire movies, we know the format. <br /> <br /> The movie is viewable, but the actors' performances are very timber and they look like they don't want to be in this movie, but it may just be part of the decadent atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Didn't stop, but there is a sequel, watch it. <br /> <br /> When I watched the movie, I thought Brendan Hughes didn't really fit the part. Later I couldn't stop thinking about him, he expressed a terrible sensuality. Maybe he was right for the part. BRENDAN HUGHES Last seen in 'Hitler - the rise of evil' as Lt. Guffman. <br /> <br /> Where is he now?
