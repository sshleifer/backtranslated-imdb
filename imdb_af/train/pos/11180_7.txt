Making a book in a movie by following the story page-by-page is never a good idea. When people read the book, they automatically start their own "spiritual movie" of which the characters look, the places in which they exist, how the situations progress. And everyone's mind-opus is different. Therefore, the REAL movie will eventually come out, and you'll always have a demarcated segment of the movie group that is disappointed that it doesn't just measure up. <br /> <br /> All a screenwriter and director can hope to reach is what their own vision of the movie is, and hope it comes as close as possible to their audience's expectations. <br /> <br /> There is no better case for this situation than the movies based on Stephen King's novels. If filmmakers capture at least the essence of his stories, the results can be breathtaking and truly frightening (CARRIE, SALEM'S LOT, THE DEAD ZONE), or they may be fans who consider themselves a gawd-horrible mess (Kubrick's THE SHINING, the miniseries for IT and the TOMMYKNOCKERS). <br /> <br /> Although not even close to the perfect King fit, PET SEMATAR has so many moments of just the skin-and-bone deep discomfort that apparently blew on the screen directly from the book , it you can pretty much forgive its shortcomings. For this we have Mr. Mary Lambert, music video script director, thanked her for resigning (she also directed SIESTA, not a horror movie, but another freaky-as-hell should see you screenplay through the 'Manster' himself, and probably one of its better. <br /> <br /> Since the majority of you know the story, I won't let you sleep with much of the details, Dr. Louis Creed (Dale Midkiff) has his family in the perfect home land moved. Well, almost perfect, except for two nasty little details: the dangerous busy stretch of the interstate highway, and the big pet cemetery in the forest. Since Louis is a veterinarian and has a young toddler for a boy Well, even if you didn't read the book, do the freakin 'math. It's a King story, after all, no mystery on the way. <br /> <br /> It's not so much the destination that counts here, but the haunting one keeps on the road. screaming life: Rachel Creed (STAR ​​TREK'S Denise Crosby), scary memory of her terminally ill, lame sister; Louis's encounters with the devoted hunter Victor Pascow (Brad Greenquist), both before and after his death; the trip to the "other" cemetery outside the pet cemetery. And that third act ... if it doesn't give you some nightmares, maybe you should check your wrist. <br /> <br /> Good performances by everyone here, especially Fred Gwynne as the well-known neighbor. Jud Crandall, who gets the best line in the story summarizes it all: "Sometimes death is better." <br /> <br /> The only problem with the movie version is the cast of Louis's son, Gage (Miko Hughes). Knowing that it would be impossible to be able to get the kind of display needed from a child who had to seal the deal, Lambert and crew still did the best they could. Unfortunately, Hughes was just too damn CUTE to "sell" his intended role as an evil, demon-possessed zombie. It takes you out of the movie when he performs, although the scenes where he appeared are still masterfully performed, especially Gwynne's death scene. <br /> <br /> Unlike that, everything is just as good as it gets. CARRIE still holds the title for the best King adaptation as far as I am concerned; but SEMATAR is right there in the Top Five. <br /> <br /> Still, anything adapted to the screen based on a King book will be so frightening than reading the story? Not BLOODY probably ... for now.
