All right, I'm a fan of the Nightmare series and everybody says it's the worst! But it's not !!! Didn't you see Freddy's revenge ??? WTF! It was the worst of all !!! Now this movie is pretty decent and it keeps up with the Freddy story and it's cool that he is a daughter, etc. Had it. <br /> <br /> Then I found out it was in 3-D !!! I was so excited, I remember seeing it on the DVD set, I immediately skipped the 3-D rows. Quite a lot was in 3-D, but like Lisa Zanes' hand, Dream Demons, Freddy's Claw (more than once), Lezlie Dean holding a knife, Lisa Zane with a Baseball bat, Doc's hand, Freddy's head explodes . <br /> <br /> I really loved this movie because it was in 3-D, but I wish the whole movie was in 3-D not just the last 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> By the Way, it's NOT 15 minutes NOT TEN !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
