I accidentally caught this movie on the cable in the middle of it and had to rent it to see it completely and I'm glad I did. I was immediately drawn through the storyline and cared for the girls involved. Naive high school graduates, best friends since childhood, travel high school and are welcomed by a man named Nick who gets them into serious trouble. They are used as sacrificial bulls in a heroin smuggling ring. Being arrested, the girls learn to handle their incarceration while trying to get away from their trouble. Everything they try to help themselves fall short when the Thai crime system shows flaws and the girls end up in more trouble and lose the confidence of their American lawyer, "Yankee Hank". Hank ceases to defend them after being betrayed by Alice (Claire Dane). However, Hank's Thai native wife smells of the case and does some footwork of investigation and finding out the girls are really victims. The end of the movie when Alice does an unselfish act to save Darlene (Beckinsale) has tears me. I really enjoyed this movie and would recommend it.
