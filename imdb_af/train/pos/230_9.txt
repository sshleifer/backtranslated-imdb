When I first saw this movie on the cable, it immediately became one of my favorite movies. I'm a big fan of James Earl Jones and Robert Duvall. The film shows an accurate picture of the South and racist attitudes. Most of the attitudes came from Soll, an old plantation owner who used convictions for labor. Soll is what makes the move, his funny ramblings give us insights into the way South Africa was then. I think if Soll lived today, he would be diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Nevertheless, his attitude towards a little boy working for him and the prisoners is complex. Having racist opinions, he grew to trust some of the suspects who were all black. The two most trusted suspects are Jackson (Mel Winkler) and Ben (James Earl Jones). The talks between Ben and Soll are the best in the movie, they have real chemistry. James Earl Jones and Mel Winkler both, but in great performances as well as Hass. <br /> <br /> This movie had to get more familiar. However, it is on DVD and worth the money. <br /> <br /> Rayvyn
