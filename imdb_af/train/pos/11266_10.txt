I recently watched it, but when it started, I had no idea what the concept was, which the subject was brief - I didn't know what it was. Was it a documentary, it was a comedy routine ..... Well, it was both. <br /> <br /> It started a bit slow, but I think it's because I had absolutely no idea what kind of program I was watching. But it sucked me in quickly. In the episode I watched, Robert Wuhl discussed fact and fiction in history. Mainly how we (Americans) learn history that is not really true - and how we learn what we did. He did it so that the viewer was completely entertained and interested. I actually learned a few things and this is a true indication of how effective this type of program can be. <br /> <br /> I'd love to see it as a series for HBO. I believe it can be just as fun and effective with a variety of topics - especially when taught in the same way as this episode.
