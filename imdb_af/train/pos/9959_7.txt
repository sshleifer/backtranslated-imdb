Well, if you are open enough to love Barber Shop, then you will love this Canadian movie. <br /> <br /> If your mind is as locked as Fort Knox, you will give it the current score it has: 2.5. <br /> <br /> It's a movie for anyone willing to watch movies from outside their own races. It's tempting, it's vital, with two or three times you lose the connection between the screens, but many times, especially at the end, you find yourself a tear or two in your eyes because it is so often mirrors that life can be. <br /> <br /> I like it and recommend it to anyone who is open-minded outside the traditional American movie.
