I am biased against any movie that paints a sumptuous picture of Italy - I think is the most romantic country in the world. Unfortunately, the movie was pretty short, unusually so for a period, and a bit sparse on the movie. However, the excellent story makes it good. The four ladies start with a much needed relaxing holiday with problems on their minds. In the course of the film they realize their problems and begin to fix them. They believe San Salvatore, the castle in which they live, has an enchanting effect on people. "It's a bath of love," says Lottie Wilkins. You can see their gradual change from disgruntled to exuberant, as the Italian sea works its magic on them. <br /> <br /> All their problems and solutions are plausible. The actresses were wonderful. The background music was very suitable for a romantic Italian country. All in all, a 10/10 movie for me.
