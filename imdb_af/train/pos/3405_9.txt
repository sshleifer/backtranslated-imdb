"The Garden of Allah" was one of the first feature lengths, 3-strip Technicolor films. To fix a previous poster, the first Technicolor feature (after Disney's exclusive 5-year deal) was 1935's Becky Sharp, which was a costume drama that used the color for its colorful costumes. <br /> <br /> "The Garden of Allah" seems to be shot years later, as cinematography not only uses color, but also the use of shadows. It had to be great for an audience to see a color zone at the time after basically just seeing black and white movies for their entire lives. Unfortunately, the film is not on the movies. That said, the movie is worth seeing just like a visual treat.
