Steven Spielberg, 24, has already directed two fantastic episodes of a 1971 series called "The Psychiatrist", starring Roy Thinnes. One episode was about an emotionally troubled 12-year-old boy and the other was about a live young man (Clu Gulager in his best performance) who died of cancer. Both episodes were stunning, visually different from anything else on television, and emotionally complex and mature. The creators of "The Psychiatrist" were Richard Levinson and William Link, who created "Columbo" and also created his first season. <br /> <br /> Peter Falk insisted on the first rank, experienced TV directors for the first season of "Columbo", such as Bernard Kowalski and Jack Smight. But Falk agreed to Spielberg after seeing part of the Clu Gulagher episode of "The Psychiatrist". <br /> <br /> Spielberg says on the DVD of "Duel" that he is from Steven Bochco's "Murder by the Book" on a Levinson / Link story), and he tried to make the production look like a million dollar feature, even thinking he has much less money to work with. <br /> <br /> This episode of Columbo is far more visually stylish and makes better use of the soundtrack and background music than almost any other "Columbo" section, although the series is always used by top directors. Spielberg controls the big Falk and Cassidy to keep it too much, but both actors are still a lot of fun. Spielberg also gets good support from Martin Milner, Rosemary Forsyth and Barbara Colby. All the performances have freshness and vitality over them. The only "Columbo" section close to being so well-targeted is the episode "By Dawn's Early Light" with Patrick McGoohan (directed by Harvey Hart). <br /> <br /> I think the two episodes of "The Psychiatrist" and this episode of "Columbo" suggest that Spielberg did not develop as technically technical as a director. He was great from the beginning. In a "Combat!" DVD comment from a 1962 episode guest with Albert Salmi, Robert Altman says the episode was pretty much as good as he ever was as director. Maybe it's true for Spielberg.
