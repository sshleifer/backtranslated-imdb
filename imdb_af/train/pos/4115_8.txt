This is one of the weirder movies I watched recently. This is because it looks less like a movie and more like an experimental movie. Kurasawa's experiment was to use a variety of individuals living in a rubbish bin and intertwine their experiences in a tapestry, which gives an overview of their generally difficult existence. Not every episode is depressed and hard, but overall it's definitely the tone. Let's see ... we have a case of incest / rape, attempted murder, women's change, alcoholism, infidelity, killing a little boy after eating infected fish, a man with severe depression (he never speaks during the movie and looks very frightening), a hopeless dreamer probably diagnosed with schizophrenia, a mentally handicapped young man who thinks he is a street car conductor and spends all his waking moments around his street car through roads under the dump to manage. A man is married to a total number (I think I have her character even less than the turbulent rapist!), etc., etc. had. It's actually depressed enough that it almost looks like an Ingmar Bergman movie in Japan. Bergman has made many films that tend to deal with mental illness and the hopelessness of life. Is it a wonder that Kurasawa tried to kill the movie? So, did I enjoy it? No. It was not a fun experience. But it was a very well-made film that kept my attention, and so I really wanted to see what happened to these people. It was kind of a train wreck to watch - you don't want to see all the bloodbath, but you can't help but watch! Of all the vignettes, I think the older man who was inclined to look out for everyone and who didn't really fit in (he was too well-adapted and pointed to living in a rubbish bin) might represent Kurasawa himself. Can be. I do not know. <br /> <br /> If you've seen a variety of Kurasawa movies and have high tolerance for foreign art films, give this one a watch. But don't make it your first experience to watch his movies - it's sure to scare away many viewers!
