Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais have a solid hit for their TV work. But their movie work is much more checkered (2008's The Bank Job was good, for example, the previous year's Over the Universe, definitely weak). <br /> <br /> Still, fortunately, is a great success. It has a wonderful story, excellent performances, lots of humor, fantastic music and, above all, the true heart. <br /> <br /> I enjoy "moments" and this movie has one of them - just when everything goes pear-shaped at the festival reunion performance ... <br /> <br /> Very nice.
