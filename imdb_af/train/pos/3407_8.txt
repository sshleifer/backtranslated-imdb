Marlene Dietrich and Charles Boyer give solid performances in this beautiful but empty movie. The irony is that Dietrich plays a woman with a beautiful but empty life. Really beautiful cinematography and sets, and yes Dietrich's bottomless skirt of clothing is also fantastic. She looks good; Boyer looks young and trim. <br /> <br /> The story of a woman seeking meaning and a pastor looking for life seems pretty obsolete, but against such unreal sets and odors it somehow works, given the two stars, the great score by Max Steiner, and a good supporting role. The movie runs like 76 minutes and looks badly modified, and some characters appear or disappear. <br /> <br /> Joseph Schildkraut is funny as Arabic guide, C. Aubrey Smith is the old priest, Lucile Watson, the mother superior. , Tilly Losch the dancer, John Carradine the Diviner, and Basil Rathbone play .... Well, I'm not sure. He just drove off the desert and spoiled everything! Like others noticed, John Gilbert with Dietrich was staring. I can't help but think he would have been wonderful. The role of world-weary Boris would have adjusted the big Gilbert well. And after the success of Queen Christina (with Garbo), his career could again be on track. <br /> <br /> I can't think of any other 30-year-old movie that Dietrich had in color. She looks good and wears some great clothes. My favorite is the Valentino as the Shiek-like outfit she wears at the pool. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth having a look at the lush sets and color and the two big stars.
