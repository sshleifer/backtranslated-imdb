I always said the animated Batman movies were much better than the live action movies. <br /> <br /> I've seen all the animation movies, but from the crowd it's the poorest, and that's quite disappointing. . <br /> <br /> "Phantasm Mask" will be considered the best, then "World's Finest", then "Sub Zero", then "Return of the Joker", and finally, these ranks. <br /> <br /> In this latest animated movie there is a mysterious new batgirl in Gotham and Batman is planning to discover if his friend or enemy is looking for revenge. <br /> <br /> But as Bruce gets involved in three young women. He begins to investigate and discover who the new batgirl is. <br /> <br /> The tone in this movie is exceptionally light as most of the movies are dark and dark. It was quite disappointing. Bruce works strangely with character, the villains are reusing the last movies, and while the action is exciting, it's really nothing new. It also has the dramatic impact the other films have, especially those of "Sub-Zero", which was heavy in drama and character development. <br /> <br /> Everything in the movie feels reasonably recyclable and the supporting characters are charming but nobody is really worth it to root. <br /> <br /> All the time I really enjoyed it, I had an explosion, and the new batgirl's identity is surprising, but it wasn't as exciting as I hope. <br /> <br /> (** half out of ****)
