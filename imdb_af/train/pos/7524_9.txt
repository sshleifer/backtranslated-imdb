For a movie that is apparently about sex and learning, it doesn't have the right to be as strange as it is. The story of Bettie Page, a good Christian girl from the South, whose mother does not want to date her until she is married, who moved to New York and eventually became the most successful of her age, is driven by an excellent performance. by Gretchen Moll. Her page can't fix the photos she takes (no one can touch, it's fun and respectful) with the porno trials and bad effects her images have on the world around her. <br /> <br /> Page is an inspiration for every burlesque artist since, not only because she had a figure to die for, but because she has invested every photo with an innocent sense of fun on the same time was unique and simple. Actually like this movie. Filmed in both black and white and glorious technicolor, it's a great way to spend a few hours.
