It's not the worst movie ever made, the actors aren't apostate and the script and director are not completely unknown. <br /> <br /> It's not the best movie ever made, the actors aren't great and the writing and director aren't quite brilliant. <br /> <br /> It's somewhere in the middle. A pleasure somewhere. An enjoyable, well built somewhere. <br /> <br /> No need to say "don't take it seriously" or "it's so bad" or "it's not terrible". None of these comments are relevant. <br /> <br /> Cut the atmosphere. It's the atmosphere that is really unique, and the one truly original aspect of the movie, which is the personal that makes the movie, to me.
