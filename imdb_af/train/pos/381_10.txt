I didn't give this movie 10 because it's a wonderfully consistent movie, but it's pure ability to stir emotions in his audience. The story of one-woman-fighting-all-odds is now an old clich√©, but very few movies have worn it with so much warmth and sincerity as The Color Purple. <br /> <br /> It has also pointed out another aspect of African American experience. It showed freedom to slaves acquitted, many fell in the ways of the hated 'white man' and abused their own people. I think this is an important point, as it is against the depiction-white-on-black violence-and-win-an-Oscar trend. <br /> <br /> Also, the acting appearances are wonderful - especially oprah who I now have a new found respect for. <br /> <br /> Well worth watching - but keep a little tissue handy.
