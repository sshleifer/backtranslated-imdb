For a low budget project, the film was a success. The story is interesting, and the actors were convincing. Eva Longoria, now on the TV show "Dragnet" stars, is more sexy than ever. The venues were ideal for the ganster plot, and the director shows his talent by taking on many roles for his project. Of course, this low budget film can use better transitions and more special effects for the antler, but the music keeps this writing moving. Although this film has its share of problems, such as continuity, I have to say I will hire the director's next movie. If you are a film student, you can learn a few things from the director's comments.
