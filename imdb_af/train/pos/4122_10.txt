I would like to see a resurrection of an updated Seahunt series with the technology they have today that will bring the child's excitement into me. I grew up on black and white TV and Seahunt with Gunsmoke was my hero every week. You have my voice for a return of a new sea hunt. We need a change in the pace in TV and it will work for a world of underwater adventure. Immediately thank you for an outlet like this to many views on TV and the many movies.So anyway I believe I have what I want to say. It would be nice to read even more pluses about sea hunting. If my rhymes are 10 lines, you will let me in or leave me out to be in doubt and stop me. If so, I have to do it.
