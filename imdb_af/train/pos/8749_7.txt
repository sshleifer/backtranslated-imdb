I loved the movie, but as everyone said, there was little that wasn't developed enough. I personally thought the girls were very vapid before landing in prison; Sure, they were supposed to be innocent American girls, but still ... I felt they didn't need the band that was best friends. For example, in the montage where they were watching, the way they kept each other for the photo was very uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> There are then some parts that are very ambiguous. I think it's well understood that Danes's character didn't do it, but I can see how it can be confusing. Also, why did the camera carry Manat, which carries a very grim look after putting the bags in their cab? I thought it suggested something, but it seems to be nothing. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, the movie was great. I cried when Claire Danes was blamed; she is a GREAT actress. <br /> <br /> Also, I wanted to see the bitchy Thai prisoner kicking her ass. Talk about lack of closure ...
