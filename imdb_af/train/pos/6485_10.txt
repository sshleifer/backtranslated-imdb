The world in war is one of the best documentaries on World War II. <br /> <br /> The 24 episodes cover the war and how it was in the countries concerned. The first episode tells us how Hitler came to power and how he could build one of the strongest armies in the world. They also fall on the military actions taken during the war and the Holocaust. One of the strongest and best documentaries ever made. Everyone should look at it. Perfection! 10/10 <br /> <br />
