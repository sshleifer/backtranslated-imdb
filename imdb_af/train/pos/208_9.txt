The Sunshine Boys is a terrific comedy about two ex-vaudevillians who are reluctant to merge for a TV specialist despite the fact that they despise each other. <br /> <br /> The comic genius of two masters at work, George Burns and Walter Matthau are stars! Some of the best scenes are when the duo is fighting the worst little, trivial thing! The material is fast and witty, attractive to all ages. <br /> <br /> MILD SPOILER ALERT: There are a few sad moments after the end of the movie that indirectly deals with the influence of aging that the film gives. A gentle, sincere, tenderness that shows this reviewer what the few really need most for success is one another. <br /> <br /> If you like The Odd Couple, you will worship this movie. An excellent movie!
