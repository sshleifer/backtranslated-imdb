This movie is one of those nostalgic things with me and I never really expect anyone else to get it, but is happy when I recommend it and someone enjoys it. My past father hung Arthur Askey, but this film was one he really enjoyed and his consistent enthusiasm for "The Ghost Train" and "Old Ted 'Olmes" conveyed me as a child. Years later I watch it now and then, enjoy the familiarity. I always wonder if this would not be the same, but I was never disappointed. There is plenty to enjoy. The order on the train is really inspired when Askey and Murdoch continue to irritate the arrogant male passenger. Then the whole section in the station is incredible with so much that you need to keep up with. Yes, it is dated and full of British war in accent and plot (based on the original play by Arnold Ridley of Dad's Defense Force!) But full of wonderful character achievements - including Kathleen Harrison as a dotty spider. The atmosphere is really as close to being as an Arthur Askey vehicle can get. It's cheap like chips in the UK on DVD, so treat yourself. It's a perfect Saturday / Sunday morning or any afternoon lazy afternoon light entertainment. Thank you .... <br /> <br /> OUR FILES can be great movies!
