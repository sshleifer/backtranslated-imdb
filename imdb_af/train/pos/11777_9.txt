"Jared Diamond made a point in the first episode that other people in the world did not have animals to house, but Europeans did so and that explains why we could make steel and find complex machines." --- It is clear that the person who wrote this comment did not understand the reasoning behind this documentary or original book. Please don't ruin this big piece by your simple mindset. The reasons are much more complex than the one thing you mentioned. Please read the book if it is a good source of information. I enjoyed it a lot. This book was even presented as a textbook at some universities.
