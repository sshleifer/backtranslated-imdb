"Johnny Dangerously" is a kind of hit-and-come comedy that laughs and "huh?" But I suggest giving it a chance. I think it looked very far. Not too many people give this movie a chance. It doesn't work. Just think of it as a small parody of "Goodfellas". Michael Keaton is very funny in his role. And he does it well. Johnny Dangerously is a gangster who wants to go higher in life. He only works his way from the big boss to a beautiful woman. And of course, like a lot of mob movies, somebody wants to kill him. 90% of jokes get a laugh. As I said, giving it a chance. Just take your favortion gangster movies and mix in a comedy. You've got 'Johnny Dangerous'. <br /> <br /> 7/10
