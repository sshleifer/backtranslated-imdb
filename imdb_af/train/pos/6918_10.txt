A very enjoyable film that contains characters who do bad things and who make emotions such as anger feel and a desire for revenge bubble. The cast is very good, there is a lot of action, and Stewart gets the girl and his revenge (with a twist) in the end. I've seen this movie several times, and always watch it on AMC or cable. Highly recommended ...
