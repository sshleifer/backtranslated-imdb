I'm a big fan of the movie, but not for the usual reasons. I think Travolta and Winger were at higher than average rates. I think the sets were representative of the location and the era, I kept the soundtrack and the Charlie Daniels Band. However, I think photography was incredible! Since the domestic scenes were filmed in the real club and had Gilley's low ceilings - maybe 10-12 feet high and the smoke supposed to simulate a "smoke-filled bar" hung 2-4 feet below the ceiling. The camera managed to get shots through the smoke and focused on the actors, the bull, the bar, the women, the dance, the low level of light that was actually in the bar! What a performance! Certainly, there were help lights, but to maintain the atmosphere of the bar, it had to be low light shots. Ray Villalobos (the camera operator) was excellent! He had a few shots he had no hope of achieving and the impact of them brought a sense of reality to the film. Thanks, Ray - Great work!
