Norman, are you? was (it is already the third hand, so take it with a salt pellet) adapted to an African American family of a Jewish one, when it transferred the stage and screen transition. Also, it was one of those movies originally filmed in video, so the theatrical prints could not have been so good. Still, performances by Redd Foxx and others were pretty good. <br /> <br /> What I wanted to tell you is that the movie is a PERIOD PEACE: it reflects the mid-early 70's attitudes to finding you a gay boy or daughter in you have family. For that reason alone, it's pretty interesting - if not a small "hollywood". Don't believe me? Look at lines over curtains, etc. Very stereotypical. Not too deep. <br /> <br /> But ... the movie really shines in some areas. There is a side-splitting scene when Redd Foxx tries to find his wife, running with Ensenada in a seasoned Pinto with his brother (!). The phone call across the border is really memorable. <br /> <br /> But ... the best scene in the movie is when Wayland Flowers and Madame did their gay routine in gay bars and night clubs. To my best knowledge this is the only time the routine has been filmed. And it's a slightly cleaned and much shorter version, I'm told. Yet it is cute Mrs, and should not be missed. People still steal Wayland lines; The man was really gifted. Enjoy the movie!
