I remember this movie. Very intense for an 11 year old. Good editing, I love the St. Bernard felt. I will see it again when it gets resuscitated, but the signal past Pluto if I write it. Robert Culp. A highlight of his career. I'm just glad I didn't live in that area. O the 70's. What a decade. If they made it again, it would be very violent and bloody. So what are they waiting for? An excellent movie for pre-pubescent suburban boys. It was very intense. I think it was filmed in Los Angeles. Certainly not made in Lodi NJ. The shot with the St Bernard was the best and of course the most haunting image of the film ... and then they left the carcass on the stoop. Rotten children.
