If TV were a baseball league, this show would have a perfect record! With an excellent movie, and a perfect plot, this show had 8 wonderful seasons and a great joy to watch TV. With the constant change of relationships and finding out who Hyde's real father is, this show was a hit when it started in August 98, although it was introduced in 1976. And in Foremans basement was always the thing to do back, and it's still today, with circles. This show was a great premiere, and it still does during re-runs. If you watch a few episodes of this show, you'll find everything and want more. Now it's just one of the best ever created, it's smart and funny.
