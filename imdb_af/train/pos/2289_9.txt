I'm a little pedestrian, with somewhat low tastes. However, I occasionally try to educate the pub for my cultural awareness. This movie was one of my efforts. I was in awe of the whole movie. I loved it so much that I got my own band so I could see it again. It is a very thoughtful and emotionally striking movie. I saw it as a big question to the viewer: What is the depth of sacrifice on service that one can accept, can be asked to accept, must accept? Of course, as a military member, this is an important question for me. This question weighs heavily on the viewer of this movie. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
