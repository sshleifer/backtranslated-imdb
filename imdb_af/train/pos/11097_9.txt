Spoilers! <br /> <br /> From the moment I saw a local film critic, this movie in a review searched for the 10:00 news, I wanted to see it. I don't remember who it was, or what local Omaha newsletter did, but the critic was very urgent that this movie was just too thin for the average Nebraska church. They showed a piece out of the scene where John Glover Ann-Margret was kidnapped when swimming in the pool. Glover's character tells her how beautiful her body is, and so on. Use many words that the local station needs to point out. I was addicted. However, there was one problem. At that time I was only 13 years old and I had to wait a year for it to come out on the cable. Let's just say it was worth the wait! <br /> <br /> If there was ever a guilty pleasure from me, this movie is it. Calling this movie will be a great understatement. The film centers on a successful businessman who, after three, is fired with a young woman with three small children fired. Roy Scheider, who is as effective as ever, plays the poor guy who just wanted a little fling and now finds himself at the mercy of three awesome villains. John Glover's character is one of the most memorable scumbags of all time. He is sometimes sleepy, funny and always on the verge of doing something crazy. Then there is Robert Trebor's (nice name, by the way!) Character Leo that is clearly in his head with this extortion scheme. He is a whistling, sweaty, coward who performs a hustle and bustle of lively nude models. Then you have Clarence Williams III as Bobby Shy, a breeding sociopath where everyone is scared of good reason. Who can forget the wake-up call he gives with the giant teddy bear? <br /> <br /> After realizing the initial shock to which he resisted, Scheider turned the tables on these creeps and took control of the situation, that is until Glover went to his wife! The conflict is cruelly played, with virtually the entire role being shot, raped or inflated. <br /> <br /> I don't know why I love this movie so much. It really has to crawl me, but it doesn't. Perhaps this is because these characters are all interesting, and the story requires many chances that most movies will never try. It is frightening to think that the adult movie industry is likely to have more than a few characters, such as Glover's running around in L.A., which is struggling. Just thinking of his voice is enough to make me. "Hey sport, enjoy a nice day!" <br /> <br /> This movie has many shooting ranges, cool cars, good dialogue (like the line in my opening statement) and decent acting. Many cameos by real porn stars. Watch Ron Jeremy turn around in a warm bath with two chicks in a partytone at Glover's place. <br /> <br /> Another thing I should add: How hot are the women in this movie ??? Wow! Travolta did justice by marrying Kelly Preston. Yum! We also see that Vanity gets naked at a time before she became a born again Christian. An Ann-Margret. What else can you say about her except that she is the actual American beauty. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> So says the dog. <br /> <br /> Added February 14, 2008: RIP Roy Scheider!
