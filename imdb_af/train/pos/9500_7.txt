I watched this movie on television and fascinated by the beauty of Jennifer McComb. It was a neat movie and you can see it for the beauty of Africa and of course Mccomb. At that time I was excited to watch this movie and from then on I tried for VCD of this movie, but I can't find it. Great African lions look in his movie and we will limit spelling just by the size of those animals and grace from them. All part of the audience can see this movie, especially children will enjoy this movie. But some scenes involving Mccomb force parenting for this movie. It's a nice holiday movie for everyone.
