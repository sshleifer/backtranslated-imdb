The running man is often dismissed as just another Arnie action thriller full of explosions, bad words and rifle, and to be fair there are many of them. People watched and compared it to the Terminator series, saying it was one of the poorer Schwarzenegger movies. <br /> <br /> But give it 18 years and find yourself able to appreciate it in a different light. Rather than just being another brainless action movie, it works very well as a parody of reality TV. This is quite different from the Stephen King book, but I doubt whether Hollywood, with its love for optimistic ends and so-called "ordinary guys" who have the skills of a trained commando, would have accepted in its current form. <br /> <br /> But with the review. <br /> <br /> Ben Richards (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a policeman who works in a dystopian United States where democracy is a thing of the past, and the whole country is controlled by a merger of government / media conglomerate. The economy is busy, food is scarce and the state keeps people distracted by the production of sadistic games for them to watch, like Spring for Dollars, where people for money jump over a pit of racial dogs and the most popular is The Running Man, a game show presented by slimy Damian Killian (played by entertaining Richard Dawson) where supposed 'criminals' are being hunted by astonishing pro-wresting quizzes. However, some try and speak against the government. When a group of hungry people hold a protest in the city of Bakersfield, California, a helicopter run by Richards is sent to calm the protest. When Richards refuses to fire on innocent people, he is arrested and framed for killing the people in the crowd. He is being sentenced to a slave labor camp, but escaping with a resistance leader (Yaphet Kotto) and going on. <br /> <br /> But his freedom does not last long and after he kidnapped network employee Amber Mendez (Marita Conchita Alonso) in an attempt to escape those who pursued him, he finds himself again imprisoned, but This time he is forced to appear at The Running Man. <br /> <br /> And of course, there, the whole movie kicks off in the standard Arnie. Richards is launched in the post-apocalyptic desert of Los Angeles (why is LA always destroyed in these dystopian worlds?) And forced to run out of the stalkers, along with two other prisoners escaping with him from the labor camp. Amber is also curious about Richards' protest of innocence, and discovers he is framed. Guess what happens to her then? So, like Amber, Richards and the two other guys running to try to avoid the stalkers, we soon become aware that Richards is no ordinary policeman. He is Super Arnie, the unmanageable one-man army who can collapse evil corporate dictatorships and stamp out obese men who are covered in Christmas while they are just your average American man with an Austrian accent. <br /> <br /> Yes, the rest of the movie becomes stupid, hard, classic 80's Arnie fun. There is a lot of exciting controversy, the brand horrible words ("He had to divide" be my favorite), and the general formal final confrontation and happy ending. It's great fun to respond to Killian in the typical 'healthy' game show host, and some of the funniest moments in the show revolve around the contrast between his interaction with the crowd as the seemingly benevolent host (watch out for the cursed guy) lady!) and the cold, cynical man, he is in fact doing everything to increase ratings. <br /> <br /> If you're expecting a high-brow, intelligent movie, you'll be disappointed. But if you want a good 80's flick, well, that's it. But the wonderful thing about this movie is that it was rather prophetic. <br /> <br /> Looking at the entertainment we have today, you noticed how reality TV is going nowadays - showing people who are willing to put themselves through anything for five minutes of fame, and producers are prepared to make them humiliate on television. It is not too far to imagine that a scary TV excerpt out there trying to show that people are live on TV. However, we've had it with the ghoulish al-Qaida hostage swap videos posted on the internet. It seems like in the current climate at least some people are perfect to watch the real death on their television sets. <br /> <br /> Bearing this in mind, along with the fact that everything today seems like a revival of the 80's, you should be impressed by the prospect of this movie. Of course, we did not reach, because they are terrorists, rather than the mainstream media, which we have easily got available programs with real human death, but just wonder how long it is before some people decide to see if he can. find a way to cast a show that combines people's desire for entertainment and their desire to welcome their morbid curiosity ...
