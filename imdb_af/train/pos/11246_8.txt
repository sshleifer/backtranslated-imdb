Breaking Glass is a film that everyone wants to be aspiring to in the music industry, should see more than once. It's a very dark story about how a recordmate manipulates a singer to do things and make so much money out of her. Check out some of today's search for a star-style TV show in both the UK and abroad. I'm always reminded of this movie. Although not an expert on the subject, the winners of this show tend to have one very big initial hit and then the downhill from there. This movie runs these shows although the effect looks the same. After getting rid of her manager, Phil Daniels played quite brilliantly, but the record company changed her lyrics. Her lyrics put her on stimulants and she eventually burned out completely. Your potential tomorrow stars .... STAY AND SAVE !!!
