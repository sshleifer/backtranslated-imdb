Laputa: Castle in the sky is the bomb. The message is as strong as its newer works and more pure, fantastic and flying pirates, how can it be better! The art is quite awesome and the soundtrack, which is repeatedly reused, is not sure if it was the first time I heard it. This makes me the most emotional sentimental response of any movie soundtrack. Sheeta, the female lead in this movie is absolutely fantastic and the boy, Pazu, is also a great role model - he lives on his own! The plot is classic Miyazaki. I won't give it away, but the end is really great. I rank it as one of Miyazaki's three bests with Nausicaa and Spirited Away. You can also check out Howl's Moving Castle when it comes out (I hope next year). If you like Miyazaki, make sure this one is as easily available in the US. Enjoy, Piper A
