This music is definitely mixed, and none of the elements really fit together, but somehow it manages to enjoy it. The plot contains the elements of Wodehouse's novel, but none of his virtues, although he wrote the script. The songs, although charming, have nothing to do with this particular movie, and are unusually rudely pressed into the plot, even according to pre-Oklahoma standards. Burns and Allen do their usual shtick reasonably well, but it misses the tone of the rest of the movie with about forty IQ points. <br /> <br /> There are some highs. Reginald Gardiner does good work when he remembers that it is a talkie, and stops like a silent actor. And there are a few pieces of writing that could only be written by Wodehouse, although most of the movies feel like the production of one of the Hollywood events he later parodied.
