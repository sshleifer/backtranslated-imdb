If you like Roman Polanski's "Repulsion", be sure to watch the "The Tenant" as it is a similar concept, only with Polanski entering the schizophrenic wacko. It's actually one of my favorites of his movies. Secondly, after "Rosemary's Baby", of course, is a straightforward journey to the spiritual collapse of a man moving into the former apartment of a suicide victim. The other residents of the building are all fluttering and stokers to keep the noise level. Even the slightest "titter" becomes a big problem, and Polanski, who becomes a star, is becoming more and more paranoid and gives his rewarding hallucinations further and further, as the film carries. on. It gets to the point where he is dressed and acts like the former tenant and you realize it's only a matter of time before he decides to leave her fatal jump from the window. The movie is a bit slow and dawdling for a while, but if you've ever seen a Roman Polanski movie, know that it will end with a bang and it won't disappoint. It is also best if you do not question the complexities of the premise and only take it as a descent into madness, as it is sometimes poorly surrealistic. Polanski is very good like the crooked, upset resident who somehow attracts Isabelle Adjani's everlasting appeal. We also get to see him walking in tow, which at the same time is disturbing and hilarious! Damn, he's making one ugly chick! So, Polanski fans - who can actually watch his thirty-year-old pedophile charges - have to enjoy "The Tenant" as an entertaining psychological tour ...
