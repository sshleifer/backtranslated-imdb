First of all, it's really my favorite movie ever. I don't have to give anyone a description, because every one of them has this. I was literally obsessed with these virtually bloodless, cheesy effects with a 'tree trunk', poorly edited, the 80-year-old metal-grit masterpiece. The director (I heard) hoped for a hit at the box office so that he could pursue prosecutors and could have a FREDDY / JASON type transaction for himself. Damn, I wish it could have been so! The soundtrack's slap. The play is good .... CHECK THIS MOFO OUT. and any the hard fans out there, feel free to email and chat anywhere. Midgetorgie .... I can be found at YAHOO.
