Follow-up to "The Kingdom" is more bloody and even more twisted. I only saw half (I was exhausted and couldn't sit through 5 1/2 hours), but I loved what I saw. Ghost, blood, murder, poisoning, mutated babies, voodoo ... it has everything! If you have a strong stomach and like strange movies, it's for you. <br /> <br /> Also, you don't need to see Part 1 to understand it ... you'll find out! <Br /> <br /> Does anyone know whether Kingdom 1 and 2 are available on DVD? Sitting through these marathon movies in a theater is tempting. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there will probably not be a Kingdom 3. Ernst-Hugo Jaregard (Sig) died a year after filming. But you never know!
