I really like this movie. I saw several Gene Kelly flicks and that's one of his best. I would actually place it above his more famous American in Paris. Sometimes it seems that the story is lost in Gene Kelly movies after the wonderful dance and songs, but not in this movie. It is definitely worth the rent.
