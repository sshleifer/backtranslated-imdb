But the opposite, sorry, I completely understand how you can be dragged into a movie because you are related to the subject (and you have). This movie is horrible, the main character will give any charlie brown subtitle a run for his money. He just bumps, which is always a laugh. Most scenes just feel uncomfortable with characters more than not looking at another. .Now your line now, I'll respond. Best British Comedy? Please friend, have a strong word with your bad bad self ... at the end of the day ... the sun goes down ... and this movie is terrible. I mean well with the people involved ... they made a movie ... and maybe motorcycle lovers can be there, but people who still live here on earth with a real sense of humor will struggle to smile at that the Christmas gift they were after they bought ... was it too hard? I apologize ...
