British comedies tend to fall into one of two main types: the quiet, introspective, usually romantic study and the passing social satire. Scenarios, characters, and concepts vary, but some features place the vast majority of performances in one of the two categories. Butterflies may be the epitome of the first type. <br /> <br /> The scripts are very oral, including long inner monologues by the main character Ria, a basically happy but undisputed housewife, who is curious about what she might have missed when she tackled a thorough conventional life . When she meets a successful but clumsy and emotionally accessible businessman (who makes his interest clear to her), she plays toys with the idea of ​​finding out what the other way might be. <br /> <br /> The acting and scripts are always on the money, which makes your reaction to the show almost completely personal: I have not been blown away or turned off either. My mother, on the other hand, worshiped this show. I think the extent to which one identifies with Ria's dilemma is the most important factor in determining your response to butterflies.
