This documentary has been broadcast on both RTE and BBC over the past few months. Having seen it twice, I would recommend it to anyone interested in media and documentary filmmaking. Initially, this documentary was intended to describe the political life of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. The Irish crew set aside these intentions. What happens when they arrive at Venezuela is scary as they see first hand, the attempt to be overthrown by rebel factions (especially the oil problems in Venezuela) by Chavez and his government. What we are witnessing to the audience is just how the media manipulates the situation and in effect supports the overthrow of Chavez by distorting the events that protrude as the coup increases. <br /> <br /> It's really a great documentary and a remarkable piece of work by some beginner filmmakers. <br /> <br />
