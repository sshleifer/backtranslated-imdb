Once when I was at university and had an international scholarship, the Russian section said a Soviet-era poster, "Ne boltay!", Which means "Don't gossip!" I "translated" it for "generation" of TV viewers as "Gladys Kravitz!" (referring to the nosy neighbor on "Bewitched"). <br /> <br /> But when you see the result of gossip in the Pvt. Snafu short "Rumors", you see it is not quite a laugh. In this case, the constantly inexorable soldier hears about bombing and immediately assumes that the Ashes powers have attacked the United States. So he tells it to someone who tells someone else, who tells someone else, and it goes on. As in "the Russians come, the Russians come," the story gets more and more out of proportion each time, so when it comes back to Snafu. Well, you know what I mean! Yes, it is mostly World War II propaganda - completed with a deviant term for the Japanese - but I have to say that the Pvt. Snafu shorts were actually pretty funny. Of course, since they dr. Seuss writes and Mel Blanc gave the votes, it is not surprising that it was chosen. Worth to see.
