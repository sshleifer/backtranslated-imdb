This film is a great example of fine storytelling. The acting is wonderful. The story is inspiring without being manipulative or false. There were a few points where they probably made people a little more good or bad than they really were, but it was a Hollywood movie. They showed incredible restraint. There was not a single explosion in the movie, although they had one chance. The film, while having teams, was not made in action. The story is therefore focussed on an extraordinary man in unfortunate normal times. Well done!
