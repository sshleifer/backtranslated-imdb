If you've ever wondered why they don't make a plot with pornography, see Dream Quest. On the one hand, you must give the Armstrong credit, both for the effort to capitalize on this idea and for the use of such a strong adult cast to put the name force behind it. On the other hand, it soon becomes clear why most pornography never has more than 15 or 20 seconds of dialogue that links sex scenes. These people simply can't act (and the story is unfortunately a ridiculous one). <br /> <br /> However, I gave it a 7 because it was a nice try and there wasn't much of an effort to cut corners. Also, I'd like to see more efforts like this. Maybe I'll see the perfect combination of pornography and plot one day.
