A tranquil, sweet and beautiful nostalgic movie about how to confront your parents and parents with all the memories and problems and sorrows of the present with you. A movie that makes you feel. All the ingredients are here: old zeal, rivalry, friendship and loyalty. Accident, night-fridge attacks and all the other fun things we all remember from our summer camps. All the characters are given the opportunity for a week to experience it again, as the old camp leader retires and wants to meet the children of the golden years of the camp. Everyone is now in their thirties and in the middle of their careers.
