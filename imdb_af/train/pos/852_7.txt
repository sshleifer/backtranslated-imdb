THE MATADOR is a hit movie hit .... if you can say it on a hit movie. The violence is never really shown, but is often introduced. Initially I was afraid I was in for another trial of the mid-90's gangster-hit-man-hipster-dark comedy, but was fortunately surprised when I realized it was just a lovely and humorous story about friendship. Nothing terribly exciting happens in this movie, but every bit of it keeps me laughing. The three leaders have the best chemistry that has presented the big screen in the past year and it seems they have had a good time making this movie together. The writing is sharp, but sometimes it felt as if the writing of a stage play was adapted because of the one set of dialog boxes. It's a good movie I probably won't remember for too long, but then it was a perfect joy. Good movie.
