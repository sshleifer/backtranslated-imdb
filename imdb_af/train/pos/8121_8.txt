The masses are ignoring the message of a world on the brink of war. The mythical city of Everytown in 1940 represents England in general, but it can just as well stand for any nation of the world. When the war finally arrives, it remains for five years, but until 1966, after which Everytown is completely destroyed. At the destruction and toll on humanity is the "wandering disease", a pestilence lasting another four years. <br /> <br /> "Things to Come" balances both a fatalistic and futuristic worldview, where science holds a hope for a revived civilization. The concept "Wings Over the World" plays a little wreath, although this spokesman Cabal (Raymond Massey) is unwavering in his mission and dedicated to his cause. If he fails, others will follow. This message is continually enhanced by the film, which was convincingly brought to Massey's end of the film. Man's insatiable desire to test the boundaries of knowledge and performance requires a "whole universe or nothing" mindset. <br /> <br /> The film's image of automation and machinery in the second half recalls the big silent movie "Metropolis". As everytown rebuilt and transformed by the year 2036, the spectacle of the city's rebirth is a resonant accord, as modern-day architecture today suggests that the film's honest prophetic vision emerges. While the film is sixty-seven years wrong, the man's first mission to the moon is, but in 1936, a hundred-year-old roster was probably more legal than 1969. <br /> <br /> "Things to Come" is one of those rarities in film, a picture that makes you think. Which side will you come across, the forces for progress in the face of uncertainty or maintain the status quo? This is not a comfortable question as both choices offer inherent dangers and unknowable outcomes. Those who choose to be rivals are taken away by forces beyond their control.
