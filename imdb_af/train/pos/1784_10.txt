Evening is an entertaining movie with quite depth. All the actors and actresses turn into spectacular performances. With the tremendous role player, however, one expects star count, but in this movie the expectations are exceeded. One can be related to personalities and situations in their own family. As one looks at the interaction of family members, their own family memories are immediately remembered. This is one of the few movies that inspires one to read the book. Usually it is the other way around; one reads the book and then wants to see the movie. I will definitely get a copy of the Susan Minot book and read it. The Rhode Island scenery is spectacular, just like the soundtrack. Any car buffalo will enjoy the seemingly expertly restored period cars. Needless to say, but I highly recommend the evening. See it, you'll enjoy it.
