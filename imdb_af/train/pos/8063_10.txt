This incredible Oscar winner (4 in total) and John Ford's first Oscar winner is simply a terrifying score from Max Steiner. He called an art film, because Ford had very little money to make this great story of guilt and retribution, and greed and stupidity. But what makes this movie so classic is the direction and amazing photography and the use of dung and lighting. It was so different from the usual American film, and more in the tradition of German expressionism. And the Oscar winning performance by Victor McLaglen as the drunken Gypo is simply incredible. Basically, the film is in Ireland, and Gypo turns into a friend in the rebel movement after the English to raise 20 pounds to give to his girlfriend. But with all that money, he begins to squeeze it out all night and give it away, while the leaders of the movement are trying to find the informant. The whole movie is one night in a dark and misty Ireland, and a piece of characters that is unforgettable, but the whole world of Gypo includes both psychologically. If I had to choose three directors to have all their movies on a deserted island forever, and no one else, John Ford would definitely be one of them. What a real remarkable movie ...
