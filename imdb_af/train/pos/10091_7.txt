For the first time in about 30 years I watched "Elephant Step" and was hit by how similar the story line is to the much better "Rebecca". As others have said, you wiped the sweet young thing through the varied charm and touching gentleman of the manor, just to find her marriage threatened by the inevitable reminder of a larger but lifelong but deeply defective family member. You have climbed the back and disapproving servant, a crisis that binds the couple together or tear them apart irretrievably by the fiery destruction of the cute house. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, "Elephant Walk" is also guilty of some of its creepy jungle atmosphere after "The Letter," the Bette Davis love triangle placed on a Singapore rubber plantation, rather than a Sri Lankan tea plantation. . <br /> <br /> Maltin gives "Elephant Walk" only two stars, and IMDb Readers are not many kids, but I enjoyed it despite its predictability. Elizabeth Taylor never looked nicer, and Peter Finch does a credible job as the basically good man who cannot shake off the influence of his over-exaggerated father. Dana Andrews - a favorite in "Laura" and "The Best Year of Our Life" - is wasted as Elizabeth's frustrated admirer. The real star is the bungalow, one of the most beautiful interior sets in film history.
