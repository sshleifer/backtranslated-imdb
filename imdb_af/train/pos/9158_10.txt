Last night I finished the redesign of Jane Eyre (1983), the BBC mini-series adapted from Charlotte Bronte's Gothic romance novel. It's a classic English literature with Timothy Dalton (my favorite James Bond) as Edward Rochester and Zelah Clarke, as Jane Eyre, a poor, orphaned 18-year-old girl, governor at Rochester's estate, Thornfield. "Jane Eyre" has been one of my beloved books since I was an 11-year-old girl and my friend told me that "This book is wonderful" and so it was and I read it decades of times and I'm still not tired of it. His beautiful language, refined, fragrant and surprisingly fresh, the dialogues, and above all two main characters, and the story of their impossible love attracted many filmmakers. "Jane Eyre" is often modified on TV and large screen, 18 according to IMDb. The actors as well-known and wonderful such as Joan Fontaine and Orson Welles, William Hurt and Charlotte Gainsbourg, George C. Scott and Susannah York, Ciar√°n Hinds and Samantha Morton, played the couple playing hundreds of stumbling blocks by society, laws, religion, the differences in age, backgrounds, experiences, and the fatal mistakes one will hunt for many years. Of all these films I only saw one 300-minute BBC version of 1983 following the novel and where Timothy Dalton, who often plays dark, roaring characters, not only played brilliant Edward Rochester and with the class he was Mr. . Rochester - Sardinian, vibrant, the power of nature, powerful, passionate, sexy and plagued master of Thornfield. Zelah Clarke was also convincing as sweet, gentle, intelligent and strong Jane who felt deeply and was passionately mixed with clear reasoning and quiet but strong willpower. <br /> <br /> Added on September 17, 2007: Over the past two weeks, I've seen five Jane Eyre movies and it was a wonderful experience. There is something to admire in every adaptation of Jane Eyre, although not all of them are quite successful. This version is still my favorite "Jane Eyre" movie.
