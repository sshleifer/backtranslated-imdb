The moment the Lady of Shanghai was made, Orson Welles and Rita Hayworth's marriage dissolved. The film was so much trouble from Welles to rebuild the old flames if it had to make a classic noir. The Lady of Shanghai has not been properly received, and has received more and more critical praise for years. Welles is better with age to speak like that. Welles is Irish sailor Michael O'Hara who, on a fateful night, saves the beautiful Rita Hayworth from three muggers in Central Park. Sparks flies, but then the rubbing comes, the woman seems to be married, but the brilliant criminal lawyer, Everett Sloane. Nevertheless, Sloane feels an apparent taste for Welles and he rents him to skipper his hunt. <br /> <br /> So far, this movie is very much like Gilda. If Orson had seen Gilda and was not currently with his male member, he would have retired to the seaman's rental room in Lower Manhattan. Instead, he gets himself involved in a beautiful web or plot and finds himself held for two murders and Sloane as his intention. <br /> <br /> For whatever reason, Welles decided that his wife would be a blonde in this movie. Presumably, Harry Cohn hit the roof, as Rita was internationally renowned for her reddish hair. This may have soured him on the photo when he joined the legion studio bosses that had Welles' vision of independent film threatening their power. <br /> <br /> Stage actor Glenn Anders plays Sloane's partner Grisby, who is one smart man, he winds up a body. The other seems to be here, is Ted DeCorsia, a private detective who is under the impression that he is doing business for himself. <br /> <br /> It's a good noir thriller, which shows Rita at her glorious best, even though she was a blonde here. The final shooting in the mirror room was beautifully performed, but I would not recommend seeing it on any controlled substance.
