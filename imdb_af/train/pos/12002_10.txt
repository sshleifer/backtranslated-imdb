In spite of reading the "initial comment" of someone who has kept the movie wonderful - (WHY IS THE ONLY NEGATIVE COMMENT VERY FIRST ON THE LIST?) It was very nice to note that almost everyone else loves it! Of course, the Church wanted to emphasize certain points and portray the Prophet Joseph Smith in a positive way ~ that's the whole idea. And indeed, those points were extremely effective. We already know that Joseph Smith was human ... but despite that, and all the terrible negative efforts made by the adversary, it just showed how he could complete a remarkable, God-given work. I would recommend it to anyone!
