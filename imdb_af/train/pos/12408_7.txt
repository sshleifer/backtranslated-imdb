Viggo Mortensen stars as a new prisoner of a haunted house in which the governor (well played by Lane Smith) has a Greek secret that may be the reason why several prison guards and prisoners are slaughtered by a supernatural presence. Lincoln Kilpatrick is the army that knows the secret and is afraid of his life. If I think of jail movies, I always think of action stalls with Stallone or Van Damme or high caliber dramas such as Shawshank Redemption or The Green Mile. However, I didn't expect a ghost story that was more like Exorcist III. However, the prison is an atmospheric effort and remains the best film of Renny Harlin's career. The movie is creepy and has some good acting from a cast of (unknown) unknowns. Lane Smith comes out best because his custodian is not the usual clich√© of evil, but rather nervous and winding, which offers some credibility in a movie that far exceeds expectations. <br /> <br /> *** from 4- (Good)
