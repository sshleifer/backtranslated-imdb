"Death Lends A Hand" is one of the rotatable early episodes of "Columbo" which helped define the performance for the next thirty years. This is the first of Robert Culp's four appearances (three as a killer), which plays the same role in each performance. <br /> <br /> In this case, Culp Brimmer, the head of a large private detective company who asked to investigate whether the rich newspaper magnate woman, Kennicut, has a relationship. Although she is, Brimmer decides not to tell Kennicut in the hope that he can extort his wife in exchange for information about her husband's business experts. She reacts badly to this proposal, following an argument that is changing rapidly, while Brimmer strikes her face. Wearing a large ring, the slap knocks her on the ground and kills her. <br /> <br /> There are some very valuable moments in this episode. One of my favorite scenes is where Columbo pretends to be in palm reading, although it is actually a ruse to discover the shape and size of Brimmer's ring without acknowledging that he knows the killer was wearing a ring. Columbo is Columbo, he only reveals what he really knows when the time is right to turn the screws a little. So he initially plays the part of a fairly simple person who gets excited about the "lifeline over the moon", or an equally ridiculous palm-reading mumbo jumbo. <br /> <br /> Another big scene is when Brimmer tries to offer Columbo a job for his firm, to effectively circumvent him to stop his nose. Again, Columbo doesn't reveal that he knows what's going on, he pretends to be honored and excited by this job offer. <br /> <br /> And there's another where Columbo told Kennicut before Brimmer that he wished the killer could hear their conversation. He wants to show Brimmer that he is on him, without accusing him directly, so in the circumstances he rather sensibly (but understandably understand) decides to play at Brimmer mindgames to panic and do something stupid. What he does of course! All the time the grief Kennicut is unaware of the subtext of this conversation. It's just near the end Columbo explains everything to Kennicut (not shown on the screen). <br /> <br /> I won't reveal how Columbo ultimately makes the killer look the right way, but let's just say there's a potato involved. .. <br /> <br /> A really good episode, possibly the very best of the first series. If you like this you will also like "Double Exposure", also with Robert Culp.
