I didn't feel that this movie was just as clever, as it looked like it was just enjoying it. <br /> <br /> It's original, but reminds me of two other French films, Vidocq and City of Lost Children, mostly for the color, but also for the edgy quality of the close ups of the characters. <br /> <br /> In a prison cell, but don't keep it, this movie seems to be far more than a multi-site blocker. <br /> <br /> Always interesting, with the perennial 'Black Arts' good in the vanguard and very good characterization, and some just make credible! <br /> <br /> Scary with some gore, it's worth watching.
