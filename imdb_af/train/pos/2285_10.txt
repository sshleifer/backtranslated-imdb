I didn't read this book, but even though the movie I was furious with just one thought in my head: this is so Vonnegut. I have never seen a writer, all the intelligence and life behind the work of a novel, translate so well to film. This movie had the same complexities in Vonnegut's novels: the jokes were often meaningful and symbolic, and the dramatic events and symbols were often jokes. <br /> <br /> Campbell was also a very Vonnegut character, perfectly portrayed by Nick Nolte. He had all the remarks of a Vonnegut hero: a lack of concern for political boundaries, ironic dark humor that foolishly inactivates in response to stress and a reluctance to push his version of reality on those around him. <Br /> <br /> Overall, I was constantly surprised and impressed when I watched this movie. It was the same feeling that I had read "Cat's Cradle", my first Vonnegut novel, as if the perfect strangest thing that could happen, he thought of it and he really made it important. Yes, he has nothing but army surplus "White Christmas" albums. So it goes!
