It is an excellent movie about the characters in an adult swim class, their problems, relationships and interactions with each other. It had to have a wider spread, as at the same time it is much better than similar films from large studios. <br /> <br /> The swimming instructor is an almost Olympic, reduced to basic adult lessons and often the aim of horndogging his female students. He tries more or less to deliver them, with varying results. <br /> <br /> The student characters are mainstream U.S.A; teachers, policemen, college students and retired people, who did not learn to swim for some reason. The movie covers their relationships, including friends, family, and romantic conquests as they go through class. Several subplots offer amusement nutrition, including a divorced teacher, some high school students who make a documentary and a girl who is only in class to meet guys. <br /> <br /> It's a good date movie, or just one to watch when you're in the mood for a romantic drama with reality overtones.
