I see this movie as a masterpiece, but it took me at least 4 or 5 times to see it, to realize what a good movie was. First, it describes a vision of World War II that we don't usually see in Hollywood movies. In particular, German soldiers, army and the Nazi government are shown more "humanized". One of the facts that impressed me the most was a murder that took place in a forest in the last 20's. This is the place where the last chapters of Berlin's Alexanderplatz take place: It's the forest where Reinhold Mieze kills. Another clue for those who keep the details is portraying doors. Fassbinder is obsessive with the changes in people each time they walk over a door or a door is opened. Many doors are shown in the screen, open and closed. And the characters change in their personality, their actions, etc. anytime, what happens. Did you notice it?
