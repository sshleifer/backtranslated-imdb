The movie celebrates life. <br /> <br /> The world presents itself to the innocent and pure souls and everything has "Happy End," just like in the closing scene of the movie. <br /> <br /> The movie has a wonderful soundtrack, a mix of Serbian neo-folk, Gypsy music and jazz. <br /> <br /> This movie is a very refreshing piece of visual poetry. <br /> <br /> The viewing experience is like you 'I'm sucked into another colorful, romantic and sometimes rough world. <br /> <br /> Like Mr. Kusturica's movie should be.
