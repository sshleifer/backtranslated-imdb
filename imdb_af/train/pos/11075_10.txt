After reading the reviews for this movie, I began to understand with a lot of doubt in my mind that it would actually be good. However, this is one of the best movies I've seen long ago. Most reviews I read have said that the complicated plot made it too difficult to follow. And while some parts leave you confused, the end binds as many loose points you feel as kicking yourself because you missed so much. It's not like "Lock, Stock ..." or "Snatch", in that it's not that funny (it's pretty dark) and it's much more intelligent, as you see parts of scenes from different viewpoints (And in one of the best screens of the movie, Jason Statham spends five minutes in an elevator that has an argument himself). The way it is similar to the two movies I just mentioned is that it is full of memorable characters, specifically Statham, that offers a fantastic performance as well as Ray Liotta, who spends most of the movie in Speedos but give a good performance anyway. If you have time, and later have time to think about the movie, and even watch it again, you really start to see all the symbolism and tips explained by the movie. I think it's fantastic and that Guy Ritchie is a director at the top of his game.
