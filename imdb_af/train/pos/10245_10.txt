It was a personal favorite of mine, when I was young, it had everything that was great with the children's children's movies. Lovely dinosaurs, cute kids, an eccentric villain and some good songs (and not the typical little mermaid / beauty and the beast type songs, but those that are almost entertaining)! I recently ran into this movie and I still love it as much as ever! I recommend everyone of all ages to watch this movie, and I definitely think it should be introduced to the younger generations! Sorry, not the most informative, I'm in luck ... just please, trust me. Everyone who goes against this movie kills their inner child!
