Mahatma was portrayed as a man who neglected his own son in this movie. Don't get me wrong, I don't judge the movie; It's such a wonderful movie and runs out of the theater with a lump in my throat. We need to understand Mahatma's spiritual status, he is a true spiritual leader. Only a fully enlightened man can detach himself from his loved ones. A man with such a caliber leads his example by his family and followers. According to the film, he spoke to his son and tried to make him understand where he came from, but poor Harilall with so little intellect could not understand his father. When things went wrong with Harilall, Mahatma could remain calm and assume his son was a tragedy. <br /> <br /> If it were any other parents, they would have compromised their values ​​to help the boy get on his feet. Mahatma did not, he is a true leader who leads by example.
