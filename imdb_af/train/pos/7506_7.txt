I'm not going to lie. In spite of interest, I watched The Notorious Bettie Page because I heard (and it was pretty obvious just by looking at a summary or something about the movie) that Gretchen Mol got naked. I've never been a fan of Mol, but I can't resist seeing an attractive woman taking out her clothes. Yes, it can be twisted, but it's a theme and ideally central to the core of the movie, helping to make the movie much stronger than it probably would. <br /> <br /> The movie chronicles Bettie Page's (Mol) lives on her physical and sexually abused days as a child in high school in the South, and on her new life in New York. She wants to be an actress, but she also has to pay bills. After taking a few seemingly innocent shots on a local beach, Page slowly becomes a modeling sensation, quickly jumping from suggestive photos to sexually challenging photos. <br /> <br /> I feel the shortness of the film (just over ninety minutes) is both a curse and a blessing for it. On the one hand, the film never elevates its welcome. You get to know Page within minutes and get it right in her model career and don't look back. But it also curses the movie, because we never really get a chance to understand everything that is going on. She's just a kind of jumping between model shoots and the controversies they create before jumping straight into the big senate examining much of the film's final act. You just sit there and try to absorb it all, and more just come right with you. It seems as if the filmmakers want to summarize too much material. It begs for longer rows and asks for more longer explanations. It does not feel rushed; It just doesn't feel all there. <br /> <br /> A bit of a fumble, though a little more curiosity, is the use of color throughout the film. The majority are in black and white, but often splashes and color ranges occur. But, although it could be done early as a symbolic gesture, it becomes a bit of a distraction, as it is constantly emerging before it looks back at black and white. It gets confusing, and is getting more of a boring interference than anything other than the movie is going on. <br /> <br /> While it may seem a bit fuzzy, the movie remains dead with its themes. Page, of which I know little about nothing, is played innocently and her world is exactly the same. Save for some shady characters during her teens, everyone she meets is innocent, and everything she does has an innocence for it. I never thought I would look to full respect as something other than vulgar and corrupt, but here it is really something to marvel at. Everything at once is beautiful and innocent. Even the most sexually distorted moments in the film (albeit tame compared to today's standards) have an innocent and angelic feel to them. There's just something about the way Mol's naked body is portrayed that hits another cord than naked bodies in other movies. It feels just as natural and so wonderful that if there was any reason to watch the movie, it would be the spectacular portrayal of Mol's body as his Bettie Page played. <br /> <br /> The other reason is Mol herself. As a page she illustrates that 1950's southern belle knows (or can at least think). Despite her profession, she is still a normal person and still looks at herself as religious. Mol plays her exactly the right amount of squeaky neatness needed to make this character from the 1950s feel of character. She played her with such a fact that you would be hard not to think that Mol was actually Bettie Page himself. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the support pours very few moments to shine and is completely overshadowed by Mol's wonderful performance. None of them do anything special, and neither of them really has the same power in their role as Mol. It's not really the actors' fault, but more of the fact that they don't work much. Many of them are completely recognizable, such as Oscar nominee David Strathairn (in a role too close to one of his better performances), Sarah Paulson (recent Golden Globe nominee for Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip) and character actor Lili Taylor but you will be hard to really put their performance into something other than okay. Not one of these characters has really been developed, and they are just like character clippings that Mol walks around when she picks up steam in her brilliant show. <br /> <br /> Really, this movie is worth it for its portrayal. of nudity, and for Gretchen Mol's excellent performance by Bettie Page. Everything else is a little too confused and uncomfortable as it should be. If more work was done to develop supporting characters and not just to blow the story, this movie would be a much better biographical movie. As it stands, it's just a vehicle for Mol to really stand up in the stratosphere of popularity as an actress. <br /> <br /> 7/10.
