A good movie, and I'll watch a few times. Rich (the previous commentator) is right: there is much more going on when it is clear from the title boards, and I have to wonder how much has been learned in translation. Was there more in the original? Or is a mother tongue audience expected to read more? Or - since the script was written by the author of the novel on which it was based - was it a popular story with which the audience was already well-known? In short, it's worth looking at, but it probably requires more work from contemporary viewers than the original 1913 audience had to put in it. <br /> <br /> The Alpha Video edition boasts the new organ score, but the music isn't in any way consistent with the storyline. Certainly, it starts promising, but turns into a repetitive, Phillip-glass monotony that does not reflect anything on the screen. After listening for a while, I turned off the sound and simply watched: much better!
