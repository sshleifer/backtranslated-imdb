This is one of the funniest and most outstanding movies ever made! Although I only saw forty minuets of it and I have to say this is a good movie. The plot is funny and because there is about every corner of this movie. It's really funny and I don't see how anyone can NOT like this movie. I really want to watch the rest of the movie. It has a slightly sick scene in it (trust me, it's not very pleasant), but it's also a good movie. I rate this movie a 7/8 for comedy, 10/10 for sexual content and 10/10 for the plot. If you're a fan of American Pie and you want to watch a movie where there is almost a lot of sex, buy the movie. It will please you. <br /> <br /> 10/10
