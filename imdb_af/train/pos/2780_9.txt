Great movie I loved it. Great editing and use of the soundtrack. Catch the real feeling of Indian life, but we can all be related. A well-chosen throw with some great characters. The movie develops all the characters so you really care about them all and you feel like you know them. The use of Indian music and drums in some of the soccer teams is great and the direction really works, as everyone comes down as real and natural. You can only help caring for Jess in this movie! The acting was really good, even the tomboy-like walk and body posture of both front ladies is very convincing as someone who played a lot of soccer.
