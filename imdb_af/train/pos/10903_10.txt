This man is nothing but wonderful. You really feel as though you were living his life with him during these tragic events and finally crying with his family. He was so passionate about his cause, not just for himself, but for ensuring that others who survived would not have to suffer this misery. I watch this video every time I have a bad or a down day, and it always drives me to see the big and brighter side of life, just as Jonny did, even with his unbearable pain. My only regret was not knowing earlier from Jonny, since I visited twice twice in England and could say I met him. It's easy to know that Jonny is sitting on his cloud, painless! Rest in peace, Dear Jonny. You deserve it!
