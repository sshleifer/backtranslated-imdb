These cute animated short features are two comic icons - Betty Boop and Henry. <br /> <br /> Henry is the naked, slightly pussy son of the comic strips who never speak. <br /> <br /> Well, here he talks! <br /> <br /> He wants to get a puppy from Betty Boop's pet shop, and if he leaves the store, there are some hilarious haninks. <br /> <br /> Betty sings a song about pets, Henry gets a fight with birds and a monkey, but everything eventually ends.
