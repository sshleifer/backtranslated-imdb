First of all, the Bourne speaks Ultimatum as a fan of the genre. It's a breathtaking, virtuosic, fantastic action movie. <br /> <br /> Secondly, it's a stupid malarchy of cartoon-like superheroes. <br /> Third, the film carries a complex, important point about crime makers who themselves become criminals. No reference is made to Abu Ghraib or the Executive Branch's excessive domestic attacks on constitutional rights. No one is needed. <br /> <br /> So, the latest in the Bourne series, in the hands of Paul Greengrass (from the 2004 "Bourne Supremacy" and last year's "United 93"), is a significant achievement, perhaps withheld but not actually reduced by the inevitable remnant of the genre. <br /> <br /> "Breathtaking" above is intended as a complementary adjective and a description of the physical sensation: for more than an hour from the first frame, the viewer seems to hold back his breath, against the chair pushed back by the power of relentless, globe-proud, totally thrilling action. There is no show, no variation in the rhythm and the draw of the movie, yet it never gets monotonous and tiring as some music videos do after a few minutes. <br /> <br /> Oliver Wood's in-you-face cinematography is the best of Tony Gilroy's script from Robert Ludlum's 1990 novel (which does not build well against "Bourne Identity", a decade earlier written). <br /> <br /> Once upon a time, Matt Damon is the inevitable, irreplaceable Bourne, the deadliest fantasy CIA agent, this time the entire agency is looking for its identity, its past, and the mysterious agency program that puts it in " a murder machine has changed. Nothing like his silent Edward R. Murrow, the always wonderful David Strathairn, is the nasty official of the top agency that crashed against Bourne to try to hide an illegal policy of a non-prisoner and a brutal procedure no. <br /> <br /> Playing Joan Allen seems to be the Good Police against Strathairn's Bad One. And there is Julia Stiles when the agent comes back to Bourne's help; A combination of Greengrass' direction and Stiles action leads to a surprising impact of a mostly silent character, her lack of communication and empty expression which is more intriguing than miles of dialogue. <br /> <br /> So good is "The Bourne Ultimatum" that it gets away with the old one-on-the-world bit, this time stretching to ridiculous surplus, as Bourne has the limitations of geography, time , gravity ... and physics in general contradict. (Can you fly back with a car from the top of a building? Why not - it looks good.) <br /> <br /> All this "real world" magic - jumping from country to country in seconds to Comes in an unknown place, exactly when, and how needed, it becomes impossible with special effects and superhero cartoons. And yet, just a clueless pedant would allow "facts" to interfere with the entertainment-based ecstasy of the Bourne fantasy.
