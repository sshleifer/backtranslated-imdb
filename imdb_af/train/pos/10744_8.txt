The events of September 11, 2001 do not require extra human interest in the training of the firefighter or the progress of the two French brothers. In my opinion, it would have been better to leave it out. I think the directors have tried too hard, maybe they felt that the events of the day need a story as background. The comment of one of a policemen - "this is not a Disneyworld". <br /> <br /> However, it is compelling to look for the portrayal of events. The filmmakers were in the right places at the right time, not matching any other footage of the day they shot.
