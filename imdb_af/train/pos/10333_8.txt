It was a wonderful American American propaganda film that is both highly creative. AND the revelation of the Nazi atrocities openly discussed before the entire camp of the death camps was announced. In late 1944 and in 1945, revealing how angry and horrible they were, this film, unlike other Hollywood movies to date, is the most brutal-honest movie of the era I saw about Nazi atrocities. <br /> <br /> The movie starts in a courtroom in the future - after the war is over (the film was made in 1944 - the war ended in May 1945). In this fictional world court, a Nazi leader is appointed for war crimes. Wilhelm Grimm is completely indisputable and one by one witnesses are mentioned who revealed Grimm's life since 1919 in a series of flashbacks. Initially, the movie seems to be sympathetic or explain how Grimm was pushed to join the Nazis. But after a while it becomes very clear that Grimm is just a sadistic monster. These episodes are incredibly well done and definitely hold your interest and also make the movie less like a piece of propaganda, but a legitimate drama. <br /> <br /> All in all, the movie does a great job if the movie is mostly considered star second-action actors. There are many compelling scenes and performances - especially the very former Jewish extermination site that can't help but bring you close to tears. It was also interesting how the same point in the movie there were some super-creative scenes that use crosses in a way that you can't even see. Overall, it's a must-see for history lovers and anyone who wants to see a good movie. <br /> <br /> FYI - It's not meant to be a serious criticism of the movie, but Hitler is referred to as "that paper pendant". It is a reference to the myth that Hitler once made money to make a background. It is NOT true - previously he was a "hungry artist", homeless person and was good at the German army in WWI. A nice person, yes, but never a paper hanger!
