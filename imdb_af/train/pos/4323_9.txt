It is a great adaptation and a great miniseries in its own right. The plot cut can disappoint fans of the book (but really, how many modern readers have read Bleak House without first seeing a movie version? I just know of a few). <br /> <br /> I think it's very scary to see critical reviews of the series clearly written by people who have no idea about the story. Did you see the series or did you just have a BBC production because Gillian Anderson was in the newer version? <br /> <br /> The range captures the mood, pace, characters and plot drivers (the Dickensian flourishes that aren't needed and detracts from a movie treatment like the Turveydrop story, the Smallweed family dynamics and the extra lawyers - Tangle, Vholes etc. are very cut off). The only omission I wanted was the Jellyby incident, but if the first episode is a bit slow (after the first episode, the pass is perfect). I can see it had to go. <br /> <br /> The only other criticism I have is that Jo's death could be done more faithfully. I can see it would be practically canonizing Woodcourt and he kept a little more people because he didn't have that scene, but I think Jo's death is one of the most beautiful points of the book and I missed it though it always let's cry. br /> <br /> Did theowinthrop actually see the series? HOW did he think Esther was raised by her aunt and UNCLE? Who is this uncle? I think someone who can miss the name DENHOLM Eliott for Desmond is not really an observer of English art (film or literature). <br /> <br /> I also think he misses the legal treatment. YES the law is very heavily signed in Bleak House. It fails Jarndyce's descendants whose valuable heritage is eaten by litigation costs, failing the late Tom Jarndyce and Rick Carstone and everyone in the pack. It misses Miss Float. In one way or another, it also fails Captain Hawdon, who is driven away by the monotony of the legal copying work. Yes, it feeds the fillers of Vholes and Tangle. But it also allows people like Guppy and Kenge to move outside their station. Although not so fond of social status climbers, Dickens would have preferred that they should not be tied to the station in which they were born. (Jo and the stonemason families contrast to climb Charley Neckett). <br /> <br /> The law, while being abused by Tulkinghorn and the Chancery vultures, is actually the source of security for the wards of Ada and Richard, and for Esther simply Jarndyce's district. Their security is assured by the law they provide to Jarndyce. <br /> <br /> I can't see anyone having trouble following the story - remember you're not supposed to realize Esther is Lady Dedlock's daughter at the start. You should not immediately "get" any connections. Immediate satisfaction just doesn't happen in Dickens. <br /> <br /> Like "seeing through the fog" - the Gillian Anderson had such a spectacular edit that I found impossible to follow and I already knew the plot! <br /> <br /> I found Diana Rigg absolutely brilliant (overworking and drama doesn't make a good Lady Dedlock, but if you think they're doing the Gillian Anderson version). <br /> <br /> That's not ADA and Rick "Kate"! and you get everything you need from the Rouncewell subplot.
