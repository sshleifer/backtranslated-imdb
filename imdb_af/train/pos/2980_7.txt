This movie is just funny. senseless, but funny. To enjoy this movie completely, you can't have a perception of how a movie like this goes and just enjoy all the jokes and points involved in the movie. I still find the bit funny at the beginning when he says, "want a beer ........ rooster". funny things. But what makes the movie decent is the fact that it is not difficult to create a serious twist on the film, too many comedies try to have serious aspects that you just don't believe. But it's different and just focus on being funny. I have to say, Yasmin bleeth is terrific in the movie and does not add anything, but the 3 main guys, coop, brake and squeak are very funny to watch and make the movie great to watch
