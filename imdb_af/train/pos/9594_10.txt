While very unfortunate, the ballroom scene is still very lively and carries their legacy. Some are still very lively and very good, Octavia is more radiant and beautiful than ever. Willi Ninja is very abundant and gives a lot of support to the gay community as a whole. Pepper Labeija just passed the natural cause last year, May she rest in peace. After Anji's passing, Carmen became the mother of Xtravaganza's house (she was in the beach scene) and she also loved more and more. Some balls have dedicated categories to those who have passed, they may all rest in peace. There is currently another project known as "How Do I Look?", You can view the website at www.howdoilooknyc.org.
