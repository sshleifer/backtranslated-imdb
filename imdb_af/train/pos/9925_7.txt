When I rented Domino, I was expecting it to be very stupid. I hate movies that have really flashy editing and cinematography, and Domino also got very bad reviews. The only reason I watched it is because I liked Keira Knightley, Mickey Rourke, Christopher Walken and Tony Scott. I also enjoy just adventure adventures. Yes, the editing and cinematography was exuberant, the story was weak and the acting was mediocre, but I still love this bizarre reason for this movie. Domino was very, very entertaining and often very funny. It was terribly underestimated when it was released. I think because everyone wanted more of an emotional journey like Scotts' last movie, Man on Fire, and instead had great entertainment. I actually understand why everyone hated Domino so much, though I love it and recommend it.
