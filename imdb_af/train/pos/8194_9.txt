Despite the other comments listed here, it's probably the best Dirty Harry movie ever made; a film that reflects the country's socio-political feelings during the Reagan glory years of the early 80s - better or worse. It's also a kickass action movie. <br /> <br /> The opening with a liberal female judge overcoming a murder case, due to a lack of tangible evidence and then straight into the coffee shop with several unfortunate hoodlums (the scene that asks the famous, "Go make my day "line", "Sudden Impact" is a non-stop roller coaster of an action movie. The first time you breathe, is when the tough Inspector Callahan is sent to a nearby city to investigate the background of a murdered hood. It just got better off with an over-the-top group of grotesque thugs for Callahan to go with a sherriff with a mysterious past. Excellent direction and photography and a temporary hilarious script help make this movie one of the best of the 80's.
