First of all, I was completely taken away by the film's first lyrics, and then I was completely enchanted by the unfolding story and enchanted by the brilliant direction. The characters were all fully developed, no bigger than life, but just like the people we live in wherever we are in the world, in Sweden, in Turkey or in America, all perfectly credible people with foibles and nobility. Hollywood can learn so much from this beautiful movie. It shows that there is no need to go every little detail behind every action to bring out the whole theme clearly and clearly, and it shows the brilliance of the director! Hearfelt thanks to Kay Pollak and the wonderful cast for this wonderful surprise !!
