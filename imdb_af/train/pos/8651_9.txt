California came out in 1993, as were 3 of the 4 main characters and came to the levels of celebrity they now own in 2006. It is a nice psychotriller who has to appeal to all David Duchovny fans because of his dry and intelligent stories that find their way in his work, as with most of his episodes of the X-Files, Playing God and Red Shoe Diaries. People fired by Brad Pitt's heavy southern accent. and of course, Juliette Lewis's characters have never spent much time in the south. For each "Brian and Carrie" in the south there is an "Adele and Early" and in 2006 it is the real horror of this movie. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, I think the film is written with a cult movie intention - as with Carrie's photography, it's not suitable for mass consumption. But if you have a copy of this in your personal library, I think it's something positive about your taste for freaky movies.
