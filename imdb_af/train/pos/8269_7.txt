I've been inspired by this movie for a while, partly because of the extremely high score here on IMDb - a 9.0 average with more than 300 votes gives it the highest score of any accessible silent movie! How did I hear from this movie before this site? Well, you can't always trust the ratings. This is actually a very good movie, well preserved as the fine VHS transfer I hired is indicative - excellent acting by principals, especially William Haines and Brown, and good work at Cambridge with a some fine performances in the climate Harvard / Yale soccer match - but the story had to have been a high chestnut brown even in 1926. Indifferent, self-centered and charismatic guy goes to school and gets in his place, in the process becomes a caring, self-sacrificing friend; I doubt people in 1926 found much that was really exciting in the last few roles, the predictability factor is high. Yet it starts out very well and it certainly deserves to be remembered, if not praised in heaven. Perhaps the previous 350 voters are mostly Harvard men ... <br /> <br /> EDIT Now 600+ voters and the score actually climbed to 9.2! Seriously, people, there are ballot papers going on here - I'm telling someone to explain why it's a better movie than Metropolis or The General!
