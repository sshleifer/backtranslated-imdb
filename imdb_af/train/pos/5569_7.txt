Cheech & Chong's Next Movie (1980) was the second film to keep the loving duo of Cheech Marin and Tommy Chong. The lovely outreachers are now housemates. They live in a condemned building and seek ways to make more smoke and lie all day. But Cheech is the "responsible" one. He has a job and a steady friend. One day Cheech wants to get his freak, and he tries to get Chong out of the house. Another problem also arises, Cheech's brother, 'Red' (Cheech is another role), is in town and wants to stick with him. Danger of killing two birds with one stone, Cheech pawns Chong off and Red. What kind of adventures will Chong and Red come in? Will Cheech get his freak? How long will Chong go without smoking? Just look at CHEECH & CHONG'S NEXT MOVIE to find out! <br /> <br /> Tommy Chong takes over government government for the successor. He gained some experience when he did unpaid work at UP in Smoking. Funny but not as good as the first movie. But Cheech and Chong fans will enjoy it. Followed by NICE DREAMS. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
