* What I like about SPOILERS * Teen Holly Tyler (Amanda Bynes) will live with older sister Valerie (Jennie Garth) to prevent her from moving to Japan with her father; but she doesn't know half of the crazy things that will happen to her from now on, and not just for her, but for her sister, her friends Gary (Wesley Jonathan) and Tina (Alison Munn), boyfriend Henry ( Michael McMillian), wasting Vince (Nick Zano), Valerie's boyfriend Jeff (Simon Rex), first boss (then firefighter then husband) Vic (Dan Cortese), annoying colleague Lauren (Leslie Grossman) and second boss Peter (?) If you "I don't have a funny leg in your body, please skip it. if you just like sophisticated comedy, it's not for you; If you like a funny, sometimes touching context with two hot chicks that can star in (and none other than the fabulous Mary Cherry by Popular - Leslie Grossman - in the main cast), what are you waiting for hell? ? Welcome to Casa De Tyler! What I like about you (2002-2006): 8.
