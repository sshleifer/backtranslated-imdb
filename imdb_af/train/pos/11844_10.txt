I started riding horses quite recently, and like someone who has ever driven, I had to fall in love with horses and their world. I hired Spirit, just trying to pack my life full of as much horse-related material as I could, and I was amazed at the results. <br /> <br /> What I expected was a good Disneyesque movie with five-minute talking animals and stereotypes. <br /> <br /> What I got was a great movie, filled with beautiful scenery and animation and a wonderful story that has the potential to warm your heart. <br /> <br /> Spirit is a wild mustang in the Old West, of which the whole world is brought to crumble when he discovers that people are slowly taking over his homeland. The story unfolds with a wide variety of characters, some people, some animals, all are well written and most are fun to watch. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good story and who appreciates history and animals. <br /> <br /> One thing I forgot to mention, but what I feel important is that the animals in this movie don't speak. It was a great holiday from the Lady And The Tramp animated movies that everyone is used to today.
