Maybe I love this movie so much in part because I felt in the dumps and it's such a beautiful little fairy tale. Whatever the reason, I thought it was perfect. Great, intelligent story, beautiful effects, excellent acting (especially De Niro, which is wonderful). This movie made me happier than I had been for a while. <br /> <br /> It's a very funny and clever movie. The running joke of the kingdom's history of principality and the aftermath, the way in which the magic of the witch and dozens of clever touches welcomed me all enchanted me. It's a lot of what makes it so good; It is an extensive, special-effect movie with more story than most fairy tales, but little attention is paid to small things. <br /> <br /> I feel like just continuing and watching it all again.
