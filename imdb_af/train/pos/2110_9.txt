So much has been written about the movie's plot, the wonderful play, the screenplay, the melancholy, the bittersweet atmosphere, the excellent direction - what can I add? Just look for one of the heartwarming, beautifully performed, striking scenes ever filmed. It is Christmas Eve and Frank Morgan's character (the shop owner - Mr Matuschek) recovering from his broken marriage and a suicide attempt. As each of his employees leaves, he invites them to a Christmas dinner. Each of them politely turned around. They all have plans for their own Christmas Eve. At this stage, there is a deep sadness for this moving scene. Frank Morgan gives the performance of his career and this scene easily brings me to tears. Fortunately, we have a happy denial to this very special scene. The new worker, the old boy, is the last to leave the store in a beautiful, snowy street scene. Desperate, Mr. Matuschek approaches this boy and asks him how he would spend the evening with him, he will treat him at all the wonderful Christmas that this old boy probably never saw! The shit is overwhelmed, of course he is lonely as well. Matuschek and together they can have a wonderful Christmas meal. Every time I see this scene, it moves me. If you manage to get the beautiful DVD, look at the big trailer with Frank Morgan who himself Introducing Matuschek and the appearance of the director of the film - the talented Ernst Lubitsch. This movie is a joy from beginning to end.
