I had to give this movie a 10, simply because it did what so many movies thrown into black audiences, weighed more likely. This movie was not of all the video higher cliches, and it also skipped the gangsters, rappers and dirty language. It explores various relationships between doctors, African Americans and African American male / female romantic relationships at a completely new and refreshing level. I was very impressed with the films' gentle mix of light humor with some tough and heavy problems. The movie will make you feel happy and sad at the same time. I also saw it at the Boston Film Festival. It was premiered at AMC Loews Boston and I really hope this movie makes it a much bigger audience. Black people (and everyone else) would like a movie like this - if the industry was just SMART enough to set it up! <br /> <br /> As an extra as your doctor, resident, medical student, premedical student, married to a doctor, a doctor's brother or sister, a doctor in the family, or a good doctor's period. They will also love this movie. It depicted life and practice in a real way, appreciated by doctors, residents and medical students. Dennis Cooper totally resides in internal medicine - so he certainly applied his knowledge / experience on the film and it is very clear.
