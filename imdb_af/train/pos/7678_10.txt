I just watched Holly with another movie about child sex and exploitation, called Trade at Film at the Sea International Film Festival. I have to say that Holly bleeds out of the water. <br /> <br /> Holly is a powerful and wonderful film at many different levels. From pure artistic and cinematic perspective, it is wonderful. The sound mix, camera angles, directing and acting are all about. <br /> <br /> The way it handles the subject is tasteful and non-exploitable. It provides the issue of child sexual exploitation in an educational and accurate manner. The filmmakers have given a splendid amount of attention to detail, capturing the nuances of the epidemic of sexual exploitation and child trafficking. Too often when dealing with a subject of this nature, it is tempting to shock the audience with graphic scenes of rape and violence. Holly can do it all without falling into the typical Hollywood trend. <br /> <br /> I had the pleasure of seeing Holly at two separate film festivals, once in the US and once in the Netherlands. I can honestly say that I have never heard audiences. Just listen to conversations after the screening, ask people who can do it personally to fight sexual exploitation of children. <br /> <br /> I recommend it to everyone, both for the film and its subject.
