This is a strange little movie, and I have to agree that there are some strange actions too. <br /> <br /> It follows the adventures of a young man who decides to become a famous Las Vegas. illusionis, and is partly about the dream of his dream, partly about the dreams of others, and everything about the jobs of showbiz. I thought the movie was charming and it had a moment or two of the real magic that made the whole thing worthwhile. <br /> <br /> Alan Arkin is wonderful as the wizard who never was and makes Max's mentorship a funny and enjoyable relationship. <br /> <br /> Not for everyone, probably, but if you want movies about the trip, then I think you'll like this one.
