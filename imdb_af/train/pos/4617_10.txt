I've been a Jennifer Connelly fan since the Phenomena, and after hearing about it in heaven for about seven minutes, I saw it as soon as possible. The movie is not just a comedy if you think many of these things have taken on most of us as kids and are currently going through. Not only was the movie terrific led by the phenomenal Jennifer connelly, it brought my attention to the fact that this movie was terrified and acted as a good deal. I loved it and watched it again and again and for those of you enjoying a good laugh or jennifer connelly, you can't see this movie !!
