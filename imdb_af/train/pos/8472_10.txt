I totally disagree. I thought it was a great movie for kids. Dawn sources of gilligans island, and promise shown from a scarce then well-known dana plato.it was disneyful and for that it can hardly be accounted for as meaningless fluff.no it was not a bit scared and was not meant to be. I will not destroy the end. But it was unusual the way it was done. I mean the kids' characters were great and I didn't know what to expect. The basic plot also has much more to do with these children as you say the fact that these children are knowledgeable fishermen is very central to the plot, especially initially. It also helps them out of a jam to the end. It also has the plus of not being too long. I think it looks in less than 95 minutes
