Okay. As you can see, it's one of my favorite if it's not favorite movies. It's a character drama that's absolutely hilarious. The main character is a businessman who is held in a "same thing, different day" mentality. He sees a woman who every day looks out of a dance studio window out of his train and wonders about her and decides to find out more about her. He decides to just join the dance class to find out she's not the instructor. From there he connects with four other dancers and learns to enjoy dancing, as well as finding out about the mysterious woman. <br /> <br /> There is no free sex or sex involved, just how a small group of people learn how to create and develop friendships. <br /> <br /> This movie has been rearranged with Richard Gere and Jennifer Lopez and the new one, while it is attractive, is nowhere as nice as the original. The film never made it into America because it was not eligible for the Oscars, as it was broadcast on television in Japan. (Movies cannot be released on TV, or they are disqualified for Oscar nominations). It has won several awards in Japan for the best film, film, director, etc. for their Oscar awards.
