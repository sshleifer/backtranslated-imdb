The plot doesn't begin to describe the movie: a man writes a movie, or rather, * this * movie. It is completely self-referring to the point that you think it will fold itself like a black hole. The author writes something and it happens if something happens and he writes about it. <br /> <br /> It's very philosophical, such as "Waking Life" but more Zen-oriented and for the cause, much better, in my opinion. At one stage there are interviews between people and on the street and then you see shots of these people being filmed, and then you discover that their answers are written if one flies her lines. There are beautiful scenery and optical illusions. <br /> <br /> I hope it comes out on DVD so I can watch it more accurately. See at Cinequest (San Jose, CA film festival) on 2/25/2002.
