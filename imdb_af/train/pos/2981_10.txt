Why is the movie rated so low in this movie?! I've seen this movie 25 times, I know EVERY rule for this movie. Obviously I love this movie. Trey Parker and Matt Stone (creators of South Park and new puppeteer Team America) die as main characters Joe Cooper, or Coop "Airman" Cooper, and Doug Remer, or "Sir Swish." Mostly they are just called Coop and Remer throughout the movie. Just as the movie starts, we remind ourselves of the money that hungry corrupt world of overpaid sports is starting, they even go as far as making "Townsell". I must quote this section of the movie, as it is true with some sports stations: "And after playing New England, San Diego, Huston, Saint Louis, a year for the Toronto Arganauts, plus one season as a bigger one at the Desert Inn I'm happy to finally play here in the fine city of Miami. "His agent leaned over," Minnesota. " Let's not forget this important piece of the movie. So it starts that Coop and Remer are at a high school reunion party and realize that they are still nothing like they are talking to their old classmates. Outside, they made the sport BASEketball after they were challenged by what was probably high school basketball heroes. After being shocked, the sport goes on for about a year. During this time, they succeeded in recruiting their third teammate Squeak, who is actually a day after finding out the game. As the film follows, we find that Coop, Remer and Squeak are the only virtuous sports hero. The story follows with zany extortion, the Milwaukee Beers cheerleaders and humor so absurd that it will make you cry for more. Hold it boyfriend, it's hilarious.
