The 3rd and in my opinion the best of the Blackadder series. <br /> <br /> The only downside is that there is no Lord Percy who was the funniest character from the previous series, but Hugh Laurie's Prince Regent is really a little laughed. line. <br /> <br /> As a package, it is quality through and through with convincing rain sets, excellent night-time scarves and small pieces of wacky, the 'Macbeth' actors that stand out and Prince Georges' happy us's chicken impression and the missing words from dr. johnson's dictionary. <br /> <br /> Few comedies were pretty clever, as it's funny, okay, the strange lame sighting or line coming in, but mostly it's a scream.
