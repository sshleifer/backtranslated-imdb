Suddenly, my overall impact was better than The Enforcer. It was a big movie, but then I saw the villain and was disappointed. <br /> <br /> Sudden Impact was different from previous installments. The plot went in a different direction in this movie, as Dirty Harry did not use so much of a police approach this time. We also don't see the villain until later, which means less screen time for them, which is better for us all. <br /> <br /> Clint Eastwood steals the show again as Dirty Harry said enough. Pat Hingle was delightful as Chief Jannings, Harry's newly appointed boss. Bradford Dillman looked his name to Captain Briggs, or he was no different. Michael Currie is decent like Lt. Donnelly, Harry's annoying superior. I personally enjoyed Kevyn Major Howard as Hawkins, the young punk who has a vendetta against Harry. Albert Popwell was excellent as Horace, Harry's friend. Audrie J. Neenan was good like Ray Parkins, a well-known lesbian in town. Jack Thibeau was well-cast as Kruger, a pervert. Now for the very bad part. Eastwood's long time lover, Sandra Locke, was terribly disgusted as Jennifer Spencer, Harry's love affair. And Paul Drake was just awful like Mick. <br /> <br /> The movie would have been so much better if it wasn't for better writing and some parts. <br /> <br /> 8/10.
