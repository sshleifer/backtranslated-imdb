The only word summarizing this movie is weird. It's a light skirt through an existential concept. bouncy (more than one) and a little sweaty. I don't call it a big and memorable theater and it doesn't look as memorable as the director's first movie "cube" but it's a nice hole to watch on a Sunday morning. The acting is from respect to irritation at times, but I believe that is how it should be written. If a serious movie was done, it might have been good, or perhaps very good in a state of pretense. A bit like "the matrix" meets "head" meets "human nature". <br /> <br /> 6.8 out of ten
