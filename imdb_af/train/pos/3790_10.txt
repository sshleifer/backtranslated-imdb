I accidentally adjusted and sounded it on the independent movie channel. I am a professional actor and I was flabbergasted at the performances. They feel totally improvisational, absolutely without affections. I couldn't say whether it was written or how it was shot and waited until the end to see credits and then spent half an hour on the IMDb to find this movie. Do not miss it. I see that the writer-director also has a very fine movie called Everyday People that I really enjoyed. The shame of the movie business is that these excellent projects do not get the distribution and advertising they earn and live under the radar. This movie deserves great and proud. I encourage people to look and see it.
