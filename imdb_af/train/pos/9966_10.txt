I watched this movie when Mystery Science Theater ran it in 1993. This is the worst thing I've ever seen. So bad in the fact that this movie has to get a ten rating because it has to be seen as believed. <br /> <br /> Whoever had this script with children in mind should be beaten. I actually mean the devil vs santa? Visions of Hell? Creepy laughing reindeer? Armed child labor with racial stereotypes? It's not Sesame Street, it's for sure. When Crow exclaimed at the MST3K, showing: "It's a good oyster-shaped nightmare fuel!" <br /> <br /> There are many strange innuendo and theology screwed. Merlin (supposedly the Arthurian Merlin) hangs with Santa in his crazy castle in the clouds (ie Heaven). Christmas talks about baby Jesus and sends letters to mr. Stork for kids asking for brothers and sisters. There are symbols around the castle that either look like pentagrams or RAF stars. <br /> <br /> My best friend and I have been looking at it every year since 1993 and our topic is someone we can keep for 2 hours to see it with us.
