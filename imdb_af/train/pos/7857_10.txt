This film does not fail to engage and move, even in 2008 to an audience only familiar with modern over-produced audio and computer enhanced techniques. <br /> <br /> The experience of the filmmaker in 1922 who could only see it in a theater with others on their big screen must have been truly deep and a thoroughly satisfying experience. <br /> <br /> One should ask a film maker today to make a two-hour silent movie and make it interesting and have the same structure pace and balance as this movie. Silent film was purely art, it had to keep its attention through its structure, direction and acting. There was no filling of more words or computer-generated distractions. A poorly made or uninteresting silent movie is unwavering. <br /> <br /> This film should be placed in context for those who may be confused with the mention of Christian themes. It's not a 'Christian' movie, it doesn't sell anything. These themes, with reference to current moral standards, often appear in this era. The church on Sundays was also a national past. Christianity was a given in most households, so the film just shows the normal life as it was at that time. The themes would have been true and deep at the time. <br /> <br /> It is strange that strong support for good Christian thinking is given to this particular film (and it is not a religion for anyone, but the difference between hypocrites and the honest) that in 1922 A pastor condemned in an open debate with a representative of the film industry with a large crowd of Pickford as an example of immorality, along with other individuals he mentioned. NY Times 1922. <br /> <br /> Perhaps they had watched this movie that also came out in 1922 and learned some lessons. <br /> <br /> The Pastor complained that since the film industry began church. attendance dropped 500,000. However, the film representative in the debate made the following remarks; that salon attendance also dropped, that there were many more pastors in prison than actors (fact) and that the selection of a few examples from the very was not representative of the whole. <br /> <br /> There was a constant battle between the church and the film industry during the early days of the film. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie to be honest and true to family friends and willing to make sacrifices. Mary Pickford, naive, honest, feisty, full of happiness and joy, faithful, humorous and quiet sacrifice - though poor and uneducated, represents her the perfect character. However, it is not deposited in our throat, but is slightly revealed by the film. <br /> <br /> It is reminiscent of some modern Chinese films where characters slowly and gently appear in the course of a movie and this is the pace that creates a stronger connection with the character. <br /> <br /> It has a smooth pace for the first half that builds all the elements for the last section. The last 30 minutes is a good film production and it must be appreciated. This was achieved without the benefit of a good, running dialogue. It was achieved through good acting and good direction. It is sometimes surprising to realize that at the end of the film, you haven't heard a word spoken, but it feels like you've heard it all. <br /> <br /> The supporting role play has especially good performances, especially Gloria Hope, Jean Hersholt and Lloyd Hughes. <br /> <br /> The last few minutes are typical Pickford underestimated humor as she goes outside under the pretext of sweeping the snow, an almost perfect balance and end. This is a special kind of humor that should not be underestimated. Chaplin often used this device and copied it from Pickford. <br /> <br /> Another special observation about Silent films and especially Pickford movies is that the star often has to keep the camera for many of the movie without the audience being bored or bored, with the actors over-exposure. That Pickford is usually the focus of most of her movies, but people still can't get enough of her. She is proof of her fine acting ability.
