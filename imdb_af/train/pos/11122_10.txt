When we watched this series on cable, I had no idea how addictive it would be. Even if you hate a character, you hold back because they are so beautifully developed, you can almost understand why they respond to frustration, fear, greed or temptation as they do. It's almost as if the viewer is experiencing one of Christopher's learning curves. <br /> <br /> I can't understand why Adriana will show up with Christopher's abuse of her orally, physically and emotionally, but I just have to read The newspaper to see how many women can and do, tolerate it. Carmella has a dream home, an endless supply of expensive stuff, but I'm sure she'll give it to a loving and faithful man - or maybe not. That's why I look. <br /> <br /> No matter how many times you watch an episode, you can find something you've missed the first five times. We even look at episodes out of order (see season 1 late night with ads, but all the language, A & E with language sensed, reliving on the movie network) - when they are on, we're there. We are now completely spoiled. <br /> <br /> I also love the Malaprop's. "An Albacore around my neck" is my favorite of Johnny Boy. When these jewels have entered our family vocabulary, it is a sign that I have to find a life. I will when the series ends, and I have collected all the DVDs and put the collection in my will.
