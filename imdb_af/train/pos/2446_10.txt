From the start, Carmen was there. She was one of the best characters. Why did they get rid of her? The show is not the same as before. The road is worse. <br /> <br /> The best episodes were with Carmen in them. You can't replace anyone from the beginning! It's like South Park without Kyle or Child's Play without Chucky! It is not right! The cousin who replaced her is just! Awful. She doesn't fit in the storyline at all. She was one of the main characters, and the cousin couldn't replace her. She was a wonderful actress. Better than the cousin. Get her back or you will lose a TON viewer.
