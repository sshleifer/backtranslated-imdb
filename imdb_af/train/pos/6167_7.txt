"Such a Long Journey" is a well-crafted film, a good shoot, and a showcase for good performance. However, the story is such a jumble of subplots and peculiar characters that it becomes a kind of Jack of all plots and master of none. Also, Western audiences will probably find the esoterics of the rather dark Parsee culture a bit to get their arms in 1.7 hours. Recommended for those with an interest in India.
