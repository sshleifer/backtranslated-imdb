Roman Polanski leads this kind of variation on the same theme as Repulsion. I cannot imagine that there is one honest filmmaker who cannot recognize the fine director at Le Locataire, although both parts of the dyptic will not be thoroughly satisfactory for most people who included me. <br /> <br /> Polanski is very good at making us feel, is the inner torture of his characters (Deneuve in Repulsion and himself in Le Locataire), starting with a lack of self-assurance, soon to become psychologically unrest, which eventually comes to an irreversible physical malaise. The shared trial and audience trial is really different from the horror and horror of horror movies as there is no tangible supernatural element here. While horror films cater for a kind of catharsis (it is cheap or more extended), Polanski tortures us sadistically and if in his last opus the dark humor is permanent, we are mostly on our nerves rather than on the side of our seats. <br /> <br /> Suspension, horror, it's all about playing with audience expectations (alternative to deceiving and fulfilling it), not literally with people's nerves. In my book, Rosemary's Baby is a much bigger achievement because mere paranoia and simple rationality are in constant struggle: the story is about a couple moving in a strange apartment while being forced to identify with one character. What is more than the fantasy elements are all in the hero's mind, the situation is very uncomfortable, as we are obliged to view the viewers, to reject him while we lure ("paint a lure").
