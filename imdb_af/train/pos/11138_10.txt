Midnight Cowboy is not for everyone. It's raw, painful and realistic, but very entertaining. The lead actors Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman, who will be Oscar actors, deliver incredible performances. Voight as Texas hustler, Joe Buck, who migrates from small town Texas to New York City to become a hustler. He doesn't apologize for his chosen career, but it's not that easy. New York City women like the rich lady played by Georgeann Johnson and Cass nominated by Oscar are Sylvia Miles other than Texas women. Unfortunately, Buck is trying to escape his previous life in Texas. He was staged by his grandmother, Sally Buck, played by the wonderful actress Ruth White who died of cancer in 1969. The places in New York City are great to watch, because the relationship between Fatso played by Hoffman and Buck's characters develops into a moving male to male friendship. The men struggle to survive the New York City life by not playing the rules like getting a job. As the film develops, Buck's past comes to the surface and it's ghostly, but not clear. The movie is not for kids, but compared to today's movies and television programming, Midnight Cowboy can be more soft. I can't forget a young Brenda Vaccaro and a party you can't forget. It's also a tearjerker of a movie, so get your hankies too.
