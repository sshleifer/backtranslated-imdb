It has been so many years since I saw it, but I feel compelled to defend this jewel against those who lament it. <br /> <br /> It is interesting and unusual to see the disagreement here. That's what humor implies. It is subjective. It will load you through your funny leg at 60 000 volts or it will leave you cold and wonder why you gave it the time. <br /> <br /> This show has compiled Britain's best comic actors in a story that's stupid and disrespectful and the result is hilarious. The dialogue and visual comedy are beautifully delivered and the two leaders (Cleese and Lowe) are excellent together. It was made for them. <br /> <br /> I can't really say more than asking you to find and see it. You won't be disappointed and in a world without humorous humor, it's a classic, inexorable and harmless piece of comic shine.
