The Waiting Womans Ward of a large in-hospital, with all its joys and sorrows, is the place where LIFE STARTS. <br /> <br /> This almost forgotten drama is a fine little soap opera, full of comedy and tragedy. , all tied up in the lives of the maternity staff and their patients. The honesty with which the subject is handled indicates the film's pre-code status. <br /> <br /> Wonderful Aline MacMahon, as the sympathetic chief nurse, is the calm center of the movie, the rock to which all the streams flow. Able to deal with any crisis or distress, she is the mothers' best, sometimes last friend. Surrounding MacMahon is a gift of excellent costumes: Loretta Young as a convicted killer released long enough from prison to give birth; Eric Linden as her scared young man; buyer Glenda Farrell as a woman who hates children; sweet Clara Blandick as a very mature mother for her sixth birth; Preston Foster & Hale Hamilton as considerate, compassionate doctors and Frank McHugh as a comic, fiery father. <br /> <br /> Movie mavens recognize Bobs Watson as a woe to see the Stork; Paul Fix as a nervous man who promises to act like a small soldier; "Gilbert Roland as a disturbed Italian man and Elizabeth Patterson as a snooty doctor's wife interested in adopting Farrell's son - all unreasonable. <br /> <br /> There are some absurdities in the plot - some of the mothers are of course far too old; Farrell gets blatantly drunk in the ward, but none of the staff seem to care; A clear psychotic patient, in turn, may wander - but it only improves the film's odd entertainment and keeps it too serious.
