Maybe I'm a juice, but it's the best movies ever! I saw it for the first time when I was about 4 or 5, and I cried my eyes. Between now and now (embarrassment at the age of 15) I have seen it more than 25 times and sucked each one of them. Don't worry, they're tears of happiness! And it's not all the juice! There is also a lot of humor and comedy. Usually, the whole talking thing can be a big drag, but in this movie it is not. My only word of advice: Even if you like it, you shouldn't see the pursuit! I suggest everyone checks it out ... you won't be sorry, no matter how old or young you are!
