It's not a good movie, but I still like it. The cat Clovis is gold in a pot, as well as the appearance of the cats themselves - intrinsically opposed to the evil dragwalkers. I think there is more to this movie than people realize, basically it is very hard, but this hustle and bustle can sometimes be good. It has the weird lines, the sudden end and a comic element that is conveyed by the clumsy policemen. <br /> <br /> Did anyone find the incestuous element a bit upsetting? Eventually, this movie happens to be random and arbitrary. This is pretty effective. I compare it to Psycho - the relationship between mother and son, changing protagonists. I think the abruptness also works, it's not a movie you want them to prolong. It only works if it's short. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if the director has had depth, or whether he has done this. , just seen some of his movies. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I liked it. If you like hard choppy movies with 80's, you just see it. but don't expect too much. It's really that bad, it's good.
