I caught this movie on my local movie channel, and I rather enjoyed watching the movie. This has all the elements of a good teenage movie, and more - this film, apart from dealing with boys and girls relationships and sex and the like, also deals with the problem of steroid use by young people. <br /> <br /> The movie has that real feel for it - no loud music, no special effects and no outrageous scenes - which was right for this movie. That feeling makes it easy to relate to the characters in the movie - which we probably know where we live. <br /> <br /> Overall, a good movie, fun to watch. <br /> <br /> 8/10
