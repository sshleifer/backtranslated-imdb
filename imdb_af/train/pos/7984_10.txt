Man on fire is definitely one of the best drama / crime generators I've ever seen. Despite a slow start, the story is so surprisingly complex and sensitive that it stays together well. It is Denzel Washington's perfect role in which he plays a bodyguard called Creasy who has been tormented by his past and is an alcoholic, but never gives up his duty to save his latest protégé, Pita. Dakota Fanning plays Pita, the very smart, enthusiastic girl who loves so many things and acts in a very convincing manner, she has a good future ahead of her. As I said, the story is somewhat complicated, to fully understand it, you have to look at it a few times. <br /> <br /> This movie is made in two parts, there is the first hour, where everyone is happy. , nothing is wrong, everyone just lives their lives happy until the kidnapping of Pita takes place and where Creasy is almost killed. And then there is the second part, the rest of the film, after which everything suddenly becomes complicated and somewhat gruesome and disturbing, when Creasy recovered from his serious injury and began the numerous criminals and "La Hermamdad" responsible for the planning. , chase and kill. and execution of the kidnapping of Pita. <br /> <br /> Denzel Washington shows us his most up-to-date acting talents with many other talented actors who have a good future ahead of them. It is really a pity that this film has not been acknowledged enough, Washington really earned another Oscar for his performance, and so did Fanning and the director. And maybe even the visual effects that are of very high quality. <br /> <br /> If you like excellent, slightly confused tension teams, this is the one you can see. The most amazing thing is that elements of this movie are actually based on a true story and real characters! 10/10
