Much has been said on this movie and I would like to join those who praised it. It is a highly unique film that uses elements of different genres: drama, comedy, gangster film without making a mess of it. At points you just laugh out loud, at other points you feel the characters whose mistakes and failures you look at. Sabu's genius can be shown with respect to some rows of the movie. One is where all three men are chasing each other, having an erotic daydream about a young woman who just passed them on the street. This sequence is beautifully done and illustrates the characters of all three runners very well. It's at the same time erotic and funny. Another example of Sabu's genius is the part of the movie where the runners get tired. One of them, the typical loser among the three guys, hallucinates that the woman who left him for someone else is back and you see how they dance with each other and in the next shot he is dancing with himself deeply moving. All the runners come here where they think they have something back, or they are back on the right path. And on one part of the movie they stop each other, run in the line, just laugh. So here's all the beauty and ridicule of what we call life that Sabu can show throughout the film. His characters fail (do they end?) But he does not rob them of their dignity. "Monday" and "Postman Blues" claiming Sabu's claim to be a genius. Go see them! <br /> <br />
