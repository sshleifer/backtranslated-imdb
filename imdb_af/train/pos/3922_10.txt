Carmen is one of the best movies I've ever seen. It's hard to tell whose performance is the best: Antonio Gades, Cristina Hoyos and Laura del Sol are wonderful. They dance their souls out. It is a beautiful story of inseparability of life and myth; Myth penetrates everyday life. Dance becomes life and life is excelled. True people at one and the same time live their own lives and become someone else, acting on the parts of lovers of old. The magic is going on.
