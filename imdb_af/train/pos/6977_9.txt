I'm really addicted to Caprica because it's a very good prequel series for Battlestar Galactica. It really started a slow pace, but surely to pick up soon after new episodes remain airborne. <br /> <br /> I heard good things about future episodes and gas stars for the first season. <br /> <br /> This Sci Fi drama is sure to support us who love a mix of both genres. <br /> <br /> Eric Stoltz does a great job as well as Polly Walker as Clarice Willow !! <br /> <br /> Worth checking out! <br /> <br /> Catch Caprica on SYFY at 9pm on Fridays
