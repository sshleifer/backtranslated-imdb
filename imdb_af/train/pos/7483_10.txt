Vanilla Sky is a 2001 remake of the 1997 movie Abre Los Ojos (Open Your Eyes). And in my opinion, a much more human and emotional version. Tom Cruise plays David Aames, an egoistic egoism who takes other people's emotions for granted and only thinks of himself. Jason Lee plays Brian Shelby, David's best, and in many ways, just friend. Penelope Cruz plays Sofia Serrano, Brian's girlfriend who accompanies him at David's birthday party. Cameron Diaz plays Julie Gianni, David's occasional friend. Kurt Russell plays dr. Curtis McCabe, a psychologist interviewing David. All their interactions, and their effects, make Vanilla Sky one of the most emotional, and complex thrillers ever made. I won't explain the plot anymore, because it's much more compelling, the less you know. Ignore all people who call this movie too confusing to follow. If you pay attention, you will not be confused. The film is very complex but not confusing. And in my opinion, one of the best movies ever made.
