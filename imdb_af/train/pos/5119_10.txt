I just have to say, this is one of my favorite movies of all time. I can't even count the number of times I've seen. I was already in love with John Travolta, but the first time the camera had dried up his body after watching scabies, was beautiful for his first trip to Gilley's. I was in awe. Debra Winger, as always, delivers a perfect performance as Bud's young, naive wife, but with the necessary attitude to be married to a stubborn and hard-working cowboy. If you're not a country music person, what I wasn't, it's a soundtrack that you will sing right with every word. If you get a chance, please see this movie - it won't disappoint.
