Dominion tank police are making an exercise in conflicting film. The four-part storyline combines sensible action, flaccid humor, touching humanity, and thought-provoking philosophical questions. It is hard to believe that there was only one director, as the style of episode changed to episode. A must-see movie for everyone who loves anime.
