I dedicated myself to this because ABC apparently licensed this show to Pearl TV in Hong Kong. This is my surprise because it was a break to listen to everything from Chinese. But I started rolling in, as the cast and story lines are just NYC enough and considerate. Nothing too incredible, although I think it's very stereotypical to write Damien as a possible black man with a skin !!!! This was the most disappointing aspect. The rest is great and I'm sad to learn on IMDb that I can't look forward to season 2 when I return to America. I'm just as disappointed as the other commentators that show a lot of promise and quality and taste. But just as it shows that characters are approaching, it's probably harder for people to see if they start looking at several episodes. It seems a bit too late for the eager networks.
