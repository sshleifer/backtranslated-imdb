My God! Buttgereit's masterpiece is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Closer to Peter Greenaway and Jean-Luc Godard's movies, this one is really disturbing, but not gruesome like the Nekromantics. All the small stories have a deep philosophical interest and directing is quite inventive, despite the lack of money (see the sketch). Highly recommended!
