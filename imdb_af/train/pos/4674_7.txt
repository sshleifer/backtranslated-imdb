What percentage of movies does one make today to see what makes them wonder what happened to their eight to ten dollars? ANSWER: Too Much! This movie is not like that. This is a story about real people who sometimes combine both fun and unlikely. <br /> <br /> Upside down: <br /> <br /> Not enough character development and some plot lines twisted in the wind. <br /> <br /> Upside down: <br /> <br /> Power viewers need to think about the choices they made in their own lives. <br /> <br /> Well done by: Scott Cohen, Judd Hirsch, Susan Floyd, Ato Essandoh and Elliot Korte. <br /> <br /> Contains good happy humor.
