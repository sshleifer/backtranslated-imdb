"The Days" is a typical family drama with a little catch - you must relate to the character's emotions in every way, so you can truly appreciate the show. <br /> <br /> [Possible Spoilers For Those Who Are Unknown With The Show] <br /> <br /> The story, of course, for all the people who watched the show is the world of Cooper Day , the middle child of the family. He records his days with his family and hopes one day to become a rich and well-known writer because of his observations. His family includes a mother, a father, a perfect sister and a genius little brother. The first episode, which will sound a bit silly, as John Scott Shepard created this situation - both the sister and the mother became pregnant. That's the first situation the writer finds. Then the father leaves his job at the law firm. The youngest son gets a panic attack. The middle child gets a fight with the sister's boyfriend. It's all in a day's work. <br /> <br /> [/ Spoilers] <br /> <br /> I admire this show. I do not know. It's a bit crappy, but I like it. At first I thought the camera work was a ripoff, but then I used it and started enjoying it. I like the quiet conversations under a dark light. I like the intimate feel of the show. I like the low-budget style. I like the play. I admire the story. Then I find myself a second season of The Days. I slowly became a fan of it as the 6-episode broadcast on ABC came to an end. It's a very good performance and it's nothing like The OC. The two have nothing in common. So I hope fans will stop comparing them. <br /> <br /> And if you can call Abby, Jack, Natalie, Cooper or even Nate, you'll keep this show. Very.
