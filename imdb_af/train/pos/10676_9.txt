This film was shot in place at Gerard Gardens in Liverpool, and was the UK's answer to films like 'Blackboard Jungle'. The film stands the test of time very well, with all the moral stories that are still (or even more) relevant today. The film has some great achievements from some well-known British actors such as David McCallum, Stanley Baker, Peter Cushing and Anne Heywood. Baker plays a Liverpool policeman assigned to young liaison duties, assuming that if you catch the kids at an early age, they will eventually be responsible adults. <br /> <br /> Striking cameos in the movie include Freddie Starr (Fred Fowell) and Melvyn Hayes (Gloria). Tsai Chin and Michael Chow play brother and sister (they are the true brother and sister) trapped in a fire. Tsai Chin is still working and can be seen in the latest Nicole Kidman movie 'The Interpretor'. <br /> <br /> Great playground features a weapon siege in a school, and it won't be shown on TV, like similar events in Scotland / Russia. <br /> <br /> I just lived in Gerard Gardens where the movie was shot (although it was not born at the time) and had good memories of the area. I recently completed a documentary on Gerard Gardens, which includes excerpts from 'Great Playgrounds', and a small British movie 'Coast to Coast' featuring star Lenny Henry and Pete Postlewaite. The plays were demolished in 1987 and the films somehow live in memory. <br /> <br /> There were complaints from the residents when the film was released, as the film portrayed the area in a bad light. Time helped to heal the wounds. <br /> <br /> A small jewel of a movie, I would recommend you look for it
