If you're a fan, you'll probably enjoy it. If you don't know who Misty Mundae, Darian Caine, Ruby LaRocca, or Seduction Cinema is, it's not the movie to start with. It's very cute, stupid, the girls are hot, and it's nice to watch. There is no gender up until the end of the 45 minute movie, but the score is cheesy-trippy and the plot is not a total drill. Misty Mundae's makeup is bad in this movie and her hair is in awkward braids, so she's not as hot in it as she is in others. But her panties in this are very cute (you just have to watch the movie because it doesn't sound strange). If you like this one, you will probably enjoy "That 70's Girl", "Vampire Vixens" or "Erotic Survivor" (which is a bit more sexually graphical). If you prefer to watch Misty or Esmerelda in less sexual, more horror / exploitation-based (but lower-budget) movies, check out the Factory 2000 website.
