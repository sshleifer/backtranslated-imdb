Before I start, let me tell you how BIG this stand-up special sounds when you play Sonic Adventure I DX: Director's Cut at the same time (especially Red Mountain level). So while viewing this stand-up, I suggest - no, THEM you do it. <br /> <br /> Carlos Mencia takes his stand to the limit in San Francisco, California. There he makes fun of everyone with absolutely NO excuses. <br /> <br /> I thank God very much that Carlos didn't do his thing in which he used the same joke over and over and over and over and over again. He does a tremendous job that makes everyone fun and at the same time truthful; I know a few times I said, after Carlos joked, "Damn, this guy makes a good point!" And then the Game Over screen came over my TV because I forgot that I was playing Sonic Adventure I DX: Director's Cut. My bad :) So yes, there is nothing to complain about this stand-up special. If you have TiVo or something like that, please do yourself a favor and sign this historic hour.
