The opening of the film with a Bach Toccata is an obedience to what must be unfolded in this intense drama. All the compositional devices Bach persisted to keep his listener (and artist) intrigued and entertained apply to this movie. There is no mutual tenderness between the two main characters and the lead woman in the final scene I feel is justified in declaring that she was raped, even though her victim feels that she has been warned that he is a cad. Mamet explores the emotional divide and the differences between the sexes, but I feel he is unclear about how they actually compliment each other with a healthy sense of humor. If Mamet ever developed a healthy, humorous action on the interaction between the sexes, I wonder how this work would end? As it exists, it is very gloomy and temperate.
