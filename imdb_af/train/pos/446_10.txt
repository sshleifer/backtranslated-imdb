One of my all-time favorite movies, ever. Just beautiful, full of human emotion, white, humor, intelligence. The story grows, just like the lesson of life, just a wonderful movie in so many ways. <br /> <br /> The film is also fantasy ..... a great choice of the best British talent. I love them all for every diverse element brought into the movie. <br /> <br /> Italy must be one of the most romantic places to create a story like this - all about this movie. <br /> <br /> I love it :)
