First, I will be the first to admit that the scarecrow itself is a bit at the top. A scene less perhaps less acrobatic scarecrow would have made this movie much less cheesy. But overall, I think it's one of the better B-movies. Tiffany Shepis is absolutely wonderful, not to mention beautifully. Although this movie lacks the everyday nude factor, there are several other movies to see her. But here she gets all the evil, especially at the end as she moves away from the stuffed scarecrow. Richard Elfman also does a good job as a sheriff and as the drunken boyfriend. Yes, it's a low budget B movie. But from all that I've seen, it's definitely one of my top favorites.
