I didn't expect much to go into the movie, but I thought it was fantastic. Pierce Brosnan is outstanding in a very different role. He dumped and paid the slick Armani suits for a ridiculous look to show that he was an excellent actor. Pierce and Greg Kinnear are outstanding, making one of the best friend teams in a long time. The humor is dark, the performances by Brosnan, Kinnear and Hope Davis are wonderful. Mix it with a touch to the story of friendship and you have a good movie. It's probably one of the better buddy comedies in a long time. It's a movie that definitely shows that we can expect good things in the post-Bond era of Brosnan's career.
