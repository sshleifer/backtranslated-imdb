I love Sabrina! She's one of my fave shows !! My favorite episodes are; the one where she changes Libby into a geek, the first episode, the true love section and most of the rest of the first series. I think the college episodes were not as good as the high schools, but they were better than the last series that was terrible. Valerie was a good character because she was more rounded than Jenny, but Jenny was in some brilliant episodes. Hilda and Zelda were wonderful, and there was no explanation for where they went! Libby was also a good character. I never liked Morgan or Roxy, they just weren't as good as her other friends.
