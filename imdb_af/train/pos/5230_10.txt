Actually, I love this movie a lot. Not because it's plot, acting, jokes, no. I like it because it's one of the worse movies ever created. It's so lame, so bad, that it gets very funny. Some jokes are actually cool, but the rest make me pray for unemployment for the scriptwriter. "Men in white" are so stupid and stupid that you can only do two things. Turn off the TV or roll on the floor to laugh (beer helps a lot). I chose the second option.
