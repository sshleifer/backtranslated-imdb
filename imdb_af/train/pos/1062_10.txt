I think this show is definitely the biggest show. Jessica Alba does such a good job in it. Michael Weatherly also does a wonderful job as well as the rest of the cast. The show is very interesting and they have great storylines and their stunts are great. It's like watching a 1-hour movie. It's definitely worth watching.
