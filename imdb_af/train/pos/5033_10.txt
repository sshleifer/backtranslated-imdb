It is one of those movies that you will consider and return to after months of watching. The play is spectacular to die of two children (usually I hate movies with a bright child). Bill Paxton is wonderful, his director's debut is even better than I expected from an actor whose most memorable line is: "Game over, man! Game over!" (from the movie "Aliens"). <br /> <br /> The best part of the movie is the dichotomy between the scene where the actors play a family and when they do their work. It really makes the movie ridiculous and memorable. <br /> <br /> Keep it up, Bill. I'll wait for more movies I'm sure to love!
