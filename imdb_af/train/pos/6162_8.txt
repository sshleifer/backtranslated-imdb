I loved this masterpiece and frankly, I also became Mary Poppins (although I loved Julie Andrews and Dick VanDyke) became foolish and sanctified. Angela Lansbury plays her character to perfection and I don't know why people think of this movie as distorting. It was great and it was fun watching. Each scene had a certain charm because you got to know the characters better. You really see how this small joint family learns to connect with each other, despite their age and differences. I thought the characters were well developed, especially Charles who was at "The Age of Believing". Mary Poppins can be more popular and cherished by others, but this jeweler will be the one I will always love and cherish.
