am I the only one who has seen the relationship between camus discussion 'the myth of sisyphus' and mary's life? In the camus version, a man is condemned to spend his eternity with a huge rock so that he has to roll up a hill. Unfortunately, every time he reaches the top, the bowler crosses and ends again to start him. There might have been a buzzard poking his eyes, I don't know now. In the film Mary spent her life struggling to get her life together. Unfortunately counting every time she gets any foot, she drops everything and loses everything. In case, the party she throws where she gets drunk would violate her falafel lover, and is practically attacked by liev schrieber. If you question this theory, notice how this scene ends with her attempt to climb a flight of stars while books are nowhere to go, hampering her progress until she eventually passes. The next morning, when she wakes up, she is still on the stairs, which never reached the top.
