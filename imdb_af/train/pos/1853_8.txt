Well, this is another movie that plays with your sentiments and you come out softly as opposed to a rocky movie. But I am a sucker for the people, so I gave it a good score ... the acting was very good and there was a lot of feeling. The violence is kept to a minimum which makes a change. I would have given it a 9 if it wasn't for the greeting at the end! All in all, a good movie with very good actors. <br /> <br />
