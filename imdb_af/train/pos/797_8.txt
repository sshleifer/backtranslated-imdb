For those who didn't follow the Anne Marie Fahey Murder case. You miss one of the saddest, but complicated murders of all. The killer is popular Delaware lawyer, Tom Capano and the victim are Delaware governor's planning secretary, Anne Marie Fahey. Their relationship was a well-kept secret to her disappearance and murder. She wanted to leave him, but he didn't want to let her go so easily. On the other hand, he had a mistress and a wife and four daughters. Where did he get the time to have two mistresses and a household family life? In addition, the case is extremely complicated and fascinating for a four-hour mini-series. While the actress does me. Playing Fahey, doing a good job, she doesn't have her dark long hair. His other mistress is definitely more attractive than the real woman. Mark Harmon looks better and does an Emmy award-winning performance than Tom Capano. It will be better with real Delaware and Philadelphia places. With Ann Rule's executive produce, she adds accuracy to Anne Marie's distinctive organization and her personal struggle with eating disorder. This information may be overlooked by any other executive or director. If you haven't read the book, it's worth it. Ann Rule is a fascinating storyteller of true crime. It is ironic that Mark Harmon plays Tom Capano. He also played Ann Rule's former boyfriend and profession, Ted Bundy, in another book adaptation many years ago. He was then and now brilliant. He does an above average job with a wonderful story. Even President Clinton offered his help in the Anne Marie Fahey case. And now, former governor Tom Carper is now the United States Senator for Delaware who defeated long-time, well-established senator Richard Roth, in the November 2000 election. If you don't think the movie is interesting then read the rule's book.
