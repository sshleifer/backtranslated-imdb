Perhaps the biggest movie ever is about jazz. <br /> <br /> This is jazz. <br /> <br /> The opening shot continues to haunt me. <br /> <br /> Lester, of course, is wonderful and out of this world. <br /> <br /> Jo Jones is always a joy (see also the sound of jazz). <br /> <br /> If you can, find the music; It is available on CD. <br /> <br /> All the lovers of jazz and film noir should study this awesome jewel. <br /> <br /> What shadows and light - what music - what a hat!
