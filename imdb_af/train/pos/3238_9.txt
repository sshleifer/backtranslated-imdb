The Finnish version of Robert Altman's "Short Cuts", in the small rural town of Äänekoski. The episodes offer a kaleidoscope of the eternal events, problems and emotions of human life: joy and love, deception and disillusionment, hopelessness and death. I was particularly impressed with two episodes. The first is the story of the young waitress, who is trying to arouse a romance for his co-workers: she radiates an overwhelming joy of love and life. The other episode offers and the old man dies in a hospital and his wife tries to help him die with dignity. Particularly striking is the way in which the old couple must fight their way against the humiliating practices of the hospital and their loneliness as opposed to the hospital staff's routines (despite the signs of occasional empathy). Compared to Altman's classic, this movie may be less professional, but it is definitely a wonderful art.
