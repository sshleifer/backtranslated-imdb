I remember that this was the original airport in 1962 as a five or six year old and really enjoyed it. I recently had the opportunity to see it again for the first time since it was broadcast on Walt Disney Presents on the Disney Channel. I forgot most of it, and some were aimed at children, but it was still nice. I can't wait to show it to my cousin and cousins.
