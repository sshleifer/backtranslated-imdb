Well, good. Roeg got a little nervous there, didn't he? He was a genius while cataloging his abbreviations of his various characters for a few decades, but as soon as he had the bad taste to suggest that salvation (or even good advice) could be found in the bad old Catholic church, the hipper-as-you alternative movie crowd gets extra angry. Worse still, Theresa Russell's character - faced with experiences that have nothing in her so-called rationalist prospect, is reluctant to deal with these experiences on another level - that of the spiritual. You know, the rich of the ignorant and superstitious, the kind of thing that the cinephiles art house is supposed to be above. Oh, the horror ... So she finds her marriage - the idea that it can be a unique important dedication - confirmed by what seems uncomfortable like divine intervention. People who find this idea prima facie offensive may ask themselves why they instinctively jump into the attack mode to be challenged to take seriously the idea of ​​a spiritual dimension in their lives. But they probably won't. Sure, this movie has some problems, especially Talia Shire's delirious hamwork as the overwhelming nun, 1950s style clothes and all. And the dialogue between Marie Davenport and the young priest in their last scene is straight from the Spellbound School of Glib Interpretations (although Hitchcock's movie escapes similar charges due to the source of wisdom that had impeccably secular credentials as a Freudian psycho-analyst) . But, unfortunately, Nicolas Roeg seems to have bought a critical mauling query for even the possible answers this movie offers.
