While thinking of "The Great Escape", I allowed my thoughts to return from this childhood to this gem. I read and read the autobiographical novel from 1949, which inspired it, and when it came to the only theater (we never used that word) in the town that showed "foreign" films, I was first in line for to buy my ticket. <br /> <br /> When one educated in war cricket and propaganda films during World War II, I had a keen interest in investigating the realities of the conflict, as reflected in the memoirs and stories of men there was personal. . It expanded willingly later in the year to buy any book on the subject and eventually read the equally compelling novels of Hans Helmut Kirst and Erich Maria Remarque, which provided an even deeper sensibility. However, the movie performances were unlike this one because they rarely delivered the goods. <br /> <br /> The medium of black and white film has never been as well served as it was in those years. I've never seen a technicolor version of the war that looks like the authentic chiaroscuros of movies like "The Wooden Horse." If it is true that we are always destined to capture the images of our childhood, then I confess it freely. <br /> <br /> And there will never be another like Leo Genn as the emblematic British war hero on film. Not even Mr Alec.
