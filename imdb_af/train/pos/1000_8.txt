I like the movie. The action scenes were very interesting, tense and well done. I especially liked the opening scene that a semi-truck had in it. A very exciting action scene that did well. <br /> <br /> Some of the transition scenes have been filmed in interesting ways, such as photography, unusual colors or interesting angles. Also the movie is funny is several parts. I also liked how the evil man is portrayed. I'll give the movie an 8 out of 10.
