John Garfield plays a Navy blinded by a grenade while fighting on Guadalcanal and who has to learn to live with his disability. He has all the stereotypical concepts of blindness, and is sure he will be a burden to all. The hospital staff and his co-wounded Marines cannot come to him. His girlfriend also can't be played back at home by Eleanor Parker. He is stubborn and blinded by his own fears, self-pity and prejudices. It is a complex role that Garfield memorably performs in a good performance, which one observes in spite of the ever-current poignant melodrama. The best scenes are in Guadalcanal, where in a machine gun he tries to care for the prosperous Japanese soldiers in a bright night battle, and later a dream sequence in the hospital where he sees a train station with a white sugar cane. , dark glasses, and holding a tin cup, his girlfriend always walks back from the camera.
