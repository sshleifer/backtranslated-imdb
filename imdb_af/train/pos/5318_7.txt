Ida Lupino was one of the few women to break through the Hollywood ceiling ceiling under the studio system. Not surprisingly, she also tackled prototeminist themes that, when touched, were so comfortably touched that it was seldom clear about what was being spoken. In indignation, she deals with rape and its aftermath, and although known in the short film as "criminal assault," she once left no doubt about what happened. <br /> <br /> Mala Powers (in her official debut) plays a secretary accountant at a large industrial plant; She lives with her parents, but is busy with a swelling man (Robert Clarke), who just got a raise and now makes $ 90 a week. Leave the plant after working late one night, and she finds her trapped. In the subsequent scene ?? the best in the movie ?? she tries to escape her runner in a banning maze of buildings and streets, but fails. <br /> <br /> When she returns home, stunned and in shock, the police can't get much of her; She claims she never saw her attacker (who manages a snack truck outside the factory). To try to pretend that nothing happened, she returned to her job but fell apart and thought everyone was staring at her and judging her. She goes into a flight statement, runs to Los Angeles on a bus, but stumbles down at a resting place. <br /> <br /> Waking up in a strange mansion, she learns that she was rescued by Tod Andrews, a young minister in an agricultural company in California. She lays over her identity and takes a work pack of oranges. The two fall vaguely in love, but it is clear to Andrews that powers hold brave secrets. When she joins a picnic of a company, cracking Jerry Pary's skull, trying to steal a kiss, the truth comes from her past. <br /> <br /> It was a brave movie to come out in 1950, and it can explain and excuse some of its shortcomings. Lupino never repeats the damnation of the early assault scene, and the movie blows off in the bucolic and sentimental and ends with talkie and didactics. Yes, Lupino had important information to give, but she didn't trust the narrative to speak for herself. Throwing her, pleasant but gentle and generic, wasn't much help, either to return to melodramatic attitudes or home insurance. But Outrage was a breakthrough which is a route for later discourse on what the rape crime really is and what it really means to its victims.
