GOJOE is getting used to a little bit, but the final result is very satisfactory. The story, about a murderous samurai who wants to save him by resisting an equal but dangerous samurai, is worth more than a watch. There is much at stake here, from physical survival to soulful salvation. The movie may only look similar to another anime-inspired Samurai movie, but soon it will be buried in more mature / mature areas. <br /> <br /> Not to be missed. GOJOE is one of the better samurai movies to come to Kurosawa. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10 <br /> <br /> (go to www.nixflix.com for a more detailed overview of the movie and reviews of other foreign films)
