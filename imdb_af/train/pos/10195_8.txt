Joe Don Baker is one of a handful of actors who are often better than his material and are almost always appreciated. He is in a ton of movies, either as a heavy or a hero, and has the kind of strong, solid presence that Wallace Beery has done in front of him for half a century. Baker can deliver ridiculous sounds from another actor, and it's so good with him. He really looks what he says, no matter how clich√©, obvious or stupid, who puts him in a league with Tommy Lee Jones, Oliver Reed and Don Stroud. This is what the WALKING TALL Trilogy work has done so well, and the same magic is in FINAL LAW. It was a significant hit in the theaters and on video in the 80's, and it became much better than many of the better-known action lessons of the era. Moving the action from Texas to Europe, there is a real timeless quality that won't break you off-screen. To be honest, I've always enjoyed Greydon Clark's movies, which is a non-nonsense director of the same ace as the 1970s Clint Eastwood, and that's one of his best. FINAL CORRECTION is one of the lost jewels of the late 80's, similar to MAN ON FIRE in its true grains and violence. I think if they repeat it with The Rock, a whole new audience will love it as much as I do.
