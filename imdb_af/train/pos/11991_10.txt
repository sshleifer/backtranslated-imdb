Agh, Talespin! What can I say is not yet said about this great show? Nothing! This is without a doubt one of the most well-written shows I've ever experienced, live action or animation. The newer stuff is too much for my taste, and from the "mature" things I have to leave the room for children. But not Talespin. <br /> <br /> The stories are alluring and very plausible. Some of them can even be stretched for a movie even after an hour or two. Episodes like Stormy Weather and her chance to dream are very dramatic while still being enjoyable for kids and adults. Then there are the pure comedy episodes such as the Bluest of the Baloo Bloody and Stuck to you, where the emphasis is on hilarity. I can laugh in tears in a few choices myself. <br /> <br /> The drama aspect is much lacking in most performances nowadays (at least those not specifically targeted), especially in cartoons. For example, in the episode Stormy Weather, Kit Cloudkicker decides to join an air circus, but Baloo believes it will be too dangerous. In the biggest battle of the episode, Baloo shouts at Kit to stay away from Daring Dan, to which Kitskreeu: NO! You can't tell me what to do! YOU ARE NOT * * MY * * DAD *! "and burying his face in his pillow. The next day he leaves for the air circus. This kind of drama is a rarity in a cartoon, and will be very welcome in those created today. <br /> <br /> The characters have a lot of depth on them, Baloo is almost the way he is in The Jungle Book, plus or minus a few degrees of laziness, Rebecca is a sly businesswoman whose ideas to get money while in theory Rarely good in practice, Molly is a cute girl but you can't be fooled, sometimes she can be a real hellion, Kit Cloudkicker is a darker character than the rest, and he doesn't trust a lot of adults. Unless they are with him, and he has a tendency to break down relationships, look at his expression in Plunder and Lightning as he grabs the joking hook: he seems to be willing to put it right through a pirate. br /> <br /> In the end, it is the drama combined with the real chemistry between the characters making this show # 1 in my book. The relationship between Baloo and Kit is very real, almost dad and son. It is well demonstrated in All's Whale That Ends Whale when Baloo Kit's word assumes Seymour is abusing the animals in his aquarium rather than slanting with the other adults. Baloo and Becky's relationship is also realistic, as Baloo's motivation for work comes from buying the crop's duck, not necessarily a desire to help Rebecca. But something tells me that if he got the Duck back, he would still do work for Rebecca. <br /> <br /> To name not all the other planes in the series, the Sea Duck is fairly realistically designed. The aircraft's features don't even change throughout the range (continuity as it is also difficult to come by), and unlike most other "super levels" of other cartoons, it doesn't have one single weapon on board (unless you count mangoes!), rather rely on the cunning pilot's great skill to get out of trouble. It's hard to think of a hero vehicle that doesn't have a kind of gun turret, laser gun or even a handgun anywhere on board. And the fact that they use their heads to get out of trouble is so hard to find in a cartoon today. Plus it's just a darn cool design! <br /> <br /> It's definitely the best cartoon. Ever. Period. Definitely worth all ten stars!
