I watched this movie yesterday and I have to say it's the best horror movie made for $ 36,000 I've ever seen. (Sorry Steckler). The movie is definitely worth finding out if you are a zombie fan. This film series of soul and atmosphere. Some of the shots of the zombies are best ever dedicated to film. VERY messy, dusty, striped bodies look slow to their screaming victims. Brrrrrrr. <br /> <br /> Warm saggy Canadian women with sexy tits keep you from wearing the body of the body before the HORROR. This movie entertainment from start to finish. I couldn't ask for it anymore. My only complaint is that it was too short.
