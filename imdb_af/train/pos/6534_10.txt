I heard this movie was good from many of my friends who saw it, and they all said it was great, so I have very high expectations - and Nancy Drew exceeded the high expectations! It had funny parts, it entertained me with the action and all the dudes tried to kill her, and Emma Roberts was wonderful like Nancy Drew. The rest of the role play was also very good. I definitely recommend this movie !! <br /> <br /> Nancy: "I wonder why those guys are trying to kill us?!" Corky: "Yeah, I wondered too. Actually, it's crawling me!" <br /> <br /> Nancy: "I hate when people try to kill me. It's so rude!" <br /> <br /> ~ Nancy Drew
