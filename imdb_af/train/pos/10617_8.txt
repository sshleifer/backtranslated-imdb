Beautiful Barbara Bach plays Jennifer Fast, a television reporter traveling with her crew (Karen Lamm and Lois Young) to Solvang, California, to cover a Danish festival. The problem is that their homes have been flooded and all the hotels in the town are full. So they travel out of town to a remote location and take advantage of the hospitality of the seemingly friendly Ernest Keller (a phenomenal Sydney Lassick). If you don't want to know, Ernest and gentle partner Virginia (Lelia Goldoni) are hidden in their basement: pitiable, distorted, diaper-clad "Junior" (Stephen Furst, in a remarkable performance) who eventually terrorizes the girls. <br /> <br /> A wonderfully unhealthy Lassick plays the true monster in this disturbing little horror movie. It slowly but surely builds on an intense confrontation / climax, delivering the horror in small doses to the last half hour. The hotel and the premature cellar - great echoes of "Psycho" here - are good institutions. Mostly, the perverted plot involves incest and patricide, so the film can take a really dark quality. And yet it also touches on. We realize Junior is not one-dimensional evil boeyman, but just as a victim as the girls. The final shot is especially sad. <br /> <br /> "The Unseen" is a solid little horror movie worthy of discovering. <br /> <br /> 8/10
