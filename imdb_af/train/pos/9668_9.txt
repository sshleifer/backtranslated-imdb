It's a small movie, few characters, theater. And yet it says something about Ireland that you won't find elsewhere. This movie IS IRELAND. It's a pity, it's sad, it's self-deception. Boys, Master Doyle, SP O'Donell, The Cannon, Senator Doogan's daughter, Gar and above all Madge. I know them. I'm in the bar with them or kneel to pray with them. They are our sad history and they are our gift.
