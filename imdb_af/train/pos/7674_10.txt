I had the privilege of watching "Holly" last week at the Edinburgh Film Festival. What a powerful and moving story! Holly is a 12-year-old Vietnamese girl sold by her own family in prostitution and living in a brothel in Cambodia. Patrick (an American) comes to Holly's life and decides he wants to help her. When Holly is sold again, Patrick urgently looks for her. We follow they are difficult travel through Cambodia and hope for their reunification. <br /> <br /> Holly is one of millions of children who are sold and traded every day. The movie portrays this difficult issue without crossing the line. I walked away to know more about the issue of child trafficking and ask how can I help? This movie has to be seen by everyone, because it is a beautiful story and it poses a problem that we no longer have to ignore.
