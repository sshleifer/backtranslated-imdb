It's one of the first and best Columbos, with Robert Culp and Ray Milland. Robert Culp appeared on another Columbo, as well as several other villains, including Patrick McGoohan, William Shatner and Jack Cassidy. Ray Milland also made a later appearance. <br /> <br /> In this one, Ray Milland is convinced that his beautiful wife, Patricia Crowley played a relationship, and he hires Culp to investigate. Culp has a blackmail business on the side, so he gives Milland a false report and threatens Crowley with the right one if she doesn't pay. They get a big battle in Culp's house, and she is killed. Enter Columbo. <br /> <br /> Culp does everything he can to get Columbo off the ground, including offering him a job, but Columbo has been to him from the start. <br /> <br /> Excellent episode.
