I was fortunate to get a DVD copy of this movie recently and have seen it for the second time. The first time there was more than twenty years ago on late-night television in Australia, but I could never forget this strange and dark movie. <br /> <br /> Not many people like this movie because it is so unconventional - the fact that there is virtually no spoken dialogue in this move - we only hear the thoughts of characters - is just one unconventional aspect thereof. <br /> <br /> Looking for a copy of this movie I found out that the producer was dead, the main actor was dead, it was not held in any British TV or movie archive, that it never video or DVD has been released. These television networks around the world have destroyed it after their copyright broke out in the 80s. When it first appeared on television in Australia, there were no recordable devices for consumers. <br /> <br /> At the second glance, I recently saw why it was memorable. Sometimes it is very tense and unbearably claustrophobic, like a Harold Pinter play. <br /> <br /> Again, if anyone wants a DVD copy of this, send me an email and I'm sure we can work out something.
