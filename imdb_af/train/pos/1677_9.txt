La Coda Dello Scorpione (by case of Scorpio Tail) was the successor to Sergio Martino, director of the wonderful Giallo Strano vizio della Signora Wardh. This is the distinctive giallo, with all the aspects that the fans of the genre get to know and love. Twisted plot, beautiful girls, black gloves, sharp blades, and a little gore all come together to make a piece of Italian exploitation. <br /> <br /> A group of Gialli favorites, both in front of and behind the camera, work to make this one of the best non-Argento Gialli. There is the aforementioned Martino who adds his director as director, great Ernesto Gastaldi as author, Bruno Nicolai, who creates the music, and an army of giallo stars and stars like George Hilton, character actor Luigi Pistilli and the anita Strindberg. br /> <br /> With all this talent for it, does Scorpione deliver? You bet. The film works on different levels. It's an exciting murder mystery, a tense and violent horror movie, and an exciting thriller. All in all, one of the best Gialli. <br /> <br /> Martino definitely knows what fans want when it comes to Gialli. At some points in the film he almost looks Argento in his approach. For example, there is a direct rip-off of the scene in Bird With the Crystal Plumage where the killer tries to break through the door, which actually protrudes Argento's movie. <br /> <br /> Are there any problems with the movie? Hmmm ... just minors. First, any scenes that do not follow the murders or the emerging romance between the two begin. But just before you fall asleep, the killer will come out of nowhere and you'll be back in the swing of things. <br /> <br /> Also, at the end, the turn becomes a bit bizarre. I mean, for what purpose did the scorpions really serve? If you do not emphasize the dialogue, you can easily get lost with the winding tissue story. <br /> <br /> But these little jars are aside, La Coda Dello Scorpione is a tense, exciting, elegant and all-around entertaining movie for giallo fans.
