In his legal message, Denzel Washington takes a true story which is also a very difficult story and put it on the screen with an honesty that we expected from Washington's acting efforts, but now we see this touch as director. <br /> <br /> Recently, we have seen all the disastrous consequences of children who have been hit by the cracks of public protection. This story tells of a nightmare existence that causes terrible scars, but eventually presents the victory of the human spirit. <br /> <br /> We can choose the first attempts at too close close ups and not the best of editing these scenes, but the simplicity of other scenes that work out such power cannot be underestimated. <br /> <br /> If the academy explores this movie, it will be travesties. This film does not push and goes to the cold hard facts of the story with a purity that usually does not exceed a novel to the screen. This is, of course, a tribute to the Director. <br /> <br /> It's a dandy so go see it and tell your friends to see it too!
