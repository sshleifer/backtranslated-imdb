If the Lion King is a serious story about a young lion growing up to avenge his father's death, the Lion King is 1 and a half the opposite, full of speed and courage. The Lion King told the story of Simba's young lion. The one and a half are from Timone and Pumba's views, a less than perfect duo consisting of a meercat who left home because he couldn't dig tunnels without burying his grave. friends and neighbors and a warthog that has an odor problem. The movie is a bit short on substance, but Disney does a good job of filling time with various sketches that Timone and Pumbaa interpret when they watch the movie with us. My favorite is the sing-along that happens halfway through the movie, make sure you look at the reflections! Disney has advertised 1 and a half as "the rest of the story," even though it really isn't. It's just another perspective of The Lion King, without all the serious stuff that has penetrated most of the second half of the original Disney classic. Credit Nathan Lane as Timone and Ernie Sabella as Pumbaa for their voting, without their efforts, could not work the movie. The song, they entertained, and they let us laugh. They also give us a reason to avoid a warm bath with a warthog.
