Lisa is a hotel manager or owner and she gets on a flight to Miami. She ends up next to a killer, Jackson, telling her to kill a family or her father's room. The reason she needs to switch the room is because Jackson wants to blow it up. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie, because Lisa is trying several ways to try to escape this fold that Jackson has erected. The whole storyline is wonderful and I thought they could spend more time on the plane. There could be more to the plane, but unlike that, the whole movie was pretty good. <br /> <br /> I especially liked the end because it was heartbeat. I didn't know what was going to happen and I was amazed at it. For me, this movie just kicked off.
