There must be a subgenre in the Western called the "Robert Mitchum Western". Mitchum's brilliant, idiosyncratic, usually undervalued Western, introduces his film noir persona to urgently eat dark characters and brings an elegant worldly fatigue out of the films of Sam Peckinpah. 'Man with the gun' is one of his best. Directed by Orson Welles protege Richard Wilson, it is a sharp monochrome beauty, full of the cold silhouettes and frightening outbursts of cruel violence, as Mitchum fails a monopoly-torn town with a private army terror come late. Mitchum's regression of talkative stranger to abused murderer, with an army of dark emotions in between, is a wonder of expressive, physical acting.
