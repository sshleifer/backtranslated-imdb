I have to say that it wasn't very exciting, but talking about fashion and strange ways to solve a puzzle. A little too easy, Nancy Drew (Emma Roberts) uses IMDb ... it's fantastic! I really like that part of the movie ... However, Corky (Josh Flitter) is extremely hilarious ... and Ned Nickerson (Max Thieriot) was really hopeless ... he had been more angry with her for how she treated him has. <br /> <br /> Well, this movie is a tour and fashion in disguise. Anyway, I recommend this movie, just for summer fun. Encore Nancy, just for fun. More teenage spy movies by Emma Roberts .. Spymate ... remember? She gets well into this difficult research.
