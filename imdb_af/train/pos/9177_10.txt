I must say that this miniseries was the best interpretation of the beloved novel Jane Eyre. Both Dalton and Clarke are very credible like Rochester and Jane. I saw other versions but did not compare to this one. The best one for me. I never thought anyone else would ever play these characters again. The last time I saw it was in 1984 when I was only 13. Then I was a bookworm and I just read Charlotte Bronte's novel. I was totally enchanted by these miniseries and I don't miss any of the episodes. I want to see it again because it's so good. :-)
