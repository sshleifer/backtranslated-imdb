I loved the fact that this movie recognizes the intelligence of the viewer so that the layers of the characters can peel through their interactions with each other about the unspoken loss that each of them has affected. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is beautiful and is an inspired reflection of the vision of someone I believe is a highly talented new filmmaker with the maturity and artistic insight to tell a story that others with much more experience failed to reach. I see a bright future for this writer / producer / director who has the ability to focus on a goal and achieve it with integrity. <br /> <br /> Kudos for this achievement.
