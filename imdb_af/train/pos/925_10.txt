One word: suPURRRRb! I don't think I've seen such a thing on the network or cable television for so long. Watching this show was like taking in a fresh air in the TV schedule filled with reality shows and boring re-runs. <br /> <br /> I have to say I had my discussions. After all, critics were almost unanimous in crying the bugs and showing the show. But when half an hour was over (thanks, NBC, for the run of a commercial free show), I was left with the feeling of direct love, love at first glance, the true love one feels in his bowels . Everything about this show shouted excellence. <br /> <br /> Graphs in this show were at least as good as Nemo and Shrek. No small thing considering those movies took years to develop. <br /> <br /> Cast was great. I'm partially John Goodman's voice, but the rest of the team was definitely on par with John. Special mention: Lisa Kudrow's gas appearance. She was at risk of creating a neurotic, pudgy and sweet panda with a Jewish streak in her. (Panda from Brooklyn? Only in this show.) <br /> <br /> The writing was funny, with lots of inner and adult jokes that were sharp but not tough. A note for all parents: it is NOT for children. This show has never been advertised as such, and there is a reason why it was set up for 9am, not 8am. So if you want to complain about "offensive context", save your breath. Adults deserve a comedy just made for them, and Father of Pride is it. <br /> <br /> Not everything was perfect. I was a little confused by Siegfried and Roy's characters. Do I say "stereotype" when it comes to them? Yes, they are gay. Yes, they are flamboyant. Yes, they speak with German accent. But it's news yesterday. Give us something new, something fresh, something funny. Placing the old jokes in a new show is definitely the wrong approach. I understand that the creators of this show want to use the "star power" these guys have. It's good for me. But do not be tired of something everyone already knows heartily. Hopefully the rest of the show won't play the same and old record again. <br /> <br /> Overall, the show is definitely a Must-See TV. Funny, funny, with some unexpected twists here and there - there's not a comedy so good since Seinfeld. I'm definitely looking forward to the next episode.
