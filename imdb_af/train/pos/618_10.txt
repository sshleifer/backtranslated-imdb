This movie is great. <br /> <br /> I was "enchanted", I have to say and am amazed at how unique it is. The throw, the sequence, the effects ... everything! Pretty! I mean, it was a love story, yes, but what was outstanding from the rest was that it was told in an entertaining, healthy way. <br /> <br /> To me this is the representation of the modern fairy tale. . It's like the modern peter pan ... simply incredible <br /> <br /> I'll definitely buy a copy of this if it hits the market. <br /> <br /> This movie is really a double. one ... !!!! 10 stars for that!
