I can't remember much details about the show, but I remember how passionate I was about it and how determined I was not to miss any episodes. Unfortunately we didn't have a video recorder at the time, so I've never seen the series. However, I can strongly remember how I felt while watching it and how excited I was each time it went. Sam Waterstone was my favorite actor these days (I think I was almost in love) and he remains one of my favorite actors of the day, mostly due to his appearance in the series. I would like to buy / download / download this series, I think I will largely go to see it again and visit a childhood again. Any ideas? Does anyone know of a site dedicated to the series or the band's prints broadcast for the first time?
