David and Bathsba is an exuberant Hollywood biblical picture produced by Darryl F. Zanuck by Darryl F. Zanuck. Directed by Henry King and lead roles Gregory Peck (King David), Susan Hayward (Bathsheba), Raymond Massey (Nathan), Kieron Moore (Uriah) and Jayne Meadows (Michal). <br /> <br /> The film is based on the second Old Testament book of Samuel from the Bible. It follows King David, who killed the giant Goliath as a child, and now we find him in adult life as the second king of Israel. A hard and sure King, however, David has affairs of the heart that cause great problems. For one time he haunts Bathsheba with a shower, this is the beginning of a journey that includes adultery and betrayal; a journey that ends in the judgment of God addressed. <br /> <br /> Typically for the genre, David & Bathsbaa is a great, grand production. From its excellent set designs to the positive, brilliant Technicolor photography {Leon Shamroy}, it has plenty of quality to offer the best that the genre offers from production values. Untypically, tho, the movie is calm and trusts that 99% of its value is driven only by dialogue. It's not for action fans or anyone who needs a little swash to go with their buckles. This is a very humanistic picture, but let's not beat the burning bush here. It is a biblical love story that is stained with the sins of the heart. But it's not bad at all. Because it is broken down, we find it performed very well. (Peck has a stoic but vulnerable thing that goes really well, and Hayward pushes it to the maximum), and it's a fine story aimed at knowing skill by the often-forgotten Henry King. And although some of the dialogue is impossible, the character flow is never interrupted, as Phillip Dunne (The Ghost and Mrs. Muir) keeps Oscar nominated screenplay throughout. <br /> <br /> Sometimes a forgotten picture in terms of Biblical / Sword & Sandal genres (probably because it's a talky piece that has the heart as its main point of sale), but it's really worth it The time of anyone interested in the most cute genres is worth it. 10/07
