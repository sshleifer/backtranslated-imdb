No Strings Attached is one of Carlos Mencia's best shows to date. Mencia is known for poking and making fun of racial issues. However, he does more than this in San Francisco's stand-up performance. Generally, Mencia's material not only makes you laugh but it also reminds you of what is really wrong with society. <br /> <br /> In this hour-long show, Mencia talks about things like illegal immigration, which women really mean when they ask for equality in the workplace, terrorism, his opinion on Mel Gibson's Passion of Christ and an argument that He deals with a woman about whether he is affected by Jesus and how society should treat those who are physically or mentally disabled. Mencia even discusses whether one should have the right to speak and tell a joke. <br /> <br /> Carlos Mencia is not afraid to offend, often having trouble with his critics. For example, he does a little (and he admits) a little joke about Pope John Paul II and what he is most likely to do in heaven now. <br /> <br /> Mencia's main message in all his performances is that we all have a voice and that we should use that voice to speak what we feel and not be afraid to insult. He reminds us that we have the right to freedom of speech and that we should use this right as Americans. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy this show, I definitely recommend watching Mind of Mencia, his performance on Comedy Central.
