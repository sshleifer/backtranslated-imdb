Jeopardy has the feeling of being a stock movie of all kinds - one of the movies that the studios pumped between the big budget / box office. It's just 70 minutes and doesn't contain many sets, and the only star is Barbara Stanwyck. But what a star of course. <br /> <br /> Stanwyck is again a tough lady as she walks in an escaped offender looking for help for her trapped man in the Mexican desert. The majority of the movie is focused on how she deals with her prisoner, who wants her to hand in for his help in return. Some psychological struggle there. <br /> <br /> It's a surprisingly effective little movie - its short length makes it stiff, and Stanwyck is great without talking (but I'll still praise her every time).
