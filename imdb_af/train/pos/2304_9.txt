I thought this movie was done very well. In the mid-1950s, everything looked straight. It was well thrown and credible. I don't usually care much about this type of movie, because they have no depth, but I have buried this movie to the characters and you could feel them, you really need to know them and care for them. It brought me back to my youth and reminds me of a more innocent time. This film can be enjoyed by both male and female and all age groups. After the movie was over, I wanted a part two. I wanted to know what happened to Dani and her family. This movie is bound to be a classic. If you haven't seen it, try to catch it when it's on TV or rent it ...
