I saw this movie in 1969 when it was first released in the Cameo Theater on South Beach, now the famous Crowbar Nightclub. It was the last year of the wild 60's and this movie really hit home. It has everything; the gender gap, the sexual revolution, the search for success and the conflict between the following family traditions and those trying to find their way through life. <br /> <br /> It was a fast, highly enjoyable movie. Las Vegas was on the hippie peak, Sin City in all its glory. Beautiful women, famous cameos, laughs, conflict, romance, and even a happy ending. A very enjoyable time about everything. <br /> <br /> The poster of this movie rests on my bedroom wall. I look at it and I go back in time; a time of my youth and my times with my dad, a wonderful time in my life.
