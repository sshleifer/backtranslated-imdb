New York City hosts a man above all others, the possibly immortal dr. Anton Mordrid. Mordrid is the sworn protector of mankind and uses his magical powers to hold his brother and rival, Kabal, so that he cannot add to humanity. Well, wouldn't you know? A prophecy is true and Kabal breaks free and starts collecting elements (including platinum and uranium) for his alchemy experiments. With the help of a policewoman named Sam, can Mordrid defeat his evil brother? "Dr Mordrid" comes to me with the grace of Charles Band in the full moon archive collection. I didn't hear it, which is a bit strange because I'm a big fan of Jeffrey Combs (Mordrid) and the movie isn't that old. But now it's mine and I can enjoy it again and again. The movie is definitely fun in the classic Full Moon style. Richard Band offers the music (which is no different from all his other scores) and Brian Thompson plays the evil Kabal. We even have animated legs! What else do you want? Of course, the cheese factor is high. I felt a lot of the movie was a rip-off of the Dr Strange comics. And the blue pantsuit was stupid. And plot holes are everywhere (I can list at least five, but why bother). And why does the ancient symbol of Mordrid and Kabal look suspicious like a hammer and sickle? Combinations have never been a strong actor, so he fits in the cheese. These are not complaints. Full Moon fans expected these things and devoured them like a cut grape note. I'm guilty ... I loved this movie. <br /> <br /> If you're not a Full Moon fan, or a Jeffrey Combs fan ... you might want to look elsewhere. But if you like the style of movie making and hairstyles from the early 1990s, you'll eat it. Stallone and Schwarzenegger fans would like to see Brian Thompson as a villain, as always, and cannot translate English beyond a third-year level. I have. I wish there was a "Mordrid II", but the company that made a sequel to almost everything (was "Gingerdead Man 3" really needed?) Passed on this one.
