It was a favorite Christmas special I wish they would release on VHS or DVD, as my 33 RPM was lost, and any cassettes I made are also over. <br /> <br /> I'm not even a big John not Denver fan, but was very impressed with the music, which was mostly traditional favorites with a muppet spin (especially Little St. Nick!) It also includes " some small familiar songs (original?). Although it was done at the end of the 70's and it had a timeless feel. I hope to find a copy soon!
