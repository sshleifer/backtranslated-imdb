This movie starts with a family all in different directions and their teenage daughter, Martha MacIssac (Olivia Dunne), was very much in love with Joe MacLeod, (Zack). The mother is played by Mitzi Kapture, (Jill Dunne) who suddenly enters her daughter and makes up Zack and it seems that all sorts of problems are on the surface. Jill Dunne has a man who is always traveling or staying away from home. There are also major issues that occur when the family decides to go on a camping trip, which does not like their daughter Olivia and just can't sleep outside and requires a tent to stop all the mistakes. Olivia is doing an excellent performance in many ways as teenager and Nick Mancuso (Richard Grant) play a major supporting role as a hotel owner. This movie will tell you how it will end and you'll enjoy a movie full of horror and terror. enjoy
