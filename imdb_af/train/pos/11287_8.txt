As noted by other reviewers, it is one of the best Tarzan movies. Unlike others, however, I like the beginning of the movie as it feels like a pretty accurate portrayal of what a trading post should have been. Plus the exposition is needed so we know why Harry wants to go back into the jungle. In addition, the beginning of the film contains one of the most exciting and frightening pursuits ever made. This happens when Harry's safari group passes a tribe of cannibals. The values ​​of the pre-censorship add a lot of realism, which really portrays the terrible dangers that the Europeans expected to go into the jungle. The film also provides an accurate account of how frightening the native Africans were treated by their white employers. In addition, sexy Jane, thousands of elephants, have some great sets and two chetas! Not an adventure classically missed.
