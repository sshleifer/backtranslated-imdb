The only show I've seen since 90210! Why did they stop it? It was the only show that captured the essence of Hawaii and made you feel like you're part of everything! The least they have to do is release it on DVD! <br /> <br /> I've reviewed similar shows, but nothing came close. The cast has incredible chemistry and I looked forward to every episode with great anticipation. <br /> <br /> They made a big mistake by pulling that show. If someone has information about where to find a DVD from North Shore, please send us some rules here. Thank you! Aloha!
