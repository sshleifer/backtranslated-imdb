I spent years copying this movie (16mm, dvd, vhs) so I could show it to my kids. The movie is funny, and Spike and his band members show why they were the best musicians in the business. They had to be so good at playing those dementes. I like it and recommend it for movie lovers of all ages. <br /> <br /> The film is about a firearm of the ages, with a crew member who is a firefighter and department (when they don't fight the fires). There are the usual runners, plus the hairstyle of Spike Jones and his band. Also comedy lighting by comedian Buddy Hackett and straight man Hugh O'Brien.
