For the first time a few days ago I only saw "Of Human Bondage" and WOW! What a mysterious and almost haunting movie. I loved how the music went with the pace of every step of Philip's feet. It gave me some cold fever for one reason or another ... <br /> <br /> One of the most important aspects of this movie is that you will soon see Bette Davis in front of your eyes. She is wonderful, not necessarily because it is her best job, but because it was so commonplace in 1934 to be so ominous, eager and unshakable. Bette was a risk-taker who always wants to be different and it goes well with her realizing that she can be as dirty and daring as she wants and people will love her. If you're a true lover of the movie, it's great to see ... <br /> <br /> She just had a way to make a line that made the movie and the movie for the case belongs to her. Like a lot of music and fire. It's me ... an old kazoo and some sparklers "or" But you're Blanche, you're in that chair! "or with my whole heart, I still love the man I killed!" It's from some of her movies, but you get my drift. She was just as brave, gentle and exotic with those beautiful big eyes. After I saw it, I can't believe it was repeated twice. <br /> <br /> Leslie Howard was beautiful ... so calm and persistent, to love. I thought he was rich and couldn't understand how everyone didn't fall for him, but then everyone was ... except Mildred. He did a good job. <br /> <br /> The only thing I didn't like was something that was common to early-stage writing. They will make a character so hateful that it is almost incredible that someone will fall in the first place for them. The performances were wonderful, but Philip would never be interested in Mildred. It's just the simple truth ... See it !!
