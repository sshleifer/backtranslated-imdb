this movie is absolutely hilarious. Basically, the plot revolves around a serial killer somehow turning into a snowman through a B-movie chemical accident. He then heads the town and begins to terrorize the residents. It is up to the local police chief and a few other characters to stop him. It's made on a good budget and it certainly shows, but the big thing about this movie is that it knows it's garbage. The improvisations of Styrofoam and polystyrene mimicking the giant killer snowman are classic, and this is clearly the intention - this is one of the few films that has its budget as its main selling point. Besides the comic tackiness, there are still some great comedy moments. Listen straight in the beginning to the voice of a father killing his children, and the funniest rape scene ever dedicated to film. fantastic tough fun
