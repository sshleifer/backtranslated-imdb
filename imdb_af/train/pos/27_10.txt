Emilio Miraglio's "The Red Queen Kills Seven Times" (1972) is about the most perfect example of a giallo I've ever seen, interfering with all the necessary elements in a sinister stove. First of all, and of the utmost importance to me, it has a complex, winding plot that ultimately makes perfect sense, and the murderer here does not come from the far left. The story, relating to a series of horrific murders (you already know how much of the movie's title, right?) That occurs in the apparent fulfillment of an ancient prophecy over two sisters, is an involvement and the murderer, a Red-faced figure with the insane laugh of a malwoman, is frightening and memorable. Every big giallo needs nice actresses, and here we have quite an assortment, led by the ridiculously beautiful Barbara Bouchet as one of the two sisters, and in one of her earlier roles, Sybil Danning, as a hilarious bump in Barbara's fashion house. Another essential ingredient of a superior giallo is an exciting, hummable score, and Bruno Nicolai offers one for this movie that has to stay with you for days. Beautiful scenery? Look again. Filmed largely in WÃ¼rzburg, Germany, the picture is indeed a surprise to the eye. OK, okay, but what about those murders? After all, that's not what Gialli is about? Well, I am happy to report that most viewers should be well pleased with the various knots, shootings, impalements and other massacres that this movie tastefully ... to not call the crypts, freaky dream sequence, rats and bats (and many of them too!), the drug references, a rape scene, the mandatory red herring and, in the person of Ugo Pagliai, a brave leading man for the female viewers. As I said, a perfect giallo. And even better, this DVD is from the fine people at No Shame, and you know what it means: a great print and lots of extras, to get started! Thanks guys!
