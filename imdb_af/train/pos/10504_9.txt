Or at least one of the best. I think it's a very fun and very cool game for the N64. Bowser is on his usual shenanigans (yes it's a stupid word, but the only one I can think of) and Mario has to stop him again. This game is great fun to play, and contains a lot of nostalgia for me. The only bad thing about this is the graphics that are terrible for today's standards, but everything is pretty good (especially the small mini games you can unlock). This is the second best N64 game (the first best is Conker's Bad Fur Day) that I recommend to any Mario fan or any platform game fan. This saves any mediocre Super Mario Sunshine. <br /> <br /> 9/10 of: A
