Okay, I'll confess. This is the movie that made me do what Michael Keaton could do. He does a beautiful parody of someone who does a parody of James Cagney, with charm to save. <br /> <br /> The supporting role players are solid workers all and will act upright and do a good job in this 80's comedy. . A spout of the '30s' 40 gangster movies, constantly breaking new ground, with remarkable original material. (Well, yes - it has already been copied from the copy - but when this movie was made, it was original, and many were not copied elsewhere.) Watch Joe Piscopo warn people not to do ______, with one of them great spoofs taglines. Watch Roman Moronie do things with English profanity that will make your spider's grammar teacher laugh. See incredible siggats, such as the pet store owner Johnny Kelly, who uses the price tag pistol on his puppies and pours out his kittens. Look at the biggest "sex warning" educational movie ever made. Look at the most wonderful misrepresentation of the Latin church that has been done, while a man who never took a shopping class meets a Thompson machine gun from parts. See lines that you will use in accidental conversation for the next decade. Watch Maureen Stapleton does the perfect antithesis for the hard-working mother, with surprising gags you'll never see. <br /> <br /> If you see a ghost that doesn't hit your leg, be patient - another will come in 30 seconds or less, and chances are you'll have to break until you're done roll on the floor several times. Duckies and Bunnies? They too. Look at the subtle things - some of the siggats can see the first few views unnoticed. <br /> <br /> There are some slight flaws - but it's probably the best of the spoofs. Some come close but none of them are pretty good.
