"Elvira, Mistress Of The Dark" is a kind of "Harper Valley P.T.A." with the touch of the supernatural. Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) leaves her job as a television horror movie hostess after the owner of the new station has become fresh. She now relies on a Las Vegas show to carry her through, but learns that she needs to get more money to start the show. Things seem hopeless to raise that money until she notices her aunt's death, which Elvira then takes to Massachusetts for reading the will. A home that needs repairs, a dog and a cookbook is all that her aunt is left to her. And again, it looks like Elvira is having trouble with the money for the Las Vegas show. The adults of the small and meticulous town make things worse by making Elvira harder. Only local hunger (Daniel Greene) and a group of teenagers will befriend her. Elvira's uncle Vinnie (W. Morgan Sheppard) is pushing to make an agreement with Elvira for the cookbook, but Elvira soon learns about her powerful heritage that includes spellcasting, and some very effective pickups. Elvira no longer wants to sell her cookbook to her uncle, but he is determined to get his hands up. Elvira is at stake on the town's old witchcraft charge, and the performance between her and her uncle. The plot is pretty simple, but the humor and well-developed characters keep it on a good fit. "Elvira, Mistress Of The Dark" is full of cute, cheeky, bawdy and clever humor performed by the many siggats, words, props, songs and parodies. The film's touch of the occult makes this one of the best horror parodies ever made. It is a well-made movie with great performances by all artists; including Edie McClurg and Jeff Conaway (from "Grease.") There are also good special effects. Many people (including myself) wondered if the Elvira character could carry a feature film, and the answer is wonderful, YES!
