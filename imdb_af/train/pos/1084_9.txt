Musings: Pure delight from beginning to end. Not a lower riot, but a more subtle, sophisticated sense of humor. What a gold mine of great scenes and character actors, including Reginald Denny, Nestor Paiva, Ian Wolfe, Harry Shannon and Jason Robards Sr. <br /> <br /> Cary Grant was framed at the building of his new home, which was at that time. A young carpenter, played by future Tarzan Lex Barker, asks him if he wants her to be "paid out", or something that a carpenter would know. Grant, not wanting to appear ignorant, replies in the affirmative. Then Barker shouted to his friends, "OK boys, he wants to spoil a little, so .... YANK 'EM OUT!" A few times you hear the ripe and tearing sounds of about 20 large nails drawn from various boards. All Grant can do is moan. <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie is dated. You will never see many carpenters working on a single family home immediately, and a place like that in Connecticut from all places will probably be a few million dollars. <br /> <br /> A classic movie that really is a treasure.
