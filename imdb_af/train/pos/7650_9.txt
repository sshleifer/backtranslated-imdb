Wow, I loved this movie. It may not have had the funding and advertising that the latest Hollywood blockbusters get, but it takes twice the emotional punch. The story revolves around this one family from Utah and these are the connections between the people in the family who give the film its punch. The chief (Giovanni Ribisi) plays his role very well, he doesn't allow you to believe he's acting all his feelings. It's his brother (Elias Koteas) who stole the show for me. When the two were in scenes, they squashed their lines and delivered fantastic performances. Great role, good movie.
