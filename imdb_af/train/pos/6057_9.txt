Sure, because it's super image and fantastic sound, it's a great home screen show-out disc, but it's also a touch drama as well as an informative documentary. The parallel stories interwoven throughout this movie interest all viewers. Young, old, boys and girls will find it deep, we are all fans of the car, especially the high performance indie machines that result from blood, sweat, tears, ingenuity and perseverance. The Mark Knopfler and Ry Cooder soundtrack fits perfectly with the footage and content. I don't want to end, but the final drive to Quincy Jones's "Days Like These" can only bring a tear to your eye. Enjoy it!
