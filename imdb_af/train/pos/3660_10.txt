This obscure de Sica supplies the goods. And it is said, "The meek shall inherit the earth." This story of classes on the surface, but really an allegory for all the homeless people that populated Europe after the great war. They are homeless but cheerful, in an association that is too poor and selfish to care or acknowledge, footprints for Italian carpetbaggers. De Sica chooses to tell it as a fairy tale, a Cinderella story. I didn't read the book on which it was based, so I can't predict if the deus ex machina is the author of Vittorio. It starts with the words, "One day ..." to illustrate the timelessness of his story, because the story can be set anywhere and everywhere. Caricature sketches of the aristocracy being cut, the whimsical nature of the homeless, especially when they start giving their wishes and ending directly from a Spielberg picture, make this boulange a pleasure for everyone. De Sica's most accessible photo is also one of its best. He has a film that breaks the heart and at the same time filled with the desire of hope that one should remain in this world. Gracias Vittorio! Gracias! Gracias !!! Gracias !!!!!!!!!!!!
