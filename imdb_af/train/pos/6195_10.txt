Having seen this movie months ago, it remains in my mind again and I feel I should buy it or at least see it again, although I watched it at least 3 times when I rented it at that time. <br /> <br /> I fell in love with Hal Hartley's direction many years ago - I found that these movies can make me laugh at a place that is rarely entertained. This is a strange feeling given, and I suppose most people out there really just don't get it, or it makes them confused and somewhat uncomfortable - I think I really get it - it's like these movies made me is. <br /> <br /> Although I don't remember laughing aloud during this movie, it remains one of the funniest movies I've seen in many years. If you don't see the humor of the grocery store, Fay goes down the street to a church, to her brother's publisher's office, to her son's principal's office, then you can miss the intelligence to be highly impressed by this film. The bag is a silent character in itself, dragged as an icon of motherhood. The usually bitter, bitter Parker Posey has to carry before the international plot of the rest of the film clings to her. <br /> <br /> I consider "Henry Fool" my least favorite of Hartley's movies. I really don't remember it honestly - I think the character itself was so despicable that I found it boring. Hartley's forts seem to be female character development. <br /> <br /> Apart from Posey's brilliance, it was great to see Elina Lowensohn, one of my favorite actresses again. Her exorbitant naive is perfect for Hartley's direction. His ability to help the exuberant looks banal defines his style as a delightful chronic irony throughout. <br /> <br /> This film breaks out into a highly relevant international plot, explaining political situations in Afghanistan. It is never suspected at first. The complexity of this film's development is unmatched. <br /> <br /> This is the symbol of a "stand-alone" successor. The less you know about Henry Fool, the more mystery he gets, the less you expect his appearance to the end of the film - as an alcoholic chain-dressing machine, putting insults on his Islamic terrorist who puts him on respect somehow. This is actually a 12-year-old school bully. Although I was very impressed and satisfied with Hartley's other recent films, "The Girl from Monday" and "No Such Thing", "Fay Grim" goes far beyond what I expected, with a sense of humor and originality, who will never risk an Oscar winner.
