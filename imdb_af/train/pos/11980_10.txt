Full House was and still is a good show. It's a great show for people of all ages and is also a good family program. There really aren't any shows like that. The kids are very cute and although it is a little cheese, it is still good, especially for everyone who watched it when they were a child. I would like to see the conversation now. Anyone who would like to see the movie interviews, similar to a true thing they are now about for the special features of the DVD, should go to the Petisie spot site and sign a petition entitled Full House Reunion on DVD, as there is a petition for this in the hope that the cast might want to. Yay for the full house!
