Brilliant film, the next best film by The Drunken Master (Jackie Chan). I recently bought it on an original VHS and I haven't seen this movie for 15 years, but still as good as it was. The acting was terrible and the dubbing was even worse, but these are the features that make this movie (and many other old-fashioned Chinese kung-fu movies). The choreography is wonderful and the storyline is basic. I've never seen the 36th room of Shaolin, but know it's the same movie, but Gordon Liu plays San Te but San Te in Thr Back to the 36th room is played by a different character. It has a lot of comedy value and brilliant kung-fu.
