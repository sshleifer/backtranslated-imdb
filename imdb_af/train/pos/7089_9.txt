Without a doubt, 12 MONKEYS is one of the best films by Sci-fi genre and director Terry Gilliam is not a stranger to pulling out such original films. An apocalyptic movie that you have completely played, 12 MONKEYS never leaves and has guessed you all the time. Excellent use of Philadelphia locals and netherworld sets creates a gothic sense of tragedy and two people are caught in the wrong place in time. <br /> <br /> Bruce Willis escapes his macho image and portrays a true loony from what is right all that will happen. He is really wise, but the people of the future (or present if you like) distort the man's head so badly through time travel, no wonder he is disrupted. He is sent to World War I just after being sent to the wrong year to find out how the Army of the Twelve Monkeys is declining civilization as we know it. They get it right, and in what is really a remarkable script to fit the show, we see Willis, Madeleine Stowe and an ominous Brad Pitt who has been crossing over the past 6 years. <br /> <br /> Stoves are sensual and solid as the risk contraction that slowly begins to realize that Willis can't be as cracked as it looks. A fascinating element of the relationship between her and Willis is their sense of anticipation, at a different place or time. 12 MONKEYS is essentially about time and the madness that the futuristic people immerse and the times of the present, when killers and a psychotic genius can change the world. <br /> <br /> The emerging city of Philadelphia is a dark and gothic backdrop for Willis's fate to complete his mission that will NOT save the world from all Hollywood stereotypes. He collects information. The movie also plays tricks on the viewer, placing Willis in a new environment at the drop of a pen. It had to have been a very difficult picture to make, but Gilliam looked the master of hard-boiled movies. He even falls into some humor reminiscent of other great works such as TIME BANDITS, and BRAZIL. The screen is this man's canvas and he knows how to paint a sometimes frightening picture of the world and its possible future within the mainstream atmosphere of big-budget movies. If you want sincere madness and ironic tragedy, see 12 MONKEYS. <br /> <br /> RATING: 9 or 10
