This is one of the best movies of 2002. Maybe it's not the best movie, but it looks the best, has a good play and is perfectly directed by Sam Mendes, who made debut with 'American Beauty'. <br /> <br /> It tells the story of a gangster named Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) seen by his son (Tyler Hoechlin) at one of his jobs. John Rooney's (Paul Newman) boss John Rooney thinks it will be good, but his jealous son, Connor Rooney (Daniel Craig), raises his father and Michael, who are killing Michael's wife ( Jennifer Jason Leigh and the second boy lead. Michael thinks Rooney is responsible and Rooney must choose for himself and send a hit Harlen Maguire (Jude Law) to complete the job. As Michael is a respected man in the organization, he tries to win friends who can help him, including master boss Frank Nitti (Stanley Tucci). <br /> <br /> In a way, 'Road to Perdition' is a standard gangster movie but it's so well made you can't see it. This movie is good in its production design, art direction, sound, music and especially in its cinematography. All of these elements can surprise and create tension, although the outcome is quite certain. That Hoechlin is not an annoying child, and Hanks, Law and Newman know how to act. Helping on a comic book this movie is so much better than you would expect and although it has errors. It belongs to the better movies in the genre. Sometimes there are events where you realize you've seen it so many times before, but for some reason it feels fresh at the same time. The screens between the adult Hanks and the child Hoechlin help in that area. See this movie that will sometimes look familiar but is completely new to many areas.
