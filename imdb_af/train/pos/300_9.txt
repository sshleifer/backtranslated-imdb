With several Bogdanoviches and Gazzaras spread by the cast and crew "They all laughed" is very much a family relationship. If you add that B.Gazzara and me. A.Hepburn had a short but passionate relationship in an earlier picture, it has the air of almost a private movie made for the enjoyment of the contestants and that the entertainment of a wider audience is simply a complementary consideration is. If all this is abandoned, you will be glad that Mr. Bogdanovich is well visible. of the particular danger and delivers a sweet and rather innocent "I love NY" Paean, it is also an altar where we have the ethereal beauty of the late Miss. Hepburn can worship. Don't make a mistake, it's her photo. Mr. Gazzara gives her the most self-control in all their scenes. The plot - a detective agency too personal in its clients' affairs - is of minimal importance, which is the performance of the two clues that dominate the movie. Mr Bogdanovich's triumph is in the way his camera apparently likes his actors, from "targets". There is a glow about each of its films that only special artists of lifeless optical equipment can cool down. Perhaps Hepburn has in particular the benefits of this love. Extra insights into his work can be obtained by reading the published collections of his essays on stars and directors, mainly "Who's the hell in it?", Which was recently left in British bookstores. The soundtrack to "They all laughed" ranges from Louis Armstrong's 1947 New York Town Hall concert to Sinatra to Country to Latin, such as eclectic like the city depicting it. Mr. B's "Golden Boy" image is surely set on fire, because so is the nature of the movie business, but it is just as sure to be restored one day, and when the day comes, "They all laughed," recognized for the good work it is.
