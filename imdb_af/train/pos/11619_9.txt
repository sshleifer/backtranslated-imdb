Wes Craven is a most successful killer thriller movie of all time. After watching, he will find your new fears. People don't know what West Craven's thriller movie is the best, because they're all different. <br /> <br /> In this movie Lisa is terrorized by fellow traveler. He forced her to kill and if she didn't, Jack would kill her dad. Lisa is in the big mess because everything she chooses will kill her. <br /> <br /> The action was unreal. Rachel McAdams and Cillian Murphy did extremely well. The emotions were right to choose. The idea and the script of this movie is also good ... <br /> <br /> Sometimes it reminds a "Scream" but he is definitely better than both "Screams" follow up. <br /> <br /> And what can I say - this is the best killer-thriller movie in the 21st century yet ...
