Street battle is a brilliant piece of brutal satire. It's not a movie you're just looking for fun. It's not a comfortable experience, though it didn't laugh a bit. It's a movie you watch when you need food for thought. <br /> <br /> To reject this movie as simply racist is to miss the point altogether. It's not just a satire of Song of the South, it's also a bitter comment on the prejudices Americans still have as a society. Each ethnic group portrayed in the movie is shown as grotesque caricatures of their stereotypes, which in turn are grotesque caricatures of real people. Through this wild exaggeration, the filmmaker shows just how absurd these real beliefs really are. <br /> <br /> If you are the kind of person willing to admit the ugliness of the prevailing prejudices, American culture continues, and if you are not afraid to face your own prejudices, this movie can be for you.
