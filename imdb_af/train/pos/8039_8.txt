Sniper gives a real new meaning to war films. I remember films about Vietnam or World War II, lots of fire, all dying, bam bam. "Sniper" takes war to a new level or refinement. The film certainly contains all the emotions it is aimed at: The helplessness of the jungle people, the hatred and the ultimate trust between Beckett and Miller and the speed of the moment when they pull the trigger. A seemingly low-budget movie makes for every mistake with action, tension and excitement, because when it comes to it, it's just one shot, one kills.
