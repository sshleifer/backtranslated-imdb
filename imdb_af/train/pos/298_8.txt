New York has never looked so good! And neither does anyone in this movie. While the font is a bit light, you can't help but love this movie or any of the characters in it. You almost wish people like this, really existed. The appeal of the actors is what really persuades them (John Ritter, Colleen Camp and the late Dorothy Stratten is extremely good.) Go ahead and buy or buy this movie, you'll be glad you did.
