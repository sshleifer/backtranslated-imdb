Winchester '73 is a wonderful story, and that's what I like about it. It's not your everyday western - it uses a gun that beats hands of different characters - as a mechanism to tell the story about these people. Rock Hudson plays an Indian chief, Jimmy Stewart plays a big front man with heart and strength and Shelly Winters plays a gall that has to handle the reality of her husband and the wild west. It is important to note the politically correct types - they kill many Indians in this movie without repentance. Against today's standards, it is still very violent. But it's a wonderful story and worth watching. Enjoy it!
