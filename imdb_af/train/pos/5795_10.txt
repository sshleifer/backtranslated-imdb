This movie is my all time favorite !!! You really should see Michael Jackson in this wonderful movie !! I'm always over the moon, watch it !! This is a movie you really should see, even if you are not a MJ Fan, because this film, like Captain EO, E.T. and Ghosts, a little movie and music history !! This wonderful movie, from Michael's feather, is a must !! And: Smooth Criminal, is really the most wonderful, most exciting and wonderful song I've ever heard in my life !! Thanks Michael for this movie and I love you !!! MJ is the best musician to hit this planet, he is a good man and he always shines in your eyes when you listen to his music! If you don't know this movie, watch it and don't miss it, because it would be yourself if you miss it !! -Highly Recommanded movie, for every movie lover-
