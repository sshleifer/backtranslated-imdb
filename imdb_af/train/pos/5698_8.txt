Val Kilmer ... Sweet or forbidden him, sometimes he gets under the skin of a character and pulls out a performance that lets you go, "Hey! This man is a GREAT actor! "He did in the leather pants of Jim in the doors and he did it again in John's leather briefs. <br /> <br /> For the fall and fall of uber porn king John Holmes, Kilmer pushes on his knees as we unravel one of the greatest murder mysteries. Hollywood has never solved more than twenty years, with Holmes the main suspect for a brutal Manson style blow. What makes Kilmer so effortless is the low life of the celebrity, anything anyone does want someone who has had it overwhelmed and then lost it. Go and see him, you will know what I mean.
