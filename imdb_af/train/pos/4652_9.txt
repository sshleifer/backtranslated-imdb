I think this movie is well done and realistic. I'm used to watching Hollywood action movies, and use it as a standard to judge this movie, and you'll be disappointed. This movie is much closer to real life than 95% of what Hollywood can produce, and that's what it is above the average action movie. I have no experience with the Swedish military whatsoever and therefore cannot point out any errors in the way they act. But as I saw the "making" extra, I am convinced that much has been done to avoid mistakes. This is a movie I would recommend to others to watch. High quality realistic story and movie.
