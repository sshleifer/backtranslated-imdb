When my little girl from kindergarten was preschool now, this miniseries appeared on A & E every morning. My neighbor and I concluded a pact that we would not miss a minute from Jane Eyre and our kids were late for kindergarten for the whole week. Good choice. <br /> <br /> I forgot how much I loved this movie until I recently released my old VHS copy. Timothy Dalton is very attractive but still perfect as Rochester. The dark, creaking face, the folly that was tempered with humor and tenderness, was straight from the pages of the book. Although Dalton enjoys some landscaping, I couldn't sit down with an adjustment starring William Hurt or grumpy Ciaran Hinds. The magic here is that women love Dalton and get caught up in the romance. <br /> <br /> I want to know what happened to Zelah Clarke. She is dead as Jane, quiet, formal and says volumes with just a look. The sparkle in her eyes gives viewers a glimpse of Jane's strength and enthusiasm to survive the abuse she endured in the youth. Criticism of her performance as "wood" was misplaced. A servant in a proper English household would have maintained such an understanding, but she spoke passionately when she was overcome with emotion. Unlike many other Janes screens, it seems clear that Jane is enough to buy Rochester's appeal to her. <br /> <br /> Bronte's dialogue is a big part of why the book retains the writing of it intact. Dalton and Clarke catch the interaction between Jane and Rochester with white and silent intensity. Although Jane looks like a sweet and sweet as vanilla custard, she refuses to be through the dark, fiery Rochester. The two look good. <br /> <br /> It's the perfect adaptation of the best romance novel ever.
