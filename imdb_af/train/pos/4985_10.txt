People don't seem to give Lensman enough credit where it's due. A few issues have been overlooked which mean the key to understanding the Lensman experience. <br /> <br /> The Year: For the year it was made in 1984. Lensman has some of the most wonderful effects I've ever seen. Looking at the early 80's animation, Lensman is unique in using what appears to be computer-generated images at a time when computers were extremely primitive. Kim's fight against the geometric snipe in the laser maze can be seen as an excellent example of this. Every time I see myself having to repeat that it was 1984 when it was made. <br /> <br /> The Soundtrack: Lensman has one of the most insane soundtracks I've heard, and this crazy hysterical beat penetrates every corner of the movie. Lensman has borrowed heavily on two western mistakes and has managed to handle the first one - the need to fill every second of silence in a movie with music and the need for a heroine. While the music is well adapted and plays such as the motorcycle battle in the Thionite Factory on Radelyx weaken, the heroine fails because of Chris's sheer annoyance. It is interesting to note that the constant music encountered my attempts at sound removal, when I transferred lensman from analogue to digital format - as there was not a single silence to use as a reference point. <br /> Western influences: Helmut - sounds like 'helmet' and has about the same voice as Darth Vader. Clarissa Fairborn - has the same hairstyle as the Princess of SW and her name looks suspiciously similar to Marissa Fairborn of Transformers. Take over Han Solos's role by flying the ship and having technical expertise. Buzzkirk - a definite improvement on Chewbaka. The lens - a beautiful concrete copy of the power that appears less than a chance to proclaim Christianity to the audience than in the original SW. While the power is much more concentrated than concentration, the lens is a pure concentration tool. Theoretically, anyone can float the lens. The lens is much more limited than the Force. It is purely a defensive / offensive weapon. <br /> <br /> Technology: The bush-wife alliance has interesting meatball sponges. They look just like storm troops with red uniforms instead of white. The idea of ​​a DNA weapon was nice if it was just developed. The Galactic Alliance looks like Starblazers (or whatever it is called - that series of 60s where they struggled with the Xylons). There wasn't enough ship to fight for me - it is much improved in the second Lensman movie. <br /> <br /> Finally a note about Worzel. This character is a unique and very interesting character design that happily continues with the second movie. <br /> <br />
