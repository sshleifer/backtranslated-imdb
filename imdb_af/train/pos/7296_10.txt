There is no relationship between Fortier and Profiler, but the fact that both police series are about violent crime. Profiler looks crispy, Fortier looks classic. Profile plots are fairly simple. Fortier's plot is much more complicated ... Fortier looks more like Prime Suspect, if we have to see similarities ... The main character is weak and weirdo, but has "clarity". People like to compare, judge, evaluate. How about enjoying it? Funny too, people who look like Fortier look American, but on the other hand, arguing that they prefer American series (!!!). Maybe it's the language or the spirit, but I think this series is more English than American. By the way, the actors are really good and funny. The acting is not superficial.
