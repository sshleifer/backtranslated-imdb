I enjoyed it. Generally I am not a fan of comedians and comedians, but I love Whoopi. I'm also partly into Sci / Fi Fantasy. And the dinosaur is weird. I read for pleasure, but if I feel overstressed or really dead, I watch television and movies to escape. Theodore Rex enabled me to do this. It makes it a success in my eyes! I didn't even go to do anything else while it was running. Whether it's "good" or not, doesn't really matter to me. And no, I'm not a youth. I'm not a moron either.
