"Most of us live at least two worlds, the real world where we are the grace of circumstances and the world within the unconscious, safe place where we can escape ..." Gone inside the world of "The Maxx" a fascinating world where fantasy and reality are combined. Inspired by Sam Kieth's comic book "The Maxx", the material is very faithful in what it was inspired, not only in the story, but also in the graphic style, which looks like the pages of the cartoon, which shows this view a surreal and unique look. But the story is also interesting and entertaining. At times it can get too strange, but if you're inside, it's hard to get out of it. The story and the characters are wonderfully developed. The music goes perfectly with the style of the show and gives it the right atmosphere. Unfortunately, like many good animated performances, this was one short. "The Maxx" is a must see. This is one of my all-time favorites.
