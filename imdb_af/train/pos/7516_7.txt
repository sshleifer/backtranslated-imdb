The first two-thirds of this biopic fetish model Betty Page is very interesting. Betty, as expressed with great sincerity by Gretchen Mol, comes across as a pleasant, girl-by-type, who has seen nothing wrong with what she did (and there was definitely nothing wrong with that). Director Mary Harron, who also made "I Shot Andy Warhol" and "American Psycho", recreates Betty's America by mixing old black and white stock with new, degraded black and white imagery. Once Betty lands in Florida and starts working with Bunny Yeager, color is introduced. Betty's fame was mostly the result of her work with Paula and Irving Klaw (Lili Taylor, in a big show, and Chris Bauer), as well as John Willie (Jared Harris). The screens where Harron recreates Betty's bondage photography sessions are fascinating and well executed. The early suppliers of fetish material are not supported and we get the feeling that these people were part of a tight "community". Betty never had too much of a problem with her fame, although we get the impression that her reputation has prevented her from gaining legitimacy in the straight-forward world. Since the third act of the movie hardly exists, we keep the impression that we are watching a documentary documentary on Betty Page, rather than a structured drama. Flaws aside, this is a movie that is worth catching and still represents a good feather in producer Christine Vachon's cap.
