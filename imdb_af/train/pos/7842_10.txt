So halfway through the season, I got so caught up in school and my activities that I didn't realize that the show was canceled halfway through. It's a crap. <br /> <br /> I think the followers of this show should write dragons and ask them to at least film them so that a season can be released on DVD later. Maybe they'll see how many people were disappointed that the show didn't survive its first season. <br /> <br /> I loved the show and challenged the OC every Thursday. Can you imagine my disappointment if I came back to try and see how the show disappeared? Needless to say, I'm not very happy with fox. even more after you discover that NO END IS FILMED. I mean, if you're going to work on a project, at least complete it to see what happens. A half-filmed show is like a half-car, it is pretty useless. fox, film the damn end and give some of the show's fans a little peace.
