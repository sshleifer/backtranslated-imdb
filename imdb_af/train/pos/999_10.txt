I'm amazed at how this movie (and most others averaging 5 stars and lower when there is an average movie of 7 to 10 stars on IMDb.) The fanboy mentality strikes again. When this movie came out, everyone just beat. ex-girlfriend questioned this movie. Years later I sat down to watch this movie and I enjoyed myself. Even laughed a little. These and The Replacement Killers are the movies people have had that director Antoine Fuqua marked as the black Michael Bay. I don't see how most of Fuqua's movies are smarter than Michael Bay has. Already ... <br /> <br /> Story: Alvin Sanders (Jamie Foxx) is the former culprit used by a non-foolish treasury agent Edgar (David Morse) as a murderer pledge named Bristol (Doug Hutchinson). Alvin's movements are detected by a bug implanted in his shit after an accident. While these agents were in Bristol, Bristol went wrong after the golden bricks taken in a fence. <br /> <br /> Jamie Foxx is funny and good like Alvin Sanders. Alvin is a quick talk that is much smarter than he keeps. Doug Hutchinson is good as Bristol. He can sometimes be over in his John Malkovitchesque demeanor. He was better here than he was like Looney Bin Jim in Punisher: War Zone. David Morse is good as the hard edge treasury agent. Even Mike Epps is funny like Alvin's brother Stevie. Both him and Jamie have some funny moments on the screen. <br /> <br /> The only mistake of the movie is the efforts of a player falling flat. The scenario at the horse racing track is far from the top, but I couldn't look away. The director all went out there, so he got points for it. Plus the bomb scene with the treasury agent tied to a chair while the explosions on the door rested was pretty nice. <br /> <br /> All in all, Bait is not a bad movie by a long shot. It's never boring, it's always funny and I haven't checked my watch every minute. It must count for something. Ace is one of the most underestimated films of the 2000 era. <br /> <br /> PS: To the judge who claimed this movie is too violent ... How long have you been living under a rock? I'm pretty sure you've seen the Die Hard series and EVERY movie by Quentin Tarantino. But those movies aren't violent? Weirdo.
