Robert Stack never really lost a best supporting actor Oscar for his role as Kyle in 'Written on the Wind' for Anthony Quinn's 12-minute show in 'Lust for Life.' Stack plays the deeply disturbed, alcoholic son of an oil drunk. He lived his life in the shadow of the friend he was raised with, Mitch, played by Rock Hudson. They are both of the same woman, Lucy, (Lauren Bacall), who becomes Kyle's wife. Kyle's sister, Marylee (Dorothy Malone), is a drunk slut who falls in love with Mitch. Their story plays in glorious color under the capable direction of Douglas Sirk, who really dominated the melodrama field with some incredible movies, including "Imitation of Life", "Everything that allows heaven," "Magnificent Obsession" and many others. br /> <br /> Don't make a mistake - it's a pot boiler, and Stack and Dorothy Malone make the most of their roles, Malone wins a best supporting actress Oscar. There is one wonderful scene, mentioned in other remarks, where she makes aloud music when her father crashes and dies on the stairs. We are led to believe that Marylee sleeps with everyone, including the guy who pumps the gas, because she is in love with Mitch. Mitch doesn't want to do anything to her. He is so in love with Lucy that he wants to work in Iran to avoid temptation, for loyalty to Kyle. I doubt he would be so eager to get there today, no matter how much he was in love. <br /> <br /> Hudson and Bacall have the less exciting roles here - Hudson's Mitch is the good guy who cleaned Kyle's. Knives for his whole life, and Bacall is Mitch's wife who finds herself in a nightmare when her husband starts drinking again after a year of austerity. Sirk focuses on the more volatile support players. <br /> <br /> In Sirk's hands, "Written on the Wind" is an effective movie, and the big scene after the end in the house is extremely exciting. The director had a gift for this kind of movie, and although he had many imitators, he never looked.
