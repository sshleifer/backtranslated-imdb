I heard people say this movie is boring. I don't think they watched the right movie. It's not the prototypical action movie, thank God. <br /> <br /> It's a psychological drama about the newcomer and his mentor who just happens to kill people. In this way, it works very well, with fantastic performances by Berenger and Zane (who do not sleep through the film as he has in other roles - he actually seems to be acting). <br /> <br /> I was disappointed with the action at the end - many didn't make much sense and were unsatisfactory given the build up of the rest of the movie. But look at Zane's face as he panic, alone, while Berenger does the dirty work.
