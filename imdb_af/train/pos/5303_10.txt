John Water's ("Pink Flamingos" ...) "Pecker" is the best movie I've seen for a while. This gives the viewer a surreal picture of life in Baltimore (I live in nearby Washington, DC), with a Warhol-like use of color, exaggerated movements and emotions. Pecker grows bigger than his town can handle, and he is separated from his loved ones (including a sexy Ricci) by his man-loving art director. The photo left a refreshing taste in my mouth - like a fresh strawberry ice cream on a hot summer day - and although this taste was fairly flat and simplistic, it just made the whole thing more profound and critical. It is a celebration of life, freedom and the right to carry weapons ... and everything that this country is about. -Juan Pieczanski (jpieczanski@sidwell.edu)
