I'm not a John Cleese finalist (although I thought "Fawlty Towers was brilliant), but I'm a fan, and when I saw this meeting, I decided on a shelf at my local Blockbuster What I got was a wonderful surprise, and one of the funniest 50 minutes of sightings I ever had, which is a typical English goon show schtick, which is actually not a sound shot. An album from 'Firesign Theater', but the execution and timing is on the rise and it raises "Strange Case" in the kind of jaw performance that lifelong British comedy fanatics can create. <br /> <br /> The British A gift for the combination of some satirical lampoons with meticulous tics of character and timing, the creators both use a good effect here. But Cleese has such a boy for physical comedy that he is more than she own. But the unexpected treat here is Arthur Lowe, who plays 'Watson' as a brilliant but unbeatable incomprehensible imbecile with such an excellent timing and delivery that he becomes the best aspect of the film. I have never heard of Lowe about this (his background seems to be vaudeville and music theater), but he justifies his entire career as far as I am concerned. <br /> <br /> Some people may not care for "Strange Case ..." especially if the British are not their "cuppa tea". But I'm very glad to see it before it disappears.
