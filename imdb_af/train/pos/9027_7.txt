Above average movie and acting partially spoiled by its completely predictable story line. Even the music was chosen so that the words fit the action every time. A smell of the Pleasantville camp is hanging around this movie. As a period piece, it is more accurate than not. The portrayal of the tragedy of company towns and lack of upward mobility is sketchy but moving. Chris Cooper turns into a first-class performance as Howard's coal-mining dad.
