Since almost all critics are the best of the Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan movies, I have no argument with it, though there are a few others I thought were just as entertaining. One thing: it's the longest of the series I've seen 105 minutes. I only saw six of them, but it was longer than I was used to and with the protracted action final I thought the whole thing was a little too long. <br /> <br /> Yet, it's a good mix of action, excitement and romance. The only thing missing is color and stereo sound. The primitive special effects don't bother me, because that was all they had in the 1930s. <br /> <br /> Amongst some, this movie is famous for one thing: skin! "Jane" never behaved like this movie, because the Hays code was introduced by the time the next Tarzan movie was made. Her outfit showed what a large figure, Maureen O'Sullivan, owns. However, the naked underwater scene was not her - by a longshot. The woman under the water didn't have a good figure at all. <br /> <br /> There is much action in this. Until the final, it wasn't overdoing it either. However, the end went for 15 minutes, and it was so intense that it was almost too much to watch. <br /> <br /> Yet this movie offers everything - except "Boy" (their adopted son) - you want to see in a Tarzan movie, even O'Sullivan does her Tarzan screaming about a dozen times. With her pair of "lungs" it wasn't a problem.
