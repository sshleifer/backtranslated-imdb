Warning! Spoilers ahead! <br /> <br /> SPOILERS <br /> <br /> I saw movie in German, so I might have missed some clues. <br /> <br /> In spite of weakness In the plot it is a movie that comes through me. I especially like Lexa Doig's play. Sometimes I had the impression that she was * Camille. But I can't stop wondering what happened to Bob, Cassie and baby. I believe she, after being initially seated on Bob, eventually ended up and loved and regretted what happened to his brother and forced to lie to him. Otherwise, it is a little strange that she will carry his baby and love it. It's up to the viewer to decide - and I don't like such ends. Dean Cain was as good as Eric Roberts. Well, I saw him better, but worse. <br /> <br /> I believe the movie is more an analysis of human relationships and reacts in unexpected situations as a crime story. <br /> <br /> Bottom line is, I really enjoyed it.
