As a man who has seen all the seasons, I can say that JG always surprised me. I mean, after you see him, he moved from laughter to paranoia throughout the seasons and after every little gesture of her you believed he was a gunman, you thought to yourself: OK he's a good actor and he can come in a gangster's skin. But after he opened his eyes and struggled for his life, I meant I could almost feel the pain he made. "We believe he went through. I was so touched by his performance that I immediately thought of Robert De Niro, Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. These guys were definitely the best of their generations and even more.

I can't wait to see Gandolfini in other movies where he plays a completely different role. of his older films where he gives an unforgettable performance?
