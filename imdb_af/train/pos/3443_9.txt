A compelling, honest, daring and memorable psychological horror movie that is a descent from the painful experiences of rape-induced pain. A film that went under the radar due to the lack of distribution because the film was honestly so cruel in its depictions that if it was released, it might hate itself to a few strongly biased people. <br /> <br /> The movie deserves to be discovered, not just its dark themes, and not just its wonderful direction and authentic style - but especially for its performances. Chad Faust is absolutely stunning, offering enough sickness and enough vulnerability to not make one, but understands this broken man with a twisted perspective on his sexuality with not only the women he rapes but also the fragile uncertainties deep within his own self. It is a supportive achievement that is so complex, brave and emotional on Faust's side. And hard to forget. <br /> <br /> The view is, however, Rosario Dawson, whose performance is an absolute revelation here. A tour-the-power of realistic dramatic tics, and one of the most subtle but hard-to-be-performances in some time. While Dawson is seen in some good supporting performances in some bad movies, she proves she needs to deliver emotionally fluent and moving performances, credible and thematic. <br /> <br /> One of the best films of his year (and 2007 was a strong one). If this underrated and intelligent movie hit the theater, I'd have praise for it, as well as Dawson and Faust. It was a pity that it was a widespread appeal. Movies like this deserve better!
