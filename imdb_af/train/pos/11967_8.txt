I don't know if it's a sitcom or not, but I agree it's one of the biggest television shows ever. It's wonderful that this show is still airy. And I love Michelle. It was cute on the episodes when she was a baby and she spoke, and she sometimes said something funny. Aw. <br /> <br /> This show can be related to kids and teens and .. well, families as they struggle through difficult times and try to work it out as a family. I don't know who would ever turn off an opportunity to see this show with anyone. <br /> <br /> I love the episode when I think her name is DD. The older girl accidentally stole a jersey, and she learned a lesson about the shaft. It was a great episode. An example that this TV show shows the family what works out as a family. <br /> <br /> I recommend this show to everyone.
