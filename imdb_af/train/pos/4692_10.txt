Although criticism is malicious, Johnny Dangerously is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. It's a movie that needs to be watched carefully; Some of the funny pieces are done in passing and do not have the usual amount of attention they have drawn. For example, keep an eye on Michael Keaton's use of the prize pistol at the pet shop ... and also on the documentary style years that appear at the beginning of the screens. It's one of those rare movies where the humor unexpectedly touches you, though you know it's a comedy. Amy Heckerling, the director, is really sharp here. If you enjoy her better-known movies (Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Clueless, European Vacation, etc.), you should watch this one. <br /> <br /> Michael Keaton is extremely enjoyable in the title role and the supporting film (Griffin Dunne, Maureen Stapleton, Joe Piscopo, Peter Boyle) is excellent. Highly recommended.
