Let's see it: the final season (# 8) was one of the worst seasons in any show I've ever enjoyed (mostly, I've never found dry spells to keep for a whole season). But if you judge this performance by the previous season, it will of course be inferior. This is a totally unfair assessment - because that '70s Show' was a brilliant and hilarious sitcom about an obsolete era in its day and how the people who lived there were not so different from what we are in modern times. is time. <br /> <br /> Well ... ignore Season 8. <br /> <br /> Topher Grace stars as Eric Forman, a horny teen with an everlasting love of Donna (Laura Prepon), the feminist girl next. Play their friends, Danny Masterson (Hyde), Mila Kunis (Jackie), Wilmer Valderrama (Fez) and even Ashton Kutcher (Kelso), giving fantastic performances in (almost) every episode. The best one is probably Fez, a foreign scholarship student who is as mentally promiscuous as they get. In which country does he come from? Try to find out! For another dimension of entertainment, Debra Jo Rupp and Kurtwood Smith are phenomenal like Eric's parents. Rupp, as Kitty, is both formidable and sweet like Mrs. Brady meets Marie Barone, while Smith's Red scares most of the guys from everyone. Don Stark and Tanya Roberts play very well to each other like Donna's parents, the chauvinist but sweet Bob and the headline Midge. Tommy Chong occasionally appeared as Leo, a stoner acting as a father figure to Hyde. <br /> <br /> Apart from the anachronistic errors that appear frequently and the sometimes over-the-top lessons (and regrettable final season), "70s" is a fantastic show with wonderful writing , spot-on direction, and a feel-good atmosphere pulsating through every episode. They are all good.
