"The Odd Couple" is one of those movies that surpasses its reputation. People all know, they hum the theme song, they complain to live with a messy "Oscar" or a demanding "Felix" ... but they sell the movie without knowing it. It's not just about a neat man living with a messy man; It is a portrait of two friends who help each other through divorce divorce. It's also funny from start to finish, but it's the kind of comedy that comes from realistic, stressful and just horrible situations. So, some viewers have actually found the movie a little uncomfortable, but I think its veracity is its power. Besides, Matthau's bulldog face does not break me! My favorite comedy, by a landmill.
