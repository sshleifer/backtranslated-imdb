We loved the movie. I'm a mother to two little men. I love a movie I can see with them where men have integrity and character. Moveis where money is not the most important thing. And family is forever and love means more than words. <br /> <br /> I wish we had seen more of the Davis family. But about everything I loved, I left with the same feeling, and the other "please not pass". We both want actors not to change. The new actors were good replacement. <br /> <br /> My 9 year old son also loved this movie. asked me to buy them all. He is a film critic, so he can tell it tells me something. Family should all see this move buy it for friends. Help to bring back a time of values. We will now read the books, because we are addicted. I really hope to see more. Be happy to move
