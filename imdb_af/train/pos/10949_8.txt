First of all I would like to say that I am a great Sarah Silverman fan, and with others it says and then patch on the pilot is beyond me. Everything in the pilot was in typical Sarah Silverman form, maybe it's not really funny, but the situation and the delivery is what counts. <br /> <br /> If you love Jesus, Magic is, then I don't see how you would. t like this. It has the same flow and the same rhythm. True, it's just for true fans, but if you are, you'll be happy. <br /> <br /> Again, for true fans, nothing is wrong. If you are not accustomed to her style, you will not know why it is funny. It is, however, and I hope you think so too.
