Jessica Alba's Max and Valerie Rae Miller's original Cindy shines in this action pack and atmospheric series. Wonderful politics wrong. Quality varies greatly from episode to episode, but overall the standard is high and when not, Jessica is always worth watching. Valerie's urban jiveralking afroamerican is occasionally urgently called Dark Angel in Sitcom.
