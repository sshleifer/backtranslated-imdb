Rarely do I ever become a movie so full of fulfillment that I need to talk about immediately. This movie is definitely one of the best entertainment available and it is highly authentic. I saw the dual version, but now I'm heading to grab the DVD remaster with the original Chinese dialogue. Yet the dubbing did not get in the way and sometimes offered some funny humor: "The gif clan hides the world!" <br /> <br /> The storytelling remains true to Chinese methods of intrigue, tension, and interpersonal relationships. You can expect developments and turnovers as the identities of the 5 toxins are revealed and an expert fit. <br /> <br /> The martial arts choreography is in a class of its own and should be seen as believed. It's like watching real animals fight each other, but form their own arcane martial arts. This level of skill under the film is unsurpassed in the modern cinema. <br /> <br /> The combination allows for a serious dose of ancient Chinese culture and I only recommend it based on the film's sincere intention to tell a martial art story and master its execution. ... Of course, if you just want to see people bang each other, along with rough forms of ancient Chinese torture, be my guest!
