Come on, look at the title! LOL! I remember seeing this movie on Saturdays Separation. It's a great, cute monster movie with hilariously bath acting and two wonderful moronic hillbillies that add the shock factor. The 2 redneck boat rentals guys are the movie! LOL, and you'll love the boat scene where the English man and his wife talk about all the stars and it's noon and sunny. Bloody hilarious !!! You could say they just didn't care about the plot, they just wanted to blow the film by filming the movie as fast as possible. Bottom line, you'll love it if you love 70's slap.
