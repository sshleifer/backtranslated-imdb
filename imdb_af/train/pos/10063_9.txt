The filming is pleasant and the environment is very realistic. I liked that it reasonably reaffirmed the concepts of the very difficult moral and social morays of the Chinese continent of the 1930s and more basic human questions. I felt that I could get a real sense of the times, even in beautiful shots of traditional Chinese theater and in purist depictions of street life. It was worth experiencing. The interwoven role Buddhism plays is probably the most noticeable - in its many and in its philosophical aspect - perhaps the most effective I have seen in Chinese film. Casting is great. Images are memorable. Acting is solid enough. Thematically puerile but still rich enough to compliment the vehicle of its expression.
