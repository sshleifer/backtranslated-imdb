This movie is one for centuries. First, I must say that once I saw it, it became one of my all-time favorite movies. Why? simple, Ben Coccio (author, director) compiled a real work of art. Where 99.9% of the movies are pure entertainment these days, director Ben Coccio gives us the truth, gives us reality, gives us a learning tool to know why. The mainstream media turns and turns, but Ben Coccio watches school shooting right in front, can go where no other media has ever been before, in the minds and hearts of two young men who want to kill their classmates. While it is certainly graphical and terrible, how can it not be? The gloves come off, the lies and the sugar cover of our media masters are put aside and we are taken to a place where we can find the truth in what happened. Sometimes it is not just a screw loose as everyone likes to think, no, sometimes hate and isolation is deeper, more human, we are shown that these boys are us and us. Society left them behind and the consequences are terrible and real. <br /> <br /> Love and love your fellow man. A lesson that we all have to learn, thank you for making this movie Mr. Coccio, I hope with great anticipation that you will continue your film career.
