One of the best Tarzan movies is also one of his most action-packed (and graphic) films. <br /> <br /> After a year or so after Tarzan, Monkey Man, Niel Hamilton's Holt, a rich friend asked for a safari back to the elephant cemetery to collect ivory. His friend also comes up with dresses and perfumes that Holt hopes to use to win Jane from Tarzan. Before they can leave, Holt finds his card stolen and it becomes a vicious stamp to try to capture a competitive expedition. When they finally take the thieves, they find the whole party dead and surround themselves. They have no choice but to fight and soon find themselves out of the frying pan and in the fire. Eventually Tarzan and Jane arrive and everyone is on even more adventures. <br /> <br /> The infamous movie is heavily censored to reduce graphical violence (This is graphically even according to current standards. It will probably get a PG 13) and to remove all markups (there's a a few minutes long naked swimming scene that includes Jane who is full-fledged in his nudity, it has only recently been restored. It's clear to see the restored version why this movie was reduced to 20 minutes in TV running time. As it is in the restored version, it is a very mature movie filled with romance, touch, action and everything a movie should be. It's an amazing movie by virtually any standard. Best of all is the kind of movie that plays well as a stand-alone adventure, but the first movie doesn't have to enjoy, but it's also a movie that deepenes the characters and themes set in that original movie. . It's a wonderful thing. <br /> <br /> I love this movie a lot. <br /> <br /> If there are any flaws in the movie, it may be that the film is not aging well. The rear screen is often very obvious, there are gorilla clothes for many of the monkeys and some of the other effects are more beautiful than convincing. However, at almost every other level, this film is. <br /> <br /> You're really guilty of seeing it. Make yourself a big bowl of popcorn and curl on the couch and just let yourself back to a simpler time. This is one of the great adventures.
