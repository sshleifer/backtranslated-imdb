He now has a name, an identity, a few memories and a lost girlfriend. All he wanted was to disappear, yet they tracked him down and destroyed the world he barely built. Now he wants an explanation, and to get the people's ride, how did he make him what he is. Yes, Jason Bourne is back, and this time he's here with a revenge. <br /> <br /> OK, this movie doesn't have the most extensive writing in the world, but its themes are very clever and ask some serious questions about our society. Of course, like every Hollywood movie since the end of the 90's, the Bourne Supreme is a superhero story. Jason Bourne is a Captain America project, which went completely wrong. In the first movie, the hero discovered his abilities and he adopted them in the second. He now fights what he sees as evil after a person is killed near him (his girlfriend in "Suprematy"). It's all part of the superhero story, including a character with (realistic yet impressive: he almost invincible) superpowers. <br /> <br /> And the interesting point is that the evil one is fighting around the world (there are no boundaries in the Bourne movies, characters are moving from one continent to another), as is in the best seasons of "24", an American enemy, who believes he is fighting for the good of his country blind him completely. Funny how "crazy patriots" are now the N.1 enemies of paranoid Hollywood stories. <br /> <br /> In addition to all the interesting themes, the movie is not flawless: Nickie Parson's feminine character has been completely useless so far, and the direction is quite original when it comes to dialogue screens. But everything that doesn't really matter, for "The Bourne Ultimatum" is an action movie. And the action scenes are impressive. <br /> <br /> Everyone here talks about the Waterloo scene and the "Tangier pursuit" and everyone's right. I especially enjoyed the battle in Tangier, which reminds me of Tsui Hark's exaggeration and insanity. Visually inventive scenes, very intelligent action parts and a good reflection on the American contemporary thematic theme: "The Bourne Ultimatum" is definitely the best movie of the series and a very interesting and original action movie.
