Gandhi, the Great: <br /> <br /> Greatness in the world is associated with people like Alexanader the Great, Ashoka the Great, because their greatness has lied that they are glorified as more than humans. Gandhi is called great to not actually be a Great but more human, because I always believe that humanity comes into us, where the greatness of human lies is. Gandhi was a human being with mankind and one mankind was ready to sacrifice himself in the battle for humanity, but not his enemies. Now let me move on to the movie review. <br /> <br /> About Gandhi My Father: <br /> <br /> Gandhi My father is not a film about Gandhi, but about his son Harilal Gandhi. By telling the story. of a boy whose father was one of the greatest people to walk this earth, the director manages to portray the story. The film succeeds in telling the story of a deceived son of a father leading a nation to greatness. The film is called as a criticism of Gandhi's failure as a father to his son, should I rather say it is a sacrifice made by Gandhi as a father of a son to do justice to a father of a nation. <br /> <br /> I wish The essence of this movie prevails not only in India, the Gandhian country, but by the hearts of all the people of this world. <br /> <br /> Gandhi the real man. Jaihind.
