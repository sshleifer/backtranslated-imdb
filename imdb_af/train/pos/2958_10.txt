A comedy of equally funny relationships from the guys who brought your South Park, and most of Orgazmo's guys. This vulgar, obscure film has completely disgusting, eiotistic and satirical content. It depicts incredible cruel treatment of humans and animals. I LOVE IT!!!!! These are some funny things. Really funny. Two free friends create a ramp-up game that explodes into a national sensation. Corruption and greed and extortion make the sport acidic, and it does well. And on the road you will laugh. Very. That's all there is. Enjoy !!!!
