The biggest surprise in this movie was the performance of Daryl Hannah. Rather than playing the stereotypical ditzy blonde roles she usually does, she plays a street-smart, intelligent, world-weary character. She doesn't have a big role, but she does a good job of portraying Lois Harlan as a woman who is tired of covering her boss's indiscretion, though used.
