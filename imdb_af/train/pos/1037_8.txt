"An unjust is often a man who has undone something, not always who did something." - Emperor Marcus Aurelius <br /> <br /> The DVD edition of Watch on the Rhine could not come at a better moment. It restores us a huge Lillian Hellman play adapted by Dashiell Hammett on the screen. (The sound commentary by Hellman Bernard F. Dick confirms his authorship). It offers a subtle performance by Bette Davis, who had a subdued secondary role long after she became the workhorse queen at the Warner Bros fate. Equally significant, it reminds us that World War II had a purpose. <br /> <br /> Sure, you say, as we needed it. We preached Cary Grant in "Destination Tokyo" (1943) about Japanese boys and their Bushido knives. We watched jackboots blunt the living hills in "The Sound of Music" (1965). We called an England, which was kept by Germany in "This was happening" (1966). Yet, the truth to tell, we still need the message. <br /> <br /> I have a 81-year-old friend who regularly curses Franklin Roosevelt. He felt that FDR had addressed the US in a strange battle that we didn't need, causing the death of his favorite cousin. He is encouraged in his demonization of Allied leaders and the trivialization of War Two by Patrick Buchanan. <br /> <br /> The political columnist has just published a thick book that is difficult with detailed research claiming that Adolf Hitler would have no further threat. to Poland, Europe or the world when only the Third Reich in 1939 transferred the Free City of Danzig. Buchanan liked that if those selfish Poland had not confronted the Nazis, and had gone foolish in England, the West would have engulfed. He believes that no one in Germany, without the guidelines of the total war, built gas chambers to provide a final solution to the Jewish problem. <br /> <br /> Some commentaries on this site feel that "Watch" is under the weight of birthday propaganda. Can be. Yet my friend or Pat Buchanan does not seem to be the film's point either: some people hurt and murdered to grab others' land, goods and freedom. such people dominated the ashes and "enough" did not appear in their vocabulary. <br /> <br /> Paul Lukas earned the Oscar he won. He and Bette Davis are convincing in their portrayal of refugees fighting oppressors. They give emotional punch to the intellectual cause to leave the sidelines, to actively stand among the martyrs and murderers. Bernard Dick points out that Hellman does not care for Luke as a person, as he remained apolitical. Of course, as a Hungarian, he replaced first-hand Bela Kun's bloody "dictatorship of the proletariat", replaced an outdated empire and then overthrew Admiral Horthy's right-wing tyranny. <br /> <br /> In a wonderful cameo role added For the play by Hammett, Henry Daniell sardonies show a Wehrmacht class officer who sees the brown shirts he serves. His Phili von Ramme will undoubtedly be in the field of Marshal Rommel in 1944 during the July 20 plot against Hitler. In April 1940, however, he discontinued the Nazi cause pragmatically, although he Herr Blecher "The Butcher" insulted, and Romanian aristoc Teck de Brancovis despised to try to obtain information about an underground leader. <br /> <br /> Teck, a peacock and a possible cuckold, wants cash and a visa to return to Europe, where he can resume the life of a living with the empire-breaking war and the greater global economic depression has been undone. He has no political beliefs, no scandal over the trading of a freedom fighter for his own tomorrow. Mercury Theater graduate George Coulouris gives this burnt-out cause of Old World cynicism a desperate threat. <br /> <br /> Lucille Watson gives lively vitality to the grabbing man's hostess, a dominant old gal who knows her mind and gets her. way - but who doesn't appreciate her children properly and their achievements outside the house they control. She and her pallid office-bound son belong to the American version of von Ramme and de Brancovis's privileged species. However, this family did not ruin and never wanted to. They are monetary people who can silence evil, simply by not resisting it. <br /> <br /> This mother and son can easily make choices that reflect the lamentation of National Socialism and Fascism today in my friend and in Pundit Buchanan. "Watching the Rhine" has a comfortable period. His dialogue reflects his erudite origins on stage, rather than sounding fresh from the streets. Still, Hellman and Hammett's film has power. Audiences still need to hear their call to arms against grabbers constantly on the march and listen.
