* Contains spoilage due to the fact that I have to describe a few movie techniques, so read at your own risk! * <br /> <br /> I loved this movie. The use of tinting in some of the screens makes it look like an old photo comes to life. I also enjoyed the projection of people on a rear screen. For example, in one scene Leopold calls his wife and she is projected behind him, rather than into a typical divider. Her face is big in the back and Leo's is in the foreground. <br /> <br /> One of the best uses of this is when young boys kill the Ravensteins on the train, shooting a scene in an almost political poster style, with face close ups. It reminds me of Battleship Potemkin, that intense constant style along with the red spray to transfer tons of horror without much gore. The same with the scene when Katharina gets her dad dead in the bath ... you can only see the red water on the side. This is one of the things I love about Von Trier, his suppression of horror, which eventually makes it more creepy. <br /> <br /> The use of text in the movie was unique, as when Leo's character was pushed by the word, "Werewolf." I've never seen anything like this in a movie. <br /> <br /> The use of black comedy in this movie was well done. Ernst-Hugo Järegård is wonderful as Leo's uncle. This leads to the snickers I got from his role in the Kingdom (Kingdom). This humor makes the plot line of absurd anal retention of train leaders against the terrible backdrop of World War II and all the chaos easier to take. It reminds me of Riget in the way the hospital administrator tries to maintain a normality at the end of part one when everything goes wrong. It shows that some people are really unaware of the terrible things happening around them. However, some people, like Leo, have agreed, but do nothing positive about it. <br /> <br /> The voice over, expertly done by Max von Sydow, is also amusing. It pulls you into the story and lets you jump into Leo's head, which is sometimes a frightening place. <br /> <br /> The movie brings the point that a coward is if they are not a side. I see the same idea used in Dancer in the Dark, where Bjork's character doesn't speak for herself and ultimately her own destruction. Actually, Von Trier was one day against my wife, by making Breaking the Waves and Dancer, but now I know his male characters aren't going well either! I find myself in the same spot at the end of Dancer, if you really want the main character to reconsider their actions, but of course they never do it!
