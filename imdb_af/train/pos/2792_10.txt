I love this movie. It is a great film that combines English and Indian cultures with feminist issues, such as girls who want to play sports previously reserved for men. It shows the struggle of both an Indian person who wants to break beyond her cultural barriers and women beyond the gender restrictions that occur in sport, especially in England. I feel that the cultural struggle is more emphasized than the other issues. <br /> <br /> Contrary to other comments, I don't think this movie is something like Dirty Dancing or any other such chick spot. This move is loved by many people, men and women, young and old.
