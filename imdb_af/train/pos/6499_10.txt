After all these years, I still see this series as the best example of World War II documentary filmmaking. The interviews with many participants from all countries set it apart from any other project. It will be great to see a contemporary documentary (Ken Burns?) And try to gather information from veterans before they are all gone. With state-of-the-art technology to enhance old archival material and much information that has been unearthed since 1974 when manufactured by The World At War, an updated version of this series will be welcome. The History Channel has made some fine representations about many aspects of World War II, but an extensive series such as World War II has not been used since the original successful attempt. If you're interested in this era, don't miss this series. It is necessary to look.
