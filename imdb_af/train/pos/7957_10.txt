Hey guys, <br /> <br /> I watched every spot where these two movies can be found and I can't find them anywhere in my local area. (I'm Australian). Can you please help me and tell me where to buy it. In General Home Ward Bound 1 and 2 are the best movies I've ever seen and are good for people of all ages. It was my favorite movie win I was 5 and it is still when I am a teenager. It's a good movie for the whole family. My whole family loves this movie except for my younger sister, because I watched it so sick. I love this movie and I can't wait until I can buy it again on DVD. <br /> <br /> Sally
