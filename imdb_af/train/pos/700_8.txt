An Insomniac's Nightmare was an incredibly interesting, well-made movie. I loved the way it just puts you in the main character's subconscious mind without coddling the viewer ... the acting was - honestly, I'd watch Dominic Monaghan watch the phonebook read! - But everyone, especially the young girl, was also good. I was also very impressed with the appearance of the film. Usually, "independent movies" feature a grainy, I-shot-on-my-video camera, but this director knows what she's doing. The lighting, cinematography ... quality work. I'm looking forward to a feature-length work by Tess Nanavati!
