Went to Wal-Mart and got this movie on DVD and have no idea if I made a bad purchase or a good one. This is the later outcome when I watch the whole movie from start to finish. Michelle Rodriquez, (Diana Guzman), BloodRayne, 05, delivered a good performance and her look is beautiful, sexy and at the same time a real study of the art of acting. Diana doesn't like her home life and especially her own father for the abuse he gave her mother. She decides to get boxing training in a local Brooklyn Gym and is not really well-accepted by the male boxers. In her high school there is a lot of friction between her female classmates and guys. There is a lot of action in the ladies' bathroom and references to private parts of guys. If you like boxing and see a hot sexy bile, do wonders in the ring and beat the boys on you. You know. What is this movie for you?
