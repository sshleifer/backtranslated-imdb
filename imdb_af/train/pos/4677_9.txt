I understand this movie as a debut feature and as such it is very impressive. It has the feel and fit of a "true indie", but director Todd Yellin clearly possesses the photographic and editorial vision, mission and judgment of an adult and seasoned professional. The shots are well framed and thought and serve to move the story forward. He and the screenwriter Ivan Solomon deliver a story that has much more depth and lyricism than typical paint by numbers type scripts. It's a story that Judd Hirsch's caliber character needs to work. Judd is fantastic as usual; such as Scott Cohen and the beautiful Susan Floyd. The real surprise, however, is Elliot Korte who plays Adam Groden. Yellin was able to nurture nuance from the young actor in a role that could easily be affected by stereotype or persuasion. Anyway, I found the movie refreshing and entertaining.
