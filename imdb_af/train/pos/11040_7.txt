Watched this French horror movie last night and kept it pretty much. The whole movie takes place in a prison cell with basically three inmates who find a handwritten magazine in a wall of a ceremony that escaped 20 years before leaving his cell. As they look through the diary, they discover it in the black arts and commands that can be their way out of the cell and freedom. What they find out is something completely different, and horrible to say the least. I like low-budget horror movies, which deliver the goods fairly well, and tell a good story. This movie just does it, for a while to go. The result and the horror they release is very interesting to me and I enjoyed the ride. Not very gore, but it won't fit the story, though the gore is pretty good.
