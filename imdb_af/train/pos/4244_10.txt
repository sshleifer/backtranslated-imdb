This film slipped through the cracks of film history. It's much better than some other New York movies of the same era, such as "The French Connection" or "The Take of Pelham 1-2-3". There is an eager reality for this film that also manages to use humor effectively to promote the plot line. It is beginning to end and is not infected with age, as with the two examples above. <br /> <br /> Ron Liebman becomes a bravura show as "Batman" and it is a pity his career has not diminished due to this project. <br /> <br /> Gordon Parks directs and, as it happens to Shaft, it looks like it's a strange choice. Yet, this is the previous side of the previous effort and approached with just as much in your face motorism. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie is not available on DVD or VHS in the United States. United Artists really have a jewel on their hands and it's a pity they don't do anything about it.
