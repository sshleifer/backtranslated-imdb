Chang Cheh's "Shaolin Temple" may well be the high-water mark of the Shaw Brothers martial arts movie cycle. This exciting kung fu epic boasts a wonderful cast - a true who is who of the Shaw stable. Although the plot is fairly standard and the combat choreography is as good as usual, it is Cheh's handling of the subject making this movie remarkable and enjoyable. The sense of respect for the history and traditions of the Shaolin Temple is tangible in every frame. Not unlike William Keighley's paean after the fabulous Fighting 69th in the same self-titled movie or John Ford's salute to West Point in "The Long Gray Line", Cheh's Shaolin Temple is a lovingly crafted ode in the same style. <br /> <br /> The cultural correlation I requested is to compare the Shaolin Temple with the Alamo. Watching this movie will give the same admiring and nostalgic feelings that you experienced in school history years ago when you learned of the courage and sacrifice of the damned heroes of the Alamo. At the end of the movie you can also be tempted to call out, remember the Shaolin Temple!
