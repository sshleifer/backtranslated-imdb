This is the best of Shelley Duvall's high-quality series "Faerie Tale Theater". The ugly step-sister is the broadband-quality comedy relief, and Eve Arden is the embodiment of the wicked stepmother. Jennifer Beals does a great job as a straight Cinderella, especially in the garden scene with Matthew Broderick's Prince Charming. Jean Stapleton plays the good-natured mother, but I don't know if I had the character of the "Southern Lady" with some of the lines. Steve Martin's comedy relief as the Royal Orchestra Conductor is characteristic of Martin, but a little bit wrong in the show's flow. <br /> <br /> As is usual with the series, there are several rogue comments being posted to older children (ages 15 and up). With a few small bumps, the performance flows well and they are still happy. Children up to the age of 8 will continue to watch it after the parents have become tired - I found 3 times a day to be a little too much.
