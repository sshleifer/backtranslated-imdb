Excellent. Initially, I thought Amrita Pritam's communist handrails and Dr Dwivedi's nationalist handrail would be more open-minded than novel, but when I read the novel, I was surprised to find it reversed. <br /> <br /> Kudos to marita pritam because it is not pseudo-sec and Dr Dwivedi should be objective. This film becomes sensitive in a sensitive way. Accidents from any war have said women like a poet and this film embodies it. It is also a sad commentary on the Hindu psyche because they cannot guard against kidnappers of their girls or the Hindu brother who can only burn the fields of his malice. On the other hand, it also shows economic corners behind partition or in the fact that girls were kidnapped in the first place. I think kidnappers thought they would become legal owners of homes and therefore new governments by kidnapping girls. They will not be able to ask them to return the houses. This separate should greet the courage of characters from Puro and her Bhabhi. They are two simple town girls who are impossible from the outside world and can dare to come back after being defamed. Because there are many documented cases when such women are not accepted by their families in India. <br /> <br /> No wonder it needs a woman to understand the pain of other women.
