In Lizzie Borden's "Love Crimes" (1992), Sean Young plays a sharp D.A. in Atlanta. She is a loner who engages herself too deeply in the case of a man (Patrick Bergin) who acts as a well-known fashion photographer and seduces women, compromises their photos and then releases them. <br /> <br /> Of course, this difficult loneliness decides to enter the life of the false shutterbug by setting him as his prey, with the intention of bringing him to justice. They meet, they make love, then the next thing she knows, she's about his lap, gets spanked. (Note: The thrilling scene is only in the "unprecedented" version of this movie. The R-rated version removes it and several other scenes that make the plot brighter.) This psychological thriller contains several scenes of female nudity and disturbing images . as Bergin chases one of his victims behind the room and hits her on a rowing crop. <br /> <br /> As a thrill, Love Crimes is at its best when Sean Young plays and cat plays with Bergin, trying to catch him in an incriminating act. It's a pity the movie doesn't end, it just stops. It's true. Director Lizzie Borden may just be out of the story to tell, but after 92 minutes the credit roll is, and we have a mysterious "what just happened?" confusion. <br /> <br /> The deployment of Young's plan is being played in attractive style, but the lack of a coherent end will be a devastation for some viewers. <br /> <br /> Then (daneldorado @ yahoo.com)
