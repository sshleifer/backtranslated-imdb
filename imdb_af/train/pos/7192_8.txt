If you're a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, or an action in general, it's a must-see. Targeted by the republic's bait of William Witney and John English, starring Reed Hadley as Don Diego / Zorro, this series delivers! I will not do to the plot (caring, talking less, fighting more); What really matters here is Hadley's excellent interpretation of the character / s and the stunts of Dale van Sickel and Yakima Canutt. <br /> <br /> *** STOP SPOILERS FOLLOW *** <br /> <br /> You can see the influence this movie had on Lucas and Spielberg. Zorro gets caught up in the original version of the Star Wars garbage substitute in one chapter, trapped on a rope bridge A Doom Temple in another, doing a Raiders horse-transfer transfer and even flowing through a tunnel while knocking the bad people over a big water tank and flooding the tunnel behind him, just like Mola Ram does to Indy in Temple of Doom. In addition to all this, the whip action is tremendous, as Zorro disarms villains, swings to safety, and so on. With its reliable eyelashes. Most of the sword work is fair to paralyze, except for Chapter 1, which features a heavy sword in a canteen choreographed by sword / stunt legend Ralph Faulkner, who makes a scarce appearance as the evil Rodriguez. It was the first series I have ever seen, at Matinee at the Bijou when I was a child and I have been joining them ever since. <br /> <br /> Zorro's Fighting Legion delivers "Z" goods!
