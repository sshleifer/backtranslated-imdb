Like an aging rocker, call this movie Heep and Quo - my 2 favorite bands ever - but with the incredible cast (all) - and the fantastic story - I just love this piece of creative genius. I can't recommend it any more - and Mick Jones added so much (Foreigner lead and primary songwriter with the biggest rock singer ever - Lou Gramm) - I watched this great work more than 10 times - Bill Nighy - what a voice - and Jimmy Nail - talent of every pore - then Astrid .... and Karen ..... the more an aging rocker can ask! 10/10 - bloody brilliant. <br /> <br /> Alastair, Perth, West Oz, originally from Windsor, England.
