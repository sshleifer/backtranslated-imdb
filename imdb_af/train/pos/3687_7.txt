Greetings again from the darkness. 18 directors of 18 seemingly unrelated vignettes about love in the city of lights. A very unusual format that takes some of the segments to fit as a viewer. We are so accustomed to character development over a 2-hour movie, it's a bit disarmed because it's in an 8-minute segment. <br /> <br /> The idea is 18 love / relationship stories in 18 different weeks of this beautiful city. Of course, some stand out better than others and some go for comedy, while others focus on dramatic emotion. Some well-known directors are involved, including: The Coen Brothers, Wes Craven, Alfonso Cuaron, Alexander Payne, Gus Van Sant and Gurinda Chadha. Many well-known faces also make representations: Steve Buscemi, Barbet Schroeder, Catalina Sandino Moreno, Ben Gazzara, Gena Rowlands, Gerard Depardieu, Juliette Binoche, Willem Dafoe, Nick Nolte, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Bob Hoskins. <br /> <br /> One of the best segments involves a mime, and then another mime and the naughty, but happy, young boy of the two mimes. Key roles also include a red crosshair, cancer, divorce, sexual fantasy, the death of a child and many other topics. Don't miss Sideways director Alexander Payne as Oscar Wilde. <br /> <br /> The diversity of the segments makes it interesting to watch, but as a movie it can't be called good. Still, it is very viewable and a nice pace change for the regular filmmaker.
