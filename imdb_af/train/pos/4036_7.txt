Good luck finding this movie to even watch - it hasn't been released on tape or DVD yet. I released in the early 70's. It was fortunate to capture it through American Cinematheque's conservation efforts, and it has many tangible moments that have remained with me for thirty years. <br /> <br /> No reason to repeat Rwint's not accurate comment here. As a chosen director shortly after the rising success of Five Easy Pieces, Jack N said he had managed the best possible budget effort, and it certainly shows up in the wander and wobbly that some might have used. . But it's also an unforgettable icon of the time: the very intense clashes of the late 60s college sport, student movements, sexual revolution and more. <br /> <br /> Why does this movie see? It was probably a pioneer in some scenes: the fresh male band in the post-match showers; Karen Black's scene with Carpet in the car will catch you a bit of the wait - but it's the first use of a word I haven't seen in the film before; and the accidental and unexpected use of nudity in general. There are probably others I omit. <br /> <br /> Look for a nice surprise from a young Cindy Williams in one of her first films; a thin David Ogend bulls; Mike Warren fresh from his powder blue UCLA uniform and ready for a dark blue uniform; Robert Towne - Actor; and many people just play themselves. <br /> <br /> Now, any connection between Harry Gittes' name, Robert Towne, and a certain character in Chinatown and the Two Jakes? <br /> <br /> It gets a "7" based on Karen Black. You will see why.
