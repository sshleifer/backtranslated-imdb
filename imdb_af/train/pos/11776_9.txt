Chuck Jones' Hare Conditioned is a fast, often hilarious cartoon. Pitting Bugs Bunny against a strange, yellow-colored apartment manager who wants to stuff him up, 'Hare Conditioned' makes full use of his multi-purpose environment. The rush takes Bugs and his descendants through a variety of departments, leading to an inspired gag in which they quickly come from different departments, with which clothes are associated with that part of the store. However, this huge gag is married to a truly inspired sequel in which elevators are involved, in which Bugs, who are disguised as lifts, try the store manager to pick up or drop carelessly at the wrong time. This is a brilliant climactic set that unfortunately makes way for a non-funny final gag. By that time, however, 'Hare Conditioned' made its mark as one of the great hunting films bursting with wild energy. Since Bugs are more refined in some of the other cartoons of this era, "Hare Conditioned" has shown that it can still be as attractive as a more anarchic character.
