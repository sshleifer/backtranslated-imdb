The kids I took to this movie loved it (four kids, 9-12 years old, they would have given it 10 stars). Emma Roberts was spectacular in the title role. (Expect to see more of this next generation Roberts in the future.) After being generally exposed to people like Britney Spears, Lindsay Lohan and Paris Hilton, seeing a girl who doesn't look like she was refreshing was refreshing. the work worked. streets. It also enjoys a supporting role including Tate Donovan, Rachel Leigh Cook, Barry Bostwick and Monica Parker (with Bruce Willis cameo). Final collection: Nice movie. <br /> <br /> (Note: I didn't read the book series, so my comment is based on the merits of the movie alone.)
