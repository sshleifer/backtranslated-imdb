... so what's in those who miss 10 minutes that were so horrible that they had to cut them out of the original movie? We were in the film production code for three years. Barbara Stanwyck was in the original play, but here Carole Lombard plays Maggie King. Co-star Fred MacMurray is probably best known for "Double Indemnity", with Stanwyck as well as his hit program "My Three Sons". Keep an eye on a young Dorothy Lamour (Bob Hope movies) and the incredible Franklin Pangborn, who just tore just about every movie on tape. Of course he works in the beauty salon on the ship! Add the sublime Charles Butterworth and Anthony Quinn. Good timing and smart trigger at the start. Maggie's friend Ella is played by Jean Dixon, who was the best friend in "Holiday" and "My Man Godfrey". In 'Swing High', Maggie meets the tourist a soldier who leaves the army. Maggie misses her boat when it leaves the harbor and becomes entangled with the soldier. The blunt 20-something Quinn has a small scene at the local pub in Panama where Johnson (MacMurray) plays the trumpet. Maggie, Harry (Butterworth), and Skid band together and try to figure out how to get back to the states. A few good songs by Lamour. Good (but short) performance by Cecil Cunningham as "Murph", the wise, helpful owner of the local salon in Panama. While others were complaining about how bad it was, it wasn't so terrible and even a little exotic, with the fake Central America setting for the first half of the movie.
