When I rented this movie to see it, I knew it wouldn't be a Mindbender movie. Instead, I thought of it as an unbelief of reality where someone would get a serious knock. And you know what it worked for. Kurt Russel did what I was already a remarkable role in portraying the emotional soldier he was. I recommend this movie if you are out with the boys and want to watch a good action movie.
