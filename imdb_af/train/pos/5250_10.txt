The world consists of two different types of movie players. There are "English Patient" types, which cannot be bothered to enjoy anything that is not enough to show on PBS, and there are the "Happy Gilmore" types, one and a half of whom genital points are worth $ 7. <br /> <br /> Certainly, there is a ton of gray area, but you know on which side you lean. If you are an English Patient, save your time, save your money and save us all "Oh, this movie is so childish and stupid" comment. I know, you enjoy a movie you don't like every time, and everybody who likes it, but maybe you just like this time. <br /> <br /> But if you're a happy Gilmore type. .. go see this one ... You will find it hilarious. Tim Meadows has created a hilarious character, and Will Farrell remains hilarious in just about everything he does. Go look it out. You'll be glad you did. And that's right.
