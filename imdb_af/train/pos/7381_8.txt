IVAN (Marco Ricca) and GILBERTO (Alexandre Borges) are partners in a company with ESTEVO (George Freire), but the first one is contracting a professional killer, ANISIO, to kill ESTEVO (the plot, at least in the beginning , don't explain why). The man does this and, after receiving his money, he starts the two partners extortion, which appears in their company and says he wants a job there (as supervisor or something?). At the same time, he meets MARINA (Mariana Ximenes), daughter of ESTEVO, and starts to dance with her! <br /> <br /> In a story like this, where crime, corruption, betrayal and extortion go hand in hand, no one is innocent or can be victimized, except on MARINA, which is the only one who does not know what's going on and nobody betrayed ?? <br /> <br /> This film shows with sarcasm the sad and brutal reality that exists in the great metropolis such as SÃ£o Paulo, where crime is every day's presence. We can feel irony, but also truth in characters like ANISIO (brilliantly played by Paulo Miklos), who make extortion to the guys who paid him without a whim and even flirt with the man of the man he killed! He really has to be a monster to do such a thing, but of course I know there are people like him out there, in Brazil or anywhere else? <br /> <br /> It's a very good movie, cruel but truth, about a sad reality ?? The acting is great and the soundtrack too.
