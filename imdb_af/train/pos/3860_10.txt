In the Netherlands, a gay writer gives Gerard (Jeroen Krabbe) lecture. He stays overnight with a beautiful wife Christine (Renee Soutendijk) and has sex with her (by thinking she is a boy). He plans to go the next day, but gets a look at a photo of Christine's daughter-in-law Herman (Thom Hoffman) and decides to stay trying for him. Then things get strange. <br /> <br /> A large X-rated art house hit the US in 1983. Why was it rated X? Let's see ... there is strangulation, full frontal male and female nudity, castration, mutilation, simulated sex, a scene in a church with a cross that will shock most people, a gay sex scene in a crib ... and that's all a comedy !!!!! Paul Verhoeven made it to "Spetters". "Spetters" were attacked by the critics because they are extremely sexual sequences and condemned as rubbish. So, Verhoeven filled this film with many obvious symbols. The critics would think it was art and praise it. He was right! Critics loved the movie and did not realize that Verhoeven had played a big joke on them. Still, it's a good movie. <br /> <br /> It is beautifully shot by Jan de Bont (now a director himself) and there is so much symbolism and clear "hidden" layers in the dialogue that you never get bored. All the plays are wonderful - Krabbe plays a horrible horrible character, but (somehow) you root him; Soutendijk is just beautiful to look at and plays her part perfectly. The little smile she gives when Gerard accepts to stay with her is chilling; Hoffman is extremely attractive with a good body - he deserves credit to do the church series and go into the manger with Krabbe. <br /> <br /> It's not for people who are easily offended or poor at heart, but if you like extreme movies that challenge you (like me), that's for you! A 10 all the way.
