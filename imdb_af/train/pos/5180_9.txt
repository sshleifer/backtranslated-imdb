There is this private campsite in Plymouth, Massachusetts. It has been busy since 1959. My grandparents were of the founding members, my parents had a website that started in 1965 and my two brothers now have places there. <br /> <br /> It has nothing to do with the movie directly. Be with me.) <br /> <br /> I've been to Blueberry Hill summers when I was five when I was eighteen, and that's for people like me talking to this movie: the one for whom ” a group camp in the woods, as my fiance tells me, "the good and happy place." If you have never experienced the lifestyle, the Indian Summer will probably be lost to you; Don't bother. It is not fast, it does not have fast cuts, the plots are not broken, it has no explosions, such a dramatic tension as there is, is soft, there is no A list actors. There's no quick fire just to show how smart the screenwriters are (unlike maybe Kimberley Williams's killer about how her fiancé shouldn't overpower his toys.) This is not the least this movie is about, Any more as The Godfather is a painter just because it has a lot on the screen. <br /> <br /> But Indian Summer is Godfather's polar opposite. If you've experienced the lifestyle, see this movie. read more, just do it. <br /> <br /> For me this is a 9/10 movie.
