IQ is a wonderful original romantic comedy that captures the greatest and deepest thinking thinking of the 20th century as Cupid's helpers. The composition of heart and mind is the central theme of this light but considerate film. You don't really know how to respond, because part of the time you see, big scientists see stupid things to nurture emerging love, but other times you hear them discuss some of the deepest puzzles of space / time of our age. The end result is a fun movie with surprises. Walter Matthau is a perfect Einstein, Meg Ryan creates a peculiar mathematician with a scattering, and Tim Robbins brings to life the contradictions of a poorly educated man who fascinated science. Together they create a passing journey through love and science, mind and heart.
