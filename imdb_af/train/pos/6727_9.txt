A few days ago I realized that the creators of this movie put a play on words in his title. This movie is not mainly about the act of 'driving giants', but mostly about the people who are the giants of the sport, RIDING giants, are changing the emphasis. <br /> <br /> In my teens, I stayed one block from the Wedge, one of the most difficult and best places in the world. I was surfing 15 to 18 feet, and on several occasions drove and hammered with 10 and 12 foot waves. That experience is why I am in the awesome awe of the surfers in this movie. The idea that Jeff Clark, for all appearances of a normal mortal, can get away for more than a decade to drive Maverick's AT HIMSELF, is beyond my grasp. The first safety rule of any water sport is: "Never navigate / dive / swim by yourself." He went where sensible people didn't want to, and lived to tell about it. I wouldn't go out there if the water was 75 degrees and the sharks were all left. <br /> <br /> In the hot water world: the first shot of the waves at Jaws always makes the skin all over my body. It's not just scary waves, it's uncontrolled bowel evacuation waves. When we see that Laird Hamilton not only survives 40 to 60 foot waves, I can barely type the numbers. But I actually work the faces like a fun day at Rincon, I'm blown away. There is a commitment and focus in big golfers that are comparable to those of anyone in the world. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie. I gave it a 9 instead of a 10, because it fails to mention that there are big golfers around the world outside the Hamilton / Kalama team, and I think they deserve to mention it. Splice in Ken Bradshaw outside Log Cabins and a 10 it is!
