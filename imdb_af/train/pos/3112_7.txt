I watched both Bourne Identity and Bourne Supremacy on DVD before watching it in the theater. I waited for them to start filming. I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> Minor spoilers below- <br /> <br /> Overall it was good, but it also lacked the continuity of the first two. Identity and domination both flowed gracefully between adrenaline speeding action and introspective drama. This movie sometimes felt bare. The plot-building times were slightly stretched. This caused the following action to feel frenetic. <br /> <br /> Camera: Speaking of frenetic, the brand Greengrass shaky cam was present and very annoying to me. I know she was talking about the nausea on the message board, but that doesn't mean it's not relevant. All the martial arts trained by the actors are completely wasted. The ridiculous camera cut and wrap camera destroys most of the battles in the movie. It's a cheap, study-leader trick to make the movie's feel unpredictable. I would expect the techniques to be used in some horror flicks made for high school children, but not in this classic, adult action series. Too much extreme proximity too. Do some framework. Get some interesting shots. Constant close-up feels like lazy to me. <br /> <br /> Story: The story was VERY confusing. They pushed new names and faces on you. Made me feel like you're getting into a movie late and knowing you've missed some important information. Facade rushed or compressed for time reasons. However, after catching, the story is pretty good. It's nice to head to Bourne. However, I didn't care for the whole last Supremacy scene (Landy / Bourne on the phone) in the middle of Ultimatum thing. It basically makes the movie a half prequel. I thought it was uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> Cast / Characters: The star of the movie is the action. Obviously there are only two originals left. Bourne and Nicky Parsons. Those working together were strange to me. I think they just wanted to give Bourne someone to protect and trust. Unless I completely missed out on anything, they never tell you why they've teamed up. The other killers in the movie were pretty quiet. It felt like Gilroy / Greengrass / who didn't want to leave open points. Understandable but disappointing. Seriously, Damon with Clive Owen in Identity and Marton Csokas in Supremacy. These scenes were phenomenal. These killers are as unimportant as Castel (the first fella Bourne battles in Identity). The roll cube in general has dropped as the series goes on. Clive Owen was almost an afterthought. It is some force for the first role. Second, they basically trade Chris Cooper for Joan Allen .... Not exactly right. This one deals with Brian Cox and Franka Potente for 3 actors to be named later. Nothing against David Strathairn, Scott Glenn, or Albert Finney, but they are not the first names to come up with this kind of series. Apart from a few pauses that seem too long, the play was right. <br /> <br /> Overall, it was successful. Feel like they wanted the series. If they cut or rearranged the slower parts, Scott Glenn's part completely eliminated, eliminated and removed the camera from the seizure victim. It would have been perfect. <br /> <br /> ENDING SPOILER <br /> <br /> I don't see why they leave Bourne alive. It was my understanding that it was the conclusion. They clearly referred to the start of the series with its silhouette floating motionless. I thought it would be. A complete circle type end. I thought Nicky was already responding to the news report. <br /> <br /> SPOILER SPECIFIC WARNING - MOVIE ENTRY INSIDE - <br /> <br /> Bourne's last line at the end. "Look at this. Look at what they are giving you." With the quote of the first killer he killed, I love it. The final scene was wonderful. (Except that it was Vosen {Strathairn} who shot at Bourne, why would he do it? Just for revenge? If he was angry enough to kill, Pamela Landy should not shoot after faxing his secret file? Make sense. )
