The movie was great! I can't come across the songs. I think I'm a little too old for musical, but the movie here gets some credit, guys! My favorite was Jack Wild. I'm a British actor lover, you can't keep me from all the pretty young chosen young men. I never knew when Jack was that movie, he was sixteen! He looks like an eleven year old. He's short, that's what helps. Try submitting your responses, posters, so I can relate to your experiences. Oh, and about Oliver Reed, that guy, Bill Sikes, I think the drunk look is really known. Any idea where he used to stand? If so, send it out, I really want to know.
