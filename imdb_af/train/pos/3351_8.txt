Very good western.This was the first time writer Richard Wilson directed a movie, it was also a first for Samuel Goldwyn Junior as a producer. It is a pleasure to see a very young and beautiful Angie Dickinson as a salon girl. Robert Mitchum comes to this town and is appointed as a town voter, but people are worried that he will go too far, also about the damage he will do to the town's businesses. There are some similarities in the story with "Warlock" made in 1959. This movie has a very fast and exciting fit, it really keeps you on the edge.
