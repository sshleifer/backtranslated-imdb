As predictable as a Hallmark card, but not without merit, The Rookie makes a solid outing. Dennis Quaid, the most reasonable jock actor working today, is absolutely perfect as the science teacher baseball player Jimmy Morris has changed. The film is never put down for the kids, as expected from a G-rated movie. As a sports film, The Rookie is one of the best I've seen since any given Sunday.
