Samuel Fuller is an interesting filmmaker, mainly because he had very conflicting politics in his films. While "Shock Corridor" and "The Naked Kiss" represent the hypocrisy and laziness of America and "The Big Red One" was an effective portrait of the horrors of war, Merrill's Marauders painted war as essential hell and "Pickup on South Street "is about the dangers of communist spies. All his films make for a very entertaining performance, and even though he was often a b-movie maker, Fuller was just as good as any of the great studio contractors. "Pickup on South Street" is no exception, and in spite of the dated themes, the film style is remarkable before its time. It is also a very fast, stiff and sometimes brutal movie noir. <br /> <br /> The play across the board is fantastic. Richard Widmark makes a big anti-hero and Jean Peters is quite sexy like a girl working for her communist spy fellow. The show stealer, however, is Thlema Ritter, in an absolutely stunning performance as a police stool. The corners of the Fuller workers are wonderful, making the acting rows increasingly exciting and brutal (it's very violent for his time). The camera constantly moves just as Tarantino and his school would do forty years later. "Pickup on South Street" is a good action-speed noir thriller. "Shock Corridor" remains my favorite Fuller movie, but it's a very close second. (8/10)
