Okay. This movie is a pure pleasure. It has everlasting so violent terror, with a little tension and a very black comedy. The dentist really starts to lose his mind and it's nice to see him do it. This movie is for some people, though. Either you will love it completely or you will completely hate it. A great movie to rent and watch when you don't have anything else to do. Also recommended: Psycho III
