The Plainsman is an entertaining western, undoubtedly a classic, actually actually even today. Gary Cooper is Wild Bill Hickok, perfect for the role, along with John Wayne and James Stewart, they were the best actors playing Western heroes in their generation. Jean Arthur is big like Calamity Jane, no one I know has played better than her. Even if it may not be historically accurate, the movie is most important about Hickok and about the time it takes. Sometimes you have to sacrifice history to make your point and that is what DeMille is doing here. Hickok's friendship with Buffalo Bill, selling guns to the Indians by a big manufacturer to compensate for the losses he would have suffered as a result of the end of civil war, Custer and Little Big Horn, the uncomfortable relationship between Buffalo Bill's wife, a religious woman, with Hickok a murdered man, also the unusual love affair between Hickok and Calamity, makes it all 'The Plainsman' a non-conventional and interesting movie. Anthony Quinn has a very short appearance, which already shows how a good actor he will become. Much care has been taken to show the original guns of that time.
