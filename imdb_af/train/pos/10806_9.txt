I felt this movie throughout. I am impressed with Russell Crowe's talent for developing his relationship with Lillie, such a typical Aussie blend of gentle approach, a little self-deprecation and very persistent. Actually loved cinematography and direction. Pace was just right and the portrayals of almost all characters were impressive. <br /> <br /> Gosh didn't even shine Russell's talent in 1993! .. and I still see gladiator.
