An old family story tells that two young girls are being brought to life by their grandfather 16 years later than he predicted. <br /> <br /> People are murdered and blood is rubbish and rotten shame is over and naked bodies are being enjoyed. <br /> <br /> Kitty (Barbara Bouchet) is the suspect, but we know she's not the killer. Is this Franziska (Marina Malfatti)? Is it Evelyn back from death for revenge? Is it a plot to steal an inheritance? The color is fantastic in this thriller from Emilio Miraglia, which only one other Giallo did, as far as I know. <br /> <br /> The only thing that spoiled the film was the appearance of several frames cut out. Someone called the police, and suddenly they were there to save Kitty.
