Eskimo is a serious film about the cultural divide between an indigenous people and the persuasive white man. Though filmed in a documentary style historically with non-professionals, Eskimo is a skilled production that contains a credible story that the audience wants to see in the final shot. <br /> <br /> The native Eskimo simply has different beliefs and behaviors about women and life, than do the whales that obscure his landscape. Of course, when an Eskimo man loses his partner, other men share their wives with their friend. It is also normal for their women to take the place of the missing spouse. Of course, all of these are in the context of the deserted Arctic environment. The trust Eskimo falls prey to unscrupulous whales (with heavy European accents) who do not regard these natives as their equal. Fraud, drunk orgy, rape and death take place after the Eskimo men left for work on the icy cold sea. Eventually the chief Eskimo (Mala) realized that he was muted and he took revenge. The audience was delighted in the theaters of the 1930s. <br /> <br /> Enter the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the moral dilemma to bring Mala back for trial. The Mounties are played as policemen who know it's not a cut and dry matter. Will the Mounties get their husband? Is it fair to keep Mala a code of conduct outside its traditional community? Is there a way out that Mala doesn't punish? Is it inevitable that the white man's law should prevail? Is there no hope for innocence? <br /> <br /> This is not a good movie, but one that you will enjoy for the depth of the issue being addressed in a completely different environment. I suspect that the filming of the animal sequences has been done before today's indemnity that no one is injured in making the film - so beware of the raw natural series. Highly recommended.
