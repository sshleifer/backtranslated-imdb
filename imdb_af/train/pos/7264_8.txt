I have to agree with Cal-37 it's a great movie, especially for the family, Kelly Linch is beautiful, the girl is very talented and cute, of course, Jim Belushi earned his strips! But I really want to be the piano song, if you are a musician or not just watching this movie, you will know what it is. <br /> <br /> "You're Nobody until someone loves you" Written by Russ Morgan, Larry Stock, and James Cavanaugh. <br /> <br /> Enjoy fun <br /> <br /> See you, <br /> <br /> Nelson
