After reading only two of the commentaries here, such as a lifelong Bronte fan, which began with Olivier's Heathcliff and lasting many versions of Charlotte's "Rochester", it is more than an eye-opener to see that it is UNSung Bronte -sister who occupies the trio for the male-chauvinist period. Of course, the "miracle" in all three versions of 19th-century British household is that the "girls" have been "spiders" and their only realistic brushes with "men" were their past father and their waste? brother. It eventually said it was ANNE Bronte who proved in her single assessment that the "feminist" point was much better than contemporary types, including the "voice-franchise" ranking. However, history is more than a few that preceded, including the Greek era and Sappho and the likes of an old emperor's Yang Kuei fei. And how about Eva and her apple?
