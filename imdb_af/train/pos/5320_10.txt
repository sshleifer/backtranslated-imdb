I started looking at this movie that didn't expect anything, just another movie to watch, but since the first twenty minutes, the artwork and main character that is enigmatic didn't speak much. I really liked this movie. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie very much, it was dark, beautifully acting and really touching. It is a bit slow but the immersion is complete. The directing was wonderful by letting us know the bits, the story that led to Joey's conviction and his life behind bars. The music was very good and very well recorded on the screens. The end was unexpected with a twist I didn't see. It's not the kind of movie we see regularly.
