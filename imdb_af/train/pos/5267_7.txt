Apparently Ruggero Deodato earlier figured out that his story would not work if he had approached it seriously, so he decided to upload it. The result is a movie that can be viewed as either a ridiculous sword-and-magic epic or as a very entertaining comedy! And I think I'm going the second way. The short gore moments are well done, the Paul Brothers mock the material (they even blow in one scene!), And Eva La Rue is also a beautiful, enthusiastic, good performance as the girl. that goes with the "boys" tag. Plus, where can you see the inside of a dragon like a disco? (***)
