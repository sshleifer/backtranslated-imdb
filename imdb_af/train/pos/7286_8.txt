I had a good time viewing this photo, and was wonderfully surprised by its more erudite features. First, the film was undoubtedly made cheap with its cardboard sets, limited sets and creative scientific props. The actor ranges from very poor (the two strippers), barely professional (Herb Evers as the leading man), gothic overstatement (Leslie Daniels as assistant Kurt) to live with Virginia Leith for the first time as the headless victim. her will to the benefit of science and her fianc√©'s funny passions. However, the writing is very good and the dialogue is fantastic for a movie of this ilk. Issues abound as to what role science and medicine have in our lives and what their boundaries should be. This film is a film in many ways. However, do not be deceived by his right intention. It's a funny story about a man who is busy with his medical science skills, which merges his dead friend's head with the perfect body, creating the perfect woman for a man with the best of body and soul . Another very bright aspect of the film is the sax music that strongly resonates every time the doctor explores the town for female beauty.
