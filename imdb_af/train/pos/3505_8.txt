I have no idea how IMDb reviews sort, but I know that, as usual on Amazon.com, there is a striking number of very negative reviews for this movie, repeating the same and somewhat clear points, almost verbatim. A campaign? Only IMDb knows. <br /> <br /> As for this movie: it's good. It's a funny, cute and very straight film. <br /> <br /> It's been over a decade since I worked in Brooklyn, living in Queens and visiting family in the South Bronx. But I didn't find anything out of sight or exploitation about these children. Is the grandmother a bizarre character? Yup. Understand the dialogue and plot it? Yes, thankful, they do it. Are other movies in the LES and with Dominican / Puerto Rican children possible? For sure. Does this make this movie a crime? as some of the (in my eyes, astroturf) comment would suggest? Rare. Let a thousand blooms bloom. <br /> <br /> It's better than any episode of Degrassi JR. High or Degrassi High. Gather at the equation, but we never had it and I am touched in the core by the film's humility of purpose and gentle spirit. <br /> <br /> It says I want to know the background behind all this setbacks! :-D
