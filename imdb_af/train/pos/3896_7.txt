Some people loved "The Aristocrats" and others hated it and often went out in the middle. Reactions to Eddie Izzard will probably not be so bad - if you can handle a transvestite comedian (who says he likes girls) and has a vocabulary that makes, we should use enough of the "f" word his program would have be a long beep if it is offered on network television. Many of Izzard's fans are so dedicated that they see no mistakes whatsoever in his performances. On the other hand, I thought this show was sometimes flatter than Izzard's chest, but more often than not funny, and in patches, absolutely hilaries. He has a way of linking routines of routines early in the show to his later routines. He's not a storyteller. He's not a joke. He's not a frenetic fantasy like Robin Williams. He plays with ideas, some of which work and some - a routine with the San Francisco cable car and Alcatraz - for example, are completely unfriendly. However, he has a way of gracefully moving past the cleft routines and expanding the one being connected. I gave this view a 7 and can be convinced to increase it to an 8. But a 10? Not at all.
