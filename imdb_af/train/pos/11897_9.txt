It's a nice little horror movie that will appreciate fans of indie movies. It has good acting, many gore, and a decent plot. One will be reminded of movies like The Hills Have Eyes and Pumpkinhead. Clearly, the budget wasn't that big, but the film really does have atmosphere and solid performances by the actors, which apparently are lacking in many of today's big budget special effects-filled movies. The film really moves together and there is excellent direction and good camera work. There are no wasted scenes, so the length of the movie is a bit short. In addition, it seems as if the end is opening a successor, which would also be very interesting. So grab popcorn, turn off the lights and enjoy it.
