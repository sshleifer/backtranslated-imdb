It was just another wonderful movie of the Berlin festival. But unlike "Yes", by Sally Potter, which I saw a few days earlier, after which I left the cinema, I had a strong desire to embrace the whole world and was just happy to live . This time the opposite thing happened. : There was something that dragged me, and the air suddenly became cold and difficult to breathe. It was as if suddenly there was nothing left, all hope, all future was taken to a dead end. <br /> <br /> Nina's life was gloomy and shut, but then one beautiful day, the kind of lights that opened the horizon appeared and she believed in fulfilling her dreams. There was no one on her side, but suddenly she found a companion, just out of nothing, someone who could share her hidden feelings. This person was Toni, a vagabond girl who doesn't look like any roots, just like herself. <br /> <br /> But the movie's title is "Ghosts", and ghosts appear and disappear as they please, there's no way to keep them? Spirits also represent the hidden fantasies of people, strange ideas that take your mind and are only perceived by yourself, hiding from all other people. Françoise, a French woman, is the victim of such ghosts. She once lost her daughter in Berlin, who was apparently robbed of her in a supermarket in one moment. Now is the time, and Françoise is back in Berlin, still looking for the missing child. <br /> <br /> Nina can be that kid, after all, she has the same scar on her ankle and the heart-shaped birth point between her shoulder blades that proves her true identity. <br /> <br /> And Nina accepts the idea. After all, she is not just in the desperate need of a companion, she also longs for a mother. But in the end, she was emptied, Toni disappeared with a man, and her supposed mother seemed to be a sick woman. "Marie is dead," says Françoise's husband, and the statement can no longer be disillusioned. Nina is just a "niña", a girl without a name, there is no hope for any divine fulfillment. There is no Marie in this world to accompany our lonely lives. Therefore, in the end, we see Nina alone, walking along the road that opened in front of her, in a future that looks bleak and uncertain.
