I love this movie a lot, I watched it over and over. I don't see why anyone would think this movie wasn't good. Maybe you saw better or whatever, I love it personally. It's one of my favorite movies and I'm not Hindi, but I love it. It may be a bit like Pretty Woman, but I didn't see it and I don't think it's better than that. I don't know why you squander it all, but maybe you have a good reason, but I think I said it enough, but I absolutely love this movie and for those who say it's not good at all, then wonder I why you watched it and what movies you considered good. As for everyone I watched, they also enjoyed it, and it surprised me that many people don't like it. As for Rani Mukherjee (I think that's how you play her game), she's very beautiful and my favorite actress ever!
