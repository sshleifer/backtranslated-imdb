This movie is about subtlety and effort to navigate the equally moving boundaries of mores, racial relations and desire. Granted, it's not a movie for everyone. There is no car hunt, no buildings explode, no murders. The drama lies in the tension presented by tins, minimal gestures, spatial boundaries, lighting and remaining things - sometimes very apparent - unseen. It's about identity, memory, community, belonging. The different parts of the film work together to strengthen the search engines of self and others, identity, desire, boundaries and loss. This will reward the attention and sensitive viewer. This will prejudice those who need explosive, massive, spicy action in their palace. It's a beautifully filmed man's story. This is all.
