Any child who is old enough to sit in front of a screen is absolutely captivated by the beautifully drawn images and wonderful music in this warm and humorous repetition of the Grimms fairy tale. They sing 'Bibbity-Bobbity-Boo' before they can even formulate a complete sentence and continue to sing it to their dying days. It is a classic for all children, especially the adults who are young at heart.
