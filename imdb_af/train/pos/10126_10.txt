Much has been said about the Shinjuku Triad Society as the first true "Miike" movie and I thought this kind of description might be a cliché. But, like all clichés, it is based on the truth. All the Miike brands are here, the violence, the black humor, the homosexuality, the taboo testing and the difficult central character. Shinjuku, however, is one of Miike's most perfectly formed films. He said in an interview that if he made it again, it would be different, but not necessarily better. I think what he means is that the movie has a really fascinating energy and rugged edge that looks so fresh that it can't record a more visual or technically complex movie, but can't repeat or improve the purity of this movie no. <br /> <br /> As you might expect, the violence is completely visceral, bloodshot and gross addictions are complemented by a fantastic scene in which a woman hit a chair over her face. (Only a Miike movie can get you away with such a sentence.) The movie has a fantastic fit, unlike Dead of Alive, which starts and ends strongly and drops in the middle. Death or Alive also deals with similar problems. Miike is clearly worried about the relations between Japanese and Chinese in the post-war period and this emotional topic is well dealt with here. The central character really comes to life when you begin to understand his past. <br /> <br /> I can't praise Shinjuku's praise. I don't want to throw away too much. It is Miike before he starts using CGI to animate his films and is almost reminiscent of something like Kitano's Sonatine. The central characters are excellently realized and the final twist ensures that once the movie is finished, you will be able to work it all out again.
