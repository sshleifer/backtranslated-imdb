It's one of Hollywood's most portable gems ever made. - A young British fighter from World War II, whose plane is about to crash, has radio contact with a young American woman comforting the brave pilot because he knows he will be dead in minutes . For some reason, the man who is definitely dead has to leave the wreck and eventually learn that he was meant to report to heaven. When a messenger is sent to ask the pilot to accompany him to heaven, the man refuses and claims that his "day in court" should argue his case. The man claims that his situation changed during the last moments of his earthly life, that he fell in love and therefore became another person who had the chance to live. <br /> <br /> The "heavenly court" is a fun entertainment! The "jury of peers" announcement is a definite highlight. The story, as fantastic as it looks, is a pleasurable one and will keep you spellbound for almost 2 hours of playing time. The final scene is simply beautiful and needs a Kleenex treatment for most viewers. This movie is in my personal favorite top 10, my highest recommendation!
