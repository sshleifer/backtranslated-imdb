I remember seeing this movie as a kid. I don't remember where I saw it. I had been 14 years old. I thought the movie was incredible and wanted to see it again. It came once on the Kung Fu channel, but I missed it. I was really bummed. This is the best special effect Kung Fu movie I've seen so far! I highly recommend it, and now that I've discovered where I can get it, I can enjoy it again and years later. I also have to check out this Return of the Venom movie, some of which have spoken so much.
