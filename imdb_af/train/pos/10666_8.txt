When I was really interested in movies, at the age of eleven I had a big list of "must see" movies and I would go to Blockbuster and rent two or three per weekend; some of them were not for all audiences and my mom would go nuts. I remember one of those movies on that list was "a Chorus Line" and could never find it; so now to see it is a dream come true. <br /> <br /> Of course I lost the list and I'll do anything to get it back because I think there were some very interesting things to look at there. I mean, take a "Chorus Line", a stage game turn into movie. I know this is something we see a lot these days, but it was a little different. and this movie has something special. <br /> <br /> Today, most of the musicals have made movies, have the chance to give them a free camera, create different scenery and take the characters to different places; A Chorus Line was born at a theater stage as a play and died in the same place as a movie. Following a major audition by recognized choreographer Zach (Michael Douglas), Richard Atenborough directs a large number of dancers while trying to get the job done. <br /> <br /> Everything happens the same day: the stress of not knowing, the stress of learning the numbers, the silent competition between the dancers? And all this happens on stage, where Douglas puts every dancer on the spotlight and they talk about their personal life and their most terrible experiences. There are hundreds of dancers and they are all fantastic, but their list shortens when the hours go by. <br /> <br /> Like a movie, I recently saw a Prairie Home Companion, the broadcast of a radio program, Atenborough dealing here with the problem of continuity. Things are going on or behind the stage, and the time does not seem to stop. Again, I do not if Atenborough has cut much to shoot it, but it certainly does not look like that; And anyway, it's a good directing and editing work (John Bloom) works. But at that stage it is wonderful to do with the camera. With only one institution, Ronnie Taylor's cinematography finds its way, making close-ups for certain characters, zooming in and out, showing the scene from different perspectives, and also giving us a beautiful view of New York. <br /> <br /> In one critical moment, Douglas tells those who remain: "Before we start eliminating: you're all great and I want to hire you all but I can't". It made me think of reality shows today, where the only thing that matters is the singing or dance talent and where the jury always tells the exact words to the participants before some of them leave (even if they are not good). It's difficult, you have to imagine; At least here, where everyone is really great. <br /> <br /> To tell the stories, use the characters songs and in one second the stage takes a new life and it is literally a dream come true. The music by Marvin Hamlisch and the lyrics of Edward Kleban make the theater transition without errors, which shows these dancers' feelings and lets them do the wonderful choreographies by Michael Bennett. The book in theater also becomes a flawless and very short script by Arnold Schulman; which is affecting at times. So if it is not with a song, it will be with a word; but in "A Chorus Line" it is impossible not to be moved. <br /> <br /> During one of the rehearsals in the audition, Cassie, a special dancer played by Alyson Reed, the scene takes Douglas to persuade him. that she can do it. The words "let me dance for you" never sounded honest and more beautiful in music and lyrics.
