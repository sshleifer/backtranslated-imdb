My favorite character in movies, but almost all of them have the character of Zorro a little bit of a mask and if the villain can't tell who is under that cloth, they are brave. <br /> <br /> But in Reed Hadley's "Zorro's Fighting Legion" (series 1939), the mask fills his entire face, making it a real riddle about who Zorro really is. <br /> <br /> But anyway, Zorro is one of the best characters in movies and to update it. I think Anthony Hopkins in "The Mask of Zorro" (1998) is a pleasure. <br /> <br /> My interest in movies is great, but I have a real taste for the 30's / 40's series .... <br /> <br /> Bond2a
