I saw this movie at a college film festival back in the 70's. I've always been waiting for this movie to come out on video (eventually it's out). It was made in Brazil, so I believed it was not yet made for video. I've been reviewing video stores for the past 15 years and waiting for this outstanding movie to come out! It's one of my all-time favorites - but be warned, it's weird, as Werner Herzog's strange, his strangeness comes from his super-realism. <br /> <br /> The film is based on a true incident, a few centuries ago, in pre-colonial times, when Europeans first met the tribes in the Amazon. A white man is neglected by a wild strain of cannibals as their enemy, and they plan to kill him. Before they sent him, however, they made him part of their tribe (their use). The whole movie is like watching a National Geographic documentary as he becomes an accepted member of their tribe. That's it. Cosmic plot line? No. Intense insight into the variety of human life? Definitely. <br /> <br /> Oh yeah ... be warned ... this movie has definite nudity - it's not a Hollywood movie about noble barbarians ... this movie tells it as it was (read again : National Geographic, Super Realism) <br /> <br />
