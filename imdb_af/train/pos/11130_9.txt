Jon Voight is brilliant in Midnight Cowboy, but Hoffman's performance, but reminiscent of his later turn in Rainman, is the kind of show that makes me watch movies. As a portrayal of a New York character, only Daniel Day Lewis's depiction of Bill Butcher in New York's gangs is similar, and Day doesn't give his character the emotional depth Hoffman gives to Ratso. <br /> <br /> It's typical of Hoffman's way of acting that the actor we tend to identify most with Midnight Cowboy is Voight. I think Hoffman is one of the 4 or 5 best actors in the history of the movie to play the people around him so he increases his performances well above their normal levels. <br /> <br /> Voight's Buck is so naive that he will drive completely out of the movie, except that Ratso pulls him off - pulls him off, but also teaches him a lot about how to survive and, more importantly, how to life. <br /> <br /> Midnight Cowboy is a movie about escape that becomes a movie to find yourself. I think that, like a movie like this, it has a very nice message, no matter how much a loser you can be (Ratso clearly defines "loser"), if you can find a way to get where to be yourself, you have the secret of life and you can even share that insight with someone else. <br /> <br /> I can't help but compare Midnight Cowboy with Klute, a few years later, which I think is more than a movie to find yourself escaping a movie about .
