This, along with "Hare Tonic", is one of the best Bugs cartoons, indeed one of the best mistakes. There are some remarks on how errors in these cartoons are "basically", which means that he has not yet been fully developed. I actually prefer this "basic" version from the mid 40's (Chuck Jones was the best version) which is actually more king-size and much more amusing than the ultimate long-legged version about Yosemite Sam and Daffy Duck. The latter Bugs were too dull and sophisticated to my liking. Also look at "Hair Raising Hare" (1946) and "Rabbit Punch" (1948) for good examples of classic Bugs and classic Chuck Jones.
