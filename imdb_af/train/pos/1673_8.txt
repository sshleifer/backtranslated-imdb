A good Martino excursion, it is an enthusiastic and enjoyable giallo with good looks of beautiful looks and mainly the two guides, George Hilton and Anita Strindberg. <br /> <br /> For me, the jigsaw puzzle of a plot is so complicated and confusing you just sit back and enjoy rather than expect. Just when everyone is resolved, we are again taken on a further series of twists, enjoyable twists. <br /> <br /> Sexy with many gory kills it a fine movie with London, Athens and Greek coastal spots. A super finale that sits on the Aegean rocks turns things up and is fun by everyone.
