I'm not sure I understand where all these enthusiastic anti-grudge people are talking here, maybe it's just that some people want to rant over things. <br /> <br /> The movie was definitely imperfect (unfairly, some might have had problems with the time changes, actors both willing to go places I didn't really want to go, etc.) but IMHO there were things which was more than the imperfections. <br /> <br /> First, I loved the "break of the rules" a bit. Normally when you leave the haunted house, the bad people leave you alone, giving you time to regroup, get friends and find the token, mysteriously paranormal type. NORMAL (semi-spoiler warning) when you have been hiding under the lids, they can only get you through that small opening that you look through. Normally, the ghosts are somehow less creepy because you found out that they were just misunderstood, whether they were liberated or whatever. <br /> <br /> Second, the production was exceptional. While the movie was hardly special, the supernatural pieces were short and short. Well done. <br /> <br /> Probably not the best kind of movie for those who think Freddy and Jason are the ultimate kind of horror (nothing against them, they have their place), but good for those who have taken the conventions for granted and what not having trouble with the time distortions.
