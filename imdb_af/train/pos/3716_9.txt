I was treated to a view of Cracker Bag last night before a preview of Disney's Holes. I don't know who decided to show it, but I'm so glad they did. Cracker Bag is an absolute gem, a picture of Australia in the early 80's as seen by a child's eye. The "conversations" between Eddie and her brother were hilarious and, as with the rest of the film, so true to life. Every shot brought a great sense of nostalgia, as it reminds me of my own childhood (the same age as the director probably helps a bit) and the sound multiplies the feeling. I just hope I'll ever see Cracker Bag again.
