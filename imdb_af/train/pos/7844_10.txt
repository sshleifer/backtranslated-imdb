I really love this show, it's like reading a book and every chapter wants you more. It reminds you of what will happen in the next episode, and the struggle to maintain their friendship throughout the years. After each episode, it ends up in a sweet bitter taste in your mouth and knows that: One - The show was good, you can't wait for the next episode, and it really makes you think about what the twenty years actually have with the friends happen. And two - the fact that the show has been boosted and we will not see the performance as a whole complete. Of course, Fox doesn't know what they did. They claim they are losing viewers in the 18-49 category, they clearly don't know what people want to see if they get rid of a good show like "Reunion". However, I have one question I would like to collect. If they were to bring the show back and it went for another season, how would it work, since each episode is being done in the course of a year and the story is based on what happens in the twenty years? Your responses are most welcome. Bring back Reunion! Bring back Reunion!
