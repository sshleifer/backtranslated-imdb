This version of Bleak House is the best adaptation of a classic novel that is familiar to me. The presentation of the Chancellor's Court as a "character" in the drama is wonderful. The play is wonderful, from the sinister Tulkinghorn to the Dedlocks, Smallweed, Crooke, Miss Flyte and the two young lovers. But it's the spider's web of cancellation that holds the whole thing together, and cinematography is great. What error did the BBC make about copyright, which means that this version cannot be viewed on any video or DVD for many years in the UK? I tried to figure them out, but faced a stone wall. In the end, I got a DVD copy of Canada.
