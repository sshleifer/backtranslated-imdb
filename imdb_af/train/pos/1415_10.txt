I saw the German version of the film in German television and I was very surprised. I usually like documentaries, but I can't remember seeing one that is better than 'Earth'. I knew about the screens of Youtube videos I found through random browsing. I also remember that parts of the movie have been seen on multimedia stores, which are displayed on high-definition TVs. After watching the movie, it is clear to me why the footage is so popular with Youtube users and multimedia retail managers: It's just as wonderful and spectacular that you can't help but watch the screen, no matter what whether you are generally interested in nature documentary or not. <br /> <br /> Without hesitating a 10 out of 10. There are probably more exciting movies, but in the case of documentaries, 'Earth' is definitely one of the best of its genre.
