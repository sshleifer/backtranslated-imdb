Financially captured Paramount has packed all the points for this '34 stage adjustment entry ': big budget, big cast, excessive production and director Mitch Leisen. What happened? Two things: Busby Berkeley didn't work for the out-of-focus rocks and a murder murder copy that didn't deserve to be in the same trash, like the worst Charlie Chan's first street concept. I have to believe that the cut was Leisen's hands, as the big Duke Ellington's number was badly chopped, but that doesn't mean it's not worth it. The 'Sweet Marijuana' number with topless chorus girls is a thought blower, considering the imminent production code and it also has the overwhelming Toby Wing (who unfortunately had horrible lines and wore the prototype dumb blonde) as a chorion hot is for an otherwise busy Jack Oakie. Carl Brisson's play is faint like Melba Toast, but he is a capable singer. MacLaglen reaches for new plateaus as a stereotypical stupid detective. And try to put Lucy in the chorus. It amounts to 7.0 as a curiosity. Feb 2010 reconsider: I recently watched the movie again and now feel I was wrong to deny the lack of Busby Berkeley production numbers. I can understand Leisen's argument for more realistic production numbers within the context of the plot. However, I still have major editing problems. Paramount, the most tremendous big studio in town, had major problems with the Production Code in the worst possible time in its history, financially, and expressed all the steps on this one (see also 1934's Search for Beauty). A must see for pre-code buffs.
