I have no idea what people are complaining about. I saw this movie yesterday and I really liked it. Steen again gave a great character. She was just as good as she was in the first Basic Instinct. She still has the clever but difficult answers. Although Sharon can be 48 years old, she looks great! I don't care if she's as counterfeit as a Barbie. She looks good and that's it. Basic Instinct 2 gives you everything you want from the first. Sex, violence and a good ending that will make you think and talk about it! Half of the people commenting on this movie didn't even see it. So don't listen to them.
