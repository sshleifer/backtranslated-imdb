As I said, four stars are just not enough. It's one of the best movies I've ever seen in my almost 17 years of life. For those who don't really like or understand it, you shouldn't have a real appreciation for art, or you can have a short attention span. <br /> <br /> Even if I didn't see all his movies, I still have to say that it is Spielberg at its peak. It is pretty sad to see that movies are not as good as "The Purple Purple" too often because I think all of us are in desperate need of first-class movie entertainment in these difficult times. <br /> Movies like this are more than movies; they are more valuable artworks. <br /> <br /> The notion that it was nominated for 11 Oscar (even Best Picture of the Year) and did not get one trophy is a sign of how blind and stupid Hollywood can sometimes be. Spielberg has not even been named Best Director! That had to have scrapped the Oscars that year. <br /> <br /> The movie clearly shows you how unfair life is for some people. <br /> <br /> If only movies were still so good ....
