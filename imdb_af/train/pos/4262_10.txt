Seen it as many times as I could before it left the scene. A lovely and entertaining movie with some of my very favorite stars. I just wish I could find it again! It would surely buy / see if I could. Please, somebody, bring it back. Fred MacMurray was perfect in his role as patriot during World War II, and his top ladies, Joan Leslie, and especially June Haver, were beautiful and beautiful. It was a musical but also romantic, funny and clever. It was my favorite movie with June Haver, though I always liked her. Her brilliant smile relieved the screen, and her beauty and talent was an asset to any movie. The supporting role gave credit to their individual roles. A well balanced and light film; I just wish we had more of it!
