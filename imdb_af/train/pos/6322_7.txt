This movie was recommended to me by a friend. I never saw an ad or a trailer, so I didn't know Clooney was there and was not bothered by the fact that his role was so small. I thought the whole roll was suitable, and found the movie quite nice. The opening scene, with the small crew of bandits standing and hiding along the road, caught my attention immediately. It had a way of telling you, "Don't go away, it won't be boring," and it really wasn't. It was an interesting, light-hearted comedy with enough twists and turns to finally keep you in your seat, but when it came to an end, I had a bit of a break. Just a little bit. The events have built up so you expect them to build, but at a point I can't define, it's kind of level, which makes the end a little disappointment. I expect I expected a bigger slap of a climax, but it looked like a low key. Keeping the movie in mind and living without high doses of George Clooney, you'll find this movie very entertaining and worth watching. Now I want to see the original (Big Deal on Madonna Street), but it's probably a rare find in the United States.
