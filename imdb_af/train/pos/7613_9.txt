/ The first episode I saw of Lost made me think, I thought what it was, some people crashed and rushed through a huge monster. But that's not so, it's much more than that, because they're not a monster at all and every episode you see from Lost, well, it gets better every time. An abandoned island with an underground bunker and especially the connection between the people crossing roads with each other before crashing. This is the real secret. <br /> <br /> This series of rules and I can't wait to know what's really going on. I hope they won't leave the last 2 episodes in the theaters. This series earns a 9 out of 10
