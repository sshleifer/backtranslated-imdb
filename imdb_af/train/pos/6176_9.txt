The 1986 TV movie by The Spirit was a pilot for a possible series. The Spirit creator, Will Eisner, however, did not know the film and therefore no series was produced. I thought it was a very entertaining movie and caught the spirit (pity) of the comic strip with a modern twist. I'm sorry it doesn't make up for a series. Sam (Flash Gordon) Jones was a perfect Spirit. Nana Visitor was a nice Ellen Dolan and of course he will later go to Star Trek: Deep Space nine years later. Perhaps with the release of Frank Miller's big-screen version of The Spirit, more people will see this rare jewel of Spirit history. It appears that when Hollywood makes a movie of an already established character or idea, someone will inevitably look past versions of the property and release it on video to make a few bucks. When Antonio Banderas deceived Zorro's mask, we could get previous versions of the masked hero on DVD, like the great Alain Delon version of the 1970s (though all the copies I've ever seen were badly changed). Heres hopes someone will soon release the TV adventure from The Spirit to DVD.
