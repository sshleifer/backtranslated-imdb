Pinjar is really a masterpiece .... It's a thought-provoking movie that makes you think and query our culture. This is without a doubt the best Hindi movie I've seen so far. This movie had to be shown at film festivals around the world and I would have been a serious contender in Cannes. All the characters were thrown perfectly and Urmila Matkondar and Manoj Bhajpai were in their roles. The story that tells the film about partition is a very important story and one that can never be forgotten. <Br /> <br /> It has no prejudice or prejudice and has given the partition a human story. No country is portrayed as well or badly here. There are evil Indians, evil Pakistanis and good Indians and Pakistani's. The cinematography is excellent and the music is melodious, meaningful and haunting. Everything about the movie was incredible ... and the play took my breath away. Everyone was thrown perfectly.
