I enjoyed the innocence of this movie and how the characters had the reality of having a powerful animal in their midst. The gorilla just looks great, and the eyes are particularly vibrant. It is sometimes a bit scary and needs to scare children a little bit without going over. Rene Russo plays her role wonderfully feminine. Usually these types of Hollywood films that are happening in the past are the need to create a strawman villain, but the only adversary is the gorilla. It's an interesting look at how close some animals are to people, how they feel the same emotions, and how we really can't handle them, just like humans because they aren't. Not many movies dare in this area and it's worth seeing if you want to consider the human animal agreement.
