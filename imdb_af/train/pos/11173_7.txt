Ag, clichés, clichés, clichés; They are a big part of a wide variety of horror movies. This one has many of them. But it's Stephen King, one of the best masters of horror. This movie was really good, just too predictable. And what horror movie doesn't have stupid people? This one is crowded with delayed victims, but only begs for their lives to be taken. Pet Semenaar I was shocking a little. The way everything was set up was VERY creepy, but not scary. For the most part, the play SOMEWHAT was credible, the tension was not so exciting, but the level of entertainment was at a great rank; My eyes are virtually glued to the screen. All Stephen King fans have to watch this movie, but like anyone else, expect an OKAY thriller.
