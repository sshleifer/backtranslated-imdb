I bought it for a while, but somehow neglected to watch it until last night. I like Juliette Lewis, although I am indifferent to Brad Pitt. After this show I have to admit he is a perfectly fine actor - his character was completely credible, and I didn't even think of Brad Pitt. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I can't say the same to David. Duchovny. I am an X-Files fan and I had to check twice to confirm the date of this movie because I thought it was made a few years later. I like Duchovny, but find his character a bit two-dimensional here, except where he does voice-overs. The part was strong, looks in character, good intonation, etc. Otherwise I thought "Agent Mulder", which is a pity. <br /> <br /> Michelle Forbes was a surprise. Why didn't I notice her before? (I'll look at what other roles she did, and I'll see it as soon as possible.) I'm slightly worried about Lewis stereotyping, this movie and "Natural Born Killers" (a solid favorite). Interesting to see a contrast of characters - in NBK she is a willing accomplice, while offending the violence and trying very hard not to acknowledge Early's dark side until it is pressed into her face. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed it. film almost unconditionally. Apart from Duchovny's character, it doesn't seem to have been completely shaped (and it might be a bit wiped out by Pitt's), it was perfect. I was also happy with the end - glad that the innocent heroes did not kill, but they had to suffer first. It was realistic, tense, disturbing. <br /> <br /> If you like NBK, you might enjoy this movie, and vice versa.
