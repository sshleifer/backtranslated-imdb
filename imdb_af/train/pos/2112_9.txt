In Budapest, Margaret Sullavan (as Klara Novak) gets a job as a clerk in a gift shop; There, his bikers with fellow worker James Stewart (like Alfred Kralik). The two do not get on the job, because each one fell in love with an invisible pen pal. To watch Ernst Lubitsch, these stars lead by the inevitable, predictably satisfying. <br /> <br /> Even better is a subplot involving Mr Frank Morgan (like Hugo Matuschek), who suspects his wife has a relationship. Morgan confirmed that his 22-year-old wife had sex with one of his younger employees. Morgan, painfully realizing, "She just didn't want to grow old with me," and the supporting characters are preventing this movie from getting old. <br /> <br /> ********* The Corner Shop (1/12/40) Ernst Lubitsch ~ James Stewart, Margaret Sullavan, Frank Morgan, Joseph Schildkraut
