Perfect movies are rare. Even my favorite movies tend to have mistakes. The rear windows sometimes look a bit stale, Chris Elliot's character in Groundhog Day doesn't work, the music score in the best years of our lives is too cheesy, the beginning of the nights of Cabiria is a bit too slow - but this film is perfectly executed from start to finish. <br /> <br /> The script is brilliant, the play is fantastic everywhere (although Reese Witherspoon and Sam Waterston are incredible, the whole scroll shines), the directing and photography are inspired, and the music score becomes intrusive ( like some Miramax scores that are too manipulative). Every sad moment really moves, every light moment makes me smile. It's really one of the best movies I've ever seen and I wish there were more movies like that. <br /> <br /> I'm glad Reese Witherspoon went to this movie, but I'm sorry to see her recent movies being so much more escaping and stupid than this serious movie about real people, real feelings and real problems. Brilliant! A must-see.
