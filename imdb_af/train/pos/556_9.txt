Cowboys James Stewart and Walter Brennan take their herd from Seattle to Alaska and up to Canada to bring in a claim. Once there, they must fight with the seductive, shy businesswoman Ruth Roman and icy happy villain James McIntire. <br /> <br /> John Wayne can talk about more, but his good friend Stewart made. some excellent, hard-edged westerns, some with great director Anthony Mann. Honestly, I'll take it, with its solid action sequences and fine melodrama, over any day North Alaska! <br /> <br /> The Far Country features some breathtaking scenery and filmography that had to be shot in the wide screen. <br /> <br /> There is also some strong support from the always trustworthy Brennan, Roman (who's wonderful), the incredibly cute Corrine Calvet and James McIntire, who play one of my favorite bad guys, that kind of that doesn't take itself too seriously. <br /> <br /> It will make a big double bill with another highly recommended Mann / Stewart northwestern, Bend Of The River.
