I still love it 17 years after the first time I saw it. I discovered that I lost my copy of this and was very upset. Despite this, it is non-association with the original (which if a child I have never noticed and as an adult I do not care about), that is what cartoons * should be. Just dark enough to be interesting and light enough to be enjoyed by everyone. I am more than happy that my parents have excited me about this kind of thing rather than the cartoons we see today that teaches our children nothing. The music is wonderful and stuck in your head forever. I downloaded the entire soundtrack at some point.
