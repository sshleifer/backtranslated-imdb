MacArthur is a wonderful movie with a great story about a great man, General Douglas MacArthur. This is, of course, the story of one of America's great military figures, and a figure that has made me aware of the earliest moments of my memory. Although there is a continuity issue (there may be others) eg. MacArthur's speech depicted in the film as his 1962 address to the US Military Academy to accept the Thayer award does not contain the phrase "old soldiers never die, they just disappear." (This was in his speech to Congress on his dismissal by President Truman in 1951 for his alleged insubordination (these two did not see eye to eye!) Gregory Peck is impossible as the general who promised to go to the Philippines World War II. The film moves quickly and easily with the general, his family and his staff from the beginning of World War II until the end of his service career. This movie will be of greater importance to one familiar with World War II and the Korean War. Nevertheless, Peck's portrayal of this great man who fought the divisions of fascism and communism and who hated war as just a soldier is indeed an unforgettable one. "In the war there is no substitute for victory."
