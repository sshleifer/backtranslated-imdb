Anyone who saw this movie and reviewed it badly, would refer it to Roger Ebert's review of this movie. He is one of the most respected critics in the industry, and he gave it 3 1/2 stars. <br /> <br /> It's a good movie. It may not be perfect or spectacular, but I enjoyed it. A choreline is not so much a story as it is a group of stories about the lives of Broadway Hope Vols. I read reviews where people said that too much time was wasted on the romance between Zach and Cassie. This is a wrong view. This is another story, along with all the other stories that are told of each of the Broadway heaps. What people do not realize is that those who are dancers for Broadway shows are going through the same things as the ordinary man goes. And what I think is really the point of the whole show. It's not just showing the talent of these special dancers, but giving us some interesting things to think about life in general. This is a study of life as a Broadway star. Anyone who dreamed of becoming a Broadway star, looks at this movie with a good sense of relationship because they've gone through exactly where the characters go. <br /> <br /> It's a great musical. It has its slow points, and sometimes it gets a little confused with the mood of some story lines, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. Look more closely at the movie, and then you may understand what I'm talking about.
