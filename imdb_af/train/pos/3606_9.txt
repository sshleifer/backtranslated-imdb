I really enjoyed Girl Fight. It's something I could look over and over again. The acting was fantastic and I thought Michelle Rodriguez did a good job in the movie. I can say very convincingly. The film shows how women should stand up for what they want to do in life. She had so much compassion, and yet it hated many at the same time. Handling her with an ignorant father didn't help her much. Even though he loved her, he was very hateful. Her mother died when she was younger and it also had some sadness in her role. The love story was a part I also really enjoy in the movie. I felt the passion you had for each other. Then drama comes in again and then it is like she chooses between her boyfriend and her lifelong dream. I thought it ended just right. It was the sort of end where you had to decide what happened to them in the future. For all your people who love a movie based on a good plot plot, I suggest you check this one
