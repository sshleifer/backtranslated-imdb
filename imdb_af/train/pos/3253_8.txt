Not a movie that has to be taken seriously, but still a big movie. <br /> <br /> It's definitely not just a piece of fluff. The acting, IMO, is excellent. <br /> <br /> One of those movies you won't find out, but it brings a smile to the cable every time. Like an old friend. <br /> <br /> Worth seeing if you get the chance. <br /> <br /> - - - - - - - -
