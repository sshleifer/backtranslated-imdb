This is one of the better Indian movies I've seen lately, instead of crappy songs and dancing or slum dogs. All the actors showed the right emotions at the right intensity with proper timing. This is the hallmark of a good movie, that it lets the viewer go back and investigate the subject, which is exactly what I checked at Harilal. I always enjoy Akshay Khanna's subtle acting and interesting, he rather had a complicated relationship with his own father Vinod Khanna, although not as dramatic as Gandhis, and wondered how it helped him set up this character. I was impressed by the direction and 2 inches for Anil Kapoor for producing such an elegant film.
