It is a very interesting short film by David Lynch and says the name David Lynch is probably enough for many people. This is your typical Lynch short. A blonde and a brunette are in a dark room. The blonde cries, the brunette speaks in a threatening way to the blonde, and it's about it. <br /> <br /> With very quiet moments, but with the haunting music of Angelo Badalamenti, there is a strange form of tension. This brief feels a bit like 'Mulholland Dr', a movie I loved, and so I also liked this one. It's probably especially for Lynch fans, but there's a chance you like it.
