A man who is desperate for action tries to hit a beautiful girl in a bus. She refuses him, but if he runs to someone trying to steal her purse, they will come along anyway. And there it starts - a relationship that is slightly contaminated by the fact that she is a jealous and neural superhero. It can be no secret that things will be problematic between them. <br /> <br /> In short, a story that can promise to grow into a cool movie. And IMO manages to be a nice movie. It's not a masterpiece, but it laughed me more than once. The two main characters turn around in a crazy love party that will even be credible with the superhero thing. <br /> <br /> So. Thin story, but really worked out funny and thus became cinema time. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 broken hearts
