If you're so big of a writer of a writer like I am Jim Thompson, it can be pretty dodgy if their works are converted to movie. This is not the case with Scott Foley's version of AFTER DARK MY SWEET. A detective, sexually charged noir classic that follows now and good law on the original text. Jason Patrick and Rachel Ward may be performing the best of their careers. And the always phenomenal Bruce Dern would even have tackled himself with this one. Like Thompson's book, this movie creates a dark and surrealistic world where passion overcomes the logic and the double cross is never over. A must see for all fans of the great noir movie. **** !!!
