Wow ... what ... a storm wind. The 30's is a decade of many movies of every type I can think of, especially during the early talk phase. There were movies that were painfully static and boring, like "Dracula" with Bella Lugosi, and there were those who just didn't give it, sometimes in a good way and other times. It's one of those movies that won't stop for a moment, and it's a wonder and a pity. Lloyd Bacon, who also called 42nd Street, had been the king of the Depression era musical and he was probably excited about the potential of the world of cinema because he filled this picture. There may not be a full minute or two without music or someone talking. It's totally crazy! I thought the movie deserved a 5 (or 6 tops) because the pacing was very poor, as it was fast and I sometimes didn't know what had happened and what to think. The characters looked as if they were just running back and forth, talking about things that didn't interest me and probably no one else. I thought I'd just be rewarded with a small headache. I noticed that Lloyd Bacon also threw the female lead in 42nd Street, Ruby Keeler, and 42nd Street was a movie the end of which was the best part of it. And you know what? It happened the same thing with "Footlight Parade"! The end is absolutely incredible! It has become, hands down, the impressive music I've ever seen. The last part gives us some musical numbers and that is, believe me, something the other rest of the movie sees. The numbers are flawless! There are three big pieces and the most impressive one is certainly the second one. Suddenly, the screen was full of amazing and ingenious camera work, beautiful people and simple entertainment that made me forget my little headache.
