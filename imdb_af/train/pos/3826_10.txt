I love Korean movies because they have the ability to really (really honestly) catch the right life. I tend to watch Korean movies only for that reason. I have seen other directors in these directors. The one closest to the feelings I get from this is Oasis and another great movie called This Charming Girl. <br /> <br /> However, my title summary should be from a Christian perspective, so I'll just start doing it rather than just leaving it with distinction. <br /> <br /> For a non-Christian perspective, director Chang-dong Lee has an unbiased and almost honest version of a modern Protestant church (regardless of denomination) warts and all. I have always been waiting for a Christian movie that truly portrays the darker recesses of church life. Because Christian films tend to speak in a language different from those who want to share their faith. Many films with religious undertones, although they have good motives, tend to have only the resonance of a Disney movie or after-school special. They must show life as it is. True people curse, real people desire, real people fall. And while Christians believe that salvation is available to those seeking it, we are still being challenged by the everyday horrors of this life. And Doon Jeon's character is a completely honest and almost brutal portrayal of a woman God has found, but because of the bitter realities of life, losing love for Him once. She does not deny God exists. It's just that she refuses to accept the idea that He is a loving and forgiving God. <br /> <br /> In her decent to the edges of morality and madness, her character asks questions in the minds of everyone, religious or not. <br /> <br /> "If God is love, why does He allow such terrible things to happen?" This movie doesn't answer it right. And I believe that the last 10 minutes of the film, although open to interpretation, let us with a hopeful future for our main character and bring the idea of ​​a secret sunshine "full circle. <br /> <br /> I do not believe for a moment that this film is trying to be religious or in any way tried to make it out, which is why it worked even more, it's really, that's fair, and that's why it's by far the best summary of a true Christian life I have seen on film.
