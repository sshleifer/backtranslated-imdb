I really have to say, it was always my favorite when I went to see my grandmother. And it's still. It is very, very close to the book. The way it is filmed, and the players were just great! I have to recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it. Almost everyone I talk to hates TV movies, but it was really great! I gave it 10/10.
