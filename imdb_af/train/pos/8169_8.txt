It's a boring mess and pretty convincing. Corbin Bernson is very in control of this movie with his smooth portrayal of the loony control freak-equal practitioner. Linda Hoffman plays his deceitful wife and she is very easy on the eye - unfortunately for her, the little "trick" with the pool man brings serious punishment in a way the good doctor knows best - ashamed of that pretty smile! The last half hour of the movie is dedicated to Bernson's character, and it is completely lost and the spotlight falls on a young actress called Virginya Keehne. An extremely talented artist, she has the spotlight from the moment when the brackets come off. Beautiful legs too!
