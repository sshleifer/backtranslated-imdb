A sharp political commentary that comes as a lifetime story is what this film is. The annoying thing is that it works effectively on both levels. It is not supposed to do this. This story of four boys and a girl who grew up in 1953, communist Belgrade is a heart warmer. This is what gentlemen call classic theater. It is clear that in 1953 Belgrade was not as hard a dictatorial and fascist environment as Communist society is often portrayed. One can listen to rock and roll music. One of the songs played is the song "Hey Babu Riba", the title of the movie. But jeans can't be bought or some drugs are illegal to own. Contrary to a heavy criticism of a communist society, this movie does so by showing how it affects the lives of the five protagonists who refer to themselves as four. The girl who is in exile in Italy is waiting for a passport for her mother and she goes out to go with him, the piano being driven away from one of the boys from communion, suddenly giving your home and quarter . to your new comrades because they need it. The boys spend a lot of time on music and it is made clear that they despise the fascism that communism created, as they are involved in tiffs with a fascist charlatan who tattooed Stalin on his hands. All of this leads to the actions they take later and the memory of a time that disappears, as this movie was released in the twilight of the Soviet Empire. A great movie that is worth over and over again. "Repentance is not your enemy, yet it is no one's friend."
