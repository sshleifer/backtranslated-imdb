Thanks to Warner Archive, I can once again see this mammoth variety show throwing in everything except the kitchen sink. (However, the bath is present.) This movie gives screen time to every person who was under contract at the time. If some of the artists are unknown to some, it is because they were big in the quiet days, and most of them faded with the popularity of the talkies. There are also some remarkable vaudeville artists. You'll be most impressed with Winnie Lightner, who runs two numbers. There is also the French star, Irene Bordoni, crowned a love song in a sexy way. Perhaps one of the greatest highlights is the technology-technological "Chinese Fantasy", which has been restored to this version. It's really nice and it's the stars Myrna Loy and Nick Lucas. Finally, there is the massive "Lady Luck" final that is underway for almost fifteen minutes. This is truly an epic of the early-talkie era. Any old movie buff will like it.
