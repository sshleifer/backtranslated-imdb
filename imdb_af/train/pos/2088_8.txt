From the top shelf of large Classic Books, this masterful story is written by Pearl Buck. The book like the movie is called "The Good Earth." It's about the story of Wang Lung (Paul Muni), a simple Chinese farmer who starts his day with a trip to the 'Big House' where he took a slave woman named O-lan (Luise Rainer) and made her his wife. Almost from the beginning she started adjusting to his friendliness by saving a small peach seed and planting it near her new home. Over the next few years, O-Lan proves her worth by completely sharing her husband's hassle, problems and changing congratulations. Over the years, they make a family and watch their simple domestic weather, both feast and famine. Indeed, it is at the lowest point in their lives that everyone discover the value of company, loyalty and love. With the changing times, their growing family is both helped and threatened with friends and family, such as their uncle (Walter Connolly) who is a charlatan and charlatan, but is patiently compassionate. Wang has his "Old Father" (Charley Grapewin) to advise and remind him of the fragile and capricious life of life. Two notable actors who make impressive appearances in this movie are Keye Luke who plays Wang's eldest son and Phillip Ahn playing a nationalist soldier. The film is in black and white and is wonderfully adapted from the novel. Highly recommended for all audiences. ****
