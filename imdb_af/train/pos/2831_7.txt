I stumbled upon this movie when I was eBay's Caesars Palace stuff, as I was surprised by its rich Vegas history, as the last of the original luxury resorts is still in good condition (unless you're Bally's, the original MGM Grand ) count. In this regard, this movie delivers full power. You get a great tour of the Caesars property, which, despite all the renovations and additions they have made over 40 years, is scary. As a movie in general, the plot is somewhat difficult to follow, thanks to the terrible editing. And if I say terribly, I don't use the word lightly. There are many complicated, second long pieces of Vegas traffic, casino crowds, and even a scene where the Robert Drivas character has a conversation with his dad about how much he grew up, and without any explanation he (Drivas ) (in those infamous snippets) of himself, to a baby, to a little boy, and then back to himself as he speaks to his father. (It doesn't give out any plot details, and if it is, you can be prepared for it. Maybe they won't be as flabbergasted as I was at editing.) The movie is well-aged and has a good message about the inherent differences between a father and his son who can handle most guys in some form or fashion.
