The Williams family lives on a farm in the middle of the remote desert. They find themselves in great danger when the place is suddenly placed in a time warp, where the past, present and future clash in a very chaotic and unpredictable manner. Director John "Bud" Cardos launches the film on a compelling mysterious note and gradually makes things strange, quirky and more exciting, as the loop story unfolds. In addition, Cardos fills the screen with brilliant visual arts and does a good job of creating a sincere sense of awe and wonder. The breathtakingly sincere performance of a game cast qualifies as another big plus: Jim Davis as sad patriarch Grant Williams, Dorothy Malone as his cheerful wife Ana, Christopher Mitchum as the worried Richard, Marcy Lafferty as his lovely wife, Beth, Natasha Ryan , as lovely little girl Jenny, and Scott C. Kolden as the gutsy Steve. The funky special effects offer an inspired combination of gnarly miniature, neat stop-motion animated monsters (the mentioned creatures include a small spin-colored hairless man, a large, lumpy, crazy animal and a crooked lizard) and nifty matt paintings. Richard Band's exciting orchestral score is really the hit spot. John Arthur Morrill's sharp, sunny cinematography also does the trick. A fun movie.
