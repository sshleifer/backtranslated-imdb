The most wonderful, spiritually uplifting film about the restoration of the gospel. Much better than any other movie, or film made about the restoration so far. If you haven't seen it, jump on a plane to Salt Lake and see it now. You won't regret it! You really get a sense of what the first saints had to struggle to put complete and total faith in the Prophet Joseph Smith. You eventually get some understanding of the things that the prophet had to fight against and the persecutions he and his people faced. If you have any questions about the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and our humble beginnings, just look at this movie, it will make complete and complete sense thereafter.
