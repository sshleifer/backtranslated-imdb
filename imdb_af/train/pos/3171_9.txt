Cross Eye is a very original and funny movie. I think Adam Jones brings a refreshing new set of eyes to the comedy genre and really improves it. This film is clever, concise and consistently entertaining and funny. As a writer / director, Jones has complete control over his characters, who are absurd and loving. The story is definitely something you haven't seen, which is good. It's unique and fun, and manages to work together in visually stunning elements as well as the long-lost slapstick genre to create a warm comedy. <br /> <br /> A very promising first film.
