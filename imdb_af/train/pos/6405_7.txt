I thought racism and prejudice against Carl Brashear was severely overstated for Hollywood effect. I don't believe the US fleet was ever so racist. I can't imagine a full captain, the commanding officer, and ever told his head to deliberately resolve someone. Certainly not at the risk of his life. And there has never been a Chief Officer as an unashamed bias against everyone, but WASP's as DeNiro's character. No Head as untidy and drunk as he was playing, would have risen to master chief in the first place. Cuba Gooding saved an otherwise bad movie.
