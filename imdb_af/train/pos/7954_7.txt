Big voices, lots of adventure and smart dialogue make it a very good movie. The addition of "character" to the three main animals gives the story a lot more depth and meaning, especially the relationship between the older fellow, Shadow and the young hellraiser, Chance. The previous versions of this movie were unable to give the animals any real personality or motif, which is perfectly done here. Sally Field loves everything, but shines in this movie as the proud cat, Sassy. Great contrast between cat and dog perspectives on life, and just the right amount of spirit and hot fuzzies to make the plot and resolution excellent. There is even an uplifting score and beautiful mountain scenery. Definitely perfect for an evening alone or with the kids. Beware of Disney.
