This movie was very good. If you're one who wants to see horror movies, I recommend it. The acting was very good, although I thought the actress playing Julie could have had more emotions behind her. Allan was very good and I thought the movies were wonderful. I was always on the edge of my seat while my friends were scared and screaming. It was a complete success for me and made it on the big screen. I give it two inches! I would definitely say that if you haven't seen it, then it will rent. If you saw it and didn't like it, look again, because there are parts that were completely unreal. I also liked how much of the film was filmed and on my school's campus.
