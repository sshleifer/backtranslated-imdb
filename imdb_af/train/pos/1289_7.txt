First of all, the film is an ingenious work of art (film). The plot was full of surprises, a little kid pretending to be an adult, inherited one million dollars and how he spends it. I mean, that's how it is here. Walt Disney this time really left themselves. The comedy is most of the times expected, but unexpectedly the other time. I mean, this movie was OK or was this movie OK. It also teaches a lot about wise youth and I am very smart and a little bit of smart pants. But it also sucks. How can a guy like the child get a hot police baby and his dad lets him go. It is as if a murderer has been released for ten years. If I did, I would be hit with a "suble jack" (a big stick that ironed out if your chair was very straightened). That child is really happy. Back to the story. The filmmakers really knew what they were doing when they made this movie, but it's still not perfect. The acting was good and bad. The child and woman had no chemistry, and neither did the father, but the brothers were excellent. "The special effects, on the other hand, were lame. Plus this movie is not based on reality. I hated it and loved it at the same time.
