I have a 19-month-old and got really tired of watching Care Bears all the time. Rooney is a good dancer who cares if he is gay. This guy had to be a cheerleader or something. <br /> <br /> Beats Barney, can't get the songs out of my head .... must ... stop singing ....... Doodlebops songs. ....... NOW. <br /> <br /> Must have 10 lines of text so I have to continue ..... what about when they say all Canadian stuff like OOOUT Aboooot. Whacky Canadian ..... Jazmine rides too much, she must be Dutch. <br /> <br /> Beat knock, who's there, Dee Dee, super Hottie <br /> <br /> Bus driver Bob can't dance, take Rooney lessons
