I'd like to comment on the April April movie. It's one of my all-time favorites because my dad, Nelson Malone, plays the horse coach. I clearly remember when Hollywood came to Lexington, KY, where we were in the time of making April Love. My dad was in many plays and was a talented man. I spoke to him to try for one of the little portions offered, and see, he came home with the writing. How exciting it is! There were also a number of my classmates in the crowd - especially those shown at the amusement park. It is very nostalgic every April when I see the movie again, and the song April Love by Pat Boone is still playing on the radio. Timeless and reminiscent of some time away when you see the movies they make today with all the sex, dirty language and violence. It will be refreshing to see more movies like April Love, come back in focus ...
