I agree with another user here and say it's one of the best Kung Fu movies! I saw it as a child and loved it absolutely! The scaffolding is brilliant and you can really empathize with this man because he is considered a wipe. Nice humor and fantastic kung fu this movie rocks! If you like Kung Fu, you would love it !!!
