Much richer in texture and character than even the classic ones of the 30's and 50's. George C. Scott was born as Scrooge, just as he was born Patton. Mr. Scott will be known as one of the greatest actors of the 20th century. The character of Scrooge as played by Mr. Scott seemed to have stormed off the screen. Scott as Scrooge brought a richer, more robust, but a more profound Scrooge than any of his predecessors in the role of the meanest man in the 18th century London. Mr. Scott brought Scrooge to a more personal, understandable but highly confronted level; His role was dealt with by the great authority Scott always puts on the screen: yet his usual bellicose voice is sometimes whispered, as he would repent of the Christmas holidays in one breath, but reveal his own human lack in his next line. He could portray the sour-and-crusty Scrooge, and a misunderstood, sympathetic Scrooge in the same scene. <br /> <br /> A remarkable show by a giant of his generation.
