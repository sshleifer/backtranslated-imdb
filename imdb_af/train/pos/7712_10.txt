Flat One, Horror. <br /> <br /> When I first saw this movie at 10, I knew it would give me nightmares. It did. Surprisingly, as I recall, it was the sound as much as the face of the monster they caused. <br /> <br /> Level Two, Psychoanalytic Theory. <br /> <br /> Later as an adult, I saw the story for what it was: What made the wilderness, unobstructed instincts that we all suppressed, clear. <br /> <br /> Level Three, Pure Science Fiction. <br /> <br /> The best way to probably realize the plot's "What if" is by the science fiction genre. It is pure science fiction, not the "cowboys in space" that go to the genre today. <br /> <br /> After 43 years, Forbidden Planet remains the largest of all science fiction films. If you're planning a remake, SKG or Lucas, watch out!
