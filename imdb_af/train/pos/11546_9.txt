First time view: July 21, 2008 <br /> <br /> Very impressive screenplay and comic acting and timing in this movie. Now 40 years old, it has lost nothing of its strength. Neil Simon shows excellent insight into human nature and relationships, as well as how to create real comedy from unusual situations. Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau give good comic performances. Neil Simon is inspired by real life events to write the play on which this film is based. <br /> <br /> One of the best written and upscale Hollywood comedies of all time! <br /> <br /> Surprisingly enough, only nominated for 2 Academy Awards: "Best Matching Screenplay" and "Best Movie Editing". Hollywood seldom knows awards, no matter how good they are.
