I've seen Dirty Work a few times and are probably my favorite Stan and Ollie short. <br /> <br /> In this one, Stan and Ollie are chimney sweep and get the job of cleaning the chimney at Professor Noodle's home Lucien Littlefield). While Noodle does bad experiments in his lab, Stan and Ollie cause a lot of chaos to clean the chimney and make a mess of the living room. The end is where Ollie falls into a tank of special formula that Noodle uses for his experiments and it makes him a chimpanzee! The best part is where Ollie falls down the chimney and land many bricks on his head, but he doesn't look like that much pain. <br /> <br /> Dirty Work is Stan and Ollie at their funniest. Great fun. <br /> <br /> Rating: 5 stars out of 5.
