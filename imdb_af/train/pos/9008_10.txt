I watched this movie without knowing what it was ... I'm a fan of Branagh, even more his Shakespeare movies, and at first I just saw it here ... and I got tears in me eyes, because the great, great calm, values, influence and brave philosophy about the life of Helena's girl. Recommended for people who are bored with TV programming (at least in Spain).
