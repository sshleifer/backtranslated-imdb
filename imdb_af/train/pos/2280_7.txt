Hard to categorize the movie - maybe it's an avant-garde spy riller? Mother Night is a very good Vonnegut novel, and definitely one of its easiest novels to fit into a movie of a typical length. The film adaptation is very true to the original book. The indie approach to how this movie was produced is probably more effective than financing a large Hollywood studio. Currently, I doubt an intelligent novel like Mother Night will ever get the green light of the big Hollywood gravel houses. And this is usually too bad, but not in this case. Mother Night has a stiff direction and a solid throw. Nick Nolte, who plays better role as he gets older, still has that "allman" person who allows him to tackle a wide variety of characters. Sheryl Lee is beautiful and wonderful as always. I always thought she did better than she came from the entertainment industry. I think your debut as a Twin Peaks with little airtime is not the best of roles, even if the TV show is a small phenomenon. Anyway, this movie is totally enjoyable and you don't have to read the book to understand the movie. In fact, given the geopolitical realities of today, the novelty of the novel may be dated, and some younger viewers with little knowledge of history will be completely confused by the unfolding events (I speak to you, co- Americans who are students and the lowest in the industrialized world in geography, history and lord know what other subjects!).
