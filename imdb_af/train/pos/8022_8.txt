Jim Henson's Muppets have been my favorite since childhood. This movie makes me feel like a child again. Well, the Muppets are back with Miss Piggy and Kermit the Frog and their friends. The premise is that they are trying to get into Broadway in a music show where different to New York City. You will see comos by the then mayor Ed Koch of New York. Anyway, the movie will be 25 this year and I hope the children of today will learn to appreciate the lightheartedness of the Muppets gang. The problem with the show is missing Kermit and the gang needs to find him in New York City. It's worth watching for kids and even sentimental adults like me.
