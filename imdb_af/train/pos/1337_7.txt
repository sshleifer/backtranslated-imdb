......... and you get Chori Chori Chupke Chupke. Don't get me wrong, this movie is much less explicit (or not even) than Pretty Woman, but it was a new topic for Bollywood. The subject was accepted, but it is far from Jism, Murder and Julie. To tell the truth, the subject is presented in a very clean way. But the plot has its number of clich√©s. The start of the film is presented in a very "movie" way. There are some very small plot holes. The movie comes up when Rani has miscarried, where you feel you are watching something other than a typical movie. Otherwise, the whole family order feels overdoing in the beginning. The acting couldn't have been better. Salman Khan sometimes impresses, and sometimes you leave. Here he made one of the best performances. In addition, his role is so well written that you solve a problem every time. Rani Mukherjee was sufficient. Throughout the movie you feel the most for her character, but she is overshadowed by Preity Zinta. Preity Zinta is perfect photo. Out of the three, they all give a run for their money. It's amazing how she can be just as convincing if she is innocent. And trust me, Madhubala is far from your girlfriend next door. This role is one of the reasons I consider her high. The supporting role is like the family you see in HAHK, where they have no meaning for the plot, but I found them acceptable here. The songs are pretty pretty. The title song is my favorite of them all with Dil Tera Mera Dil (Hearts). Mehndi Mehndi (Henna) and Dekhne Walon Ne (Watch the Worldview) are two songs that fit perfectly to the movie. Preity's cabaret number, Diwani Diwani (Crazy), could have been abbreviated while Nr. 1 Pajabi watched, though it had good dance. Otherwise, the movie is definitely worth a watch.
