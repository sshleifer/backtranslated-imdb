Each time the conversation will turn to favorite movies. I call Titanic, and at least a few people will snicker. I don't pay them any thought, because I know that five years ago, the same people were moved by those many movie tears. And they are now ashamed to admit it. <br /> <br /> For the first time, I watched Titanic again. Just expect to enjoy the story again, I was surprised to find that the movie has not lost its strength over these five years. I cried again .... in all the same places. It brought me back to 1997 when I remember how a movie nobody thought would break even became the most popular movie. A movie that burst into public consciousness, like no other movie I can remember (yes, even more than Star Wars). And today, many people will not even admit that they have enjoyed it. People, let's get something straight - you don't look nice if you have this movie badmouth. You look like an autonomous cynic. <br /> <br /> No movie is perfect and this one has some bugs. Some of the dialogue fell flat, and some of the plot around the two lovers came a little too neatly together. But none of this is so distracting that it ruins the movie. <br /> <br /> Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are great. Leo is one of the fine actors of his generation. Wait until you see him in gangs of New York before calling him nothing more than a pretty boy. Kate Winslet was so strong in this movie. The movie was really hair, and she liked it together. <br /> <br /> James Cameron managed what many believed was impossible by recreating a completely credible Titanic. The sinking scenes were terrible, just as they were that night. How someone can say the consequences are bad outside me. I was completely transferred. <br /> <br /> This movie is one memorable scene after another. Titanic leaves port in Southampton. Rose and Jack at the bow, "fly". "Iceberg, straight!" The screws hang from the sea unbelievably. The shouting of the condemned after she went down. And it ends that even the bravest man in the theater brought tears. <br /> <br /> The music, which was also the victim of the film's success, was an important ingredient. James Horner's score was simply perfect. And the love theme was beautiful and tragic. Too bad, Celine Dion's pop song version had to destroy this great piece of music for so much. <br /> <br /> I confess, I'm a Titanic buff. As such, I had the opportunity to see the ship as we never saw it - in all its beauty. Maybe I watched it, it affected me more than some because I had such an interest in the ship all my life. However, I doubt many of those I saw were Titanic buffs. I applaud Cameron for bringing this story to the masses in a way that has never endured the tragedy. The film was made with such humanity. <br /> <br /> Another reviewer said it better than I ever could: Open your hearts to Titanic and you won't be disappointed.
