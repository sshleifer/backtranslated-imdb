A beautiful, funny movie that gets a solid grade around the world. I recently watched this movie at work. It was so nice to see this movie unlike all the crazy horror movies I see every day. So much so, what I figured out, I want to write. Not sure if this movie goes to theaters, but I hope so. It's a nice movie to see with friends, it's a charmer, and has funny jokes. The acting was great (especially Howard Hessman and Larry Dorf.) Directing was pretty good (not a movie that had to be ridden). What really makes this movie stand out, I think is the writing. It was like Neil Simon, Seinfeldish, and the bad character between characters is clever and has a good rhythm. As an aspiring author writer, I see those things! (I'm a dork). Anyway, a very cute movie I recommend.
