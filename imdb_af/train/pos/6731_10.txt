I rate this 10 out of 10. Why? <br /> <br /> * It provides insight into something I hardly understand - surfers surf because it's all they want to do; Nothing else seems to them as much as surfing; It's also not a temporary thing - it's a lifetime for these guys. * Buried in the movie is a good history of surfing; I've never been surfing, but I love surfing movies and have seen a lot. No one taught me what this movie did * The movie was very well edited. It flowed well. The interviews were excellent. This is interesting from start to finish. <br /> <br /> In summary, it's just as good as a documentary, as I have seen, so I have to cherish it. So 10/10
