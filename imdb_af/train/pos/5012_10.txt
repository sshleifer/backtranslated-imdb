In April 1965, CBS broadcast the first of Barbra Streisand's monumental television presentations. The performance was not only a runaway success, but also achieved 5 Emmy awards. This is one of the most memorable moments of 1960's television and (unfortunately) the kind of television species they no longer produce. Filled with great songs and a spectacular show by Barbra, this special is a must for any Streisand fan and anyone interested in early television.
