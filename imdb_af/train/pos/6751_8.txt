Pretty good movie from Preminger; labyrintine sometimes, as it explores sets and places from different angles and perspectives as if it were a natural film on the inhabitants of the modern city and how they live. In this sense, it is visually and spatially satisfactory, as his hero, a good policeman with a bad temper, comes in very hot water when he accidentally kills a man with a plate in his head. <br /> <br /> Dana Andrews plays the lead as if it were Hamlet and has never been better. The story can be pure melodrama, but Andrews gives it weight, and almost brings it to the level of the tragedy. As his girlfriend, Gene Tierney is attractive but unbeatable. Gary Merrill makes a very interesting villain, with his natural warmth, a good contrast to Andrew's coolness; his smiling, friendly-seemingly bad man seems to constantly challenge his nemesis by the mere fact that he is emotionally open, unlike the tight wound and moralistic police pursuing him. <br /> <br /> There are no big surprises in this movie, which looks like a change for everyone involved. For director Preminger, it is a reunion of sorts with its Laura stars, Andrews and Tierney, who have overtaken their career peaks by the time the film was made. The supporting role, Merrill, Karl Malden, Neville Brand, is understandably more optimistic, as they were all on their way. Preminger, like an observer ever, lets the events unfold without giving a strong stance, as the morally ambiguous ends up being somewhat disappointing, because the cat and mouse match between the two antagonists looks bigger and more archetypes than any mere movie . contains much less solution. <br /> <br />
