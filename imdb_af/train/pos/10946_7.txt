Don't listen to the crazy critics who are probably bitter gamers who are still bad at the timetable. Silverman received them a few months ago at Spike TV Video Game Awards, "The Sarah Silverman" is wonderfully bizarre, surrealistic, immature, ridiculous, and would rather fit nicely into an adult swimming range. If Silverman shows the youthful "doody" jokes and accentuates the darker, significant undercurrent, the performance has so far been an indication. We can have one of the greatest cult comedies since the canceled "Strangers With Candy". But just to look at the pilot, it's just solid, not outstanding, horrible dark comedy / musical but with great potential. <br /> <br /> Silverman has created a hilarious, child-like woman - a more beautiful, younger, Jewish American Princess version of late-sized Jerri Blank and the show has one of the most unconventional, non-stereotypical portrayals of a gay couple I have ever seen on television. Early reviews suggest that the next few episodes will surpass the pilot, so I can't wait to see how this show unfolds.
