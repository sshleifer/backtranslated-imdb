I've always liked this John Frankenheimer movie. Good script by Elmore Leonard and the main reason why it was not just another excitement is because Frankenheimer. His solid direction and attention to small details make the difference, he even hired Ron Jeremy as a consultant as a porn star! You can make it the last good movie Roy Scheider is. I've always said that Robert Trebor just gave a tremendous performance. Clarence Williams III has received the publicity with his frightening performance and he is also excellent, but I really thought Trebor was standing. Frankenheimer may not be so proud of this movie as others, but it is an effective thriller full of extortion, murder, sex, drugs, and real porn actors appear in thin parts. What can you say about a movie shot by Ann Margaret with drugs and rape? A guilty pleasure to say the least. Vanity has a very cunning role and a very young Kelly Preston makes an early appearance. A classic exploitation thriller that should not be forgotten.
