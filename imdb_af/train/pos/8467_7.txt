I like this movie because it basically did more with less. It could have been more interesting if they restricted it even more to the studio (although some of the album elements would have been more difficult). <br /> <br /> The guy playing the DJ has done a good job. to show someone who haunts and haunts his memories. I also found his dialogue with the callers quite funny. <br /> <br /> While parts of the movie you see come a mile away, other parts you didn't expect to point them out. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a pretty minimal ghost story for the most part, concentrating more on the living side of the equation. The last 5-10 minutes were done pretty well, as everything is revealed. <br /> <br /> While it was a shorter movie, it was about the right time to tell the story. Any more and it would have started to drag.
