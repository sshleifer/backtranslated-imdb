Dumland focuses on the lives of one (American) family ... The father; a violent and obscene person who loves to use spit and profanity and who has no redeeming qualities. The mother; What seems to be a paranoid psychotic never really says much. The son; a dark annoying repetitive little one. The animation is simple and rough, but fits the stories and characters. The episodes were originally only available on the davidlynch.com website, but are now released on DVD. There are 8 episodes on the DVD and a short summary follows: <br /> <br /> 1- The neighbor: We meet the neighbor next door and find three things about him ... he has a very good barn, he has only one arm and he likes mischievous things with ducks. <br /> <br /> 2- The Treadmill: We find that the woman has an affinity for exercise, but the man doesn't really think it's a good idea. In the end, the practice runner was overcome. <br /> <br /> 3- The Doctor: The father has an unfortunate accident with an exposed live wire ... the doctor's investigation is fairly thorough (if not unconventional), but this diagnosis is "you is quite normal "(but we knew). <br /> <br /> 4- A Friend visits: After a departure with the new clothes hitch, come a friend (believe it or not, he has one! but after we meet him, we can understand why) , no surprises when he tells us what his hobbies are. <br /> <br /> 5- Get the stick: we touch another neighbor, he has a stick attached his mouth (though we never find out how it got there). Unfortunately, the stick is removed from its neighbors' mouth, and it becomes harder (and more violent) than expected ... but he is eventually victorious ... Jesus some people may be ungrateful! <br /> <br /> 6- My teeth are bleeding: This was my favorite episode ... and was also the most sensible repetitive and annoying (hmm, what does that say about me?). Not sure why the boy's teeth are bleeding, but believe me when I say it was minimal to the story. What is an oxymoron, because the story had no plot. But had a funny end (with a fly)! Uncle Bob: After meeting our uncle Bob and Uncle Bob's wife, we get a clear sense that the Dumbland gene pool is very flat. . Uncle Bob is a sick man (I won't spread so I won't spoil you). Uncle Bob's wife definitely wears the pants in his family ... and the father definitely ends up on the wrong side of her big fist (and spends the rest of their visit in a tree in the backyard). <br /> <8- Ants: After the house is infiltrated with ants and a wrong attempt to spray, it goes wrong ... he ends up with the syringe in the face and starts hallucinating. The ants sat on a fantastic song and dance show ... he is going to try to kill them, wind in a whole body of plaster ... and let's say the ants get their revenge in the end. <br /> <br /> As bad as these stories, there's something that forces me to watch them. They give another insight into the idea of ​​one of my favorite directors. David Lynch. Perhaps they were an outlet for him to get rid of his violent thoughts? I actually laughed a lot in the episodes. Many aspects are absurdly funny!
