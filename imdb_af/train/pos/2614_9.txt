Why was it not released? I think it should be a bit of garbage because it's not yet. How wrong can a girl be! This film is surprisingly in one word. <br /> <br /> You'll be enchanted. It keeps your attention from the beginning, and its pace never slows. <br /> <br /> The final part of the movie, the "episode" as it was (giving nothing, you saw it in the trailer) is also to be remembered. You will choose a favorite, you will be shocked, you cannot make a cup of coffee because you have to find out what happens. The adrenaline rises and you can't look. Cudos to the actors, this is very credible. And it doesn't stop there, they have a final shock for you. <br /> <br /> It also makes you reality TV and if you want to watch. And how far from this are we really? Endemol (who makes a big brother) made a TV show in Holland last year that offers a dying woman's kidney to patients who need a transplant. The show is revealed at the end to be a stir, apparently to raise awareness of organ donation, but is getting too close to comfort?
