I remember this series as well. It was excellent - so strong and compelling characters, attractive and sexy ... and so different from what everything is being offered at the moment - and now ... I'm sure it inspired the excellent Canadian drama "Traders". <br /> <br /> Both season 1 and season 2 are available on DVD region 2 in the UK. It's a surprise to watch the series again. <br /> <br /> Season 1 is 13 episodes and season 2 seems to be 10 episodes. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it seems to be over after 2 seasons. <br /> <br /> This series was fun. <br /> <br /> Sometimes you can get it on special at Amazon.co.uk.
