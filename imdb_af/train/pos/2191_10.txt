Shakespeare said our actors were in a big stage. But at this stage, Israel is multiplying the work we interpret by ten, and all the actions we do are full of hard style. Dan Katzir succeeds in doing a spectacular portrait of part of life in Tel Aviv, but Katzir can also penetrate the heart of Israeli people and these people, far from simple prominent figures, speak of our heart . Katzir's film lets Israel escape from the darkly illuminating cross in which they live, and this wonderful land comes to light as a wonderful bird born of its ashes. This is very good to me because the reality of the state of Israel, which the Europeans only know for the informative diaries or newspapers, appears as a close and absolute human reality, the reality of millions of people seeking its place, the whole Name the whole culture with the sole purpose of participating. Katzir builds a wonderful documentary and he demonstrates that when a man with passion film, the deepest feelings of power are projected and these feelings cross our hearts. Thanks Dan for opening our eyes and giving us one of the most beautiful portraits of the most wonderful countries in the world.
