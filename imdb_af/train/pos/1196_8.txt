I watched a few days of filming this movie that summer, the end result was just two scenes in the movie. The place was Sylvan Lake in the Black Hills. Bring the wagon, stop the wagon, etc. So this Dakota youth was looking forward to the movie and was not disappointed. The local buffalo herd was poured out, so the skeleton was real. (Yes Doris, animals were injured during filming) I think the end was copied by Jack Nicholson in the Shining? A great western / social commentary from the 50's. It should be in the same class as High Noon for true Western drama, or as a social statement such as Blackboard Jungle or Rebel, without a cause, was for the 50-year-old youth.
