This highly underrated movie is (to me) that should be good writing in a movie. Kasdan takes the quest for meaning in our lives and lays it for everyone to see and wonder. The movie is about the divisions that people create to isolate themselves from the violence and hatred and coercion of everyday life. <br /> <br /> Along the way, our demand for life is being asked. Davis (Steve Martin with a big beard) asks himself: "Am I a violent film (and, moreover, our enjoyment of it) that causes violence in society?" Claire asks: "What kind of world does something throw away as precious as a human life?" Mack is not immune because he asks: "Is it possible to go beyond the boundaries of race and (an even more difficult step) of financing? This is of course not the film, but generalizations. Others also ask their questions and honestly It increases more than it answers. <br /> <br /> But this is the nature of life, and we strive to find answers to questions that we will never quite answer and in some cases answers to suit our own needs and desires.As one boasts questions we cannot answer, some answers are actually Claire and Mack realize that although they can take the easy way and the state can take the baby, they find that Responsibility for her life in their hands Some answers are not: Davis "sees the light" and decides not to make violent films, but the next day turns around and shows his epiphany as inferior to his art. br /> We all look for answers. This movie doesn't answer them because it just reminds you to continue looking for the answers. <br /> <br />
