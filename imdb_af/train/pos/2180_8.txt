Louise Brooks gives a wonderful performance in these well-made French melodramas. She plays a typist named Lucienne who, despite being in love with a man named Andre, dreams of raising her position in life. She sees the opportunity in a beauty contest for Miss. Europe, but Andr√© is outraged when he finds out she's enrolled and demands that she withdraw. She just tries to retrieve her subscription to discover that she is already Miss. France has been selected and is now going to the main competition. <br /> <br /> It is a story of love, loss and determination expressed to its passionate end. The film was filmed very energetically by director Augusto Genina and film writers Rudolf Mate and Louis No. The filming style is more like modern movies than the 30s Hollywood movie, and shows the different styles used by Europeans. There are many quick cuts and travel shots, mostly with great skill and dyeing. The high energy of the first third of the movie falls a little in the middle, but picks up the last 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> The performances were very good by all the principals, but those of Louise Brooks are especially memorable. . Louise leaned heavily on her silent screen skills, though it's a talkie, but because her quiet style felt a surprisingly contemporary, understated, she made the transition to talkies very good. The long early scene at the show was especially encouraging because Louise used her remarkable expressive eyes to convey her growing sense of misery and alienation, to be trapped in a life she no longer wanted. I doubt it was ever better done. <br /> <br /> The film builds to an excellent final, spectacularly shot, powerful and stylish. It's really the best thing about the early days of the movie. And the tragic storyline only highlights the greater tragedy that it is the last starring role of Louise Brooks. Not only was she a great beauty that looks fantastic in a swimsuit, she was really a great actor who basically threw everything away. We are all poorer for this. <br /> <br /> This movie is less known as her German movies with G.W. Pabst, but I think it's better. I think this crew is just better than a storytelling than Pabst, and while Prix de Beaute may miss the deep moral complexity of the Pabst movies, it's much easier to follow and is a more streamlined, focused piece of work. And it doesn't hurt that Louise's singing parts are also done by Edith Piaf. <br /> <br /> Bottom line, it's a classic Louise Brooks movie worth looking for.
