If I have ever been asked to remember a song from a movie of years, it should be Chalo Di There Chalo Ch Couple Ke Chalo, because it is sung by Lata Mangeshkar and Mohd. Rafi, the lyrics of Kaif Bhopali and not the film photography as the sailboat goes out against the black background and the shining stars. The other must be Chalte Chalte. Pakeezah was Meena Kumari's last movie before she died and the amount of time it took could be seen on the screen. In each of the songs depicted, she looks young, but after that she does not. But one actor who did not change his appearance was the late Raj Kumar who fell in love with her and especially her feet after he accidentally entered her train hut and after seeing it, he told a note how beautiful it is . <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Pakeezah is a beautiful romantic story that should, if at all possible, be seen on a big screen, just for the sake of film photography and songs. The film is Meena Kumari, Raj Kumar and Ashok Kumar and is directed by Kamal Amrohi. <br /> <br /> Kamal Amrohi's grandson has now resurrected his grandfather's studio by making a comedy film.
