This is a low-budget movie with a throw of unknowns and a minimum of on location shoots. The Philippines replaces Thailand and no one actually goes to Hong Kong. The stockpile of a Cathay Pacific jumbo jet landing on the old airport makes the transition perfect. This film proves that you don't need budgets or a headstarter to produce a great movie. It also does not contain the gaffes or the excesses that young movie people often bump. Solid craftsmanship of people who know all aspects of filmmaking and who understand the trade-offs between art and cash office. An excellent piece of work!
