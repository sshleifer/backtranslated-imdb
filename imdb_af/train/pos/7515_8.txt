I've known Bettie Page for a year. The soft core porn images of her from the 1950s have since become iconographic and still have a strong sign today. The "Bettie Page" look is still very popular in the world-fetish world and remains as characteristic today as it was at that time. So I watched this movie with a little familiarity to start with. The result did not disappoint. <br /> <br /> Among other things, was it entertaining to see the film's recreation of real figures such as Irving Klaw, John Willie and Bunny Yeager? everyone is considering trailblazers today. Mary Harron created an excellent work that created the desired atmosphere of sexual oppression and hypocrisy in American America, along with a sexuality that was innocent to the standards of today's standards. I especially liked the use of monochrome versus color as a visual shorthand for the emotional and spiritual climate that Bettie found herself. <br /> <br /> I think Gretchen Mol did an excellent job of suggesting the character of Bettie in all her. innocent sexuality and all her extreme naive. Betty loved to look beautiful, to pay attention, to see nothing with his nudity, and to wear a "silly outfit" for the camera. The underlying sexuality and deeply fetishistic desires were completely lost to her. To this day, she still doesn't understand "what the fuss has come about" when it comes to her pictures or their S&M content. <br /> <br /> It's not to say she's uncomfortable or too easy to understand it's just that she "doesn't get it" about fetishism and never will. No evil there. Bettie Page is simply who she is. The movie caught it very nicely. <br /> <br /> The social atmosphere of the 1950s portrayed by Ms Harron and written by her with Guinevere Turner really makes me happy in the day and age I do. The hypocrisy and oppression combined with the massive ignorance of our sexuality, all combined into a frightening suffocating world. The film puts it well and brings regret because Bettie endures everything with her unwavering faith and her immutable naive. <br /> <br /> Sometimes this movie was slightly slow, but hit all the points. Mrs. Harron tried and hit. they are good. I would even recommend this movie to those people with little or no knowledge of who Bettie Page was and what effect she had on American culture. For those with such interests, then this movie is a must see.
