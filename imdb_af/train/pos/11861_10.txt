This movie is very entertaining and is never sown for almost 3 hours. Al Pacino, Michelle Phieffer and the rest of the movie are big in the movie and are very credible. The violence was a bit extreme in the film, but then it showed how dirty the drug deal was at the time of the film. The end is wonderful and is probably one of the coolest scenes ever. Great movie and you will probably really enjoy it.
