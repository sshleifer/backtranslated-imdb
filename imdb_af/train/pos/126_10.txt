Zentropa is the most original movie I've seen for years. If you like unique vibrators that are influenced by film noir, it's just the right cure for all the Hollywood summer blockbusters who hide the theaters. Von Trier's successes like Breaking the Waves received more praise, but it's really his best work. It is flashy without being distracting and offers the perfect combination of tension and dark humor. It's too bad that he decided that handheld cameras were the wave of the future. It's hard to tell who took him away from the style he is exhibiting here, but it is everyone's loss that he is heading in his heavy theoretical dogma.
