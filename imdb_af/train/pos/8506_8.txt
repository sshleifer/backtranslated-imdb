. . . But it was on a UHF channel and the reception was very vague. I would like to own the movie because the reason I saw it in the first place is because I am a bus driver and when I saw this movie, I managed the model bus. It was just (during his murder trial about 15 years later) that I vaguely remember that OJ was one of the stars in it. I just remember that he was the driver and the bus, who was excited and driven. I've been looking past this movie for no use, as I watched it in the mid-80's. I like the movie, I don't usually see thrillers, but after reading the summary in the TV guide and seeing the beginning (though invisible), I stayed for the whole thing.
