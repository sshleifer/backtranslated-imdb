Whether this movie is propaganda or not (I firmly believe it is), it really shows the power of Media. The importance of this documentary is not to show how good a man is Chavez. It's really showing how the Bolivarians saw how it happened, the Chavez way to see it. Although it may seem wrong and prejudice to support a movie, I think the viewpoint in the movie is completely legal. The Venezuelan people via the private media corporation of Venezuela have seen only a one-sided perspective of the coup, the Neo-liberal side. This movie shows us how the Bolivarians saw it. Call it propaganda, I say it's a statement on your part.
