Titanic is a long but well-made tragic adventure love story that takes place during the unfortunate journey on the invisible ship. Author / director James Cameron has done a good job of making this film about a fictional love story between two very different people and combining it with the real event of the Titanic who sank after striking an iceberg on April 15, 1912 has thousands of lives that have died in the icy waters of the North Atlantic. The two clues in the film are huge in their roles, including Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. They make a good couple on the screen. DiCpario and Winslet also had genuine chemistry that made the romance eventually blossom between them so much more credible. They both showed real talent when this one came out and both also showed them in their most recent films. The rest of the supporting role, including Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Jonathan Hyde and Bill Paxton in a minor role, is as impressive as their characters who help them live in this movie. The love story, the action, the stress and the special effects were done wonderfully, especially for that time. The horror of the situation in which the characters were in was so realistic because it really happened that you wanted most of them to survive this life and death situation. The pace was sometimes a bit slow and it was a bit long, but the rest of the movie made up for it to be a little flawed. Titanic makes for a great date movie that makes sure some girls cry almost every time they see it. The fact that it really happened, certainly contributed to the movie that pity you for all the lives that were lost when the Titanic sunk in the Atlantic after hitting an iceberg. Overall, Titanic is a tragic heartbreaking story about two people who fall in love as they are alive on the awkward ship made by the exceptional performances of the film, especially DiCaprio and Winslet. It definitely makes this movie worth watching.
