It has singing. It has drama. It has comedy. It has a story. It's one of the best movies ever made. If you can't enjoy this movie, either sleep or some kind of spiritual disorder. In "Yankee Doodle Dandy" James Cagney sings his dances into an Oscar award; but in this movie he is better! This is James Cagney at its best BEST! He's fast with the one-liners! He's fast with his feet! This is nonstop action. And the song and dance sketches are classic, especially "Shanghai Lil." And the supporting role is great; and the whole movie is optimistic, moving fast and provoking confidence. And even though this role was made more than 70 years ago, it's still visible, even today. And of course, this movie features me. Ruby Keeler (who was married to Al Jolson). She's the perfect partner for James Cagney ... and also Dick Powell! If you like fast, fast movies, with lots of singing and dancing, it's the movie to watch.
