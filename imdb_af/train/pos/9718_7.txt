POSSIBLE SPOILER - Somehow, "How to alienate friends ...." is the "loser learn to adapt, succeed and find out that something else matters" type of story, located in the well-known business. - END OF SPOILER <br /> <br /> I don't know the original book, but this comedy delivers several good moments. Although I think the end is flawed. It feels too fast and too sudden, as if something is missing. In addition, I would say the movie can't keep a high level. In addition, you will find a sweet selection of actors and actresses with sometimes controversial acting attributes. Until now I have never seen Pegg else. Yet he is a very unique type, although he sometimes looks on the screen, it may be a bit more boring than needed. Fox proved she was able to play a hot star with her head in the clouds. Don't know if it's hard to do, but her performance was hot and better than during Transformers (okay ... probably, it's not a tough game). Kirsten Dunst is much more Kirsten Dunst (again) and you may find it (like me) or find it irritating. On the other hand, you will see Anderson showing her acting skills and Jeff Bridges (who is good, but maybe he did a little bit of power). They all fit their character well enough. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: I think it's a nice celeb comedy with a few more and a few less funny parts, a lovely role but a sudden end.
