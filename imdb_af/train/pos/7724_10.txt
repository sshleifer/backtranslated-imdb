Sure Star Wars (a movie I have seen at least fifty times) saves everyone else in special effects, but this movie has everything else! <br /> <br /> It has horror (non-graphical), romance, robots, spectacular repartee, intelligence, (surprisingly good) special effects and drama. <br /> <br /> A couple of years ago, I saw this film in a revival with a new touch, and I was amazed at how well it was today. I thought the old 40's style electronics would look hokey, but somehow they looked futuristic and modern. <br /> <br /> Ann Francis here (mostly) short skirts and bare feet with a girlish innocence that's hard to beat, is still emerging from me. <br /> <br /> The Krell monster appearing in the beam still scares the bejebees from me. <br /> <br /> Of course, we all know that the "Big Bird of the Galaxy" probably modeled much of Star Trek from this movie. <br /> <br /> No one has beaten Robby, the Robot, in terms of personality <br /> <br /> (sorry, R2D2 and C3PO). <br /> <br /> This movie is generally the standard that all other Science Fiction movies will have to meet! <br /> <br /> Honest mention for the haunting electronic count we've kept on pins and needles.
