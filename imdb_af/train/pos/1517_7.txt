From the thought of Robert Bloch, of "Psycho" fame, four stories of twisty terror come into this Amicus anthology movie, which, while not quite as fun or frightening as I would like, still cater for " a decent genre entertainment. . <br /> <br /> It is linked to the cover story of a highly skeptical Scottish detective (John Bennett) investigating the disappearance of a prominent actor. he is advised that this matter be linked to a few others by the house in which they all took place, and our film is underway. <br /> <br /> "Method of Murder" haunted author Charles Hillyer (always glorious Denholm Elliott) haunted by his latest fictional creation, which apparently came to life. This series has some good surrealistic and fairly exciting moments, and is covered with a fairly amusing revelation and denial. <br /> <br /> "Waxworks" star-horror icon Peter Cushing as retired stockbroker Philip Grayson, who is obsessed with the old friend Neville Rogers (Joss Ackland) with the image of a beautiful woman in a macabre wash museum. The most effective in this episode is the dream sequence, although it is always nice to see Cushing. The final images presented to us in this story are pretty shocking. <br /> <br /> "Sweets to the Sweet" features another beloved horror star, Christopher Lee, and John Reid, who doesn't treat the sweet moppie child. Jane (Chloe Franks) with too much kindness, and it's up to the new partner / tutor Ann Norton (Nyree Dawn Porter) to find out why. The secret of this particular episode is handled perfectly; The filmmakers don't show their hand, it comes as more of a real shock if we get the full truth of this unhappy family. The "dying" moments are particularly terrible. <br /> <br /> "The Cloak" has the most sincere comedy of the four; Jon Pertwee, one of the many actors who play the role of Dr. Who has played over the years is a lot of fun as a vain, temperamental horror movie star (in fact, he is the highlight of this story) of quality in his latest low-budget movie, go out and buy his own mantle. The said cloak has strange powers, which I dare not reveal here. Sexy Ingrid Pitt is a welcome presence as Pertwees companion; A wonderful example of humor here is a hint of eyebrows taken by none other than Christopher Lee! <br /> <br /> The wrap-up story then ends in a predictable yet effective way as detective Holloway learns he must have All the warnings gave him more serious. <br /> <br /> Inquiry by Michael Dress's unusual, striking and ominous score, "The House That Dripped Blood," is an entertaining mix of stories; while I don't enjoy it so much, for example, "Tales from the Crypt", it's still fun. Capably directed by Peter Duffell, it moves slowly but surely to each of its bad conclusions, and is definitely a good movie of its kind. <br /> <br /> 7/10
