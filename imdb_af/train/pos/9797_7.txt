Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman is the latest animated Batman straight to the video / DVD movie being released. (Minor Spoilers Ahead) The plot revolves around a new crime fighter, the Batwoman, who is personally involved, for whatever reason, to stop a major arms transport. <br /> <br /> Although the movie is interesting enough, it's not as good as "Phantasm Mask," "Sub-Zero," or "Return of the Joker." The main reason is that it does not deliver the emotional appeal made by the other movies. At the end of this movie, we didn't really feel sorry for anyone like us in the other, especially 'Sub-Zero.' There is no real tragedy that made the other animated movies special for us. Even the Batwoman is not really a "tragic" character (like Freeze or Phantasm). Not only that, but Batwoman's alter ego looks so incredibly 'stiff' and sows that the viewer doesn't really care what happened to her, causing her to put the mask on the side or what happens to her at the end and in it lies the main reason we do not get this special emotional appeal. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong, I found the movie enjoyable. It has its moments, like when the audience finds out who Batwoman really is and returns an old villain who was last seen in the original Batman: The Animated Series. The action is also very pleasant with very exciting moments. <br /> <br /> If the Batwoman's background were more interesting, this movie would have been better than Return of the Joker in my book, but as it is, it's in 4th (out of 4). <br /> <br /> As far as animation is concerned, it is the same as the New Batman Adventures mid-late 1990s cartoon. The score is not as memorable as the previous 3 animated Batman movies, but it's still good. <br /> <br /> I recommend buying this DVD because it's enjoyable despite its mistakes. But remember, it's not as good as the other Batman animated movies. <br /> <br /> 7/10
