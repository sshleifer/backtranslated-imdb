IMDb calls it 1972 for some reason, but the other sources I've seen, including the excellent program notes, mark it as '68. It does not matter, except that it is very interesting to see this abstract film and video collage (one of the first artworks to put the two together apparently) in the context of the Star Gate series in 2001, the same years released. Pure abstraction is not really my thing, but I can take it in small doses and the super saturated optically printed colors and psychedelic feel of this range of flowers, Rohrschach blots, birds, etc. Is very compelling and very beautiful. Certainly helped pave the way for many other nascent video artists in the 70's, and deserved to be better known.
