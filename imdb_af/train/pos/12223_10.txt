I saw True Crime when it was first released in the mid-1990s and I saw it many times. It's a wonderful mystery about Maria (played by Alicia Silverstone), a high school senior in a California city, whose classmate's younger sister was tortured and murdered by an unknown killer. Mary meets Tony (played by Kevin Dillon), a police cadet who sees how beautiful she is and decides to work together to find the killer. <br /> <br /> Many suspects in this one. True Crime feels very "true" or really to me. I have read a newsgroup review where someone wrote that the total suspension of unbelief is present and it is so true. Alicia Silverstone is perfect in this role and Kevin Dillon and Bill Nunn do a great job, just like the other actors. The venues are right and author / director, Pat Verducci, really captures some of the realities of teenage life and of Mary's loneliness. See the scene where Mary wakes from the dream series after watching Tony's photos. I wish Verducci would make more movies. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen any other movie like True Crime yet. 10/10
