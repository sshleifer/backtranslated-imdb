This episode is a bit confusing. Some people say you have to start from the beginning, but I must say I was confused from the beginning! <br /> <br /> Clark gets a head start and gets on the floor of Fairview Mental Institution and is fun to believe he's a superhero. Clark is told that the life he knew was all in his head. Wild. He also finds things unusual: Martha is married to Lionel; Lex is tied to a wheelchair with his limbs cut off after his accident on the bridge; and Lana is dedicated to Clark. But he finds one familiarity; somebody else dedicated to Clark: Chloe. He also finds that a mental patient is also from the well-known world of Smallville. And the doctor is an escape from the Phantom Zone. <br /> <br /> This episode now reminds me of a Buffy episode called 'Normally Again' where Buffy raises a sensible breath throughout the day. The doctor tried to convince her that everything she knew was an image of her imagination and that she was actually crazy. Her parents were still married, they still lived in LA, her friends didn't exist. Angel was never her boyfriend and she didn't have a sister called Dawn. Demons and vampires also didn't exist. Both episodes are a bit sad because doctors not only tell the characters, it's all a picture of her imagination, but it tells us what it really is: fiction, and that brings us back to reality. It's nice to have a sense of reality every time, but we look at these shows to escape reality. It's good again because the characters have to face new challenges.
