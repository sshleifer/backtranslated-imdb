One of my favorite Twilight Zone episodes. And the next day we were in the supermarket at Hollywood Blvd. and La Brea, my father and I, and guess who came to us in the passage! Barney Phillips, but no hat. Anyway, I don't think he had a hat. <br /> <br /> We asked him about his third eye, and he said something he'd left at home, and everyone he met asked him about it. <br /> <br /> A friendly guy. In those days we saw all kinds of character factors in LA. <br /> <br /> VAT, I was a teenager and it took a long time to get the "three hands" on the other alien hand! <br /> <br /> Ruby Frisch O'Neill <br /> <br /> 1947-1963 Hollywood resident and resident.
