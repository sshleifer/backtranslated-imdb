Laughing out loud playing fun on sex, family, and the Beverly Hills milks classes are more out of the post code it saw since the days of Grandma and Jed Clampett. Plot centers on two drivers who decided which one could cover his employer (both single or soon single-ladies, rather sexy - Bisset and Woronov). If Manuel wins, his friend will pay his debt to a violent Asian street gang - if he loses, he must play the bottom man to his friend! <br /> <br /> A lot of racial dialogue, pretty sick physical humor, etc. But much of the comedy is just below the surface. Bartel is unforgettable as a very sensual or member of the family who eventually takes his sexy teenage cousin on a year-long "missionary journey" to Africa. <br /> <br /> Hilarious fun.
