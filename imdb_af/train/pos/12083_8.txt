Second feature relates to a young woman in London who is desperate for a job, who would like to have a secretarial position with an elderly woman and her son. Thrillers about people who are kept in a home against their will always make me a little uncomfortable. I also feel like a prisoner - but this nice-colored B movie is not fussy or claustrophobic. It is far-fetched and unlikely, but not uninteresting, and our heroine (Nina Foch) is fast on her feet. To restore it in 1986 (as "Dead of Winter") proved that it is not wise, as the plot elements are not of contemporary existence. "Julia Ross" is extremely compact (too short at 65 minutes!), But it does turn out to be a quick climax that feels a bit messy. *** of ****
