I originally remembered this movie at Radio City Music Hall when it came out. I didn't really understand the humor, but this movie can make me laugh out loud. <br /> <br /> With all due respect to George Burns (RIP), Walter Matthau earned the Oscar for this movie. His performance is wonderful - given that he was 20 years younger than his character, Willie Clark. His mannerisms are first class. ("You know what kind of songs he wrote? Sh * t!" And when you talk to the talking man at the desk: "No! No! No enchilada !!") Absolutely hilarious! <br /> <br /> Kudos to Richard Benjamin, who played straight man to Matthau. <br /> <br /> I just wish it was on DVD, because my VHS recording is getting a bit old. <br /> <br /> I had no interest in seeing the remake with Woody Allen, because it can't fit at the original.
