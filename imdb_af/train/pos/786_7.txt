Andie MacDowell's facial expressions are again great in this movie. When you enter 40 and have been awhile for a while (or your whole life), you may feel wasted. The movie is a sweet reminder that love can only be found everywhere if your antennae are active. I like the fast sexual encounter, which must be out of character for a normally reserved school teacher (MacDowell). Her former student is cute enough and still bothered by his teacher. <br /> <br /> There are some areas I thought unrealistic or impractical. For example, on a scene where other women's jealousy persuaded and set up a scene to drop Andie MacDowell's young man, an adult police officer (MacDowell's other friend) could do her friend such a sinister act ? Is it so easy for someone not to stop in front of a car? Of course, accidents happen all the time, but I was hoping to see the heroine happily married to the first man she became involved with. (It was the hardest part to believe!) For such a beautiful woman to stay alone for so long? ... <br /> <br /> Perhaps the film producers are aware of the fact that a lot of romance between an older woman and a younger man doesn't last long. Besides knowing that a happy ending will not attract the public, especially after jealousy women over 40, who expect some miracles to happen. The sadness that ends with a look at hope for the sad woman who has lost her true love is sweet, but if the man lives, would it stay? For how long? Nobody knows. Nonetheless, it's a movie to let you see it sometime later ... maybe a year later.
