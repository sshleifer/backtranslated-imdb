This movie is witty, viewable and completely touching. And now you get Jean Harlow (or any actress of this era, for the case) also a quick punch in the jaw? (Twice!) After Harlow's Ruby was sent to a reformer after he was mixed with Gable's Edward Hall (he is that cute but engaging, crooked smile), her trouble becomes more and more complicated when she discovers it. is pregnant and she is convinced that this rake has abandoned her, but her love reformed him and he sees her, despite being arrested, and from the help of a minister. <br /> <br /> The wonderful relationship Harlow shares with her fellow prisoners is the second for her electrical chemistry with Gable, who was her leading man. Her cynical character is a perfect fit for Gable's fluent conversations. What do you want? <br /> <br /> "You know, you won't be a bad lady - if it wasn't for your face!" Ruby cutly comments on Gypsy, her rival. "If you come so close to me, I have to open the other window!" <br /> <br /> Priceless !!!
