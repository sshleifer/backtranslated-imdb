I took the other night randomly from the library, without any idea of ​​the film's cult, influence, or that it is currently being offered as a musical. (!) Most of the comments here are on target, it moves, funny, sad, and yes, a little mining despite the best intentions of the filmmakers. The extended Chriterion edition is a must have for anyone who loves it when it comes out. <br /> <br /> I think you can also see in the little Edie the fall of a class that has disappeared, you can also hear it in old films by Jackie O; people no longer speak like that. I think as a documentary, it would have been interesting to find out more about how the house fell in indifference. Old Edie at least still looks aware of what's going on. could she not dissolve the once-off spectacular house? <br /> <br /> Yet, the movie's subject is the life that the two women have set up for themselves, a real life, Tennesse Williams, one act. Well worth it.
