The first time I saw this movie in the eighties, but now revised, is this thriller really. Some newer films focus on similar topics, but they do not match this French milestone. <br /> <br /> A president - of course JF Kennedy - is shot in an open car during a public appearance. The resulting major investigation found the "Lee Harvey Oswald" figure of this film guilty, but one jury member insists on further investigation. He reveals some surprising evidence ... <br /> <br /> Unlike Oliver Stone's JFK - a movie with the same plot - this one does not play with emotions, but focuses on an exciting description of A conspiracy and how everything fits together, draws a new picture of the assassination. Even a true psychological experiment is used for this explanation of the crime scene. Compared to JFK, this movie is more reasonable, intelligent and exciting. Parts of the plot can be found in many newer films, I sometimes had a kind of deja vu in the theater. <br /> <br /> "I ... comme Icare" is a "must see". Its unique and brilliant, and the music by Ennio Morricone is wonderful. This movie deserves a very good position, if it was a Hollywood production, it would probably be known. <br /> <br />
