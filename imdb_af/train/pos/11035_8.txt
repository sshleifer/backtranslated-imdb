Four prisoners share a single cell: the dominant transvestite, Marcus (Clovis Cornillac); Marcus's idiot savant buddy, Paquerette (Dimitri Rataud), who will eat something in sight, including pocket watches, cockroaches and his little sister; Lassalle (Philippe Laudenbach), the intelligent librarian who killed his wife; and Carrère (Gerard Laroche), the new man who was involved in fraud and is now aiming to escape. After a brick fell from the cell wall, the men discovered the hidden magazine written by a "Fountain of Youth" controlled serial killer who occupied the cell in the 1920s. Is this journal the secret of their escape? Or is there something much more sinister behind? <br /> <br /> I was a bit tired of coming into this movie because the only other experience I had with Eric Valette was the terrible One Missed Call (2008) I consider to be the worst theater film I've ever seen. Much of what was wrong with One Missed Call can probably be attributed to Klavan's horrible writing, because (as I remember) Valette's direction was not the worst part of the movie (unless he chose to include the baby) . Anyway, Maléfique was a great way to get my respect back. . . It's a French movie (of course, something I love) and it is in jail (which is my second favorite horror setting for asylum). So it's two points for him before the movie even starts. Luckily, Valette had me once when the movie ended. Maléfique is a rather deep, rather complex, compelling story of obsession and despair. . . the desire and must bring fantasies to reality. While it's not a scary movie in the traditional sense, the strangeness of its power makes it terribly scary. The period between the climax and the conclusion was from the best movie I've seen for some time and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a decent psychic thriller with a little cool gore. <br /> <br /> Final verdict: 8.5 / 10. A lot of respect earned by Valette. <br /> <br /> Note: Paramount picked up the rights to make a US remake (surprise surprise). This is to be done in 2009. I'm not sure why, to be honest, because it doesn't look like something a big money maker will be in the states. But I was previously surprised. <br /> <br /> Vive La France! <br /> <br /> -AP3-
