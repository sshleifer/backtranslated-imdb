When I flickered through the TV guide and came across "Twisted Desire" on the film section, I read its description. Three words have caught my eye "Melissa Joan Hart" ... I find her role in "Sabrina: The Teenage Hitch" absolutely dirty, I hate those kind of programs, so I just thought it was going to be a boring old, love story that head her ... Little did I know. <br /> <br /> It finally started on television, I got my bucket ready if I wanted to stick it out about the madness or the buzz, you know what I mean. Initially, you think she's just a pretty, ordinary girl who's in love, but has parents. Then, when you find out, she manipulated her boyfriend to kill her parents, so she can be with her true love, you are like "Whoa". You just don't expect this kind of role for that kind of actress. She played her role very well, I never expected her to be able to do such a bitch, and voil√†, she did it perfectly! Congratulations to her, the movie was very good, I will definitely see it again and recommend it to others.
