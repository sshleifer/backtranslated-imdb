There are some spoils in this comment !! <br /> <br /> Contrary to the comments I have only read through nativetex4u and some others, I really liked the movie and it will be seen as a weekly series. /> <br /> I'm a fan of Judson Mills, but also a great Chuck Norris fan and while I admit that some of the action scenes stretched the line a bit, the storyline is right in the other weekly series currently being broadcast. <br /> <br /> The opening of fifteen minutes with Deke running from the bad people after blowing up their missiles was packed with action. I can't see how many "professionals" didn't hit a moving target, but the action was definitely there and Deke, the hero, had to survive. <br /> <br /> As for the comments on what is needed to get the film into the look to fill the time slot to the playoffs. This movie was not originally scheduled by CBS for a January aeration and filming was completed in May 2001, a good 4 months before the terrorist attacks against the US <br /> <br /> <br /> If the author of the comment paid attention to the movie instead of avoiding it, they might have realized the story: Rashid, a Bin Laden character, planned to launch a nuclear device in the United States set. The President's husband was awaited to find and eliminate the problem. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the author should watch the movie before attempting to comment on it. <br /> <br />
