I saw the first film at the International Film Study Course. I am a 'non-traditional' student, and perhaps accrued for the reasons of years or wisdom, appreciating the slow, reflective pacing of the film's story. The story is deep with the heat and dust of a dry ravine. The story is deeply psychological, full of polygonal symbolism and an articular inversion of the theme of the "Other" in a country that one does not understand. the concept that comes is fraught with the unsolved memories and subjectivity of the outsider. Made almost 20 years ago, it is also a forerunner in a genre of many other international films exploring the themes of colonial colonial space, without the nuances of the cultures they entered. Much more exaggerated - and heavily financed --- works that have been made since they reflect the same themes: Indochine, nowhere in Africa are two that are similar, perhaps Chocolat, pale and boring. It has no adrenaline pumping or extreme violence. The struggle is spiritual, emotional and subtle. But it is said, it's a fine movie worth watching.
