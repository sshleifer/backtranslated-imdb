I saw hundreds of silent movies. Some will always be classic (such as Nosferatu, Metropolis, The General and Wings), but among them my favorite is this movie (it may not be the best - but a favorite, yes). In fact, when I looked at IMDb, I noticed I was laughing at myself immediately, because the movie was so cute and cute. Marion Davies proved with this movie that she had a lot of talent and was not just William Randolph Hearst's mistress. <br /> <br /> The story entails a hiccup from Georgia that comes to Hollywood with every expectation that it will be an instant star! Her experiences and the interesting comedy of the stars of the era make it a great surprise for movie buffs and a must-see!
