Was there ever a movie that was more charming than it was? One of the reasons why everything works so well is that the actors really interact and have an influence on each other's lives. Its centerpiece is the "romance" of James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan, who work together and cannot face to face, but who are completely anonymous to each other as pen pals. But there are also supporting characters and unlike many romantic comedies (including "You've Got Mail", the recent "Shop" update), they are not only beaten up to support the two leaders and their needs. Everyone becomes a complicated part of Ernst Lubitsch's rich tapestry of charm. One of the most heartwarming scenes in film history takes place when the post-tragic Frank Morgan coincidentally and humbly looks for someone to have Christmas dinner. A must see! **** from ****
