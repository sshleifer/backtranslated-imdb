I have to say that sometimes "watch" everything that matters, just as Jeremy Clarkson of the BBC pointed out (not about our earth, but he does.) <br /> <br /> And when it comes to look, this movie is such an amazingly beautiful beauty, you will absolutely love what your eyes will see. <br /> <br /> There is also the personality of the movie, interesting, with a fascinating narrative voice and narrator stories that will touch your soul when you look at the beautiful images. <br /> <br /> The movie will probably not affect your lifestyle, but destroy this beauty, but it will definitely remind you how precious our life is. is. <br /> <br /> This movie earns it 10 stars, as it is one of the few stylistic earth movements I really enjoyed.
