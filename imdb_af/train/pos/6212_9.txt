I have a deep pleasure for this movie, though deliberately less 'polished' than the other Fred and Ginger films, and not just the slightly problematic Harriet Hillard's ruling role. <br /> <br /> Again with these movies, the plot of a slight follow - Astaire plays a very unlikely sailor (who is of course a brilliant former hoofer) and Rogers is an aspirant in a Seedy Dime-a-Dance Music Hall. Though their relationship is bright and fun to watch, they are trapped by an unrelated main story by Hilliard and Randolph Scott who fail to find any chemistry between them. <br /> <br /> Although it was a last minute decision, Hilliard was miscarried because she didn't have the screen presence to give this movie what it needs, though it's sweet and real. The movie may have helped to promote Lucille Ball's sensible, shaky, world-like character for a bigger role as she just shone in every little scene, and would make a great Helen Broderick-type sidebar for Rogers in this clear movie has. See 'Stage Door', the following year made for an example of wonderful scenes between these two fantastic actresses. That Scott's one-dimensional Neanderthal character eventually falls in love with Hilliard's is even harder to believe than Astaire's in the fleet! <br /> <br /> Now on the key part, the singing and dancing: Nothing more can be said about "Let's Face the Music and Dance", except that it is brilliant and moving and perfectly executed and I often like ready to watch that scene with tears in my eyes. Other songs in the film, however, also deserve recognition. "I put all my eggs in one basket" is a beautiful example of the comic instincts of Astaire and Rogers, and almost picks up fun on their reputation for spontaneous, perfectly synchronized dance. Other highlights are: "I'd rather lead the band" and "Let yourself go" that shows how these two talents can perform so well alone. I almost forgot to mention that this is one of the few (if not the only) time we see Astaire playing brilliantly on the piano; It seems this man's talents were endless! <br /> <br /> Overall, I actually prefer it to Top Hat and Swing Time (though only), as it is more fun and so enthusiastically performed by everyone involved. , it's hard to keep the fun factor.
