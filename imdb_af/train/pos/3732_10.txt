Producer Joel Schumacher, who also arranged 'Phone Booth' (02), and many other big films showed in detail how no one can really be trained to be a murder machine without destroying their own personalities and the real fears that ' a person faces when you go in COMBAT !! Colin Farrell (Roland Bozz), "Intermission", '03, has one of his best performances and actually carried the whole picture on his back. Matthew Davis (Jim Paxton), 'Blue Crush', '02, donated a great supporting role and Shea Whigham (Pvt.Wilson), "All The Real Girls", 03, has his real acting skills in the role he plays. played. There were two short plays where the soldiers could get a short leave in the local town and had to pay for their love and sexual desires. One Viet Nam Army Veteran Instructor told the soldiers how to actually torture the enemy using electric wires in all the wrong places on a human body. Enjoyable and entertaining movie to watch.
