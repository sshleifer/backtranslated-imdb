This film is so old I never realized how young watch Ray Milland watched in 1936, I remember playing in a big movie, "Lost Weekend". Ray plays the role of Michael Stuart, who is a very wealthy banker. There are three girls in this picture who are not very happy about their father and mother who divorce and find out their dad is getting married to a young blonde who is a golden digger who is just looking for a rich sugar daddy. They hire a man to convert as a very rich count, his name is Count Ariszted, (Misha Auer) who is drunk all the time and is strange and gives many cartoons in the picture. Deanna Durbin (Penny Craig) surprised everyone when she was booked into a police station and told police chief she was an opera star and then Penny started with the most amazing soprano voice I've heard, the entire police department and condemned people started applauding, which was a very entertaining and enjoyable scene from this movie. This is Deanna Durbin's first film debut and she has become a direct success at night and has become a major movie star with Universal Studios after leaving MGM.
