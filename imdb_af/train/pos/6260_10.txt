It was psychological! I am an Iranian and live in the 21st century. I did not know that such great tribes were in such circumstances in my grandfather's time! <br /> <br /> You see it today, or even in 1925, on one side of the world, a lady or baby can serve everything for him or her clean and on demand, but 80 years ago people risk their lives to go somewhere with more grass. It is very interesting that these Persians have such problems finding grazing for their sheep, but they lose a lot of sheep on the way. <br /> <br /> I commend the Americans who accompanied this tribe, they were as hard as Bakhtiari people.
