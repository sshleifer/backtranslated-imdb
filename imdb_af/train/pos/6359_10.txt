If you went to this movie to see a great academic award presentation ... oh .. but if you want to see a funny beautiful customization of an old classic, you'll love it. Jim Carey was incredible as usual. The story line was great, some parts added like the Grinch's history made it even better. Ron Howard never misses a beat. But although there were a few adult remarks and favors, it added that it would be a children's or family program. Try not to lose sight of it. If you really don't want to enjoy the movie ... and for the comment on Ron Howard, try to make a big movie and see how you do it. It's not easy as it seems. ...
