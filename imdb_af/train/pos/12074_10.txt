Joseph H. Lewis was one of the best directors of film noir. It's definitely his best. <br /> <br /> It does not mention some of the standard features of what we now call. Although American is made, it is entirely in England. It doesn't have gang members. It has a femme fatale. It has no crime. <br /> <br /> The title character answers an ad. She is delighted that she will make money as a secretary. Instead, she wakes up like the pawn in a terrifying plot. Only a very strong person can survive such a terrifying ordeal. And Nina Foch gives the feeling of a strong woman like Julia. <br /> <br /> Part of the excitement comes from favor at type: Mrs. Foch has an elegant way. She is not a screaming, cowling victim. She is actually a little ice cold and patrician, though improper. This makes her character's fate more credible. <br /> <br /> The most fascinating element is certainly the decisive Lady May Witty. She was (and is) probably the best known for the beautiful title character in "The Lady Vanishes." She has a sweet way and a harmless, slightly dithering way. But here she is far from a heroine. <br /> <br /> George Macready is excellent as her extremely difficult son. The whole role is really great. <br /> <br /> It seems that this well-known and brilliant movie was made almost by accident. No doubt the director knew exactly what he was doing. But he did it on a low budget. This is the excitement and charm of film noir, the real film noir: It's small, convincingly lowlife, and in this case memorable.
