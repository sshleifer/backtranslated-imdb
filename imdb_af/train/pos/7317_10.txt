It was a movie I heard throughout my life, but never seen it a few years ago. His reputation really continued. I knew Michael Myers, who saw the mask, saw ads for all the crummy sequels that followed. But I grew up during the decade where Jason and Freddy had a deadly grip on the horror game, and never thought much of the Halloween franchise. Boy, how did I cheat with cheap knock offs. <br /> <br /> Halloween is a really scary movie. Now, according to today's standards, it's not as graphic and visceral, but this film delivers on all the other levels that most horror movies can't reach today. The atmosphere created by John Carpenter is so creepy, and the fact that it is located in a beautiful mid-western village is proof of its ability. The lighting effects are horribly right, with "The Shape" appearing and disappearing in the shadows. The simple but brutally effective music score just adds to the tension. <br /> <br /> The performances of all the players are well done, with specific nods for Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasance. Me. Curtis is such a good Laurie Strode because she is so nice and vulnerable. It's all the more frightening if she is hit by Michael Myers because the director and viewer have invested so much in her, we want to survive and get away. <br /> <br /> Donald Pleasance plays Dr. Loomis like a man on a mission, and it works well. He adds a sense of urgency to the trouble the town finds himself in, for he knows what the evil stems are in the streets. <br /> <br /> Overall, not only Halloween is a great horror movie, but also a great movie. It works on many levels and pulls in the audience and never stops. It should look standard for anyone experiencing a real and scary movie. And for an even more frightening time, try to watch it alone with the lights. Don't be surprised if you think you see 'The shape' that crawls around in the shadows!
