This is the first review I wrote to IMDb with me naked, but I caught this movie on HBO and I was glad I watched it. Richard Gere is wonderful in this movie as the passionate agent / detective who deflects the rules to get the job done. I think the story is great, and there is never a dull scene that slows down the pace of the movie. Some parts of the movie dealing with demented sex addicts are pretty shocking, but if you've ever seen a crime movie like Se7en, you might just be able to stomach the screens. <br /> <br /> All in all, if you're looking for a good detective / suspense movie, ignore the low rating this movie got on IMDb and definitely look at it.
