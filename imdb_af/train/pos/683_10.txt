I like Ghost stories. Good ghost stories of bumps in the night, voices that cannot be explained. Now I see a lot of them. As a special efx has a bigger grip on today's movies, sometimes to find a real gem, turn the clock back to the time when the writers and directors really had to use their heads to really create good ghost stories. Now this one, very rare, pilot episode for the TV series Ghost Story called "The New House" was one of the most scariest movies I've ever seen. It was once in 1972, ... I was just 9, but nothing since even compared to that. With all the remakes going on in Hollywood, somebody needs to do this "like it" with no more special efx than the original one. This episode was right creepy like hell. I'm happy to find it today on DVD and very rare and hard to find. The only other 2 Ghost Stories that were even close were the original "The Haunting" and George C. Scott in "The Changling". Wish someone would do more ghost stories like this.
