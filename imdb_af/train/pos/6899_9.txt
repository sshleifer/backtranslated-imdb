The wonderful star quality of Gerard Philipe, who died too young, jumps off the screen in this funny, funny, clever swing box comedy with lots of sword fence and raids. Tasty lust in his' storytelling, impossible to resist. A lovely romantic comedy with a very young Gina Lollobrigida as the love interest. A movie one will remember with great love.
