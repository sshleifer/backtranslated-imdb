but just as entertaining and random! Love it or hate it, but don't expect a sophisticated plot or nail-biting stone hanger. Think of it like Seinfeld, but without the succession and repeated performances of crazy characters (well ... so far, I have a feeling that I will develop favorites as the season continues). <br /> <br /> "Essential Comforts" are not for the most beautiful of humor - it is meant to take on the least amount of effort on your brain. Therefore, this show shows everything I need in a program when I get out of work in the evening: superficial conversation in the background with just the right amount of "cute" for the characters I can enjoy when I finally look up from the computer to see what I miss. <br /> <br /> Today, as most of today's sitcoms, calmer than a night at NASCAR. Just the right mix of dead air and comebacks. Can't wait for the next one.
