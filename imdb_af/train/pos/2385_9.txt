In the old commercial for empty audio cassettes, the tagline was "is it really or is it Memorex?" The same can be said for the events in this episode - a compilation and remix of "The Cage", the first pilot of Star Trek. Mr. Spock ordered the ship to take it to the forbidden planet Talos IV for Capt. Allow Christopher Pike, his first captain to burn and paralyze, to get there. Why the finagling? Because there is no contact with Talos IV, a death sentence is invited. Why this is so, is never explained - it has affected me tremendously - but, if nothing else, add it to the story. After getting the ship to travel to Talos IV, Mr. Spock him in to dr. McCoy (chief officer present, Capt. Kirk of the ship) for arrest and saying, "The charge is mutiny, Dr. I never received orders to take over the ship." What follows is a court in which we - thanks to the Talosians - learn why it was so important (except the obvious paralysis) for Capt. Pike to reach Talos IV, even in danger of Mr. Spock's death. The illusions the Talosians create, the background music and the whole storyline are fantastic. And Meg Wyllie as The Keeper (the chief Talosian) is wonderful. Call me sexist, but it never happened to me to have a woman in that role, but she was perfect! The Talosians, who surrendered virtually all physical activity and were almost completely dependent on the power of illusion, are also unfair; You can't really tell if they are male or female and it really doesn't matter. This episode, more than any other in the series, makes me hope and pray there are other worlds out there and there are civilizations that are so advanced! What a neat thing if it is! It's one of my favorite episodes, and no matter how many times I've seen it (I even have it on video), but it never makes me fascinate. Meg Wyllie LOOK like a stranger and that doesn't mean it ignorant.
