I found it to be a so-so-romance / drama that has a nice ending and a great feeling. This is not a Hallmark Hall Of Fame-type family movie with sleep-for-marriage considered "normal" behavior, but considering star Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro, I would have expected a much rougher movie, at least language use. <br /> <br /> The most memorable part of the movie is portraying how difficult it should be to learn to read and write when you are an adult. This is the big theme of the movie and it involves a few screens, but to be honest, the movie is not so memorable. <br /> <br /> It's still a pretty soft, nice story I would recommend.
