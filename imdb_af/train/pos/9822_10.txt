I only saw the movie when I was a high school student, and the film was stuck over the years. It's not about the soundtrack, or cinematography, or even the dialogue and somewhat bad acting, it's about the educational goal and the message behind it being the most important. It is not a sin to have a child if you are a teenager and still at high school, and it is not really a bad thing, but it is a problem. Many girls I knew now have children, and I think they never watched this big movie, and if they did, they clearly didn't get the message. It's about the chance of not taking chances when you are in a sexual relationship. Any girl can get pregnant for the first time. It's not a myth. You don't necessarily lose your dreams, but they have to take a backseat in your future, because you have a child to think first. <br /> <br /> This movie has a clear message about it: JUST NOW!
