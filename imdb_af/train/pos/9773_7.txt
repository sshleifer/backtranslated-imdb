The plot is really horrible, the atmosphere is really depressed, unusual for a low-budget production like that, and at least for a German production. A little Indian spirituality, mystical thriller and slasher movie mixed together. The development of plot and characters is wonderful, the sets are very close to reality, without any studio atmosphere. It could be perfect, but unfortunately some things were a little disappointing. What shouldn't necessarily be for low-budget movies: <br /> <br /> 1.) The roll-throw is sometimes no more than average. Almost every actor looks like a layman. Some of them do good or very good work, but some act like the actors of crazy German court shows! But I was very, very disappointed with the actions of Mathieu Carri√®re! His acting (in many of his older movies was his play well) was below average! But this could be the reason why he participates in crazy German soap or TV shows on private channels today. <br /> <br /> 2.) The dialogues are sometimes at soap opera level. <br /> <br /> 3.) The bad sound sometimes makes it very difficult to understand what the characters say. I saw it on DVD and was happy to rewind and listen again. This is caused by the set (large halls such as in the hospital or with the esoteric group) and sometimes the strange dialects of the actors! <br /> <br /> But all this is an interesting movie worth seeing, far beyond the commercial movies, which are often more terrible.
