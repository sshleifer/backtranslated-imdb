I accidentally kicked this title up at the Grindhouse Vol. 1 collection of pure Euro trash films. But this movie has a good stamp of approval and needs a better transfer than is out there. Stupednous this is not ... satisfactory it is! Look at this movie I couldn't help wondering ... how did Sergio Martino not make this movie? It has its signature on it and Edwedge Fenech (as not known, but she got a nice cameo in Hostel II). Double intersections and three intersections under and cement this film from beginning to end with Lee Van Cleef giving coolness under the pressure of the 1st second. Did this man go to Italy to finally reach his potential or did the studio system make the man slip? In addition to Lee's more recognizable films, filmmakers should try it out and see how Sergio Leone would lower his epic scale on One-time in America to half the running time (and 1/4 of the budget). to be. So refreshing, it should be taken home and made it a matinee bank
