It is not yet a spectacular look at the Holocaust, but rather an intimate story about the events that took place on a small street in Berlin and the people involved. This movie starts in the present time in New York City where Rut Weinstein (Jutta Lampe) mourns about the death of her husband and relatives, all joined her. Ruth's daughter, Hannah (Maria Schrader), slowly learns that her mother was raised by an Aryan woman named Lena Fischer (Doris Schade). So she travels to Germany and places the 90-year-old who tells her about the events at Rosenstrasse. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** <br /> <br /> Lena talks about Berlin in 1943, where the Gestapo will keep all Jewish spouses in a building on Rosenstrasse Street although they are supposed to have immunity to be married to Aryans and for nine days a group of women will be waiting outside and screaming for their release. Eight-year-old Ruth (Svea Lohde) is waiting for her mother to come out and has nowhere to go, but she meets Lena's 33-year-old (Katja Riemann) who takes her. Lena's husband Fabian (Martin Feifel) is also in and eventually tries to socialize with the Nazi officials to help them do something. <br /> <br /> Margarethe von Trotta corrects this film. She made her first feature film in almost 10 years after working in television and although it is clearly not one of her more challenging efforts, she remains one of the most respectable directors in Europe. It is not one of the Nazi films where we see ominous acts of inhumanity to Jews, although we see that serious treatment is being issued, but it is rather a re-enactment of a small life and death event for the involved people mean. This film does not attempt to shock anyone or open the door to debates about the circumstances, but what it simply wants to do is simply a light on a small but real life event that occurred during a historical period. Part of the film's strength comes from his actors and there are some good performances that especially shine through Riemann and young Lohde and it is always good to see Schrader (Aimee & Jaguar) in a central role. It is not a good movie or something that changes your perspective on World War II but takes into account that innocent lives have been killed because of the events that occurred. I think that reason alone is important enough to recall this true story.
