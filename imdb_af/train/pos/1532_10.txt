It is, like Murder She Wrote, one of those shows, that I watch and watch TV after a stressful day at school. Why? Because I really enjoy it and it is a pity it is no longer on the air. Dick Van Dyke is wonderful as Dr Mark Sloan, a doctor-carried detective, who murders with his son. He is linked by a largely unknown but very capable supporting role, namely his actual son, Barry Van Dyke. Victoria Rowell is also good, but I noticed that each series changed her hairstyle. I also liked Scott Baio and Charlie Schlatter, but I especially loved Michael Tucci as Norman, and was amazed how he suddenly disappeared. This show is so entertaining, with big gas stars, it's sometimes striking like Colombo, but in every episode there's always something to complain about. Finally, a huge series, with two thumbs and a 10/10. Bethany Cox
