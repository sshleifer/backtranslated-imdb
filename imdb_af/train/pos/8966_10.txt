It's a wonderful movie, making the 1950's beautifully stylish. Kim Novak is intriguing and compelling as a contemporary witch with a foot in Manhattan and another in infinity. All the supporting performances are great, from Jack Lemmon, like her neck to Ernie Kovacs, as the author of Magic in Mexico, who works at Magic in Manghattan, to Elsa Lanchester as the slightly sturdy and aunty lady Queenie. And then there is the cat. I have no idea how many witches (except me) called a Pyewacket cat, but suggest a zillion. Jmes Stewart looks out of place, but just as much as his character from p; ace in this strange sub-world of magic and witchcraft. Perfect. And it has the perfect romantic happy ending, for which we believe, because films of this vintage have those happy ends. Gillian and Shep certainly have so much chance of being happy, like Rose and Charlie Allnut in The African Queen (another good movie)
