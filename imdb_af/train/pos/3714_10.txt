First, I didn't know what to expect when I started the video. <br /> <br /> When someone returns a cult-type movie genre and fits it into the present, something inexplicable is lost in the translation. <br /> <br /> This is not the case here. This movie just starts on the right track. It is part of well-known area, but it also manages it above. Crockzilla scene someone? It should be seen, and just try a straight face. This movie takes some of the old fun cult movie classics and seamlessly controls it in a modern production. It's good to see someone filling the need in this market. Well done. <br /> <br />
