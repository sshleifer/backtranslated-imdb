I always thought it would be a long and boring Talking-Heads movie full of static inland, old, I was wrong. "Election" is a highly engaging and thoroughly engaging thriller drama. It takes a deep and realistic view behind the origins of Triads-Rituals. Characters are constantly going on, and as a viewer you always remain an outsider, but it's still possible to feel the tension of certain decisions and ambitions of the characters. In addition, Johnnie has succeeded in creating some real cute images due to meticulous composite lighting and atmospheric light shade contrasts. Although there is almost no action, the end is still shocking because it is relentless portrayal of cruelty. Cool movie that deserves more attention, and I achieved the minimalist acoustic guitar score properly.
