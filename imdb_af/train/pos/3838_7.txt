THE FOURTH MAN (Paul Verhoeven - The Netherlands 1983). <br /> <br /> A film based on a novel by Gerard Reve, which works best as a thrill. This is quite surprising, as Reve needs predominantly one hundred pages for just a little plot twist and tension is the last thing I read in his mind. <br /> <br /> "The Fourth Man" is heavy on symbolism. Paul Verhoeven is generally extremely concerned with proving something to the most hostile critics and I am never sure what exactly he is trying to prove. He usually underestimates his audience and tells his story in such an unreliable way. Often he differs from the original idea or storyline, and looks almost forgotten what should be seen on the screen and which should be omitted. In "The Fourth Man" he is not so explicit to describe the plot as he is with sex and nudity (of which there are enough), but as in most of his films he seems afraid that the audience will not get it and hammers go home the story with overt symbolism mixed with some so-called shocking nudity and graphic sex scenes. There is hardly a scene without sex or front nakedness, most of it is so maddeningly free and in your face it undermines another good story. <br /> <br /> However, if you can handle Verhoeven's distinctive satirical approach, it is sometimes an entertaining thriller, sometimes with some interesting screenplays and good performances, especially Thom Hoffman and Jeroen Krabb√©. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 7/10
