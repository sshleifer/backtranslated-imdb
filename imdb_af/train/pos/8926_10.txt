I don't think anyone except Terrence Malick and maybe Tran Anh Hung make theater on a pure level as Claire Denis. That said, I don't love this, her latest movie, as much as her 2001 masterpiece "Trouble Every Day" (though very close), which is one of my absolute favorite movies. That's just because the narrative here might be a bit too elliptical for its own good. Don't get me wrong, the fact that this movie has no plot is actually one of the best things about it, but I think Denis has gone about one degree beyond what was needed to go and consequently flourish the movie with incomprehensibility, and a few key points had to somehow been cleared up (such as the main character going to South Korea to get his heart transplant, instead of just showing him suddenly without any explanation of where he is or why he is there). Also, some of the other characters were unnecessary and as if they were just excuses for Denis to use actors, she keeps apart (especially Beatrice Dalle's character is a bit distracting because you expect her to have some meaning) . Yet the film is incredibly absorbent and cinematography is over. It is definitely a masterpiece in its own way. At least as good as Denis's more well-known "Beau travail", if not better. Claire Denis must now be my favorite French director, better than Leos Carax. I also have to admit that the South Korean order really means 'Lost Translation', better than the movie itself (and I am, unlike some, a big fan of that movie).
