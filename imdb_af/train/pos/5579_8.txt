I have never heard of this movie until I accidentally hit it when I visited IMDB. I've seen it get very horrible reviews that contain lots of colorful explanations about how much it has hit. Of course, that means I had to see it. I was pleasantly surprised because Whipped is actually a good movie. I watched it with a group of friends and we laughed more than we had at many recent high-profile Hollywood fluff comedies. It is an independent film and as such depicts its subject (sex and dating) without the ordinary Hollywood fiction. I fully suspect that people's opinion of this movie depends very much on their experience of life. If you have never dated or divorced, you will not get this movie because you will not meet people like these characters. If you have, you will recognize many of the situations presented here in comedian fashion. The end was also good, as it did not portray women as unreal, helpless, virgin romantics as opposed to many Hollywood movies.
