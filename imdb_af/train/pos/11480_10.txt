Cut to the Chase: This is one of the most wonderful, most intense movies I've ever seen. The first movie in years that totally disturbed me. I could barely feel my way out of the theater, I was so overwhelmed. <br /> <br /> I watched the screen about fifteen minutes and try to describe the power of this movie and just fail. Strikingly any aspect of it - the documentary style video diary format, the incomprehensible portrayal of the events, the power of the characters - just seems to trivialize it all. Some people find it feasible that any killer can usually be characterized. But then not all killers, but screaming lunatics foam at the mouth. Many are very regular, modest people. They are just differently wired. <br /> <br /> And this is perhaps the most chilling idea of ​​all.
