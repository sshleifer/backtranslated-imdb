Lars Von Trier is never backwards to try out new techniques. Some of them are very original, while others are best forgotten. <br /> <br /> He shows post-war Germany as a nightmare train journey. With so many cities in ruins, Leo Kessler feels young Americans are compelled by German descent to help in their recovery. It's not a simple task, as he quickly finds out. <br /> <br /> His uncle finds him a job as a night leader on the Zentropa railway line. His job is to attend to the needs of the passengers. When the shoes are polished, a lime mark is made on the soles. A terrible argument follows when a passenger's shoes are not lime, despite being polished. There is much talk of German fanaticism in complying with such stupid details. <br /> <br /> The railway journey is like an allegory that represents man's march through life with all its trials and tribulations. In one row, Leo pushes through the rear carriages to discover them filled with half-hungry bodies that have just escaped from Auschwitz. These images, as horrible as they are, are fleeting as in a dream, each with its own terrible impact but not yet connected. <br /> <br /> At a station called Urmitz, Leo jumps out of the train with a packet of bomb. In view of many assistants, he connects the bomb to the bottom of a car. He returns to his cabin and connects to a timer. Later he jumps off the train (at high speed) and lies in the cool grass on a river. He looks at the stars above and decides that his work is to build and not to destroy. When he saw the train reaching a huge bridge, he walked with a breaking speed to walk to the train and stop the clock. If you care about analyzing the situation, it is a completely impossible task. Quite ridiculous. It can only happen in a dream. <br /> <br /> It is strange how one remembers small details, such as a row of hooks hanging on hooks and running away from the train. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that this film is very well known, I prefer Lars Von Trier's later films (Breaking the Waves and The Idiots). The evil scene described above really dismissed me. Maybe I'm a realist.
