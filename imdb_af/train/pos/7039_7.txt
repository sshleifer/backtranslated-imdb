War Inc. is a funny but strange movie. The actors are nice, the movie is nice too, but I don't know how to describe the plot. I'll go into the plot later. It's a movie with some weird deciding choices. Besides John Cusack as a hit, we saw empty things I wanted in Grosse Point years ago. <br /> <br /> Here we have Hilary Duff a Russian pop star named Yonica Babyya or something. Her character is strange. There is a scene where she puts a scorpion in her pants. And hits on Hauser (Cusack). There is a twist in the end that involves the two characters. It makes sense. <br /> <br /> It's the only decisive choice I'm going to make. Because it's just strange. The whole movie is strange. But at times incredibly funny and I was never bored. Here we have some of the best actors out there. Excluding Miss. Duff. She's not big. But here we have John Cusack, Marisa Tomeii, Joan Cusack, Ben Kingsley. See what I mean? <br /> <br /> This is the story of a hit named Hauser (Cusack). He was sent to a Middle Eastern city to place a hit on an oilman named Omar Sheriif (not the actor). While trying to deal with his own personal problems, he has to help the wedding of a pop star (played by Hilary Duff). And he falls in love with a news reporter (played by Marisa Tomeii). However, there is something about the pop star. Hauser is disgusting to her. There is a scene where she sings a song to him and then he throws up. <br /> <br /> The turn in the end of the movie reveals kind of why. The thing about the twist is that I did well. But it does not matter. It's a strange, funny and entertaining comedy. I love most actors. So really, how can I not recommend it? <br /> <br /> War, Inc .: 3.5 / 5
