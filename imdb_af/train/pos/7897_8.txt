At first sight, this movie doesn't look like a wonderful one. After all, a Bette Davis movie with only 166 votes on IMDb and a 6.5 score should be a bit bad. But the movie seems to have been a wonderful and original surprise. <br /> <br /> You'd first expect it to be a normal average typical '30's movie with a formal love story, but the movie is surprisingly well-crafted and has an unusual and original story, which also helps this movie to make a very enjoyable one. <br /> <br /> The story is borne by its two main characters played by Bette Davis and George Brent. They helped by a movie of mostly amusing characters, but the movie is mainly about them two. Their character is involved in a most unusual and cleverly written love story that also works humorously. It makes this movie a great little comedy to watch, it is perfectly entertaining. <br /> <br /> The movie is pretty short (just over an hour long), meaning the story doesn't waste any time on unnecessary time, plot lines, development and characters. It also makes the movie quite faster, which helps make this movie a perfect viewable one according to today's standards. It may make the movie a bit of a simple one, but it's never at the expense of its entertainment or fun. <br /> <br /> A beautiful, pleasant, simple romantic comedy earned to see more! <br /> <br /> 8/10
