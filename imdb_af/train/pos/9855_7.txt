This is my first CG animated movie I've ever seen. Usually, the look of other animated films made me see them. Not ice age. I wanted to see it when I saw the trailer with Scrat, the hilarious sabertooth squirrel. <br /> <br /> Ice age was sporadically funny and overall fun movie to watch. The story is basically an animated version of Three Men and a Baby, which has set 20,000 years in the past. The footage was wonderful. Simply beautiful. It's one thing to create convincing aninmation, it's another thing to create, in total, visually arrested things and Ice Age is great to look at its stylized visual art. Blue Sky Studios is a company to look into in the future.
