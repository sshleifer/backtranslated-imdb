When I watched this movie, my expectations were very low, but I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> I thought I'd see a boring teenage movie, BUT the plot was interesting and well done, the acting was somewhat convincing - especially from Melville who really shows his talent in this movie, and battle scenes were - for a low budget film - very well done. <br /> <br /> I think this movie earns a bigger audience than it did. This is a movie that can be seen throughout the family - perhaps not the smallest of the kids, as it contains rather jerky scenes. A movie about love, and the problems that can occur when you go against your family traditions. <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie is much like "Bend it like Beckham", but I actually think this movie is better off.
