Elephant Step (1954) With an early Peter Finch as lord of the shepherd in a God-forsaken plantation where there is always the danger of elephants or mad English men, who stay in the afternoon sun and go berserk. Well, finally, they do, of course, to the typhoid or cholera outbreak, and many chaos occur. Taylor replaces a sick Vivien Leigh in this potty / adventure movie. When the elephants storm the house and Liz steps on the big stairs, I still get dots. Thanks Dana Andrews is saving the day. One of my favorite guilty pleasures. Also in color!
