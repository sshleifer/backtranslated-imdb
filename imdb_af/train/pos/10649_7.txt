What can I say about it? It's another Hollywood horror movie with a very high budget ($ 80 million). It's not scary, but it just gives us some excitement and one very horrible sequence with the skeleton in the fireplace. Many computer-generated special effects and nothing more. Catharina Zeta-Jones is beautiful as always, Lili Taylor is also a good actress. The Hill House architecture is wonderful, all these monuments, statues, furniture ... Delicious! But I don't like the end because it was so nice. Look at this one and form your own opinion on it. I give this picture 7 out of 10.
