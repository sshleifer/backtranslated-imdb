This film has very raw potential. The script is sharp, the dialogue is (usually) excellent (although it can be to lose the excessive voice loss), the direction and cinematography are surprisingly pretty good, although some of the experiments just don't work. The biggest problem here is David Duchovny. Once a geek boy, always a geek boy; And the sad, simple fact is that he can play nothing but Fox Mulder. He puts it, he's trying to be smooth, he says, he's trying to be a macho. In the end he just tries too hard. He survived his character, he overshadowed his lines, and he was only played in all ways by Timothy Hutton and Angelina Jolie, who are each in a class above him in terms of acting skill. Timothy Hutton was (as always) really good. There was a mocking moment or two where he overestimated his role, but you could say he had fun with it. He watched the part, and he became both physical and atmospheric. Angelina Jolie was also really good. She didn't have much of a role; In fact, although she could have used a much stronger one, her character didn't develop nearly enough, though she did remarkably well with what she had. And the chemistry between her and Hutton was clear (give, maybe that's why Uma left him ...;) All in all, it was rough around the edges, but a good effort by a good role and great supporting roles. If David Duchovny hadn't torn his part, it would have been so much better. 10/07.
