It's a good movie. I like it more every time I look. Most comedies can be pretty crippled because you know all the gags, but mystery men have so much integrity in the writing and characterization that looks again - like Ben Stiller tears at the hood's decoration of the limo, or Hank Azaria says goodbye to Louise Lasser, or Geoffrey Rush flashes his choreography of his choreography, or Tom Waits mumbles as he watches the news report, or Janeane Garofalo refuses to kiss Paul Reubens - is a pleasure. It is a peak perfect ensemble acting. The story develops directly and consistently, the action ranges are creative and not too dominant, all set-ups pay at the end. Seriously, if you saw it and it was a while, watch it again, and if you didn't even start. You can't see it again until you've seen it for the first time. (West Studi, William H. Macy, the tryouts scene. Too many good things!)
