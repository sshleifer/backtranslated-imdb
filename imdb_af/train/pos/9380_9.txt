A nice old-fashioned excitement that follows a cross between Alfred Hitchcock and David Lynch, 'Red Rock West', is the misadventures of injured veteran unemployed oil worker Mr. N.Cage, as his luck from bad to worse gets worse with an empty gas tank and barely enough money for a cup of coffee in one village in the back of it. From the beginning it was established that Mr. Cage may be, but he is not out, and he can be broken, but he will not steal even in his current difficult circumstances. As a result, Mr J.T. Walsh for the man he ordered to kill his wife, Cage urged the woman to warn her of her husband's intentions. In turn, she offers, in the person of Miss. LFBoyle, him even more money to Mr. Walsh. Mr. Cage. decides to leave while still ahead, but when he leaves town, he strikes a man in the road. While driving, he took the man to the hospital, where he was shot. Mr. Cage is detained by the Deputies who call the sheriff who appears to be Mr JTWalsh. Events take a further complicated turn when, escaping from Mr. Mr.Cage, avoids the real hit coming in to fulfill his commission. At the moment you can be forgiven for thinking enough, but as it happens on the screen, it seems to be a completely logical event, the narrative flow of the movie which at this time seems unstoppable. Mr. D. Hopper was comfortably thrown as the hired killer, like Mr. Cage, a USMC veteran. This little piece of serendipity holds Mr. Cage long enough in life. Think of the murderous trio and survive, a little more abused, but still inflexible. It's a tribute to everyone involved, who looks remarkably like a piece of nonsense on paper, is actually a tense, exceptionally well-made picture with good performances everywhere. "Red Rock West" is a movie lover's movie. With five minutes you know you're going somewhere, but many times you are very happy, but you'll be very happy during the trip.
