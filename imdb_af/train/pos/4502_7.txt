I saw almost all the films of Cynthia Rothrock, and to me this is the funniest. It reminds me of early Jackie Chan movies. Admittedly, Ms Rothrock cannot be the greatest actress, but she is very good at watching as a martial artist and as a very cute young lady. This movie, probably not the best of all her films, was the most entertaining.
