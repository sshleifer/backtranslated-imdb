I don't think most people give this movie as much credit as it deserves. I like low budget horror movies and it takes the cake, especially for originality. Yes the scarecrow is a Kung-Fu fighter, but why not? No one else is prepared to go that far. I've not had much fun watching a movie since Candyman. So the town chooses on this one child who calls him scarecrow, even his mother doesn't care for him. Then he is killed and the spirit is brought into the scarecrow, which then goes on a Killing Spree. His demise is relatively easy to accept as soon as the movie goes down. The dedications at the end go straight to a lot of horror directors, but with the most dedication to Dario Argento I got so cool, these people who want to make newer movie films. Over the movie many Arnold rip offs, with one liners you will definitely laugh like holding on and he kills the sheriff with a stick. I would say, grab a pizza a few friends and laugh at your $$ with this movie. I love it for its originality, the most fun.
