First, a quick 'shut up!' to those who say this movie stinks. You can't go to every movie that 'Citizen Kane' expects. It was actually a fun movie. Jason Lee is good at everything he does. The only mistake in this movie is, I don't think there's enough chemistry between Lee and Julia Stiles. They had to devote more to it. Other than that, the movie is fun. Selma Blair should eat something. She worries me. But she still looks pretty. So yes, I recommend this movie for a date or light Saturday afternoon fun. Go see. <br /> <br /> RATING: ** 1/2 off ****
