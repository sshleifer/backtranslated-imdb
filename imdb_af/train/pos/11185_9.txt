Being one of the favorite novels, I was excited to see the move. I was not disappointed! Yes, of course, there are a few things I can do, but I think the film is true to the book, and it was a very good movie. It seems that Stephen King films tend to get a bad review, but this is one of the good things. It's such a dark story I think is why I like it. And what's better than the dead come to life. And something about animals coming back from the grave is also quite creepy. If you've seen the movie, do yourself a great favor and now read the book !! It's a well-written screenplay, the actors could have done a better job (I only say it to Rachel and Ellie. She was so scary). I loved everyone very much. And most important to me. true to the novel.
