Greetings again from the darkness. Expected, twisted comedy by writer / director Richard Shepard is an outing for Pierce Brosnan, the actor. There Bond man is gone. This new guy is something else completely !! Read that Shepard thinks Brosnan was too much the beautiful boy for this plum roll, but Brosnan seems to be the perfect Julian Noble, "Facilitator", and is all but beautiful! Don't underestimate how twisted the humor is in this one. If you go, expect punch lines and sight gags regarding all types of sex, murder, religion, sports, business and anything else that you may find politically wrong. Brosnan takes an excellent script to another level with his wonderful facial movements and physical movements. Even sitting on a hotel bed (with or without a sombrero) is a joy to see. <br /> <br /> Greg Kinnear is the straight guy for Brosnan's cartoon and has a lot of depth and comic timing to make this partnership click. Hope Davis has a small but subtly effective support role as Kinnear's wife (what is his "Bean"?) What happens to get a little excited when she has a facilitator in her living room. <br /> <br /> The visuals and settings are perfect - including a bullfight, race track and Denver suburb. And how often do we get The Killers and Xavier Cugat on the same soundtrack? This one is definitely not for everyone, but if your sense of humor is a bit of a hub and you enjoy risky movies, it can be for you.
