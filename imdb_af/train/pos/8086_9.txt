I recently rented the animated version of The Lord of the Rings on video after watching the FANTASTIC 2001 Live Action version of the movie. The Lord of the Rings live action trilogy directed by Peter Jackson will undoubtedly be much better if George Lucas's Star Wars prequel trilogy (episodes 1-3) will ever be the true fantasy movie series of the 21st century! <Br /> <br /> I remember seeing the animated version as a child, and I didn't understand the depth of the movie at that time. Having read the books, I understand what the whole story is about. Certainly, some of the characters are pretty stupid. (Samwise Gangee is particularly annoying, almost as much as Jar Jar Binks in Star Wars Episode One, (AWFUL!)), But I have to say it follows the book rather, and it will be part of book two, The Two Towers. The good thing is that the action is somewhat interesting and some of the animation is pretty remarkable because it's time. The bad thing is that it ends halfway through The Two Towers, without any consequence of Frodo's quest to destroy one ring and the animation looks fairly dated compared to today's standards. <br /> <br /> Overall, not as bad as many say it is. BUT, the 2001 action version is the new feature of The Lord of the Rings! At least Ralph Bakshi took the writing seriously! Peter Jackson said the animated version inspired him to read the books, which in turn made him one of the greatest fantasy series on film. That's why we can thank at least Ralph Bakshi for the matter! I will take the animated version of Lord of the Rings about the live version of Harry Potter anyday! <br /> <br /> A 7 out of 1-10, far less violent than the 2001 action version, but now close as well! For diehard fans of the books and film performances of The Lord of the Rings.
