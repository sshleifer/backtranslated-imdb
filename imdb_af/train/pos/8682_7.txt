I'm sad to say that I disagree with other people on this Columbo episode. Lending a hand is honestly kind of a boring Columbo to me. After a few times I was bored of the channel. I still love Robert Culp and Patricia Crowley and Ray Milland in their roles, but the story was worse in this episode than in the other. First, Robert Culp plays an investigator for Ray Milland's character. He hires him to investigate his young beautiful wife, played by Patricia Crowley, to see if she has a relationship. In return, Culp's character misses the fraudster who plans to expose his scheme to her husband who ruined his career. Out of anger Culp kills her by hitting her face and raising her body elsewhere. I do not know. Maybe I just didn't care about this one. Of course, Columbo finally gets him. That's just how.
