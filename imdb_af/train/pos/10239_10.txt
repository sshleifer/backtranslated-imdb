I don't agree with anyone who doesn't like this movie. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie when I was little and I still do. It's sweet, funny and warms your heart. And it proves that love and friendship can never be destroyed. <br /> <br /> And while it didn't have much of a story, it was still excellent. I give it a 10 and two inches. <br /> <br /> Oh, and it proves that your deepest desire and dreams can be realized. (Tears, tears) <br /> <br /> I love this movie, personally, if someone says it sucks if I say, "Shame on you." Because it was a beautiful little movie and I'm glad at least SOME people like it.
