Vertigo co-star Stewart (in his last turn as a romantic lead) and Novak raises it, Stewart's other 'Christmas movie' filmed to top entertainment. The chemistry between the two stars allows for a fairly moving experience and further revelation can be obtained from the movie if witchcraft is seen as a metaphor for private pain that impedes many people's relationships. All in all, a nice distraction with legendary stars, 7/10.
