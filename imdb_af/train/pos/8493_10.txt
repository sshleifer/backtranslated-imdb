this is a good movie !!! <br /> <br /> For the first time I've seen this movie fall out. I just saw this movie recently and it still keeps my memory. Many movies we watched when we were younger didn't seem to see us later than life. The movie is actually a big 80's example of the kind of movies made. Keaton is at its best, all the actors have done a very good job and Ron Howard was very good at getting the story printed. The pace of the movie is fast with a few slow spots and the 80's cars are too funny. From the 80's I was loved to see the ugly pacer again. The movie is a great movie for any comedy lovers and 80-year-old movie lovers.
