When the Chamberlain family camps near Ayers Rock, Australia, Lindy Chamberlain (Meryl Streep) sees her baby dragged out of the tent by a dingo and begins a trial that no one should experience. Because the dingo story doesn't seem to be believed by the public or the press, and the whole thing goes into a circus. Lindy does not help either, as she will not play in the jury or courtroom, she is just herself and she is a tough nut to crack. Everyone thinks it's guilty because there is evidence that didn't come. light. Sam Neill is excellent as Michael Chamberlain, a seventh-day Adventist pastor, who doubts his faith and perhaps his wife. It's good (or bad) to see people just as biased and stupid elsewhere as they are in the states, because the Australian public doesn't believe the story and the media just supports the flames. Eventually, Lindy was found guilty and sent to prison for a life of hard labor, but years later a missing piece of evidence appeared and she was freed, but not even after the family's life was basically destroyed. A heartbreaking story, very well done, a bit long but worth seeing. 8 out of 10.
