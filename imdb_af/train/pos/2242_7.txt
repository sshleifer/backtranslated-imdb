Partly from the perceived need, a conventional love story in the plot feels like making the film more marketable for a 1950s movie. <br /> <br /> The film begins with an evil funny characterization of high school bureaucrats managing the Foreign Office. The British are set in such a way that only the British can plunder themselves. But then the movie is lost in a conventional graphic plot. Terry-Thomas always looks, but the great talent in the movie (Peter Sellers, et al.) Is largely wasted. <br /> <br /> A distracting but not good movie.
