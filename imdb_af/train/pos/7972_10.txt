I watch this movie all the time. I saw it with family ages 3 to 87, and everyone in between; Everyone loved it. It really shows the real scenes that a dog has, and the love and loyalty you get from a pet. Just beautiful. <br /> <br /> It's great for those who love comedy movies, the ripping films, or even pets. <br /> <br /> The music is great, the animals are spectacular, the screens really thought out and the characters perfect. What I like about the characters is the real and beautifully mixed personalities: Shadow (The Oldest, a Golden Retriever) He is the wise man, filled with the wisdom and mindset of any dog. Chance (the American Bulldog puppy) is basically a puppy with a witty side, the comic character; And Sassy (The Hymilayan Cat) She is the real cat that shows what a real cat will do for their owner, the real girly one.
