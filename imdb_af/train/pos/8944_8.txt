Bell Book and Candle was released in December 1958 and includes James Stewart, Kim Novak, Jack Lemmon. and Ernie Kovaks. This movie features James Stewart and Kim Novak in their second screen pair (after the Alfred Hitchcock classic Vertigo, released earlier that year). It was Stewart's last film as a romantic lead, as at age 50 he became too old to play that kind of part. The film is about a witch played by Kim Novak who is attracted to a mortal played by James Stewart. She puts a game on him and he falls on her heels in love for her. I enjoyed the movie and its role player. This film was a moderate success at the time, nominated for the best movie comedy for a Golden Globe. GimmeClassics
