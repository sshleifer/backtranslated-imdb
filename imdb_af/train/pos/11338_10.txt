I saw it at "Dances with Movies" and it was wonderful. I really felt for Jake. Talk about adding insult to injury! Not only are your parents divorced, but there is a monster to you. <br /> <br /> It was both sad and scary - there were several moments in which the audience screamed in real fear. It reminded me of a Japanese horror movie, except that the story was really good. <br /> <br /> That's what Jake's Closet has separated from the usual indie movie pavilion - an excellent compelling character. By mixing the elements of the horror movie with family drama, the movie is also the best of both genres, avoiding both clicks. <br /> <br /> If it's not in the theaters, definitely get the DVD. .
