Care Bears Movie 2: A new generation is not a bad movie at all. In fact, I like it a lot. Yes, I admit that the dialogue is curly and the story is sometimes bad. But Darkheart, while very dark, is a convincing enough form of hide and seek, and Hadley Kay has done a wonderful job. Talking about the voice-acting, it was wonderful, nothing wrong with it at all. The animation is colorful, and some of the visuals at the beginning were breathtaking. The songs and the score are beautiful, especially Growing Up and Forever Young, the latter has always been my personal favorite of the two. Caring, which I love, is great, and the human children are well done. And the end is a real tearjerker. All in all, innocent children. 8/10 Bethany Cox
