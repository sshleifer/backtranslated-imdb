It's no surprise that Busey later developed a tumor in his sinus cavity. This film is also a poor decision, but one that I fully enjoyed. The first 5 minutes are the most uninspiring 5 minutes in any movie; boring, bad dialouge, and then, with a Spiderman attitude, Busey shouts the best worst line in any movie ever created ... "Your worst nightmare but tower!" I chopped some of my egg and laughed so loudly. That line resonates so well, it even tops Clooney's infamous "Hi Freeze, I'm Batman" line. Other classic moments are that Busey is constantly upset by people who remind him that he has killed his ex-CIA partner ... which he accidentally shot in the chest (all made possible by a super slow-motion flashback series that makes paint look dry seems exciting). There is an ashtray on the nads, bumps to the face, and a "it wasn't my fault and you know it!" Well, the image shows that he misses the bad man and hits his mate, so ... Other screaming moments should be his ex girlfriend dropping a grenade to the ground to enable his escape. logic, physics and absurdity. And lastly, when McBain jumped out of the Thunderblast during intense guerrilla warfare and started running and hindering a small object, I watered myself. Some of Busey's best work by far, rent or buy it today "butthorn!" My voice is a perfect 10 (on the meter).
