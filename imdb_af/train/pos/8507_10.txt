Well, you take O.J. Simpson as an American soldier has all the American bus drivers who decide to save his passengers on their own, just that no one else is going and Arte Johnson is in a straight role as the tour guide who does not know what to do but not I don't want to admit they are in trouble and combine it with Lorenzo Lamas as one of three baby's bad boys who intend to kidnap an heir and kill a busless person to die on the dessert and you must have action. and lots of drama. Everyone was good, but seeing Lamas as the bad boys of the bad boys, I really blew it. He was far too credible as the remaining bad guy who not only wanted to kidnap the heir, but raped the women and humiliated the man who wanted to stop him. It was apparently long before he had grown his good old image. And believe me a 20-year-old Lorenzo in tight jeans, you really don't want to miss out!
