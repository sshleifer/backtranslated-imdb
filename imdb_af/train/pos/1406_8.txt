Remember H.G. Wells' "The Invisible Man"? Well, here's another movie like that, just more extreme. "Hollow Man" is like no story about invisibility as a weapon of choice. Kevin Bacon plays Sebastian Caine, a scientific genius who goes out into the world of invisibility and makes it useful for military purposes. At first, the serum was the easy part, so the person did not return. Most of the first tries ended up unstable. Until one night he made the formula perfect. And who else, but Caine will be the labrot. The gorilla was the first and almost died, and when he arrived, it was closer. So when Caine decided, he decided to use it for pleasure. When he was tired of not being seen, the team tried their best to bring him back to the world of flesh. The visibility formula, however, happens that it does not work as it is needed, and Caine will be obscured in the madness. So he's a crazy invisible killer. It would be best to just get out of town, rather than take the lives of people near you. I would care less for those who did you wrong. Great movie, great fun. 3 out of 5 stars!
