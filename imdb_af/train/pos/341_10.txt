I really enjoyed this thriller! I wanted to see it again as soon as it was over. The movie was excellent, the plot was exciting and entertaining, and it was just an overall enjoyable movie! I would rate it as one of the best thrillers I've ever seen! The girls in it were also very cute, especially Denise Richards. She was very ornery through the film and has her character some OOMPH!
