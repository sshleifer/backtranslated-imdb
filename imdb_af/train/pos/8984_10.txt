I only saw this movie when I waved DirecTV through the movie channels. It was on the Sundance Canal and just started. I love music, especially late 60's and that's how the BJM sounded (The Dandys is alright). Everything about the Brian Jonestown massacre intrigued me from the music, to Anton and Joel's personalities, to the illegal drug use. It was funny, because when I watched the first party tones when everyone did rules, my parents walked and decided to look (the look of their faces was invaluable). Anyway, it's definitely one of my favorite movies because it introduced me to The Brian Jonestown Massacre who is now my favorite band. <br /> <br /> Just look ... seriously
