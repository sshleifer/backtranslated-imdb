What people don't understand about this movie is that it's not a start, middle and end, it's just the conclusion of a 26 episode TV series. So remember this if you all talk about how the world isn't researched enough. It was all in the TV show. <br /> <br /> As big and beautiful as the visuals, I think the *** SPOILERS *** argument between Lian-Chu and Gwizdo was near the end of the movie What really made me love this movie. To see characters I fought through 26 episodes was so disturbing, and when he saw Gwizdo, he was saddened by the swaying ruins while Lian-Chu cut his blade, almost tearing. <br /> <br /> Then we got a total contrast with Lian-Chu fighting these incredibly awesome dragons (who were previously in the series), while Gwizdo threatens to kill Zoe indirectly. * Shudder * I'm surprised this particular scene is no longer mentioned in the warnings. Any child who has a good sense will be able to see that Gwizdo was not himself and was quite intent on strangling that little girl. It was enough to bother me, and I'm 15. <br /> <br /> The world is great, the plot is much better than most multi-million blockbusters, and it was a nice way to get rid of me. see favorite characters go. Look at that. :)
