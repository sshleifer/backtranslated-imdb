The first thing I thought after watching "Mystery Men" was how could this movie be so unpopular? I found this movie so beautiful and funny that it ignored status as a bomb logic. Well, I hope this will be a cult hit in the future, and you can count me with his fans. <br /> <br /> Simply put, and without giving away too much, this cartoon for "the Princess Bride" made for fairy tales and "Who Rated Roger Rabbit?" did for classic cartoons. This should give you a more accurate idea of ​​the scene of the movie, then the marketing committee is unfortunately signed (this is one of the cases like the Iron Giant, where the studio had no idea what it had on his hands) . Rent it the next time you're in the mood for something a little horrible. You will never listen to the BeeGees again in the same light.
