These are the French and Belgians who do what they do best. It's strange, visually inventive, exciting and emotionally challenging storytelling. Director Jaco van Dormael takes us into the world of Georges, a Down Syndrome sufferer and his quest for a meaningful relationship with someone, just someone. It is not done in a protesting way, but with a great sense of fun and honesty. George's conversation with corporate governance guru, Harry is spectacularly handled - shifting from comedy to tragedy again with the breathtaking ease. Let's look at the eighth day, like a similar Hollywood festival like Barry Levinson's Oscar winner, Rain Man or Robert. Zemecki's Forrest Gump is good and really in the shade. Sometimes it made the humor of Milos Forman's One Flew about the Cuckoo's Nest cast into the shades of Dennis Potter. <br /> <br /> As the emotionally handicapped and desperate lonely yuppie, Harry, Daniel Auteuil turns into another sublime show. But it is similar to the brilliant Pascal Duquenne as Georges. It's a movie with uniformly strong performances and so many, memorable pieces - the shoe store, the showroom, George's dance to Genesis's "Jesus He knows me," the conference scene, the fireworks zone. If you haven't seen it, there's only one thing to do. Just rent or attend a retro theater near you and see what you lacked. Better still, buy this movie. Clean genius .....
