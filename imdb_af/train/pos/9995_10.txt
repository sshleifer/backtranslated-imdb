This is the kind of movie you want to see with a glass of wine, the fire on and with your feet up. It doesn't require as much brain power to follow, so it's great after a long day. I would say it is very unrealistic - if you expect something serious, don't bother it, but it's very funny. Just the idea that a businessman would go so far to agree to stay in a slum for a while, and then actually enjoy it. I would definitely recommend it.
