Greetings again from the darkness. What a relief ... a thrill that is really exciting! The new "IT" girl Rachel McAdams ("Wedding Crashers" and "The Notebook") dominates screen time in this beautiful, small classic suspense thriller by famous horror movie director Wes Craven ("Scream" movies and "A Nightmare on Elm Street" "). Craven even has a cameo as one of the passengers on the plane. <br /> <br /> What this one does is the realism of the first 15-20 minutes, as we see McAdams interacting with 4 or 5 people as well. person or telephone. She's of course. When she meets Cillian Murphy (the Scarecrow in "Batman Begins") in what appears to be contingency, the movie really takes flight. Flirting the two yuppies while the audience knows that something is wrong, breeds, is staggering movie processing! The aircraft boarding sequence is fascinating and the 30 plus minutes on board are unnecessarily claustrophobic. Craven keeps us guessing about the involvement of others and if someone comes to her rescue. <br /> <br /> As with many excited, the only decay occurs during the climax when the lamb becomes a superhero. An interesting plot device leads us to believe little Rachel has the necessary refurbished frustration to see it through, but we can't help but cringe. The most exaggerated scenes include irate hotel guests, an annoying airline passenger, Cillian's injury and the FX at the hotel. The strength of the film is in the character development and psychological games between the leaders. Unfortunately, the fine-screen veteran Brian Cox is underutilized, but overall it is a top-tensions stress worth seeing for anything but the finals.
