I have a two-year-old son suffering from the same condition as Jonny Kennedy. I never had the chance to meet him, but I have never heard anyone say a bad word about him. I hope he knows how much this program has helped his fellow leaders by raising awareness of this terrible condition. This man touched people in a way that a million charity leaves could not. I believe that this should be mandatory viewing in schools. I also agree with other comments - what should I complain about? He took everything that could put life on him and still managed to maintain a sense of humor. God bless. I couldn't look at the part that showed that its fittings were changing. I have enough trouble with my son.
