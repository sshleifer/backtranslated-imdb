I have to say that I really had no idea I was going to sit and watch this movie. I think it was the fact that I had nothing better to do between classes. But for once a TV movie caught my interest. More importantly, Helen Hunt caught my eye. I really wasn't a big fan of her before this movie. Sure, I like Twister and get it as good as it does. But, something about this movie really did it to me. I would see myself as a big fan. This movie comes with high points of ... I. Give it a chance, it won't let you down.
