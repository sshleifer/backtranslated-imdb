It is not a brilliant idea to watch Dog Stage if you are not 100% sure of your spiritual stability, as it will be seriously tested with this film, no matter how healthy you are. I have to say Hundstage is an art film rather than an entertainment film, so the majority of viewers will not have the level of maturity to get into its beautiful side. Similar Tarkovsky movies, but different in a way. I can't say I really enjoyed it myself. But it's an excellent and very interesting experience for those who are only tormented by the clich√© offering Hollywood. Hundstage bumps a finger right into your brain and scratches your head. You can't just sit back and watch, you will use shouts or look open through the film. A movie similar to this one in style is Night Creatures, but it was much better, and less violent. This one, for example, is not for children or those who are mentally or ill. Most viewers will probably also give a 10 or a 1 to this movie. I gave it a 9 because I saw the multiple story-in-one movie feature in another movie and it was better. But this one is an excellent piece on its own. Like to watch, but get ready to upset something.
