I want to warn you that there is a lot of bittersweet quality for this comment. This comment will also be far more meaningful to you after watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Although it is tragically sad to say, the movie has a similarity to my life that is so striking that it really is. frightening. The rest of you will never know how accurate that movie portrays how people who have been in such situations react in their later lives. <br /> <br /> It couldn't have been a fiction work; It had to be based on personal experience. <br /> <br /> My testament to how good the film was, is shown by the fact that, while it was one of the best movies I have ever seen, my life was watched on the silver screen. such a painful experience that I will never see again. <br /> <br /> But I warmly support all others as an opportunity to enter into the soul of another person to the extent that you have never or never experienced before. I know this for a fact, because it is my soul that you will see.
