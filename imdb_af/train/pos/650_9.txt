A great movie, rather challenging than really entertaining. Unfortunately there are no memorable quotes here, but this one is my favorite: Alexandre: If you leave someone you loved, tell me what I'm saying to you, "Farewell, I'm going." But to disappear, to hide like a criminal, is insignificant. (Didn't watch it with English subtitles) <br /> <br /> In my opinion it all speaks. There is so much tactic involved in the relationship between Alexandre and the other, and yet everyone wants a little more truth. However, knowing the truth can hurt even more, as Alexandre experiences. General interpretation is that the film criticizes the mere possibility of "liberated love" by depicting the unwanted implications on the persons concerned. It does show it in a convincing way, but I would appreciate it if the reasons were dealt with a little more in depth: it is not that liberated love itself is doomed to failure, but people (especially men, I think) must work on themselves and try to overcome the prevailing morals before and not through the practice of liberated love. <br /> <br /> It says the movie's realistic but really worth watching.
