DOCTEUR PETIOT, starring Michel Serrault, is a cruel story about a cruel man. A doctor who cures the sick in inhabited France, even if their ability to compensate is not there. Yet he tastes the worst in the midst of the population. The images and cinematography are great, and give an additional easy feel to this complex story. He is the perfect psychopath. Seductive and altruistic, intelligent and caring, calculating and killing. A movie that should not be forgotten soon by the viewer. Kudos to Mr. Serrault, for his cold portrayal.
