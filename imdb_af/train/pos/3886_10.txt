Eddie Izzard is genius with his non-stop humor. I could hear the whole day. His unique approach to life is fairly logical. His understanding of discovery (such as the Heimlich maneuver) is creative. Eddie Izzard catches the heart of what we think. I don't know when I laughed so hard at anyone's flyhalf.
