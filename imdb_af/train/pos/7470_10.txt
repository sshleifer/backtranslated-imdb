I went to see Vanilla Sky with a big, big, big !! Tom Cruise, my very cynical brother and my girlfriend ... what can I say. I was totally blown away by the movie and especially TC's performance, I thought it was a very moving movie and it was not what I expected. <br /> <br /> I read the reviews and decided not to look. I'm so glad I'm "forced" to see it. The strange thing is that I can't say why, all I can say is that I have completely engaged it and couldn't think the next day. What I felt about the movie is all I can say, it's not the story (fantasy, psychodrama, whatever), it's about people and events that shape their lives and how small events like being in a car climb, can change everything ...... <br /> <br /> About what the critics wrote, yes, maybe the original is an incredible 2nd movie for Alejandro Amen√°bar, but it was a totally different interpretation of the subject, and by no means a narcissistic remake for the sake of Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz. <br /> <br /> I can't even consider writing some striking slips to describe the movie, go it! <br /> <br /> Yes, I know it's not a balanced, thorough review, but so. It's not that kind of movie.
