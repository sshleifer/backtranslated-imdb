There are people who claim it is another "poor language" ultra-violence Mexican movie. They are right, but more than that, this film is a call to create awareness of what we have become. The terrible truth hurts or spoils when you have already accepted the paradigm to live the third world as the only possible goal. One of the key things of "Cero y of Cuatro" is the open invitation for a profound reflection on our current identity. Is that what we all are? Is this all we want to be? I'm abroad and I realized how devastated the Mexican society was when the Tlahuac incident came to light. I still can't understand viewers who see a mass transfer. I almost puked when I saw some of the images. It wasn't Iraq or Rwanda, just a small town near Mexico City when rampage was carried out with media and government concessions. The relaxation of a similar situation in this movie shocked me deeply. The other stories were good at portraying other situations of corruption, dishonesty, betrayal and violence, but I consider Tamales de Chivo the best. <br /> <br /> The movie is deeper than some "cabr√≥n" and "pendejo" scream. It is meaningless compared to the actions of the people. With a few exceptions, they are all perfect examples of human rubbish. Just as in real life, honesty becomes more exceptional than the rule in our country. In addition, honesty is only miraculously rewarded.
