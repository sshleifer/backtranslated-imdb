Well, maybe not immediately before the Rodney King riots, but even a few months before was timely enough. My parents said they saw it and the next thing you know, police got acquitted and LA burned on the ground. It's just about showing the state of racial relations in America. The plot has become white Mack (Kevin Kline) and African American Simon (Danny Glover) friends after Simon Mack's life in the black ghetto saves. Meanwhile, movie producer Davis (Steve Martin in a serious role) thinks gratuitous violence is really cool ... until he gets shot. There is also a bit of existentialism in the movie: Mack and his family realize that they are not living the way they really want. <br /> <br /> It seems that "Crash" has a bit of renewed interest in race relations, but this one came out much earlier. Perhaps we will never be able to have stable race relations in this country. But either, "Grand Canyon" is a good movie. This confirms Kevin Kline as my favorite actor. Also starring Mary McDonnell, Mary-Louise Parker and Alfre Woodard.
