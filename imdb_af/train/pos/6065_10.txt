This movie is awful - in a 'so bad it's good' kind of way. <br /> <br /> The storyline is repeated from so many other movies of this kind that I won't even bother it. This is a sword / magic picture, a child hopes to realize how important he is in this world, has a "nomadic" adventurer, an evil aide / wizard, a princess, a hairy creature. .. you get the point. br /> <br /> The first time I caught this movie was during a very hard winter. I don't know why I decided to watch it for an extra five minutes before turning the channel, but when I caught up with the Gulfax site, I decided to keep looking until the end. <br /> <br /> Gulfax is a white, hairy creature related to Chewbacca but not nearly as useful or entertaining to watch. He looked as if someone was sticking together a bunch of white mats and forced the actor to wear it. There are scenes where the actor seems to be unable to move inside, or that he almost falls. Although not so much in the movie, the few scenes are worth it! Watch as he tries to talk, beat Bo Svenson, and take the Solo-Chewbacca equation to an even higher level! <br /> <br /> I just bought this movie because of that character, and still have it somewhere! <br /> <br /> Gulfax can look like sh! t, but he made this movie !!! The only reason I had never seen or even looked for the successor was because of his absence! Maybe there should be a final movie, which completes the trilogy, Gulfax will make a very expected return!
