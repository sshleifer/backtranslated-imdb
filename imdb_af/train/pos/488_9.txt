Part of the pleasure I took from this movie was the fact that I knew nothing more of it than John Turturro and Emily Watson (2 reasons enough to watch). Everything that developed before me was completely unexpected. So I won't throw away any more. Suffice it to say that Turturro is wonderful as an eccentric, obsessive and deeply vulnerable chess genius and Em takes him step by step as the brave woman drawn to him. It's about love and obsession, rather than the venerable board game, and after gradually getting in, I became completely compelling. And I am defending someone to guess the end.
