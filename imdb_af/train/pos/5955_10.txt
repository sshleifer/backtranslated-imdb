As the creator of "This Darkness," I acknowledge that we have neglected 3 very important acknowledgments in our end credits. The omissions were overnight stays that couldn't be committed once, nor were the parties involved --- who saw the movie - mentioned it at the time. On behalf of the excellent film and crew of the film, I apologize to them. Obviously, some criticisms made here are difficult in view of their accidental credit. Our production values ​​were insignificant and our "special effects" were quite special, but the plot is very strong and cinematography by John McLeod is wonderful. We hope you, the reader, enjoy "This Darkness" and the efforts of those who finish their chicks for free. Thanks, Dylan O'Leary, Director.
