Edward Furlong and Christina Ricci are an excellent couple and demonstrate this with their unique charisma featured in this movie. <br /> <br /> This is the typical "alternative" or indie movie with a plot that contains a rare situation that suddenly becomes. very important. <br /> <br /> Pecker is an average boy who has an old camera and his main hobby is taking pictures of the exotic inhabitants of the village where he lives. Suddenly, an alternative artist pays attention to his work and hires him to expose his work in some important festivals and more. <br /> <br /> But the Pecker life changes drastically because now happiness and fame seem to disrupt the town's people who are Pecker's greatest inspiration. Even his sexy girlfriend gets angry because he doesn't pay the "enough" attention to her now. <br /> <br /> Well, it's an Indian movie with a border but not everyone. It may seem boring or pretentious to some people, but I still think it's just a watch worthy because it offers something different from Hollywood's typical standards. <br /> <br /> To describe in a few words: This is the typical Christina Ricci and John Waters movie. This is it. <br /> <br /> Oh, and I almost forgot to mention that the "Full of Grace" lines are very annoying. Geez.
