It's just 2 episodes in a 5-part drama, but I can already say it's one of the best things I've ever seen. It's on TV, silver screen or even in real life. <br /> <br /> As a writer, it's so good that it's almost demoralizing! As a viewer, it's so entertaining that I'm irritated. The episodes are in two weeks instead of Monday to Friday. Obviously, all these negatives are actually positive. <br /> <br /> I am a modern guy who previously transmitted TV dramas. Compared to movies, it seems that TV dramas are always dated, fairly soft and good, usually boring! "Five Days" really made TV drama in the 21st century, so that is at least the mind for me. Go see it.
