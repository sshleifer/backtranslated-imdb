A meteorite falls out of the air and revives a plesiosaur that used the area around Crater Lake long ago. As the monster eats the locals, they try to kill the monster. Recent attempts to send out old horror and science fiction movies such as Lost Skeleton Cadavra and Alien Trespass are similar when you have movies like Crater Lake Monster available for screening. It's the kind of movie that those movies spoof and just send it is the right deal. That's all those movies are trying to be just with the tongue in the cheek and it's so much more fun because of it. It's a real entry-type movie that had the unfortunate luck to come, just as Star Wars changes the way we look at special effects. The monster, a mixture of stop motion and a life-size head, is a beautiful, beautiful little animal. The filmmakers spoil the audience with regular shots of the monster and its chaos. Surely it is clear that all this is false, but are there no movies about the suspension of unbelief? Actually, I think it's really cool monsters that have it. <br /> <br /> I like this movie in a low budget tour of some sort. If you want a real authentic drive in the monster movie look no further. It will be perfect for a double or triple feature with similar multi-sample films (Boggy Creek, etc.).
