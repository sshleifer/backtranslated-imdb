If you love Jamie Foxx (Alvin Sanders), "Date Of Hell," "01," you'll love having his actions as a man who never gets an eternal break in life and with the Shrimps Jumbo Size at the same time many gold bars. Alvin Sanders has many FBI eyes that see and excite him through a brick in the jaw, and David Morse (Edgar Clenteen), 'Hack' '02 TV series, decides to use and use a zero on poor Alvin him as a so-called Fish Hook to attract the criminals. There is a lot of laughter, drama, cold bloodshed and excellent movie locations and very expensive cars are sent to the Junk Yard. Jamie Foxx and David Morse were outstanding actors in this movie and it was fantastic entertainment throughout the picture.
