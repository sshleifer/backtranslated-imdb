Another of the brilliant young men who went out and dared to make a teenage romance movie (I can actually call it - that would call the devil out of his fans) on a micro budget, but with such a taste, sensitivity and maturity. Peter Sollett-you deserve more admiration and respect. Thanks again for the forces in the "industry", that stereotypes can be flushed to the toilet. One place, a handful of rich characters, low budget, good acting (and also amateurs), decent lighting worshipers of true indie cinema, should look more and watch STOP ... well ... you know what.
