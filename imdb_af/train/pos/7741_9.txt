The first of two Jim Thompson adaptations released in 1990 (the other being the well-known GRIFTERS), AFTER DARK already has Thompson's features: Dangerous Women, the Confident Game and Characters That Are Not as Dull as Others Suspect , or not so innocent. <br /> <br /> Jason Patric is wonderful as a former boxer who has been disqualified from the sport for life due to an incident in the ring. (Director James Foley uses RAGING BULL-esquire rows around the back story) and the under-seen Rachel Ward also delivers a good performance. But Bruce Dern is the secret weapon of the movie. His lovely cute uncle Bud delivers subtly every one of his screens. <br /> <br /> There is almost no comic relief in this movie, so watch it ready to be sucked into the void. .
