It's a clever drama about the way of life in the early 1980s in Texas. John Travolta and Debra Winger show two very credible performances such as Bud and Sissy Davis. This film really opens the country music scene and introduced America to the mechanical bull. If you love a good romance movie then you will love this movie.
