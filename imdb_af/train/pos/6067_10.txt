Although I tend to agree with the other comments made by people who have seen this movie, I am ashamed to say I prefer it. Not so much a heap of 80's porridge can be found outside a Wham! video, so it's definitely worth watching (Â£ 0.79 per night in my local store!). Look out for the badly-obvious seams and sack on the monster's costume, the fact that the "hero" looks much like Keith Chegwin and so classic lines like this: Evil Wizard-Type Block: "Finally Meet our Kor ... "Cor:" Vibration, isn't it? "Amazing !! I also like the fact that although the video box looks very exciting with images of a castle surrounded by wild seas and a dangerous hawk-like bird that carries an attractive safety hero (including such "interesting and engaging" suggestions of what is happening in the real movie, none of them actually happen, no, I'm not joking ... actually there is no rage, sea or a fiery bird, it just tries you interested ... classic in my opinion, this movie gets 10 for pure entertainment!
