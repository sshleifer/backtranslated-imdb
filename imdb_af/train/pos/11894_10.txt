A truly adorable heroine who in turn is astonished and horrified by giblets, wrestling with mattresses, running in closed doors ... just a few moments in my memory of "The Naked Truth" sparkle. I loved what I got from this show: enjoyable plots and some good supporting characters provided the setting for the diamond of the show - Tea Leoni as 'Nora Wilde'; cute, clownish and wonderfully unhappy - How refreshing to see an actress who can clown - it's no wonder Hollyood doesn't look like throwing her. But where-oh-WHERE are the DVD releases? The amount (bleep) they release is incredible to me that this jeweler remains buried. (Someone improves me if I'm wrong.)
