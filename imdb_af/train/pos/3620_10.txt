I just saw this movie tonight, opening night. It was wonderful !! I'm a big fan of sports movies, and it was right there as one of my favorites. Dennis Quaid was wonderful. (Oh yes, Mr. Quaid, if you read it, my sister lives in Austin, where you live ... and she once had to buy you a drink ... well ... she kinda got you up ... but she didn't mean !: C) [Not that anyone is going to believe it ...]) EVERYONE, that's a good movie. Everyone who likes a good sports movie should go out and see it! : C)
