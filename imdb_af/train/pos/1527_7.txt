Savaged when it came out, this movie looks attractive and sounds good. A festival of intelligent thoughtful acting, of Gielgud, Kenneth Haigh, Harry Andrews and especially Anton Walbrook, and a central display of the beautiful and incredibly young Jean Seberg. Preminger doesn't jump around and show. She takes long, slow, encourages you to listen and reflect. Graham Greene's script condense Shaw without presenting complexity. The piece has the look of a TV movie, and is definitely studio-bound, but no worse for it. Too much contemporary movies about 'historical' themes cannot resist. What would Mel Gibson make of the Maid? Very sudden shots of her on the rack, probably, then break it on the BBQ while the flames take hold. Preminger does nothing about this. The fire is mainly shown by a guilty reaction. There are some poor performances, but not enough to cause serious damage. I caught this movie on TV and didn't want to watch, but I was grabbed. In our era of religious fundamentalism and sacrifice, Joan's story has unexpected resonance.
