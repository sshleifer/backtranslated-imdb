Never heard of this movie, it saw on DVD. Great movie, a perfect example of a movie every player has taken to make it work. No dominant typical Hollywood movie with the same old overhead actors. No current act list actor may have made a performance in this movie. The revival of my own post has Vietnam war military experiences. It concentrated on the people who were sent to fight. As depicted by the characters who had fears and emotions, even though some volunteers were on duty. They were also regular people, some just didn't cut off for military life, I remember a few in my experience - to put it mildly, couldn't live up to military life either - but I will never forget them in touch . I highly recommend it and then think of those who serve the present day in Afghanistan. Basic training is a journey, noting that drill sergeants are not tomorrow people. Maybe they should have sensitive training. HA! HA! HA!
