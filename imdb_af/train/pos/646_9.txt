A has a female friend who is currently drawn to a long-term girlfriend's relationship with a SOB. Of course, the SOB is very beautiful, charming, etc. And my friend is a very intelligent woman. Seeing Jean Pierre Leaud's character at work is just like watching what happens in real life when guys destroy the lives of our female friends. It's tragic, and you know she's going to hurt a lot, but there's nothing you can do. Leaud is brilliant. Completely empty. He empties the faces and tells the stories he thinks the reaction he wants will get. <br /> <br /> The scene lasts two hours when Leaud and Lebrun love, and the next morning he sits a record and, very nice and charming, sings together to entertain her, is brilliant. The "What the hell am I doing here with this idiot" expression flashing back and forth over her face will be in my memory long ago. <br /> <br /> It's a long movie, but watch it all at once, preferably in a theater. Take a moment to go in, but then the time just disappears.
