It's a movie that can show you. I especially liked how it ended. I didn't see the end, but when Laws wasn't blown away for the first time, he suspects he'll be back. <br /> <br /> The story is tempting and could have been more psychological, but I understand the story needed to capture the viewer and the action was needed. <br /> <br /> Difficult to Michael Jr. to believe, may seem as unconscious as his younger brother and mother blew away. But I can appreciate that the acting couldn't really take our attention there, as it had a bigger story to tell. Some complained about Hanks as a gunman. I believe this is not justified. If his character was harder, he would not have taken care of his son pulling a trigger. <br /> <br /> Eight stars for this one. Although released in 2002, I only saw it on DVD for the first time.
