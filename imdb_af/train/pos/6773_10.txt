I have this movie on T.V. Captured last night and you know Danny Masterson was a very good actor in the movie, and it's great to see him in something other than the 70's. The film was not graded, but in my opinion I would rate it only because of the nudity and abundance of adult content. But all I loved, I thought Dirt's Wisecracks was pretty funny. She is basically just about a guy who has no job, girlfriend or money and eventually gets a job as a private investigator (more of a messenger really.) He gets an estimate for the murder of a rock star and the rock terrain a girlfriend is one of those people who really need to help him. I give it .... *** 3 stars.
