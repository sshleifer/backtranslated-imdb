** Possible spoilers ** <br /> <br /> I like this movie and have no problem keeping up. It reminds me of 20, except it's even better. As Veronica says, two chicks are at once. This brings the clumsiness in me, the accidental conversation, these two real chicks, rather than hookers, make us every step of the way. I also get in the conversations. Even if they are completely b. Sometimes, so what? Every chick, just about everything I've ever talked about and high on herself, is usually full of the same, unreasonable, fake, gratuitous, self-centered b. philosophy. It's just a bunch of nonsense, and as wise as the other b. philosophy chicks are often found in: astrological maps. The only deal with this movie is the man is almost as feminine as the women, he is in the same b. and moods. The brunette is actually the most masculine person there. <br /> <br /> I think it's funny that the brunette is turned on so clearly by Veronica. She would like to pull the blonde away from Alexander, but Veronica plays her completely. She is brilliant. She gets the brunette and thinks there is something between them, and then she steals the boy-child / man, which is only suitable because it appears from the same age group. The brunette knows she is at the end when she drops her face in her palms while Marlene Deitrich sings in the background that there are a million couples tonight in Paris, but I only have this chorus. /> <br /> But in the end do they marry Alex and Veronica? Mmmm? I can only imagine a super-tumultuous relationship ending in a pre-marriage. They are too selfish to be something to each other than to walk stones. <br /> <br /> I like the movie though. It entertained me, it had a nice look, and it's sexy.
