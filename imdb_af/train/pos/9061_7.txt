I really like the movie. I remember reading it a few times as a child and I was glad to see a movie about the book. <br /> <br /> I was a boy and a girl, aged 11 and 8, and had to speak the girl to see the movie. But fortunately, in the end, she was glad she saw it and even said she wanted to buy it on DVD as soon as it came out. <br /> <br /> There were a few great moments and the movie was not so "gross", as I expected it to be ... it got on the gross o-meter high. <br /> <br /> The only thing I can't figure out is why they had the "dilly" rule that Woody did with reference to his private part. It was the only shock moment for me (and you could hear the adults in the audience hearing at that moment in the movie) ... I have no idea why it was in the movie; It didn't add anything to the real movie, except that shock / throttle ... other than that, a pretty good movie. Nice to see the "Pepsi" girl who grew up.
