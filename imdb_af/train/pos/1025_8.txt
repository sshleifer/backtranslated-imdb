My review refers to the first 4 Seasons of Stargate SG-1 which is wonderfully fresh, creative and addictive. When the throw went through the gate, you never knew what was lying on the other side! The series started with season 5, and the concept had a different focus. Still good, but different. <br /> <br /> The series follows the adventures of a team of people (and one stranger) who frequent in the "Stargate". The background of the series is based on the characters and events of the movie "Stargate" in which the device is discovered during an archaeological dig in Egypt. <br /> <br /> The episodes are light (innocent and easy to watch) and very creative. Many of the inventive stories could easily be made into large sci-fi movies of their own. What happened next was always unpredictable. <br /> <br /> The characters on which the show is based are also well defined and brilliantly executed. Their tone is serious, but the dialogue has blossomed with incredible humor and humor. They are simply fun to watch. <br /> <br /> Start somewhere around Season 5, and start developing a persistent story based on the fight of a single enemy (the Goa'uld, then the Ori). The plots become more complex (much more political / strategic oriented) and interdependent. The characters were as big as ever, but the show was different. <br /> <br /> One thing to mention is to watch the episodes that commemorate the 100th and 200 episodes. They simply can't miss it. They showcased the creative and wild humorous genius that carried the series through 10 seasons. <br /> <br /> If you're a sci-fi fan, watch a few episodes of the first 4 seasons and you'll probably be hooked. If you develop story lines between two opposing sides, you have 10 seasons of show to look forward to.
