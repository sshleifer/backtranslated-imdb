Henry Fonda brilliantly captures what we have long believed Abraham Lincoln was like. It's a fool. Through Fonda's performance we are led to believe (on the surface) that Abraham Lincoln was a potting pot. But through his confrontation with the lynch mob and especially during the court proceedings, you can see that among the outposts is a brilliant man who has a very good command of what is going on him and how to influence the people around him. <br /> <br /> In this film, Henry Fonda shows that he has a very good understanding of how to offer humor. This is an aspect of him that has been lost over the years. When he tells stories and jokes, he has the timing perfectly. There is a succession in the hearing that laughed me very hard. He shows this gift again in The Lady Eve in 1940. <br /> <br /> The end by John Ford is absolutely brilliant with Henry Fonda at the top of a hill and in the distance is a tremendous storm symbolic of the Civil War. He's going forward in history. The movie is fiction, but the insight into Lincoln is great. Definitely worth seeing again.
