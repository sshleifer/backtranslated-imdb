It's a modest, character-driven comedy filmed on a low budget in Brazil. The starting point is known, the same as in the Danny Kaye movie of the 1950s ** On the Double **: someone who makes an impression of a famous person as a joke is then draped to the right person. personified. <br /> <br /> The contrast between the two leads is highly effective. Raul Julia as the German-Paradoxic secret policeman, is tall, cool, threatening and Latin. He plays a deliberate, obvious blonde dye. Richard Dreyfus, animated, short, New York Jewish, is funny and sympathetic. There are many references and inside jokes about show business. <br /> <br /> The institution is clearly modeled on Paraguay. Paraguay was regulated by genl in the early fifties until the late eighties. Alfredo Stroessner, an unprecedented military dictator whose father emigrated from Germany. But writer / director Mazurszky reveals his ignorance of local conditions when he paints Parador / Paraguay as a typical Latin American tyranny, with great differences in wealth and active guerrilla rebellion. Further in this bait, Mazursky throws comic Jonathan Winters as an American retirees who are in fact C.I.A. station head in Parador and a figure so powerful he can give the president of the country to throw out a fake. <br /> <br /> In fact, the US has little influence in Paraguay, which is largely without the social and racial tensions seen elsewhere in the region. This is due to the fact that in the 19th and 20th centuries the country fought long and expensive wars against much larger neighbors. The male population has been almost extinct at times, but the emerging society was patriotic, racially homogeneous and strongly united. <br /> <br /> On another level there is a bow for feminism in the form of the Madonna character. Madonna was played by Brazilian actress Sonia Braga. She is a former nightclub dancer, who is the exact pleasure girl at the end of the film. It is seen on television as president himself - now politically and cosmetically correct, no makeup, hair. The one time such an event actually took place in Latin America, the administration of Argentina's Isabel Peron ( not the beloved Evita, who never kept office). two years after the death of her husband, legendary ** supremo ** Juan Peron.
