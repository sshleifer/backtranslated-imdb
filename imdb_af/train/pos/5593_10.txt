This movie can be a silent film; It certainly has the feel of one. I was very happy to see this rare version of this movie. Erasing is a 'symphony of love' and spans all language versions. French, which is the ultimate romantic language, looks pretty suitable for this very sensual and lyrical version. A young Hedy Lamarr raises the screen, in this movie that is, in a way, almost like a sex fantasy; but definitely far from pornography. Technical features may have been a little rough; but it does not detract from the magical game that this movie emits. Many lovers of early theater will absolutely adore this movie.
