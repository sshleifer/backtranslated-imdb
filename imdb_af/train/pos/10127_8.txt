It was the beginning of everything! Granted, it's not Friends at its best, but it was the show's pilot, let's not forget and not a bad one. We were introduced to the gang and Central Perk, where our story begins. Even from this first episode, we get a sign of the Ross-Rachel relationship that will come over the next ten years, when Ross says, "I just want to get married again" and Rachel storms with a wedding dress ... probably not deliberately as the writers for a Monica-Joey relationship went on at the time, but beware when they look back. Something else. In this episode, Rachel is introduced to Chandler as if the two had never met before, but in later episodes, the so-called "flashbacks" were contradicted because the two came together three times. However, the point is it's a good start for a good performance. This episode may not be the usual friends as we are used to them, with the rather inexperienced role, but in the next few episodes we see why the show has become what it was! Keep watching, the first season is a blast!
