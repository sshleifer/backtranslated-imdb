Today, if someone calls the name Victor McLaglen, the reaction is likely to be "Who?" Be. or maybe "Why?" Well, whether or not, Victor McLaglen has won the Oscar Best Actor Award in this film. It's about a poor, desperate man who is willing to sell his best friend to the United States. It's an interesting movie that shows how low even the most significant shnooks are for just a few bucks. The film takes place in British Ireland and while all the other characters are either directly or indirectly fighting for Ireland's political independence, McLaglen's character worried about getting money and getting drunk. The film makes one wonder if political activism is worth it, because while the activist struggles to make a point, many don't just care about it, they don't even know what the fuss is about. The moral of this movie is: look out for the friend, he may sell you out for a dime.
