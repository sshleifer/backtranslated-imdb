This show was great, it wasn't just for kids I initially thought it was for the whole family. <br /> <br /> The first season was mostly about the caring father, two daughters and son, unfortunately he died in season 2, I could believe it when I heard it. <br /> <br /> I'm dressed, they continued with the show, and it will really happen in life and I have to call the farewell section. It was made so good, it must be so hard for them to film it, you can say they are real tears in their eyes. I am a 24-year-old man and this episode has made me cry when I know how they feel when my father died when I was 13, just like Roy. <br /> <br /> Season 2 and Season 3 had a great comedy in which season 3 also had some of my favorites so freaky Friday Secrets. <br /> <br /> I still think the show was strong enough to continue, I was disappointed that it ended, it was one of the best no's the best family comedy show since Home Improvement and it could Have been friends. <br /> <br /> It should never end, but still watch the reps every day.
