I have been a fan of Edward Burtynsky's work for years and it was so nice to see the man at work, thanks to Jennifer Baichwal's documentary. The serious beauty of the shipyard in Bangladesh, the rocky quarry in Vermont, the enormous composition in China, the beloved old neighborhood in Shanghai just waiting to be broken down. These landscapes are so well captured by the photographer and the film maker. <br /> <br /> Sometimes I thought of old TV documentaries about abandoned coal mines and plastic factories; the kind of things I grew up to look at. Burtynsky's work has great value in pointing out how industrial activity only shifted to Asia, it didn't stop. The strangest scene for me was the computer leaf yard somewhere in China - the waste had a threatening air over it, while the workers were very jovial.
