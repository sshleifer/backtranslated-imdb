Holes, the novel, was forced on me in an educational course. I didn't think I wanted a children's book; The other few books I had to read to the class were very bad. But to my surprise I absolutely loved Holes. It's really one of the most perfectly written novels I've ever read. I think it has the rare quality it makes into pre-teens, teens and adults. Everyone who reads it, I think will be a better person. While I can't say it to the movie, I'm happy to say that they are mostly right. I don't think viewers of the movie will go away as enriched, but they will definitely be entertained without the effect of being stupid when they sit down. This is an intelligent story, and it is very well told. I think it's a bit too fast. The novel takes more time to develop the characters. And the flashbacks come in so fast that they don't have too much time to register. The interracial romance of the past feels more clich√© and trite than in the novel. And the end, which connects all the loose wires, looks very ridiculous. This is exactly the same in the novel, but there is a sense of absurdity that is not quite in the movie. It works much better. I also don't like the many pop songs. I wish Disney didn't need it to sell soundtracks. The film is generally excellent, from the young ones to the old benefits. Jon Voight is especially big. Not quite sure why we need Catwoman and the Fonze. 9/10.
