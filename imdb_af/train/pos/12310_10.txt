Just read the original story written by Pu in the 18th century. Strikingly, the movie portrays the original spirit very well, although the plot has changed tremendously. The film language, the rhythm, the special effect all come from Hollywood, but there is still a Chinese core. It is wonderful how Hark Tsui managed to combine them. The result is pure beauty.
