Oddly enough, all previous comments first described and left the details. I feel it necessary to confirm that this is a family work, as Marina Vlady was also Robert Hossein's wife, and - excellent jazz music written by Andr√©'s director's father. Under these circumstances, no wonder it was a very good thriller, when it was issued and immediately identified with the music. The tension was flawless, and maintained until the end of the week. Robert Hossein, then one of the best European players, also assigned him a top screen and staging director. He still has great stage shows, with a preference for religious subjects.
