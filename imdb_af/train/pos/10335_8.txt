The only reason I give this movie an 8 out of 10 is because there are few movies that I think are perfect. This little B picture is a naughty story, well told. I have always been intrigued by Alexander Knox, but I have seen very little movies. Here he plays Wilhelm Grimm, a sad little man who becomes a monster. He betrays everything and everyone without a gram of remorse. The show is one of the most cold performances I've ever seen. Since World War II, actors who played Nazis or other evil types in films have occasionally nominated Oscars. I suggest that since the academy was made during the war, the Academy felt honored to be a show, as it would have been to honor the evil one. But Knox is in that kind of performance - a man who is so bitter and consumed by guilt that he thinks nothing about causing others to suffer. I still can't get over it. <br /> <br /> Marsha Hunt, who usually plays the filbert gibbet or social butterfly, is thrown in at type, probably the best thing I've ever seen her. Perhaps not worthy of Oscar, but the best of her career. Nothing against her; I enjoyed her in the "light" roles she often played. But here she proves to be the task of heavier drama. <br /> <br /> If you like human drama stories, or stories about the fate of those who have suffered in the hands of the Nazis, I recommend this good bit of film.
