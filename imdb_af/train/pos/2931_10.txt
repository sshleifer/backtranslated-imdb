Eddie Murphy Delirious is undoubtedly the funniest thing I've ever seen in my life. When I first saw it about 2 years ago, I was stuck weeks later. To date I have seen it another 17 times, and I still laugh at my ass every time. For those who don't know Eddie Murphy, he was a brilliant comedian before being a Hollywood superstar. There is no dull place in this piece of genius, as opposed to Eddie Murphy Raw, released in 1987 and staying flat in the middle. If you're not the kind of person who can't swing, I wouldn't recommend seeing it, because you'll probably hear the curse of some form every 5-10 seconds. I gave it a 10 out of 10 because it shows the best comic genius of them all at its best.
