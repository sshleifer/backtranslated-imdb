How to lose and alienate friends People are honestly one of the best comedies I've seen this year with Pineapple Express and Step Brothers. It's not one of the "brutal" comedies that relies heavily on fiery jokes and toilet humor, but moves at a good pace and you'll easily be linked to the unfolding story. Simon Pegg nails it in the coffin with his hilarious portrayal of a fish-out-of-water character and quickly detaches him from the tripod he used to be in England (the other two being Nick Frost and Edgar Wright). Getting yourself in the top of the Hollywood food chain is a difficult thing to do as we can clearly see with Pegg. His first jab was the lead role of David Schwimmer's comedy Run Fatboy Run, but it received lukewarm reviews from critics and audiences. His second test was this movie, had fairly positive reviews from the majority, but was a flop in the box office. I still haven't lost faith in him and I'll still be there when he wants to take that third shot for glory. <br /> <br /> Other characters were well-cast from Jeff Bridges to Danny Huston and Gillian Anderson. Surprisingly, in my opinion, Kirsten Dunst performed well in this movie as the love corner for Pegg's character. However, the spark I saw in Maintenance with the Vampire is still lost. She must find it quickly, or she can have the consequences of being lost in the country of "rom-coms" forever.
