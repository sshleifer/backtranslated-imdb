There are too many new styles from the sitcom, but the one that works best is the old-fashioned way with an audience and indoor set. The 70's Show is a good example. When the show came on the air, no one really heard of Kurtwood Smith and Debra Jo Rupp, but the teens played wonderfully by Topher Grace and Ashton Kushton (both leaving the show this year to pursue other interests). I wish Topher would stay around because the show started over his character, Eric, and his close circle of friends. Ashton is already the John Travolta of our time. Remember when John fell in love with Diana Hyland of eight, that's enough, think of Ashton with Demi Moore. The film of actors has never been known to us, because it is a good thing because a famous member can spoil it. I miss Mo Gaffney who played Don's friend Joanne. I miss Lisa Robin Kelly as the original Laurie, the replacement couldn't agree with her and I'm sorry about it. I like casting Tommy Chong as the wasted, but beloved dad figure after Steven Hyde. I loved watching Tanya Roberts next to Charlie's Angels. I loved Brooke Shields playing Jackie's mom. She really showed her acting talent before going to Broadway. This show was a delight with many surprises. I hope this show will last longer, though 2 of their members are out of the way, but I hope they don't stay too far away. I wish the show's creators, Bonnie and Terry Turner, who also created my other favorite program, Third Rock from The Sun, were more successful on Fox than they were on NBC sabotaging their performance. The Turners are not dummies and I hope they create more apps like this in the future.
