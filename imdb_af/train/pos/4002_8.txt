At the start of the film, we look at May and Toots to prepare their trip to London for a visit to their children. One can see Toots is not in the best health, but he goes along. When he suddenly dies, May's world starts out of control. <br /> <br /> The movie directed by Roger Michell, based on a screenplay by Hanif Kureshi, is a study of how this mother figure comes into play. with her new status in life and her awakening in a world she doesn't even know has existed so far. <br /> <br /> May's life as a suburban woman was probably boring. It was clear that her sexual life was almost nothing. We know she had a short extra-marital relationship, and nothing at all. When she loses her husband, she can't go back home, so she stays behind her grandson at her daughter's house. It is in this area that May starts with a desire for young and brave Darren, her daughter's occasional lover. <br /> <br /> In May, Darren is passionate about what she has never known. May respond by changing herself before our eyes. Perhaps, at the beginning of the film, it is dull, suddenly becomes attractive, becomes an interesting and attractive woman. She ends up with the heads over with this young man who drops her with a passion she has never felt before. <br /> <br /> Having suffered a few cases that looked like this story, it didn't surprise me to look at May's response. Her own chance of a normal relationship with Bruce, a widower, ends frustratingly for May, realizing how well her sex is with Darren. The younger man, who we see, is just in this case to satisfy himself and the possibility of expressing money from May. Lastly, daughter, Helen, discovered what Mama had done behind her back when she discovered the erotic paintings her mother made. <br /> <br /> The movie is a triumph for the director. In Anne Reid, Mr. Michell found an extraordinary actress who brings so much to May's role. Also wonderful is Daniel Craig. He knows how Darren will respond to the situation. Anna Wilson Jones as Helen is also essential for the story, as she is the one who must confront the mother about what goes on behind her back. Oliver Ford Davies plays a small role as Bruce the older man in Helen's class and is reasonably effective. <br /> <br /> The movie is rewarding for those who will see it with an open mind. <br /> <br />
