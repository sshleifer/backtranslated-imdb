After seeing that you had Mail and felt disappointed, I decided to see the original movie inspired by this one, The Shop Around the Corner. I was amazed at this movie. This is a real gem and from this moment one of my favorite movies of all time. The acting is so perfect, the story is so beautiful, if I haven't seen it, I urge you to see it today. I'm not against re-making and sometimes I like the new version more than the original, but this time recognizing that you have Mail is a poor adaptation of these classic. Don't miss it, go to your video store and rent The Shop Around the Corner today!
