I had the chance to see a movie of this movie recently. I believe it will be a little time for Mother's Day in the theaters in Canada. If it's in a theater near you ... GO! It's not a funny, good movie - it's more of a line of feeling and thinking. <br /> <br /> The director does an excellent job of character development - which leaves you in the heart, hurts and hurts at Hagar a little bit. Initially, her attitudes and behavior do not make much sense. As her story unfolds, she becomes someone you can understand. As in life ... understanding brings empathy. I found her at the end of the movie, especially when she opened her heart to the young man in the loft at the lake. <br /> <br /> Hagar's relationship with her two sons is painful - and reflects many of our own experiences in this world. Her youngest son, John, who is full of life and adventure, takes the viewer in front of the chair - and in the kind of raw emotion that is so authentic and scarce. <br /> <br /> It's fun to see Ellen Page acting in this movie. She is so much different from the young woman she plays in Juno. It gives me an even greater appreciation for her acting ability. If you love her in Juno, you'll love her in The Stone Angel. <br /> <br /> Of course there is Ellen Burnstyn as Hagar. There is probably no way to express the power of acting as strongly as the ability of the actor to forget about any other character they have ever played. Never in the course of this movie have I ever thought of Ellen Burnstyn - I always thought of Hagar. She rushed me into her character - hook, line and slow down. <br /> <br /> Kari Skogland's film-loading capability is impressive, this well-known book by one of Canada's most cherished writers. His brilliance brings the stoney and angelic parts of this complex woman, Hagar - the stone angel, to the screen.
