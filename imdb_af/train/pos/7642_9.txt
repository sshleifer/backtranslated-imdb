Not really a big box, but I was pleasantly surprised with this movie. James "I've done a few things to Farrah Fawcett" Orr <br /> co-authored and directed this movie about an ordinary, average guy named Larry Burrows, who thinks his life would have been < br /> <br /> Unbelievably different from having hit a homerun at a key ball game when he was 15. But thanks to the mysterious and magical bartender <br /> <br />, Mike, Larry gets his wish, but soon realizes that his new life <br /> <br /> is not exactly what he hoped. <br /> <br /> I have to say, this movie really impressed me. Critics have <br /> <br /> mixed it up, and I have to say the concept is very interesting and <br /> <br /> well down. Yes, it's a small standard, but pack enough <br /> <br /> funny moments, drama and great acting to make it really good. <br /> <br />. James Belushi (I think) was worthy of Oscar's role. Jon <br /> <br /> Lovitz is perfect, and Linda Hamilton plus Renee Russo shines in <br /> <br /> their roles. Michael Caine is perfect as a bartender. It's <br /> <br /> just a great movie with a good lesson. If you've never seen, <br /> <br /> highly recommend you
