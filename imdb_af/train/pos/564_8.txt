Colored western. <br /> <br /> Wyoming cowboy James Stewart sparkles up to the Yukon Territory to dig for gold, sell his scaffolding, and try to get a date with a beautiful saloon owner Rut Roman as he the tail can shake off Crooked Sheriff John McIntire who wants Stewart's cattle. Beautiful cinematography in a joint effort by William Fritzsche and Bill Daniels. Good Technicolor adventure from Universal-International, led by Anthony Mann. <br /> <br /> Also with Corinne Calvet, Connie Gilchrist and Walter Brennan as Stewart's sidekick.
