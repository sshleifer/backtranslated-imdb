Scott Henderson, the engineer who uses Carol Richman as his assistant, makes a point to call her "Kansas" when he speaks to her. This shows us that Carol, who is played effectively by Ella Raines, is supposed to be a babe in the woods, as far as the Manhattan of the 40's. Just a woman, from outside the town, would follow the shady barman to a lonely subway subway. Even then, a na√Øve girl can do such an adventure. <br /> <br /> Robert Siodmak made this film noir very well. He shows a flair for infusing the story with lots of raw sex that was surprising for those days. How else can we justify the way the drummer in the orchestra of the musical, where Scott takes the mysterious woman with an unusual hat, passes such a thought on a lady on a date? The drummer with high tension by Elisha Cook Jr. played, his desires do not hide for any of the ladies in the front row of the hit music where he plays. It was a true express invitation, first to the "phantom woman" of the story, Fay Helm; Afterwards, Cliff the drummer, very openly introduces him to Ella Raines who is hidden in the theater as the mysterious lady who originally took her boss. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that will hook any viewer from the beginning. There are things that are not explained in that, but it keeps one's interest throughout. The killer is not disclosed until the end. <br /> <br /> Ella Raines with her expressive eyes was an understated actress. She holds her own against many more experienced actors. Franchot Tone, a New York stage actor, who works in Hollywood, never found the fame he earned in this medium. He is effective as the accused man's best friend. On the other hand, Alan Curtis comes across as a man who, when framed, accepts his fate and is only saved by the determination of the woman who loved him secretly. Inspector Burgess, Thomas Gomez, is an asset to the film as a detective who doubted the police had caught the man who committed the crime. <br /> <br /> This movie won't disappoint.
