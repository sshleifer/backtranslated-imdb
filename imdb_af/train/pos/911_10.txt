VIVAH is, in my opinion, the best movie of 2006, coming from a director who was successful during his career. I'm not too keen on romantic movies, because I see them as "old wine in a new bottle" and so predictable. But I watched this movie three times ... and believe me this is a fantastic movie. <br /> <br /> VIVAH returns to the traditional route and displays simple characters in a meaningful and realistic story of the journey between engagement and marriage. The movie is entertaining in all ways, as it can be reflected on what we (or would) do when it comes to marriage. In that sense, Sooraj R. Barjatya did his homework well and depicted a very realistic story in a well-crafted highly entertaining film. <br /> <br /> Several rows in this movie take your interest immediately: <br /> <br /> * When Shahid Kapoor sees the bride (Amrita Rao) - the way he tries to look her without pretending obvious to him and her family. The song 'Do Anjaane Ajnabi' goes well with the mood of this scene. <br /> <br /> * The first conversation between Shahid and Amrita, when he sees her - that is, a shy Shahid who doesn't know exactly what to talk about. but to get a decent conversation. Amrita's naive nature, limited eye contact, shy features and gentle answer to Shahid's questions. <br /> <br /> * The emotional collapse of Amrita and her uncle (Alok Nath) when feeding him at Shahid's party in the shape of another's daughter-in-law rather than her uncle's beloved cousin. <br /> <br /> Clearly, the film at Amrita Rao is entirely applicable. The actress portrays Poonam's role with such a belief that you can't imagine anyone else replacing her. She looks beautiful throughout the movie, and perfectly portrays an innocent and shy traditional girl. <br /> <br /> Shahid Kapoor also plays brilliantly. He is making a promising performance and shows that he is no less than Salman Khan when it comes to a Sooraj R. Barjatya movie. In fact, Shahid and Amrita make a cute pair of scissors, without a doubt. Other characters - Alok Nath (Excellent), Anupam Kher (Brilliant), Mohan Joshi (Very Good). On the whole, VIVAH who promised it delivers a well-made and realistic story of two families. The movie features top-notch performances, great story and great music to fit the movie, as well as directing the fantastic Sooraj R. Barjatya. This is a must see!
