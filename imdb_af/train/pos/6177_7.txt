The adaptation of Will Eisner's SPIRIT to the TV screen follows many other offers developed from cartoon pages or comics. (Remember, the two are not exactly the same medium). It is indeed ironic that it is the only adaptation (of the time of this writing) of Eisner's clever alec, wise, creaking, super-hero-in-the-cheek. <br /> <br /> The story says Republic Pictures are interested in making a movie version and were negotiating with the copyright owner in the middle of the 40's, but they could never close the deal. The left-hand display has become one of the best of the Republic, THE MASKED MARVEL. Perhaps it was just as good, because the studio had a love of pruning with material adapted from cartoons, pulp, radio and comic books. <br /> <br /> What made this 1987 movie movie, It is pretty clear that it was a failed pilot for a proposed television series. While an old, long-time comic reader, like me, may be a bit difficult in criticizing an adaptation, a viewer unfamiliar with the character can give any new observations without any preconceived notions that this screen release should looks like. <br /> <br /> Well, as you unfold and watch the story, with the characters in the middle of a crime wave, the Little One (my wife, Ryan) nailed it with one statement. "It can't be remembered if it's serious or not!" It describes well both the Spirit and his creator, Mr. Will Eisner, the true creative genius in the comics. <br /> <br /> The film is a sincere effort to put Eisner's world on the screen. The throwing of Denny Colt / Spirit, Commissioner Dolan and Ellen was done very well. Although it was in a contemporary environment, it was still in the tradition of "good old days" as far as the costume goes, you know when men and women wore hats! This brings this one final (and winding) point, and it is that the director and the production made a conscious effort and managed to give the characters a Will Eisner look for facial expressions and body language. We tell Kudos to them for their efforts. <br /> <br /> It's just bad that no ranges have followed! Oh, good in today's movie world, come up with comical adjustments as a hot item. Perhaps a big big producer and director for the big screen can make a 1st class SPIRIT production. We can only hope. <br /> <br /> UPDATE: Dateline, Chicago, Illinois. 06/04/2008. At the moment, everyone who goes to the movies at the Shopping Center Multiplexes is seeing the poster of THE NEW SPIRIT movie, subtitling MY CITY SCREAMS. released on Christmas Day 2008. Well, we'll just see what we're talking about. Just keep your fingers crossed! TO BE CONTINUED ............ <br /> UPDATE II: A few days ago we saw the new movie, author director Frank Miller's THE SPIRIT version . Well, we had our wish; but is this a good thing or another case of "Be careful what you ask for you can get it?" Please read our heading elsewhere in IMDb.com. THANX!
