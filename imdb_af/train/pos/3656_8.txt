If you have trouble lifting unbelief, it is not for you. Consider: A woman who is already in the middle of the middle finds a newborn baby in a cabbage spot and raises it as her own. Think about it; she does not try to find the mother, who may be a confused teenager who needs medical treatment, and none of the Italian equivalent of Social Services seems to try to put the baby in 'care'. Know this is a fantasy. Before you know it, young Toto is ten or so and his adoptive mother dies to leave him to the orphanage from which he is a HAPPY man who loves everyone. In nothing flat he just gave his suitcase to the man who stole him from him, but organized the local homeless into bona fide Shantytown residents. He leads them into a struggle against capitalism in the form of the businessman who buys the land on which Shantytown stands when oil is discovered there. It would appear to him a few swallows without the subsequent 'miracles' that began with Toto's dead mother (the old lady who had rather raised him than his biological one) and gave him a dove that doubled as a magic wand so he modest wishes and a finale in which the hobos fly away to a better place that is thought to be somewhere over the rainbow. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the movie here at Charm is easy to tell. On balance a small masterpiece.
