This place was in England in 1940. Three orphans (Carrie, Charles and Paul) are sent to live with Miss Price (Angela Lansbury). She does not want them, but takes them into consideration. She seems to be studying to be a witch through a correspondence course with the College of Witchcraft. (OK - I realize it's a family movie but - College of Witchcraft ??? Come on !!) Before she can finish the course although the college is closed because of the war (???) and she's looking for the head Professor Browne (David Tomlinson). And her and the kids travel on a bed with the help of a magical bedknob. <br /> <br /> I only saw it when I was 9 and remember it vaguely. It certainly does not matter as an adult! The story is stupid (even for a fantasy), the kids are terrible actors and one of them (Charles) is incredibly stupid. Roddy McDowall is also billed third and only appears in two short scenes! There is also a trip to the island of Naboombu run by animated animals. I thought it might be fun, but the animation is poor (for Disney) and it has a very violent and too long soccer match between the animals. There are a few savings here: Lansbury and Tomlinson are just wonderful; the songs (while forgotten) are pleasant; The long dance series on Portobello Road is very colorful and full of energy and the Oscar winning special effects are still impressive at the end. But the bad story line, poor animation and unlikely kids draw this one right. I heard the extended version is even worse! I can only give it a 7.
