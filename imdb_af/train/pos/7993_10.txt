There are many reasons to watch this movie: to see the reality of Latin America's abduction of abductions, police corruption on a continental level, under so many realities that we live Latin. <br /> <br /> The performance of Denzel Wahington was brilliant, this guy remains an excellent actor and continues to be so. Dakota Fanning, just ten years old, has become an excellent actress and I wish her luck. The rest of the movie was amazing, I got it in my collection. <br /> <br /> I hope it happens to Hollywood manufacturers to make a movie entirely in Venezuela, where they show our reality better in terms of crime, drug traffic or political problems. They are some of the movies they play in Venezuela (for example: Aracnophobia, Jungle 2 Jungle, Dragonfly), they have to make more, as well as what they make in Mexico. <br /> <br /> The song "Una Mirada" I hope it leaves in the soundtrack, it is excellent. My voice is 10/10
