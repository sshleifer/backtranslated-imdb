This movie is an hour or so of good entertainment and has some really funny moments. I loved the character of Matt, and also Tiny. They were the most engaging and funny characters, and certainly the most interesting. Matt is very good (as he is not a good cousin), and the policewoman and blonde biker wife offer some welcome eye candy. I must say I see striking similarities between Matt and another Aussie actor, Eric Bana. My personal favorite part was the brothel scene, loved it. Overall, I like the movie and it will get about an 8 rating. However, the penalty was disappointing. It was a silk foot curl, rather than the appropriate lace explosions. <br /> <br /> Of course I'm joking. :)
