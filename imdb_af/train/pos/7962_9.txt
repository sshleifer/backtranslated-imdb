Very few so-called "remakes" can be as good as the original. This one crosses the border with flying colors. Just a remake, I don't think so! I saw it at the age of nine and was totally enchanted and surprised by the movie. <br /> <br /> The film definitely invites comparisons with its 1963 counterpart. The previous film is also a pleasant and entertaining movie, but it is likely to feel more like a nature documentary than a movie. This update is more epic and movie. Yet I thoroughly recommend both films. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely a must-see for an animal animal. We have the wise old Golden Retriever, Shadow; the sharp, sarcastic Himalayan cat, Sassy; and the young, love-American Bulldog, Chance. The animals are brilliantly pronounced by Don Ameche, Sally Field and Michael J. Fox respectively. <br /> <br /> There is virtually nothing offensive in the movie. There is a bit of scatological humor, but nothing extreme. No harsh violence, except a few tense scenes that have a bulging waterfall, a fierce porcupine and a dark railroad ash. <br /> <br /> Nice, scary, moving, and most importantly, it surprised me to see that this movie won no awards, not one. Nevertheless, I have to say it is just as good as some of the best photo nominees these days.
