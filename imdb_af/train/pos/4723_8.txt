Actually enjoy this little movie. It's a moving movie about battle, sacrifice and especially the ties of friendship between different people (the child actor playing Miki is especially good). There are so many large-scale impersonal films that took place in the second half of the year. This convincingly telling little story is a true breach of the norm, and its original. I will also add that this movie is far from boring, very far !! Of course the horses are wonderful and the scenery breathtaking. For anyone who really treats their animals as part of the family (I do), you will find this movie especially rewarding. Recommended to movie lovers who are looking for something different.
