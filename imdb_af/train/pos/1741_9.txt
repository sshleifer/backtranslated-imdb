This is a dramatic movie in the whole sense of the word. It tells a tail that we live in Greece as a routine in everyday life without realizing how sad it is. Sure, it has some extremes. But now and then, real life loss surpasses art. It is deeply critical of the goals we pursue and build the whole social structure around them. The film has a deeper understanding of the Greek way of life, stereotypes and social structure. Unlike most Greek movies that have heard a particular hearing food mainstream, this one is not specifically aimed at anyone, but while you see it, you feel that someone is putting the best possible words and pictures to describe your feelings. I'm also not a big fan of traditional music, but I don't want to hear anything other than that during the movie. <br /> <br /> If someone told me to say something to this movie, I would define The following, sometimes the transition between scenes suddenly or somewhat cuts. I think the editing had to cut to suit the 2 hours and a bit for the theaters. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I could write more and more to express my thoughts on this, but I think you should see it and discuss it with a friend. A must see
