To bend it like Beckham, for Americans who know very little about the other soccer (soccer), but for English sports fans, this is similar to "Hit It Like Bonds" or "Dunk It Like Jordan." Any young soccer player dreams of bending a soccer ball to one player and reaching into the net for a goal. Just like star player David Beckham, the young Indian girl, Jess (Parminder Nagra), does the movie Bend It Like Beckham. Jess likes to pick up soccer matches, the kind prohibited by her traditional mother. But while she's playing one day, a passing friend, Jules (Keira Knightley), sees her play and invites her to a trip, all girls' soccer team. After satisfying coach Joe (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers), she made the team, something she knew would not approve of her mother. The movie is not about disobedient parents, but rather a girl doing what she wants to do, even if it is against culture, not just the parents. There is humor throughout the film, especially when Jules' mother thinks she is a lesbian. The movie is a bit of a clich√© moment, because the big soccer game is the same day as Jess's sister's wedding, but it doesn't come from a cheese, but rather tasty and light. The soccer action looks good, so sports fans will enjoy it, and a story about girls growing up in a boy's world, the soccer world will inspire some in the audience. Bend Like Beckham, it's not just about soccer, but rather a girl trying to find herself and at the same time pleasing her parents, something that seems to be pretty difficult.
