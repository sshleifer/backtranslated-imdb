This almost unknown jewel was based on a French farce - which shows, and I mean it as a compliment. <br /> <br /> Caroline (Lee) is being played by a rich Argentine (Roland), who asks her father for her hand in marriage. But Caroline is already married to Anthony (Colman), who just arrived on the plane and immediately started an audience-oriented reminder of the last time Caroline decided she was in love with someone else: a dilettante sculptor (Gardiner). The film plays the story of Anthony's strategy of disconnecting Caroline from her sculptor, and the experience helps him with her Argentine. <br /> <br /> It's perfectly thrown: Ronald Colman is at his most sophisticated and charming Reginald Gardiner is on his most beautiful, Gilbert Roland is at his most exotic, and Anna Lee is just gorgeous. The film is wonderfully directed by Lewis Milestone (who also produced); the whole production feels like a labor of love. There are wonderful touches, such as Colman's frame and the camera, and the exceptional use of a sliding door closet. It is a sin that has not been released on DVD - it is the kind of movie that can somehow attract interest in classic movies.
