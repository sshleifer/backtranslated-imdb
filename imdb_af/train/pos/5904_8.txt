I waited to watch this movie for a long time. This gave promotions a good idea about the content and when I finally saw it, I really found it good. Most of the conventional romantic movies end up with the loved ones who eventually marry or start a happy life after marriage, but there really is a huge adjustment needed for this transition from an old life to a new relationship and life. This is what this movie is about, when a new widow, Fardeen and Esha, marry a regular marriage and start their honeymoon. The acting is really binding, but I think Esha has stayed a bit silent and she could use a few lines for herself. The story was well knit and dialogues were more or less appropriate. The editing and direction was also good, Meghna Gulzar really did a good job here. To summarize, I would say it's a good drama cum romance, a true combination of what Bollywood can offer a clean entertainer.
