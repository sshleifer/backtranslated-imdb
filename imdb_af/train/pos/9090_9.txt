"Hollywood Hotel" is a quick, exuberant, wonderfully entertaining musical comedy by Warners that is unfortunately overlooked. This should be remembered only for providing the official theme song of Tinseltown - "Hooray for Hollywood." The score of Richard Whiting and Johnny Mercer has a number of other gems, but also the beautiful "I'm like a fish from water," and "Silhouetted in the Moonlight." The best musical number is "Let it be a lesson to you", in which Dick Powell and the company describe the misadventures of people behind themselves. A lot that literally ends next to Edgar Kennedy at the number one. The photo celebrates Hollywood glamor and punk it all at once, as it gets many comical miles from pompous and ego-manic actors and dual studio executives. The movie includes a lot of great characters - Allyn Joslyn as a concise press agent, Ted Healy as Dick Powell's managing director, Fritz Feld as an exciting restaurant patron, Glenda Farrell as Mona Marshall's sarcastic Gal Friday, Edgar Kennedy as " A Mabel Todd as Mona's goofy sister, and Hugh Herbert as her even goofier dad. The racist element mentioned in another review is here ten seconds when Herbert appears in a black face during a pseudo- "Gone With the Wind" series. This is in dubious taste, but it should not prevent you from seeing the other treats in this movie, especially the Benny Goodman Quartet (including Teddy Wilson and Lionel Hampton!) What I believe is the only footage available on this amazing jazz combo . The "Dark Eyes" series goes a bit too long and comes too late, but otherwise "Hollywood Hotel" is a gem, worth your time and definitely a movie to be considered for DVD release.
