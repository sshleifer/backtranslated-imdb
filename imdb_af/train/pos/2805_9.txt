Wow, I can't believe I've been waiting so long to watch this movie. I just never came around to watch it. The plot has nothing that interests me. I don't know anything about football (soccer). I'm one of those American fools who has no idea. I have never seen David Beckham before this movie. I chose to ignore the buzz around this movie when released in America. Enough about me. <br /> <br /> Truth be told, it was a mistake to ignore this little piece of movies. What a fun movie. It is full of color and exuberance. I have a goofy smile on my face throughout the movie. Parminder Nagra is so sweet and loving, you can't help rooting for her. No wonder why US television program E.R. got her up. I have a new appreciation for Indian culture. Those people know how to have a good time. The wedding scenes are wonderfully beautiful. <br /> <br /> The only problem I had was deciphering British snake and dialogue by accent. I switched on the English subtitles to make sure I didn't miss anything. (This is not a criticism of the movie!) I am sure audiences worldwide are having trouble understanding the ever-changing snake in American movies. <br /> <br /> It's a perfect date movie. It has a good sportspot like Rocky, and a strong sense of feminism that is empowering for women. I watched it with my wife and cousin, and we all loved it. I highly recommend it.
