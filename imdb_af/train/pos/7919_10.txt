It is undoubtedly meant as a totally crazy joke, "Full Moon High" portrays the 1950s teenager Tony Walker (Adam Arkin) with his father (Ed McMahon) on a trip to Romania. Sure enough, Tony is bitten, and grows fur and fangs when there is a full moon. A particularly interesting aspect of this movie is that it cannot grow old as long as it has swept the werewolf and that it must fulfill a lot - even if it takes twenty years. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, the movie is just funny when it comes. Ed McMahon's character is an over-patriotic right-wing yahoo (he thinks everyone should have listened to Joe McCarthy), Kenneth Mars coach / principal is a tense mop, and then there's more. One of the most obvious players is Demond Wilson - best remembered as Lamont on "Sanford and Son" - as a great bus driver. But probably the funniest scene is changing the presidents; Then Gag summed up with Gerald Ford! Anyway, this is a real surprise. Since Alan Arkin - who plays a psychiatrist - just won an Oscar on Sunday night and resigned his sons, I wonder if he didn't remember two of them in the movie (except Adam, his son Anthony too). a small role). Very funny. Also starring Elizabeth Hartman. <br /> <br /> PS: director Larry Cohen is probably known for the killer's movie "It's Alive".
