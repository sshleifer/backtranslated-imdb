I love this show. I watch all the reruns every day, although I've seen them all six times. <br /> <br /> It's about two sisters, Holly (Amanda Bynes) and Val (Jennie Garth), who live in New York. York. Holly will live with Val if their father is transferred to Japan. Val has the perfect life, she has a boyfriend and a perfect apartment in the Upper East. <br /> <br /> The show basically shows all the problems Vall and Holly are going through. The biggest problem is guys, but also about responsible and other choices of life. <br /> <br /> Holly is 16 and is a total free spirit, while Val is the complete opposite. She is organized, should have a plan to do any kind of person. <br /> <br /> The other characters are Henry, Vince, Gary, Lauren and Tina.
