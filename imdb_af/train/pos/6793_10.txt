I absolutely love this game to death. Since I was 9 years old (I'm now 15). It has great graphics, characters, magic, weapons, additions, and don't forget the ultimate awesome dragon shapes! I'm still waiting for a remake, prequel, or a sequel to this spectacular video game. <br /> <br /> You play as Dart, a young swordsman who has the potential to be the hero. On this adventure you meet wonderful creatures and battles. You also have some friends on their way with their own special element. Like fire, darkness, water / ice, thunder / lightning, earth, light and wind. There are also items known as dragon spirits, which allow you to transform into magical creatures of legend. Dragons, wizards, creatures called wingless and evil creatures, face this adventure of action-packed stress and excitement. One of my all-time favorite games, The Legend of Dragoon!
