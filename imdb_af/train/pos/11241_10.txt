I recently got one of my all-time favorite movies on DVD, and as usual I just blew the whole thing through me. <br /> <br /> I'm a massive fan of Hazel O'Connor and the soundtrack to this movie just made me tear, especially the "Do You Want" track. It's a pure nostalgia traveling for me back to my youth. These prizes are best for Quadrophenia (who also dies Phil Daniels). <br /> <br /> A great soundtrack and a view of Britain in the Thatcherite years of the grim 80's in which I grew up. The end is so sad, for hours after the end of the movie I am like a blubbering baby. <br /> <br /> I'm expecting this DVD to be repeatedly viewed, I can watch it over and over and never get bored just for the soundtrack alone. <br /> <br /> Hazel, sorry to hear from your dad treasure. God bless you all. xx
