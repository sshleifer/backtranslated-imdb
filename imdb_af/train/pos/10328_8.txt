The makers chose the best people for the job and made the scene wonderful. Every inside is full of detail that tells you about the people who live in it. Whether the period is the 20s (the first story), the present (ie 1950) for the middle story, or the 1910s (the last), costumes and institutions are lovingly observed and created. I love the cheerful costumes of the two old ladies in the sanatorium - beautiful lace covered by the best Shetland shawls. Roland Culver as Ashenden is very attractive, but never cares for the sweet young lovers, it's Raymond Huntley as the man who withdraws his wife's health and independence, which gives us emotions. He usually played comic, pompous types, but here he is subtle and convincing and very impressive. The China Seas (large 30-year-old movie with Gable and Harlow) has the plot of the Know All episode stolen (and also called a story by Kipling). I wish we had seen more of Naunton Wayne as the jealous man - although he has a good moment to see melancholy in a Mexican hat. I love that sturdy bird that also plays his wife.
