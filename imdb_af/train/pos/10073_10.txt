One of the great things about many of the great Chinese movies you can find, if you're lucky in the video stores, is that they are very accurate feedbacks from real, true stories. Goodbye, my concubine, the emperor and the killer and this movie are perfect examples. The filmmakers make a real story and work hard to accurately create a movie without harming the facts for dramatic or commercial convenience - the hallmark of many Hollywood and especially Disney movies. <br /> <br /> In this story we follow the later years of a well-known local street artist called the king of masks for his mastery of Sichuan Change Art. Along with the fact that he had lost his only son many years earlier, he is looking for a male heir to continue his rare and dying art in a society that forbids women from having such work. Master Wang is a boy sold by a slave trader. Everything is fine, because he gladly prepares him to succeed in his art. But the boy is finally a girl. From there, the story becomes very interesting, with a good performance by Master Liang of the Sichuan Opera - a regional operating style related to the Beijing opera. Fans of Farewell My Concubine should look carefully at Master Liang's portrayal of a man playing the female role in the Chinese Opera. It can help them understand that the players of these female roles are probably not homosexual or castrati, but people who are so psychologically conditioned that they are totally unaware of their own sexuality.
