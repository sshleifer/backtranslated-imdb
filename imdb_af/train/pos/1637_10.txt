I love this movie and have seen it a few times over the years. It gets better with each look. I agree with all the positive reviews here. Yes, it is fierce and brutally realistic, as life was on the prairie in those days. I found myself commenting as I watched it. Someone said that Rip Torn was in disrepair. I couldn't disagree anymore. He is brilliant like the brave, miserable Clyde Stewart who says little and works like a slave / worker. Conchatta Farrell is fantastic as the widow Elinor, who hires Clyde as housekeeper / cook (along with her 7 year old daughter). Lilia Skala is excellent as a distant neighbor called grandmother. Also a star is the bright Montana prairie. It is a beautiful and cruel country to settle. There are some scenes that are repulsive and necessary. No special effects here, what you see is actually! It even has a great music party and good writing. Once you see Heartland, you'll never forget it. It earns all the 10's it gets here.
