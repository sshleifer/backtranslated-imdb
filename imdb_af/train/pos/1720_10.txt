This early biography was so much fun to watch. The second on disk one of D.W. Griffith's "Years of Discovery" DVD series (highly recommended) features three excellent performances by the main leaders, and interesting to see Henry B. Walthall (the small colonel, birth of a nation) as a champion musician who is a countess give the eye (and other things). <br /> <br /> The Countess's husband goes berserk after his wife's betrayal and has her in a small room with her paramour wall. It's amazing that they won't hear the wall, but hey, maybe the wine has something to do with it. Here Mr. Johnson (father of silent player Raymond Hackett) gestured wildly and added to the melodrama, but in an unexpected comic way. The best moment comes to an end. While the woman goes out of shock and fear, when she realizes she was killed, Henry picks up his instrument and supports it over her. The way he did this was so unexpected and in a strange way kind of sexy, and I just lost it and laughed at my head. The expression on his face! From then on I charmed Henry B. Walthall.
