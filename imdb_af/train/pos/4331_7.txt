Murder in Mesopotamia, I have always considered one of the better Poirot books because it is very creepy and has an ingenious end. There is no doubt that the TV adaptation is visually striking, with some beautiful photography and a very haunting music party. As always, David Suchet is impeccable as Hercule Poirot, the comic highlight of the episode is Poirot's battle with a mosquito in the middle of the night, and Hugh Fraser is good as the rather naive Captain Hastings. The rest of the movie is performing properly, but be careful not to overshadow the two leads, a danger in some Christie adjustments. Some of the episodes were rather creepy, an alternation of an episode as tragic as Five Little Pigs, an episode I enjoy much more than that. What made it especially creepy was that the music was set aside when Louise Leidner saw the ghostly face through the window. About the adjustment, it was pretty faithful to the book, but I would say there were three things I didn't like. The biggest problem was the pacing, it's pretty slow, and there are a few scenes where very little happens. I also didn't like the fact that they made Joseph Mercado a murderer. In the book I see him as a rather nervous character, but the intervention of the idea of ​​making him a murderer and underdeveloping has made him less attractive, although I'm glad he didn't miss his drug addiction. (I also noticed that the authors left out that Mrs Mercado fell into hysteria in the book when she believed she was the next victim of the murderer.) The other thing that wasn't so impressive was that I felt it might more was effective if the adaptation in the view of Amy Leatheran was, as it was in the book, Amy seemed in some way less sensitive in the adjustment. In general, despite a number of wrong judgments on the authors, I held Murder in Mesopotamia. 7/10 Bethany Cox.
