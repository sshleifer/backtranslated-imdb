This Cecil B. DeMille epic of the old West contains Jean Arthur's best performance, as a hysterical, eccentric, incurable, amoral, but devoted calamity Jane. She really pulled it! Gary Cooper is at his peak, but sometimes he speaks words: "The plains are big, but paths sometimes cross." The story is a pastiche to end all pasties. All the cowboy heroes of the Western lore seem to be there somehow except for Jesse James. Even Abraham Lincoln opens the story personally (or at least DeMille will believe us so). There is no place for anything so abundant or subtle, it's a blunt in the face story for the masses. A remarkable thing about this film, however, is that it is a very early, full frontal attack that Eisenhower eventually called "the military industrial complex". It's not just a story about rifle runners, but about raising anyone for money, and doing it from the heart of Washington. But let's not get into politics, let's leave it to DeMille, which can be guaranteed to be superficial. The main interest of this movie these years has been that it uses George Antheil's first film, which has much to say about the work of his autobiography, Bad Boy of Music. Antheil appears to be the origin of the "great sound" adopted by all subsequent Westerners, singing the plains with the voices and sounds of many cowboys in the air, interweaving four open spaces and ordinary melodies. That's why it doesn't sound unusual, because we've heard it a thousand times. But he seems to be the first to collect the combined impala of all sage brushes in this open air symphony that has taken place in the American mythical lorries and has given it a soundtrack that has never before changed. but undoubtedly appropriate. It's amazing to see Anthony Quinn in an early appearance as a Cheyenne Indian. Gabby Hayes is there somewhere, but you miss him in the crowd. Gary Cooper embraces them all, big threatening, but when did he ever get small?
