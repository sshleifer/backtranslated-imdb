Andy Goldsworthy is a Taoist first-order master who expresses the Way through his sublime ephemeral art. Indeed, time and change is what his work is basically about. I bought his first book a few years ago and my family was amazed. So it was a surprise to get to know the artist personally through this movie, he is just as patient and gentle as you would expect, and has wonderful things to say about the natural world, the deepest in her occasional Inability to speak in words. He is like most kids playing outdoors (if they do more), creating things from sticks, sand and mud and snow before they outgrow it. Mr. Goldsworthy gave the gift and mission to expand that kind of play to create in-depth visions of nature and often open up tired eyes on brilliant new ways. And always with the utmost respect, gratitude and humor of a wandering, and wondering monk.
