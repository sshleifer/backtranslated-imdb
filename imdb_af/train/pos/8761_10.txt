I love Claire Danes, and Kate Beckinsale looks incredibly immature in her role. The film is only flawed because it seems as if the two accused appear to be in a monastery, working like monks in the grass and under strictly almost martial-like discipline. The play and filmography and amazing colors of what Thailand is supposed to be striking, but Claire Daines steals the whole movie and is unexpectedly deep in her to teach the hard lesson of life itself to the end. of incredible selflessness unheard of and totally unexpected in the real world. The flaws are low and I recommend the movie, which is forever disappearing for rare TV shows. I want the movie for my collection - a collection of only 10-rated movies. Look, you will be touched a lot.
