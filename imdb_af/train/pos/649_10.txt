We don't have to lose this movie, it's one of the biggest things I've ever seen. Jean Pierre Leaud is wonderful (more than usual) and the movie is one of the most memorable of the nouvelle fashion. Jean Eustache is no longer on this earth, we only have these black and white images to remember one of the largest and most valuable French directors. You just love this masterpiece. I will never forget it. <br /> <br /> PS: Sorry for the English ...
