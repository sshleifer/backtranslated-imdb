Like others, I have seen and studied most of the books and films about the Clutter Killings, including some dramatic works that are thematically based on the actions and psychomology of the participants of the crime - including Capote himself. As far as Capote is concerned, I cannot forgive him for deliberately withholding Perry Smith's confession, intimacy and writings from even the defense advice. I believe truths and facts that Capote "reserved" for his book, which required Capote two guilty statements and death sentences, would almost certainly have undergone a successful madness defense for Perry Smith under the old McNaughton rule. Capote himself could never write another great literary work after "In Cold Blood." Shame and guilt. In my opinion, he willingly encouraged the cruel death penalty and planned to bring the spectacular end he needed for his book / drama. For him, both men had to die for his book to succeed. The book had to justify itself by pretending it was about the horror of the death penalty. His actions and silence ensured the ice-cold conclusion. <br /> <br /> Capote's book is not the truth. It is not factual or journalistic. It is drama and melodrama seasoned with its own creative psychotic imagination. What most people consider the virtues of today's first movie is strong images of Capote's thoughts, which could be the cold-blooded aspect of everyone. No wonder viewers ironically prefer, but preferably Blake's performance. This actor is the nightmare of Capote's dishonest imagination. <br /> <br /> So who should say how the two killers should be played? Who is to judge what can make a material poetic psychotic snap of excessive politeness and kindness to do now? I agree with the little that in Eric Roberts' work saw a beautiful show, Shakespearean in his series, but played with heartbreaking sincerity. Anthony Edwards takes a much safer "attitude mode" to create a smarmy Hickok; but he is one-dimensional and boring, with only a few notes in his television series. Roberts is almost four-dimensional and adds physical weakness and anxiety to a powerful animal body, a Frankenstein creature thinking in poems and knowing exactly what NOT to do. Like Leopold, Loop, Robert's Perry Smith is hopelessly in love with an evil man. Without Hickok or a man of his particularity, Perry Smith would not have brought his psychic mind into a world of horror. He feared himself more than he feared anything else in life. <br /> <br /> Given the freedom of Capote's assault on the awareness of the Clutter murder, Roberts and Edwards are free to create original personalities and psychoses for another and new production of the drama. The same facts, from the same lines from the case stage, but deeper, more complicated, with clear titanic psychotic tension. Indeed, Roberts is so good at this fluid madness that he physically and soundly shows in every moment how little awareness he has of where or who he is. <br /> <br /> What many of our judges do not like this movie, especially Roberts, is that cold-blooded murder is not shown as they expected and manipulated to claim. This is because here, a much deeper realistic "interpretation of life and death" than Capote can ever see - a true tragedy. <br /> <br /> The actual cold-blooded killer, Mr. Capote, and his hypocritical artistic "non-fiction novel" do not control these interpretations and actions. <br /> <br /> As "In Cold Blood" and Capote's effect on life, literature and truth matter as much as scholars say, then it is necessary to gut and talent to portray the truth, or a version of truth, it is not the rank, cowardly lie drawn from the plains of Capote's own abyss.
