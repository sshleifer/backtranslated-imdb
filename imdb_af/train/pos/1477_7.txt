I watched this movie on Friday, April 7th. I didn't see the last scene (cos I talked to my brother at the same time). Anyone can tell me what happened to her? I looked slightly when her husband heard someone talking to his wife in the bedroom and then he opened the door, she was dead. <br /> <br /> What happened to her? Did she kill herself? How could she arrange everything like the phone calls, meanwhile she was at home when her husband talked to this strange fan? Anyone can please explain to me. I'm so curious! (In the end I read that she suffers from the increased disorder personality). <br /> <br /> Think of it.
