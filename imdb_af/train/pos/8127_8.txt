While a little preachy about the subject of progress as the saving grace of humanity, it is still a beautiful film that will take science-fiction special effects blockbusters exactly what will take another 40 years to get on the silver screen. It predicts the worldwide chaos of World War II, but expands on the premise of having the conflict for the past 30 years, and then tells the epic story of man's struggle under the rubble and in the wilds of space. The play seems to be wood and oddly sterile, but it is perhaps the result of its contrast with the visual values ​​that had to be totally breathtaking at the time of the film's release, and which are still impressed. It is a movie not missed by anyone who is not interested in the SF genre at all.
