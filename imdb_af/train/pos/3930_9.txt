It is noteworthy that Ford has thrown out less well-known, star-stared actors for Lincoln's supporting players Ford. Not only does it enhance his film's focus on Lincoln's central character, it also offers the audience a refreshing insight into Lincoln as a man of his place and time, a man who, as we are relentless, in the issues and sentiments of his time and seek his way to solve them. Not so much by Fonda's Lincoln's words and actions, but in the faces, reactions of supporting players, Ford tells the story of shaping the young Lincoln's worldview, sense of place in society and the police, and how people responded to Mr. Lincoln's words and deeds and laid confidence in this man. They thought they deserved respect and respect. <br /> <br /> Give it a try: instead of focusing on Henry Fonda the next time you see "Young" Lincoln 'shifts your focus to the supporting characters - you'll be well-equipped with a more in-depth appreciation of both Lincoln and Ford. I suspect Ford's storytelling through the supporting characters' reactions to Fonda's Lincoln called on David Lean when he directed Omar Sharif to "Doctor Zhivago". These are the supporting characters' reactions to Zhivago, which actually tells Zhivago.
