Very emotional. It can't leave you neutral. <br /> <br /> Yes, this is a love story between 2 18 year old boys. But it's just the body of this movie. And it was removed. You just feel what happened to these boys. You feel the soul of the movie. Of course, some action, a little sex, but it's not pornography, too many feelings. <br /> <br /> It was just a summer "story", and it has become love to kill almost the most important time of their lives. I loved it, you will also have what your feelings are.
