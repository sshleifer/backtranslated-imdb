It's a rip-off, old-fashioned adventure yarn. I understand that the treatment of the Indians against today's political standards was unacceptable. But this movement is not about politics. It's about action, dialogue, camaraderie, acting, direction, music and photography, and it's great about all these factors. Grant, Fairbanks and McLaglen are electricity together, and Jaffe is great. This is the ultimate girlfriend movie.
