The Running Man is one of those movies that, even if overwhelmed, will be boring and sad. <br /> <br /> My advice is to look it up once or twice a year with a few friends and a few drinks. <br /> In today's climate of TV Media domination and capitalist mode in society, it really works as a revisionist social commentary, after the 1980s tree. Forget it already! There are other brilliant and better reasons to see this movie. <br /> <br /> Schwarzenegger is on top form as Ben "The Butcher of Bakersfield" Richards, and the inclusion of Bond-belting one liners was totally inspired. really end-to-end (with his rant to Killian over a camera the main highlight). <br /> <br /> The design of the stalkers is authentic American, and reflects the characteristics seen in the PC's Gladiators TV show. , and the WWE too. Buzz-saw's grisly end will chew any viewer to the core (as a footnote, why was his death radiated as particularly disturbing in what is apparently an exciting action with a bitter sense of humor?) <br /> <br /> Jesse Venturer and Sven Ole Thorssen are big as back muscle (and are Arnies buttons in real life), and it even has Mick Fleetwood in it! what more can you ask for? <br /> <br /> I recommend the running man if you are looking for a wonderful entertaining action, with a glossy finish and some good characters. Don't just expect an education (at least on the surface value). <br /> <br /> Quality, I love it very much. You will also, unless you are a thesp. 10/07
