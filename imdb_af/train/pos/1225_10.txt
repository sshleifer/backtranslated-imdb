Does anyone know where or how to get a copy of this movie? !! I've been looking for too long, helping someone! Back in 1997, my girlfriends and I were extras on this Long Island-based movie, and we never really saw it. : <br /> <br /> I was hoping I could find a copy somehow, so I can finally check it out and share it with the girls! Is there anyone out there who knows where to get a copy of this, so I can also stop making love (it doesn't matter in VHS format, I'm still in the ice age myself.) If you, or anyone you know, have a copy of this movie, please help, I'll be willing to pay for a good copy of it!
