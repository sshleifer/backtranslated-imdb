Being Austria was a straight knock in my face. Fortunately, I do not live anywhere near the place where this movie takes place, but unfortunately it is all that the rest of Austria hates about Viennese people (or people near the region). And it's very easy to read that it's exactly the director's intention: let your head sink into your hands and say, "Oh my God, how can that be!" No, not with me, the (in my opinion) completely exaggerated uncensored swinger club scene is not necessary, I certainly look, but in this context I was rather disgusting than in the right context. <br /> <br /> This movie tells a story about how deceiving people who suffer from lack of education or trying to survive and live in a world of dismissal and boring horizons. A girl who is being treated by her super-jealous boyfriend like a whore (and still comes back), a female teacher who discovers her masochism by putting the life of her super-cruel "lover" at stake, an old couple who is almost a mathematical daily cycle (she is the "official replacement" of his ex-wife), a couple who have just divorced and the former man suffers from the actions of his former wife, naturally has a relationship with her masseuse and finally a crazy hitchhiker who asks her managers the most unusual questions and extends their nerves by just being super-annoying. <br /> <br /> After you see it, you almost feel nothing. You're not even shocked, sad, depressed or feeling like doing something ... Maybe that's why I gave it 7 points. It made me react in a way I never responded. If it's good or bad, it's for you!
