It is one of the greatest sports films ever made by Hollywood. What a wonderful story about one of the great sports figures of American history. What makes the story of James J. Corbett especially interesting is that Mr. Corbett has introduced the style of boxing that continues to this day. In this respect, James J. Corbett is truly renewed. But to return to the movie, all the performances were excellent. Alexis Smith was beautiful. In fact, she looks like Nicole Kidman. And while it is a period, the story can withstand the test of time; it has no birthday. Ward Bond's portrayal of John L. Sullivan should be one of the great representations of a real sports figure in the history of movies and the boxing scene is realistic, well-educated and highly effective. This, along with a large font, makes this movie a must.
