Olivier, Kosentsev, Richardson, Coranado, Zefferelli and Almerayeda all targeted Hamlet, but Branagh was the only one who managed it. <br /> <br /> It is the only movie of "Hamlet" that is the full four hours of William Shakespeare's masterpiece and gives a unique feel to the whole story. <br /> <br /> Not many directors can break it down without boring their audience, but Branagh's skillful use of bravora film style and stunt casting allows people the importance of Screens that are usually cut out. <br /> <br /> Examples of this are Gerarde Depardue as Ranyaldo, whose entire purpose in the movie was to simply say, "Yes my lord", as Polonius asks him to explore at Leartes. It also includes Billy Crystal as the grave engraver, Robin Williams as Osric, Jack Lemmon as Marcellous, and Charlton Heston as the actor. <br /> <br /> Branagh's execution of the Act 4 scene 4 soliloquy is nothing short of c-spectacle, as the camera slows down as the intensity grows. It's a scene that literally made me want to jump out of my chair and start applauding. <br /> <br /> Branagh is the only filmmaker who understands the importance of each scene in this movie and knew how to make it important to the general audience. <br /> <br /> It's a must see for everyone who enjoys a good storytelling, brilliant play and incredible direction. All this part of William Shakespeare's greatest triumph.
