Ya. That's what I think. Certainly, it was another great show with John in it, but I personally think it's better without it. <br /> <br /> I love CJ and Grandpa to stay home because they are so funny together. <Br /> <br /> When John was still around, I didn't really laugh as much as I do now. <br /> <br /> It's not that bad anymore. (I don't think ...) because I like to see new material. <br /> <br /> My favorite character must be Rory. poor Rory is almost always left out. It's always about Bridget or Carrie. WHAT ABOUT RORY !!! ?? Honestly, it's a good show and to someone who never watched it, you should watch it. I almost guarantee that you will laugh. good, even, sly.
