A vow to cherish is a wonderful movie. It is based on a novel of the same title, which was equally good, but different from the movie. It really made you think about how you would react if you were in the characters' shoes. Recommended for anyone who has ever loved a parent, spouse or family member - in other words, ONLY! <br /> <br /> Although the production isn't quite Hollywood quality - no great special effects - still, the values ​​and ideas depicted more than making it up. And the throw has done a wonderful job of capturing the emotional connections between family members and the destruction that happens when one of them becomes ill. <br /> <br /> You don't want to miss it!
