It was the first regularly filmed Columbo movie section, but it seconded to Steven Spielberg's "Columbo: Murder by the Book". It's also one of the better at the same time! <br /> <br /> Bernard L. Kowalski was a wonderful creative director! No wonder they asked him later to direct three more Columbo movies. The film has some real creative and innovative lap sequences and the film as a whole is also made clear with style, passion and attention to detail. Each shot connects and is a reason why this movie is better and also looks better than any other average made for TV movies. It's definitely one of the better-directed Columbo movies. <br /> <br /> This is a stop original Columbo entry for a few reasons. The murder is more or less an accident and was an impulsive act. This time, the murderer does not have the time to plan the 'perfect murder' in advance and she has to clean any of the tracks afterwards and have to get rid of the body. The murderer in this movie is not only dealt with as the man who committed the crime, but more than the man who helps Lieutenant Columbo solve the murder. It also makes the character a more interesting and layered one, and also helps the way Columbo unleash the whole crime, also looks more interesting for it. Of course, Columbo starts to suspect him early, and as always, he comes to the solution by making himself vulnerable and more stupid than he is of course real and by gaining the murderer's confidence. Of course, this is not a devastator, because it is the way each Columbo movie is created. I like the story of the movie and how it progresses. <br /> <br /> It also helps the movie to have such a good role. By the time of this movie, Peter Falk really made the Columbo character and its character has already been fully developed. Robert Culp is really good as the short-tempered Brimmer. Funny thing is that he will later die in three different Columbo films and one of the "Mrs. Columbo" sections, only in different roles. He even played the killer in some of those movies. He was not the only actor who did it in other later Columbo movies. Also, the great Ray Milland makes an appearance in this movie, as the man of the victim. <br /> <br /> All in all, a very good early Columbo movie and among the better from the long series of movies. <br /> <br /> 9/10
