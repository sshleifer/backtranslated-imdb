Was happy to be an extra in this great movie and loved every minute of the filming. Went to the Premier in London and had a good conversation with Phil, Peter, Martin and Jon like my wife. Fantastic after party too. Then a few weeks later went to the cinema with members of our bike club. What a brilliant movie, it deserves to be there with all the big biker movies. Now we have the DVD Sue my wife can't get enough of it, even the kids. Get a piece of stick from the club that looks like I'm a movie star now. Oh, you can only dream. I think they're just jealous. The only downside to the first part of the filming was the weather, rain, rain and more rain, but hey we were in Wales. Hopefully there will be a follow-up, so keep me posted Jon. Danny Beck
