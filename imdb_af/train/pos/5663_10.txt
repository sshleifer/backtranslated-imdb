14 years since this show was made and it is still the best show ever made. The writing was 1st class and the production was second. This show will never be made today and it is a shame. I hope if you think about finding this show to make sure you do it. <br /> <br /> AG came out the year when I left high school when my fav TV program was the x files, giving you an idea of ​​why I first got this show. AG was a much better program with better writing just one reason? I know it's not the only program to get just one season. Another example to consider will be the lone rifle (x files turn off). It had good writing and was funny but it only had one season. It doesn't look right! <br /> <br /> We also need to remember that this show was before "dark" dark performances like "cool" so I think it might have dropped the show as well. <br /> <br /> Watch this app and enjoy it! 10 out of 10 for me.
