An excellent example of the spectacular Busby Berkeley musicals produced in the early 1930s. Audiences should be very surprised to see James Cagney in this type of vehicle. Totally a contrast to his "Public Enemy" 2 years earlier. Cagney adds spark and interest to a very routine-depleted formulated story and plot. But the highlight of the movie is the 3 extended production numbers from back to back. First, with the conservative "Honeymoon Hotel" number, followed by the very spectacular dazzling "By A Waterfall" sequence, followed by the closing of Shanghai Lil order, Cagney only participates in the last number listed on the top of a pub shows counter with Ruby Keeler. The Shanghai Lil number with Cagney is excellent, but a bit of a comedown & anti climactic to the more exciting and incredibly sensible "By A Waterfall" choreography. If I were the director, I would have inserted the "Shanghai Lil" number in the middle and close with "At a waterfall" that blows the other 2 numbers out of the water, and in my opinion the best of the 3 numbers. The 3 production numbers are the ripe on the cake, and James Cagney's performance is adorned with the cake. An excellent musical performance, a 4 star movie, the ultimate music, worth watching, will not be disappointed !!!!!!!!!
