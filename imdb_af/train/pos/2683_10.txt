Franco once again proves that he is the prince of surrealistic and erotic theater. Certainly, much of his work can be seen as an entertaining sleaze, but with Succubus (Necronomicon) he shows what he is really capable of raising his distorted creativity and gives us a film that is hypnotic and enigmatic while he still the annoying eroticism in his work. Jerry Van Rooyen's brilliant score pulsates when the viewer is thrown from one bizarre scenario to another, as we follow the trials of a striptease artist (Reynaud) who may be schizophrenic, or perhaps a devil is similar to the world she lives in. A beautiful and mysterious piece of cinema is highly recommended for anyone with even passing interest in alternative theater.
