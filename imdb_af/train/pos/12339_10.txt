Dear Joan. Great achievement. What is she not good at? I watched this movie and then Jane Eyre afterwards ... she just got better. My heart was racing. Great old movie drama. Just what I want from a classic movie. Facial expressions are worth the whole movie. I'm glad I put it on video. Don't know what you need more in a movie. Beautiful woman .... wealth ..... greed ..... murder .... detectives ...... a trial ..... <br /> <br /> The costumes are a lot nice . Wondering what the budget for this movie was? Wish they still made movies like this. When they try, they just seem to make a cheese film. Black and white movies still hold a certain mystery.
