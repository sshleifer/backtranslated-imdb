When I first found out that Brian Krause would be in this movie, I wanted to look. It took me weeks to realize that I saw this and loved it. That's why I had more reason to look. Well, I looked. It was actually better than most TV movie sequels. I hate what happens to Brian's character (you can find out for yourself) and I don't like most characters, Brian's one is included. But the movie needs the cheesy and annoying characters to make Stanley Caldwell (Judd Nelson) shine again. In the end, I was sorry for Stanley and his own happy ending. If you liked the original cabin at the lake, or if you like horror movies without the blood, I'd recommend seeing it.
