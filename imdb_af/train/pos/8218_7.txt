With Harry Callahan standing up in years, the inevitable "old man with a slide on his shoulder story finally had to come into play. Callahan, who sometimes looks fragile and out of place, was still steadfast in his attitude. Fortunately, this movie took time to develop a different kind of story, one that can rediscover the Dirty Harry and the whole genre. While the movie was short, it was still a great addition to the series, even though it got a bit out of place at a time of silly fashion trends and New Wave music.
