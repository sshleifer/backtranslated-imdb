This film was one of my childhood favorites and I have to say it, unlike some other movies I had at that time. The Thief of Baghdad has the quality of my mind as I grew up. It's not just a movie that children can enjoy. It can also be viewed by adults. The only downside is that one cannot see the bad effects (compared to the effects of the day) as one can be when one is a child. I didn't remember any of the effects, of course it was about ten years since I saw this movie when I was about eleven years old. Who then looks at securities? One only searches for good stories and entertainment and that is exactly what this film offers. In my mind, this film is one of the first major adventure films of the 20th century. To think of it, I feel that the Indiana Jones movies are much like this movie. There is comedy, romance and adventure all in one that creates a wonderful mix that captures you from the beginning to the end and although the film is old and the music and style of the movies clearly is not modern, it manages to dusty and old. All this is mainly due to the great story, the good direction and the good acting of the actors. In that department, Sabu (like Abu) and Conrad Veidt (like Jaffar) stand out, offering the comic and the cold elements of the film for the most part. Big movie and although an 'oldie', definitely a golden one. I hope someone has the brain and at least to release this one on DVD. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
