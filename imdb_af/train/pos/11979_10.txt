I try to watch it most of the time every day, and although I've been watching for the past 4 years, I haven't seen every episode. <br /> <br /> The show is about Danny Tanner who is a guy news for sports. His wife is killed by a driver by a car accident and he asks Jesse, an Elvis maniac with a motorcycle and has an obsession with his hair. Joey, an adult kid who does comedy and plays continues to care for his three girls, Donna Joe, calls them her DJ, Stephinie, the second oldest and Michelle, the youngest. <br /> <br /> They all live under one roof with no one to help them. <br /> <br /> Later in the show, Jesse gets a girlfriend and later she is married and has twins, Nicki and Alex. (it starts in the new seasons) This show is great, if you like the Suite life of Zack and Cody, it's so Raven, Boy Meets World, and the design of Woman, you'll love it. (It starts better in the end of the seasons.) Look, you will love it!
