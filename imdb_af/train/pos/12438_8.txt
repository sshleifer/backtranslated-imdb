The movie was a long-awaited release, which is a bit disappointing because of the expectation I have set up. If I look again, I have to say it's pretty good. First of all, it is very true of the original history (of course not quite) and was made as such only to retain the right of the movie. Humility's history as a child is shown and is very true to the original. The play is perhaps not the best and the plot is a bit thin, but if you compare it to the 1966 Vitti movie, it's much better just because it's not a musical try. Generally speaking, I would only recommend it to fans of Modesty Blaise or to anyone who catches it on the TV.
