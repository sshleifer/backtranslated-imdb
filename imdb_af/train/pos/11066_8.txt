For a long time, it seemed as if all the good Canadian actors led south of the border and (both) all the second rankings filled the top slots, leaving the dregs for the sex comedies. <br /> <br /> This movie was a real surprise: in spite of the strange plots typical of farces, the actors tried to put something in their characters and what we, the viewer, came back to was almost true suspension of faith. When the extras of the music video got out of the police, you almost believed it was possible. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of some of the better sex flights (Canadian or not), you should definitely look for one. out. And the big surprise, this gender child is also loaded with some very good nudity.
