Unfortunately, this movie never made it to DVD. I saw it when it was only issued to the theaters in 1983, and then released the VHS in 1992. When I recently saw a VHS copy at a flea market, I immediately bought it. I was not disappointed. First, the obvious: Claudia Ohana is beautiful and a joy to see. But then the film takes you into an unreal world where you have to reflect on your values ​​and decide what is very important to you. The movie is about many things. It's about how the World Bank and big companies exploit and add to developing countries with their capitalist schemes to force them into a debt they can never repay. It's about how our economic system exploits us by forcing us into debt with credit cards, loans and car payments. It's about trying to save an innocence that we might never really have and maybe we can't really save it. It's about good and evil and how difficult it is sometimes to tell one of the others. It raises many questions, but does not give answers. I think sometimes it's good. For this reason, it is a movie that is worth saving and seeing.
