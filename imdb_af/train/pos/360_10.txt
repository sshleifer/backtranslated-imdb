11 Oscar nominations and zero wins !!! I haven't yet understood why. It's not like the actors in the movie, but better than you can by giving their awards for trivial roles as done with Halle Berry and Denzel Washington. Whoopi, Oprah, Margaret Avery, Danny Glover alike. - everyone was wonderful - I'm curious to get scripts from the discussions at the Oscars that year ...... it should be in the Shoulda-woulda-coulda category for the judges. <br /> <br /> It's a wonderful book - but where is Alice Walker's style of writing, she has a way of looking like she's exaggerating her characters - so I'm so glad their screen matching is a few things . <br /> <br /> The cinematography was wonderful - the African screens are a lot to be desired - the African part of the book is supposed to be in Liberia - somewhere in West Africa - BUT oh no! Steven Spielberg thinks the world is so stupid that they can't think of Africa outside of the Safaris - if so, there should be a complimentary zebra and wildlife if we all know that there is no West Africa and especially the why The people speak Swahili --- who speaks in West Africa Swahili? I just had to get it out of the way ....... <br /> <br /> But as a story - wonderful, filmmaking - from this world - CLASSIC yes !! <br /> <br /> I own it and I watch it if my soul needs rejuvenation.
