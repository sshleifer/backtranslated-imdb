I'm glad other people enjoy this movie because I know it doesn't have the biggest reputation and it didn't make any money at the box. I thought it was great and there are several reasons why - Bogdanovich is the lightest touch, the cast (especially Coleen Camp) is perfect and the Big Bad Apple has never looked better at the movie. You've seen worse movies!
