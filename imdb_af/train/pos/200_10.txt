Updated from a previous comment. The big and underrated Marion Davies shows her comedic stuff in the late (1928) silent comedy that also shows the wonderful William Haines. Davies plays a hiccup from Georgia breaking into Hollywood with the help of Haines, a bit of a comedian player. They appear together in cheap comedies until Marion is "discovered" and becomes a great dramatic star. <br /> <br /> A great lampoon on Hollywood and its pretensions. Davies & Haines is a wonderful team, and guest photos of Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, John Gilbert, Elinor Glyn, Norma Talmadge, Mae Murray, Rod LaRocque, Leatrice Joy, Dorothy Sebastian, Estelle Taylor, Louella Parsons , Renee Adoree, Aileen Pringle, and Marion Davies (you should see it) are a hoot. A must have for any serious movie buff or for anyone interested in still malignant Marion Davies! Dell Henderson plays the father. Polly Moran is a girl. Paul Ralli is the smart front man. <br /> <br /> People from SHOW WAS said he used Gloria Swanson's career as his model. (I think Mae Murray is closer). Davies and Swanson were friends. But this film's story is parallel to the rise of Swanson from one-line Mack Sennett comedies with Charlie Chaplin to STAR in late-teens and early 20s Cecil B. DeMille films. <br /> <br /> Davies and Haines were great MGM stars and friends. Strange that MGM never put them together in a talkie. They are good together! A lovely romance and beautiful spoof of early Hollywood. Greta Garbo and Bebe Daniels are mentioned but do not appear.
