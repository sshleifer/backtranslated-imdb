Well, there are quite a few ways to spoil a political thriller. Usually they are derivatives or too ambitious. They often have a conspiracy that is totally paranoid and incredible. But City Hall doesn't do any of the above. The plot is cleverly designed, the story is credible. Regarding characters, I would say this movie is a solid average. No character seems out of place and Al Pacino is brilliant as always. His portrayal of a charismatic NYC mayor is excellent and again proves that Al Pacino is the absolute top of American actors today.
