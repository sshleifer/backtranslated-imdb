Any movie in the early days of Orson Welles is a triumph to the third man with Joseph Cotton. He is also wonderful in a sharp of evil. Please see them all! He tends to be pompous and serve himself in films like F is for Fake, really stupid waste of film. Don't waste your time watching it. It's really ignorant. Orson Welles is a movie icon and anyone who studies film must see everything he has filmed. All his foremost ladies are great, but eventually Welles has become a fat drunk, like his character in a Trek of Bose! For some reason Orson Welles had a way with women. I see how he can be considered attractive in his youth, not like Gary Cooper or Joseph Cotton, or Cary Grant, John Wayne, I can go on and off, but I'm going out ... And because I'm a wife, I can see the attraction to him. He (Orson Welles) is one of the last true filmmakers and unless you count the filmmakers today: Tarantino, Scorsese, Spike Lee, most of the filmmakers not only measure the filmmakers of the Forties! I know that there are many more filmmakers today, but in such a short time I can't call them all. No offense to any of the great filmmakers of this millennium! August 21, 2100. Please remind me of some current and future filmmakers, I don't want to be held in the past! I love some of the movies now, but rarely is there anyone I will list 100 best. "Hustle and Flow" was fantastic, so was Fargo, and "Oh brother, where are you," of a line in Sullivan's voyages; Another fine movie from the forties! Can anyone give me the best list for the 90s and 2006? I want to know who to look! Thank you! Also props for this site! Where else can you plug a movie or fix it! I like the ranting and raving of regular people like me who can say what I want and I promise not to spoil any movie for anyone who hasn't seen it yet!
