It is a truly classic film in his story, acting and film performance. Wonderful actors are full of the movie, Miss. Sullivan, and Jimmy Stewart are the leading characters. In real life, she admired and loved Jimmy, and he basically gave his first acting and helped him to calm down with his appearance on the set. The "chemistry" between the two was always clear, and so warm and pleasant to see. She was such a beautiful, young woman, and so sweet in her personality depictions. The story of these two youths, and how they eventually eventually come together, is beautiful to watch and pure magic entertainment. Heart warming offers are also provided by the other supporting actors in this wonderful story / movie. I give Miss Sullivan a perfect 10 in this Golden Age Cinema Classic, which has a special appeal for all generations. A must see for everyone!
