Unlike me, Vern and Teddy talk who was harder, Superman or Mighty Mouse. My friends and I often discuss who also wins a fight. Sometimes we become absurd and compare guys like MacGyver and The Terminator or Rambo and Matrix. But now it seems we are discussing guys like Jackie Chan, Bruce Lee and Jet Li. This is a pointless comparison since Lee is dead, but it is a fun one. And if you're going to see what we saw about Jet Li in Lethal 4 and Black Mask, you should at least say that he'll match Chan well. In this film he comes over as a martial artist. <br /> <br /> Black Mask is about a man who was created with many other men to be the highest fighters. Their only goal is to win wars that others lose. They are invincible in some ways. Now this is the point of departure for the film, but what it means is all the incredible choreographed scenes. <br /> <br /> Jet Li is a miracle. He can do things with and to his body that no man should be able to do. And that's what makes him so enjoyable. <br /> <br /> In addition to martial arts in the film, Black Mask is passionate about humor and that is because of the chemistry that Jet has with his co-star, the police officer. They are good together. But to be honest. If someone reads this review, they want to know if the movie is in the action section. And the answer to this is a resounding YES! Much gory mindless action. You will love this movie.
