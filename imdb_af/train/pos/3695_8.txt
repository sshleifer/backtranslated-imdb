I was happy to attend a show in Stockholm for this elegant, enjoyable and thought-provoking movie. With romance as the heaviest weapon in his arsenal, Paris boldly pushes your t'aime into Paris in love, navigating the various forms in eighteen separate "quarters", but without cleaning Parisian and sacrament formulas. The gold mine undoubtedly comes from frustration on the directors' parts ?? frustration about just 5-10 minutes of screen time ?? thereby you are offered only with the best and most assured direction of each party. <br /> <br /> Debating whether I should review all 18 segments, I concluded that it would simply be superfluous and lengthy. Instead, just be sure that each director featured the film with their eccentric styles and skills, and definitely find your favorite. Although Gus Van Sant cannot resist the temptation to be introspective, his LES MARAIS is one of the better contributions, even in a well-placed Kurt Cobain reference. The Coen brothers recreate one of the more accessible segments in Paris, a scene with a subdued, but emotional, transparent Steve Buscemi, deadly humor and clever camera angles that surely generated the most in my theater, and perhaps ended up. <br /> <br /> In this way, all story lines are exceptionally unique? filtered through the minds of different directors? But the one who deviates most from the rest is Vincenzo Natali's QUARTIER DE LA MADELEINE, a dark horror-Gothic love that Elijah Wood as a lost tourist walks into Paris's backstop at night, meeting a vampire. With a black-and-white format, but a crimson color contrast that seems to be unashamed, does it eventually become a Sin City pastiche? a refreshing, ominous and visual twist in an otherwise reasonably well-founded film. <br /> <br /> But my single favorite segment was FAUBOURG SAINT-DENIS by Tom Tykwer, but I think I was qualified to think so, as I went to the theater with him and my girlfriend in the side put down. and said, "Lastly, this is my favorite director here". Yet it cannot be denied that Tykwer delivers a beautiful segment in which a blind boy picks up the phone and hears of his girlfriend (Portman - for once not annoying) that she breaks with him and he reflects on their relationship. As for Tywker's style, the story is dizzy, fast, kinetic and repetitive, with screaming and running (Lola Rennt), making it the most adrenaline pump segment in Paris your time and possibly also the most beautiful when Tywker his most powerful tool ?? music. <br /> <br /> To fill the negative account, it's clear that not all directors work as well as Tywker, Van Sant, Cohens, Coixet and Depardieu. Sylvain Chomet scrapes the bottom of the pile by cutting out a truly disposable segment in which a little boy tells the story of how his parents met. They are two lonely mimes. This part is so in your face French and desperate that it is offensive to international viewers. Suwa also regulates a poor and soft segment with an exceptionally disturbing Juliette Binoche that grieves the loss of her son. Nothing else happens. In the end, the excitement and intertwining of the 18 stories eventually feel a bit rushed and half-hearted. <br /> <br /> But Paris your t'aime really spoils you with quality, because all the other stories are good. - Made with sharp acting and spectacular writing. This is definitely one of the highlights of 2006 (not much, I think) and a very personal movie in that it is inevitable to choose a favorite and the least favorite. Highly recommended to be the mainstream of "pretentious" (heh) audiences. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
