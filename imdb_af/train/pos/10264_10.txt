Just watch the movie for the 3rd time and enjoy Lindsay Crouse and the rest of the cast as much as before. It just gets better and better. You just have to wonder about the meticulous way of speech, the slow deliberate action, everything that is in place. <br /> <br /> Actually one of the biggest and definitely my all-time favorite !!!
