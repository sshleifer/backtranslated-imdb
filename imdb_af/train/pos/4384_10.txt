GREAT SPOILERS !! THIS IS FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE seen the movie! <br /> <br /> Commentaries touched the main theme of "honor" in the film, and too many comparisons with "Braveheart." I will point out a few things about this movie I didn't see. Other allegations relate to: <br /> <br /> This movie has a definite difference in abortion. The first character to conceive is the villain's (Roth) girlfriend, and when he coldly suggests an abortion, she says it's too late. Shame on her situation ("I have a bastard bastard.") Lead her to commit suicide in a much later scene. The second character to find her pregnant is Mary, Rob's wife, after a Roth character rape (and at least one sex scene with her husband, Rob). Later in the film, as Rob leaves for a final confrontation with Roth, Mary asks her what to do about the pregnancy of questionable origin, with an abortion tone. Rob replies in a noble tone, "it is not the fault of the child," and then say what he thinks the name should be, girl or son. I find this "pro-life" attitude of the part of the hero very un-Hollywood. Rob walked from the darkness of the house to the shining outside to make this comment - not accidental symbolism. <br /> <br /> Another related theme is Roth's character is a bastard, someone who apparently doesn't know who his father was, and has little kind words for his mother, although he has a picture of her in a case hung from his neck. It happens to be that Roth (without family stability) is the definition of psychopath, while Rob is the strong man / father figure, and of course the hero. In the last sword battle between Rob and the villain (Roth), the former last cut across the chest - the left side of the chest, over the heart. His employer and pseudo-father figure (John Hurt character) holds the photo of the mother in his hand and looks at it before cutting it off the neck of the dead Roth. <br /> <br /> Also, what I find interesting is the direction of the rape scene, which wasn't quite graphic, but also not from the camera. I found it surprising in this is a little real portrayal, with Mary convincingly demonstrating the characteristics of someone who is going through the trial and the subsequent post-traumatic stress (as we call it now). My point was that the rape was not sensational or just implied, which I find an interesting way for Hollywood. <br /> <br /> In the final battle scene, I need to fix an earlier commentator: The Roth weapon chosen was a rapier (or perhaps a short sword), the weapon Rob preferred was a Claymore. Someone really did their homework on this whole scene. Roth would have the upper hand in such a situation, but of course the Claymore is a clear Scottish weapon. What's even more noticeable (such as a screen and someone who has read a bit about the subject) is that this last sword battle is one of the most convincing of any movie ever made: Actors actually try to kill each other - Not the ordinary chips to the opponent's blade we see in most movie battles (including the movie start-up fight). Even more true in history, Roth is seen several times by using the rapier as a gun, which is the purpose by design! (Rapiers was striped, but mainly a gun with the edges mainly used to make an opponent's punch.) Rob uses the Claymore in a broad diagonal as it is designed. The battle goes off as I expect it - Roth wins effectively. Although Rob wins the day by grabbing Roth's weapon (more symbolism) and killing him with a powerful cut. <br /> <br /> People, it's RARE to see this level of historical accuracy in a movie sword. <br /> <br /> I would also note that, for whatever reason, I remember 1995 (the year of release) clearly as a time of distrust of the US government. Hollywood, of course, agreed with the release of both "Rob Roy" and "Braveheart", and I think the anti-government leanings are why both films get so much comparison. <br /> <br /> I think the different perspective this movie gives is refreshing for avid movie lovers, tired of the same old, not so hidden messages from Hollywood.
