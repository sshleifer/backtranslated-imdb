Don't be turned over by the naysayers. It's a wonderful ghostly movie. It was a pilot for the author / director, JT Petty. He did a good job of having me on the edge of my seat. I never really knew what to expect, and it is Nirvana for an amazing horror filmmaker! The film is about an elderly man living in an isolated log cabin in the woods. One day, looking for his cat in the woods, does he witness the murder of a child, or does he? He worried about the rest of the film. What is most unusual about this movie is that there is no dialogue to the last few scenes. I found it to be interesting. The author succeeds in holding your senses and gives them a relentless towpipe. Give this movie a go, you won't be disappointed.
