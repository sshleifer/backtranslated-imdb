Hotel Du Nord is a gripping drama of guilt feelings in which Marcel Carne portrays an entertaining tale of bad love that also acts as a revolt against the cruel world. The film is entirely based on a few fearless enthusiasts. Pierre and Ren√© were wrong when they believed suicide would end their misery. The hotel Du Nord has its own indescribable charm as its residents have become an essential part of the business. There is an element of unity as everyone at Hotel Du Nord swims to eat, chat etc.Marcel Carne has remained true to the spirit of the films produced in the 30's and 40's, since Hotel Du Nord is a kind of nostalgic felt. Carne, while recreating the life of the Parisian roads, could provide a kind of nostalgia for black and white, a unique genre of poetic realism to his oeuvre. Hotel Du Nord can be called a creature of cinematographic populism. The July 14th balloon scene on the banks of the St. Martin Canal remains a beautiful series. The film's im popularity can be judged by the fact that Hotel Du Nord has been declared a national monument.
