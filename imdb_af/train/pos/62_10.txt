I absolutely loved this movie. I bought it as soon as I could get a copy of it. This movie had so much emotion, and I really felt, I could be very sympathetic to the characters. Every time I see it, the end makes me cry. I can really identify with Busy Phillip's character, and how I would feel if the same thing happened to me. <br /> <br /> I think all high schools should show this movie, maybe it will keep people doing the same thing. I recommend this movie to everyone and anyone. Especially those affected by any school shooting. <br /> <br /> It's really one of the best movies of all time.
