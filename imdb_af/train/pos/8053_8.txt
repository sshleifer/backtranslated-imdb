It's from Sammo's big early comedy movies. It's not a parody to enter the dragon, the main character (Sammo) is obsessed with Bruce Lee and emulates him freakishly well for a man of his size. Nominal story of how his battles cause his loved ones trouble - then fight. Oh, the battles. Good, fast-paced high-impact plays (the white man playing a boxer seems to be really hurt by one of Sammo's kicks). <br /> <br /> The funniest part of this movie was purely unintentional. There is a Jim Kelly search engine (one of three experts appointed to take out Sammo), but he was a black black Chinese man with an aphrodisiac. Come on, did they not have any real black people in Hong Kong in 1978? Well, I think I've seen enough white fake as well as hell Chinese people in old American movies. <br /> <br /> It's one for any Sammo or Bruce Lee fan.
