In fact, this is one of those movies that you should give 7.5. The fact is; As already mentioned, it's great fun. Wonderful atmospheres. Askey gets over the top, but it's a good vehicle for him, just like O, Mr Porter is for Will hay. If you like old dark house movies and trains then it's definitely for you. <br /> <br /> Oddly, it's the kind of movie you want to see again and again. It is friendly and atmospheric in an impressive way with all the nostalgic references that made great war periods. The 'strange' band characters just play off as they do in many other British British war movies. It would have been great to see this movie recorded by Ealing studios. A real pity that the 1931 original didn't quite survive
