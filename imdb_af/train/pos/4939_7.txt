This movie is not good, but it is a good and pleasant one. It feels like an indie movie made from a acting. Morgan Freeman basically plays himself, although the director is swinging, the writing is not written to him. And there is the little irony of the actor who goes into a supermarket to do research for a movie he is not yet connected to. I mean, he actually made the movie and we look at it. <br /> <br /> I found the dialogue a little too positive for my taste, yet refreshing. It's a movie that inspires the viewer to look at their own lives and choose the direction. A little too much emphasis on appearance, if you ask me. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: A nice little movie made in two weeks, with basically two actors and a few extras, dialogue driven, makes Morgan Freeman. good :)
