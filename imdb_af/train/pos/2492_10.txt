It's one of the funniest shows I've ever seen. It is really refreshing to watch and I was often stitched. I think there is also a social awareness factor that makes it interesting. If they were white girls would they get the same reaction? Maybe they would do it? The characters don't know any boundaries (see my lyrics) and don't exclude anyone from their distorted sense of fun! There are so many funny sketches. my favorites are the bob the builder one. it's so stupid it's genius. If you like a twisted black comedy then it's for you. if you like to quit, it's probably not.3 Not blonde is another hilarious BBC BBC comedy! It's such a funny show and the characters released on the unsuspecting public are very funny! It would be impossible to keep a straight face and look at the crazy characters and the reaction of the public! This range easily adds to the excellent comedies produced!
