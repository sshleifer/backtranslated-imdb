The world of Dragon Hunters is a 3D gravity-challenged world. Plans, pieces of buildings and strange flat plants float in the atmosphere while the soil falls for most characters, is nowhere to be seen. It's a world reminiscent of Neverending Story, when Nothing got away from the world. <br /> <br /> Oddly enough, the villain here is also the World Gobbler. This time it is a big skeleton dragon with fiery eyes. The heroes are a large but taciturn warrior, an annoying and greedy sidekick who manages the entrepreneurial side of the duo and a strange, useless animal. They are linked by the most talkative girl in the world who, to my mind, has not died a terrible painful and hopefully early death. <br /> <br /> The animation is great. The voices and sounds are on top of that. Sorry, the story is as simple as you can imagine. They're going to stop the World Gobbler, they reach him almost immediately, they beat him. The end. No real character development or storylines. Not even the one I would expect from such a plot. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: It's a nice thing to watch, kids will probably enjoy it, but it's about it. No depth to this world (pun intended).
