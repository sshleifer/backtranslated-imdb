Four words explain why this film was made - "She Done Him Wrong". The great commercial success of the Mae West vehicle convinced the studio buyer that Gay's 90's melodramas were a viable proposition. Here we are rewarded with a fast-moving, well-written skirt that neatly targets the personalities of its star. <br /> <br /> Wallace Beery and George Raft are excellent as friendly competitors; Jackie Cooper is a bit harder to take, but it is Fay Wray who steals the movie with her stock-in-trade daughter in distress. With a strong director, as Walsh proves he is, Wray can carry a lot of punch, and she is totally credible as the object of Raft and Beery's love. <br /> <br /> A great atmosphere, beautifully designed, is a forgotten movie worthy of revival.
