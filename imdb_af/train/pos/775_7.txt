It's a strange but somehow impressive story about love. Personally, I never run such a twist story in real life. But I can have an image there. <br /> <br /> This is a story that promises to be "sick". But after I looked at it, I didn't get this feeling of "sickness" that I surely would have regarding societal rules. It is something beautiful in this movie ... something impressive ... I can't contradict the use of moral or community rules. <br /> <br /> The film focuses mainly on the relationship between Kiki and Alex. You can see how this relationship begins, develops and eventually ends. You feel the moment when this love blooms, the first whisper, touches. You feel the connection. And no moment, I'm immoral immoral. You even hope it won't break in the end .... it can't break ... it's not right. You feel the pain of the fact that hearts are finally broken. <br /> <br /> But I also need to add a negative spin to this comment ... I don't know if the story isn't somehow * showed * to give the feeling that these relationships are sick only in form, but not in content. You don't have the whole story, but only fragments. When the film started, the relationship between Kiki and Sandu was already in place. So, no idea about the nature of the relationship. You just feel a tension between them ... a battle between the need for love and the desire to break this relationship. I think this line from Kiki to Sandu says everyone: "I want to stop ... and if you love me, you'll do as I ask you." <br /> <br /> This movie will probably guess questions about what is love and what is moral ... and where is the boundary between them. I do not know if the idea of ​​this movie is "love conquers everything ... even social and moral standards" or "love is beautiful ... no matter how or true". But in my opinion, this movie is already a success for the simple reason it makes you think ...
