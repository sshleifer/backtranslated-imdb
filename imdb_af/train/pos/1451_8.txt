I saw this movie about 6 times. And every time I see it, I'm more impressed by the story and the play. It's like watching a train wreck run. Its subtle in its approach, but very effective in achieving its purpose. <br /> <br /> Spoilers-> In the middle of the story is a very nice digotomy. On the one hand, our deputy Eddy Calhoun (Cusack) unknowingly tore at the old boys' network that is at the heart of New York's administration's head, and on the other hand, we have the mobb boss Zappati who deliberately tries to stand the to maintain. needed by all means. This situation ends in the end when Zappati Alselmo orders to make him easy by murdering himself and Calhoun ordering Pappas to do the same, politically speaking. <br /> <br /> The movie also features some fantastic one-liners like (a personal weakness of mine): - You don't take one's life in one moment. The only thing new in this world is the history you do not know. <br /> <br /> All in all, a great movie earning a much higher rating.
