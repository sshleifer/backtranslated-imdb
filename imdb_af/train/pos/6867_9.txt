I was born in 1982. Most of my childhood memories are in the late 80's and 90's. I watched the Groove Tube for the first time in 2001, when I was 19. <br /> <br /> And I hilarious. <br /> <br /> For anyone who thinks something can be "dated" It's pretty funny 30 years later .... think again! It's funny, even if you have no idea how the 70's were, and the thought of the bell-bottom pants makes you crazy. Who can argue with a Bozo the Clown type that reads adult literature? There is a lot to laugh about. The endless scrotal puppetry is the best.
