I'm a big John Denver fan. I have a huge collection of his music on vinyl. I saw this Christmas especially when it was originally on TV and loved it. I have the original vinyl album and CD. I released the original CD and later released. However, the later version lacks several songs. I see it released with all original songs this year. To my surprise, I offered the original CD for sale at $ 75.00. WOW - to think that a Christmas CD will be worth so much. For me, no amount is worth selling this treasure. This is my favorite Christmas CD. I've never found it on VHS or DVD. I'd like any version. If anyone has one, please let me know. Thank you
