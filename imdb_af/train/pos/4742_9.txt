This movie features more action for opening credits than all Hollywood movies of this kind. This film is produced by Tsui Hark and stars Jet Li. This team has brought you many worthy Hong Kong movie productions, including the Once Upon A Time in China Series. The action was quick and furious with wonderful wire work. I just saw the wires in two shots. Apart from the action, the story itself was strong and not just used as a filler. To find any other action movies to oppose, look for a Hong Kong cinema in your area. They are really worth checking out and usually should never disappoint.
