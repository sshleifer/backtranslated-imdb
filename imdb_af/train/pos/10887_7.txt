A horror movie is being shot and things are not going well. It's about a masked killer. The director tells the killer before the throw and crew. He is crazy and kills two people. He killed himself and the film was never finished. Twelve years later a lot of film students decide to try it - but there is a curse. People who try to complete it are killed themselves. The students ignore it. Guess what happens next? <br /> <br /> The plot is an old hat, but it's not bad ... for what it is (a low budget treasure movie). It is well done with a young and fairly talented young role. Nobody is wonderful, but nobody is terrible either. It also avoids the mandatory (and unnecessary) female naaktonel. It moves fast, the gore is nice and bloody, and the writing insults your intelligence. Molly Ringwald is also playing the time of her life with a bitchy blurred actress. <br /> <br /> No big shake, but not bad at all. I give it a 7.
