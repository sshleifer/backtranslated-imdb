Updated version of a story that was changed in England in 1938 (Crossing's return), regarding police action by a master criminal known as the frog due to the frog ascending (bending eyes, etc.). ) What he wears. <br /> <br /> One of the good Wallace films from the 1960s is a solid little entertainment. Clearly influenced by (or had this influence) the restart of the Dr Mabuse films, the Frog seems to be more than a master thief. Although it's not the best of the Wallace movies, it's worth it. It would make an interesting double feature with the excellent previous movie. <br /> <br /> Between 6 and 7 out of 10.
