Sometimes I get tired of reading reviews of some of Hitchcock's lesser-known films, because almost every one starts with someone who says this movie is seriously overlooked or it's a hidden Hitchcock jewel or a real Hitchcock big or another generic as - people - would - look - it - they - would - see - it - it - is - a - big - Hitchcock - movie - just - like - many - if - Vertigo - North door - North West - Psycho - even. That being said, I just want to say that if - just - people - would - look - it - they - want - see - it - is - a - big - Hitchcock - movie - just - as - Many - like - Vertigo - North West - North West - Psycho - Rear - Window - etc. <br /> <br /> Now, it may be a bit overshadowed, The Ring isn't mentioned twice by any imagination of the imagination in the same league as any of those films, but compared to the other movies that Hitchcock made in the late 1920s and early 1930s, I really think tha t The Ring is one of the best photographed and performed films of most everyone. As a brand new director, there are some amazing dream series and brilliant segments of editing that show why Hitchcock received so much attention so early in his career. <br /> <br /> Allowed, the movie begins with, among other things, the most disturbing spectacle of an idiot circus artist (and I use idiot in the definite way, as Stephen King does so often) with eggs and fruits thrown on him by a crowd of not the nicest white people. I suppose it just illustrates how incredibly different such circuses and people were, but I think this is one of the most relentless sequences in any Hitchcock movie I've seen. <br /> <br /> The main attraction at The Circus is a fighter claiming to be able to beat in one lap, but when he meets his match, it is against a man who is not alone in his boxing ring challenge, but also in the ring around his wife's finger. So start an entertaining, or not very tense challenge for the love of one woman, who seems effortless and ungrateful from one man to another. <br /> <br /> (spoilers) For example, there is a scene where Her husband looks at her from the top because she is dropped off at home late in the morning and just before she enters the building she returns to a kiss. the car. This kiss is never explained, and there is also the fact that even in the end when she is faithful to her husband or at least eventually chooses, they look in each other's eyes but do not actually kiss. <br /> <br /> The movie is definitely beautifully photographed, even more so than several films released by Hitch in subsequent years. There is also a performance by Gordon Harker as One Round Jack's coach, who expresses his rock expression, often reminds me of the brilliant Buster Keaton. Hitch makes it a bit ambiguous, but this is a good example of his early work.
