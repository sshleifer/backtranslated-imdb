The 60's is a well-balanced mini series between historical facts and a good plot. In four deliveries we follow a North American family, with 3 members. But we don't just see them. We also follow the story of several characters as a black dominee, an extremist student leader and a soldier in Vietnam. The filmography is just extraordinary. In the first chapters we see a few shots of the Vietnam War, between the scenes. The next chapter does not start where the last one is finished, it starts a little later, and gives us a little secret about what happened. Generally, the mini-series of the 60's is a must see, not just for hippies fanatics, but for everyone with little curiosity about the subject.
