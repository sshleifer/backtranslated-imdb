I will not claim a fan of Ralph Bakshi because I am not. So far I have only watched 5 of his animated films: Coonskin, wizards, Fritz the Cat and Lord of the Rings and finally "Fire and Ice". What I can claim is that I found "Fire and Ice" to be most enjoyable. This is a straight fantasy tale of swords and sorcery, according to Conan the Barbarian, but the beautiful artwork, realistic animation and vibrant movie score effectively gives a very classic charm to this movie. <br /> <br /> Earning first alert is the animation itself. I don't care what people say about rotoscope, but I think Ralph Bakshi used the technique very effectively here. I was amazed at how realistic the characters were. The style of directing and the photo-realistic character designs made by "Fire and Ice" feel more like a big budget fantasy blocker than a cartoon. Unfortunately, the level of art detail tends to be a bit contradictory, especially near the end of the movie. Some scenes just look straight with little to no body contour details or fabric folds and shadows on the characters. <br /> <br /> With realistic moving characters, realistic action will naturally follow. Not only was the action well choreographed, but it was really brutal. I would be so brave to compare the brutality of the action to live action movies like Zack Snyder's 300. However, I noticed that although there was blood shed, the blood splashes were kept to a minimum. Again, a good choice by the creative team that only increases the show experience by not using things over the top. <br /> <br /> Although I do not recognize a "big name" in the film, the voice actors succeed in delivering a satisfactory performance; Keep delivering each line realistically and keep it just in case of the bad guys. <br /> <br /> Did I say bad guys? Yes I did. Because that's exactly what the story is about, a standard good vs evil story. Nothing really original about the story that seems to be just a mix of pre-existing fantasy movie cliches that involves clothes dressed warriors and girls. Anyone looking for the depth will be very disappointed. The characters are not much developed, and some of them like Nekron and Darkwolf are at their best one dimensional (however, I have heard rumors of some distant scenes explaining that Darkwolf's obsession with Nekron and his mother killed. Scenes like that earn full recovery and should have included in the final cut to add a depth of the show). In fact, I won't be surprised to find out that the whole movie was just a "tech demo" of all kinds to portray the wonderful animation and art. The story threw together and threw in as an afterthought to give it off as a real "movie". <br /> <br /> A true classic of an earlier era, "Fire and Ice", really captures the immense spirit of adventure and mysticism with its beautiful versions of fantastic creatures and charming characters. It's a unique vision of a world created by Ralph Bakshi and artist Frank Frazetta with a great deal of action and excitement. <br /> <br /> Will it stick to animated movie standards today? Definitely not. But I request animation fans in general to get rid of your high horse and give this simple yet beautiful movie a chance to grow on you. It's really a jewel of the 80's that is worth checking out.
