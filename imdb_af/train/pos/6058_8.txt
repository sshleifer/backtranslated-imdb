It is a well-made documentary on the exciting world of Indy Car racing. Photography is simply outstanding. The scene was Mario Andretti driving the old racing roadster along the New England street which is incredible with the old maple blown by the speed of the car. The movie does not lose some of its beauty on the small screen, but if you want to look at cars that drive to their limit, you should see this movie.
