When I saw the dentist, I thought it was very cool. But this movie is not for everyone, especially people who do not like greedy scenes, as the dentist has many greedy scenes. That's why it has the R18 rating. It's about a Beverly Hills dentist Dr. Alan Feinstone, who finds his wife Brooke with him on the police. It is best to go to your dentist "before" you look at it. But if you do not like to go to the dentist then it is best not to see it, as you might be sitting down for life. The dentist has the best bloody revenge in what I've ever seen. Who ever saw a movie that a dentist (Spoiler) pulled out his aunt's teeth and cut her tongue without anesthesia? Overall wonderful movie, but not for everyone.
