The Sopranos stand out as an airtight, dynamic exploration of American life, and how the American experience is formed and defined by money. By setting the story in the vicinity of the underworld, David Chase eliminates all obstacles to a grunt, low ground, and a thorough deconstruction of the postmodern era. <br /> <br /> Each character represents a facet of the US industry. Tony Soprano illustrates the beleaguered solid work, torn between family duty and a need to keep his "business" on the sidelines. The convergence of these two things is the need to move the story forward. The characters of Christopher, Paulie, and Bobby reflect the loyal - but self-serving interdependent in every business, relying on necessity rather than merit. With the character of Ralph, Joe Pantoliano writes a brilliant interpretation of the charismatic psychopath, a twisted businessman who thrives on violence, is tragically generated by his beautiful treaty. And Dominic Chianese is the ultimate symbol of the obsolete old age, which retains power through established relationships and the necessity of the pages. <br /> <br /> Although oblique and occasionally disturbing, Sopranos has earned its place as the ultimate TV drama. <br /> <br /> PS A good companion for Chase's series is The Shield, another violent drama that makes the best characters interesting.
