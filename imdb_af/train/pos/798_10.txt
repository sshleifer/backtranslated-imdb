This excellent drama has kept me busy all the time. I can't look away from the screen one second because every word keeps the pieces to this mysterious murder. This movie really touched me because it showed how sad and difficult life can be. I actually cried (which I don't want to give away!) It also makes me realize how cruel and sick people can be when it comes to murder. <br /> <br /> The cast was also very good. The only bad player was the actress Anne Marie played. The actress did a good job, but the director didn't. I say this because he found someone who didn't look a bit like Anne Marie Fahey herself.
