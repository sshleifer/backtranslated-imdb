if you are like me, you'll love this great teenage teen movie. I think it is there with mischief / book of love / high school USA / screaming / calendar girl / crybaby / all the big movies in the late 50's & early 60's and it has a wonderful soundtrack.not as many songs as in some of these type of movies, but still great.it is so much funny at times and has a great love interest. all the young cast is great.i wish there was more kind of this wonderful movies.my favorite movie of all time is back to the future when Marty mcfly casts back until 1955 good in these wonderful movies it stays in the fab 50s (early 60s ) There are some movies of this kind better than that but not many.
