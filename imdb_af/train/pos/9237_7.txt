This movie is pretty good. Half a year ago I bought it on DVD. But first I thought it was the original movie. I saw the series and it's a good movie, but here they put together The Living Legend, part1 and 2 and Fire in space. Same as they did with the first movie, but with other episodes. But it's still a good movie. Only the end is strange (you don't see what happens to the Pegasus). But I still think it's pretty good. The actors and special effects were good. If you haven't seen it, it'll see. With: Richard Hatch, Dirk Benedict, Lorne Greene, Herb. Jefferson Jr., Tony Swartz, Terry Carter, Lloyd Bridges, Jack Stauffer.
