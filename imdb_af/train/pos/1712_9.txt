This movie was a disaster at Box Office, and the reason for that is the innocence of the movie, the sweetness of the story. Music was good, story is very simple and old, but presenting such a story is very good, the director tried his best. Abhay is excellent and impressive and he shines in his role, he has done his best in comedy or in emotional scene. Soha looks so sweet in the movie. Rubbish was simply okay. Music and all songs are good, Himesh is impressive as a singer here. Don't miss this movie, it's a great movie and a good one for us. Abhay's best work to date. I will give 9/10 to Ahista Ahista.
