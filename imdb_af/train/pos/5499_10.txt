I had no idea of ​​the facts that this film offers. While I remembered this situation, I accepted the information presented in the media: a confused event around a dubious personality: Mr. Chavez. The film is a revelation of many realities, I wonder if something of this caliber was ever made. I thought the chief was Mr.Chavez, but everyone came in the photo <br /> <br /> and in the end the reality of that entelechy was: the people were overwhelming. Thank you Kim Bartley and Donnacha O'Briain. <br /> <br />
