This movie is wonderful. As it is often heard, it is indeed very realistic and sometimes brutal, but unlike other people, it is clear that it is not a depressed, negative or dismantling of Austria as a proto-fascist society. On the contrary, while in the DOG many very heavy scenes are present, some characters have to be called very bad people. At the same time, you look at love, beauty and humor in Ulrich Seidls movie. And that's exactly what DOGSTAGE sets me apart from other films that try to show the lives of the "ordinary people" in an intense, realistic way. their desire, their wishes, their dark sides: Seidl is never trying to prove that the lives of the working class are people! In my opinion, viewers who come to this conclusion seem very afraid to admit that almost no one's life is as clean and normal as we would like other people to believe. And that every life has its dark and often depressing sides. The most beautiful scene: The old Viennese man, watching his old girl dancing the eastern way, as he calls it. I think everyone who finds this scene ugly does not have a sense of beauty and has to ask themselves what it is, it is proto-fascist. The characters in DOGS or viewers, danced by the body of a 70+-year-old woman, dance to All her charm for her lover.
