I have to say though I despise these kind of performances, shocking, I'm a girl, I feel I have to express my opinion. I saw Dirty Sanchez before I saw Jackass and think it was Jackass in terms of program driving. Story lines and interviews are interwoven to create a more interesting display. The other night I saw a few minutes of Jackass movie and couldn't believe how bad it was. Everything just jumped in a line, after the joke with no connection between anything. It should have been the fastest easiest show ever to change a shocking amateur. While a hug is not really my thing, as far as a sizeable entertainment program, Dirty Sanchez is away from Jackass's league.
