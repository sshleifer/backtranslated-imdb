I'm amazed at IMDb's low rating of this movie. With all due respect, the low rating is representative of the IQ level of those who rated it so poorly. They would rather see a movie with cheap excitement, a bigger budget and more gore. <br /> <br /> The first misconception by humans is that it is a horror movie. It's not, and the movie doesn't fool you into believing it's one. It is a psychological thriller. It's for people who really want an intellectual experience when they watch a movie. Reel.com's review is the perfect example of how I feel about this movie. All the other negative reviews don't make much sense. It's almost like trying to make an original movie for a change - very rare these days - is something bad and not worth it. <br /> <br /> I'll reveal some spoilers to the morons who said it was boring and didn't make sense. Martha was reincarnated and did experiments on herself to be a caring mother while she was truly an evil Nazi who would kill without warning. The evidence is all in the pudding and the fact that we sympathize with the first visit with this cold-blooded monster for the duration of the movie is proof of the film's direction and writing. <br /> <br /> I definitely feel that this movie should be original at least in the 6's series. I recommend this movie to the people on the other side of the IQ scale - aka smart people - as this movie is of course beaten by those who would rather watch Skream or Freddy's Nightmare. <br /> <br /> Kudos to the acting too. For such a low budget movie, you are surprised that this movie did not hit your local cinema with the good direction, writing and acting. Please do not be deceived by the rating by IMDb. This movie is worth it. Actually, I recommend buying the movie, as a first rental rental will not do this justice.
