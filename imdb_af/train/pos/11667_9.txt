The secret of Kells is a movie that I have been waiting for years after seeing some early recordings at the Cartoon Saloon in Kilkenny. I'm here to tell you, it's worth the wait. The cartoons are heavily stylized, but not annoying as I feared. The whole film is a thing of beauty and great imagination. I especially like the animated enlightened book where the little figures on the page come to life. The characterization is wonderful, I love Brendan Gleeson's voice as the back Abbot and I especially like the voice of the spree Aisling. The forest is a triumph, such a beautiful place. The story is well-known, a mixture of facts and fantasy. and really draws the viewer to cherish Brendan in his quest for the perfect material for the book. Anyway, I am a fan of calligraphy and enlightenment, so the subject is near my heart, but all the people I know who have seen it and are not fans of the vessel agree that it is a beautiful little movie is. I will definitely buy the DVD if it is released, and would like to say, well done Cartoon Saloon and all the people involved in this mammoth project. May there be many more. :) Come back here to say that I bought several copies of the DVD as soon as I could and released them on Christmas, everyone loves it! And I wish them all the luck in the world at the Oscars, such a joy to see this nominee.
