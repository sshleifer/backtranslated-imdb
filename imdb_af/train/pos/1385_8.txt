I saw it at Cinema MK2 Hautefeuille just one night after his first public projection in Paris. A very nice movie about three 15-year-old teenagers, all just about the same psychological stages. Many of the scenes allow us to come back to our adolescence and our first feelings about sexual relationships. It is possible to imagine that the director wants to reduce the first strong sensual feelings of the girls on lesbianism, but even in that case, she does not disturb the likelihood of the story. You can sometimes find the film a bit slow, but that's what creates this intimate atmosphere. I finance the young actresses of talent, special mention with Floriane and Marie, very convincing. There are many small details, but this movie also enabled me to discover what synchronized swimming is: impressive!
