This movie is such a moving, wonderful piece of work. I saw it at the theater when it came out, but I was only 13 and didn't really get it "... I saw it again when I was 20 (on the video of course and I own it now) blow. Steven Spielberg has created a wonderful movie that keeps you from beginning to end. I also read the book, but there's just something about the movie that really brings it to life. the decisive, acting, music, costumes, scenery, everything, it's just wonderful. you laugh, you cry, you courage ... it brings out every imaginable emotion. This is one of his best works and should not be missed!
