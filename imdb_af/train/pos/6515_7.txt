I almost didn't rent it because of all the bad comments, but anyways.I thought it was similar to the dark fall I also wanted. The only part I hated about the dental ferry was the 2 red neck brothers at the petrol station. They were funny and the dialogue made me laugh, but it wasn't a comedy. It ruined the movie a bit for me because it was unnecessary. The rest of the movie was the way a horror or suspense movie should be. The make-up was good and I've seen worse movies than that. It was a simple story with credible acting. It's not the scariest or goriest movie, but I'm not disapproved or want a refund after watching it. On the DVD there were previews of other movies that all look good and I'm going to look it up.
