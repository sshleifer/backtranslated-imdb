I wasn't really a big fan of Star Trek until past 2-3 years. Thanks to the advent of Netflix and the distribution of video technology after 2000, I can launch the main Star Trek episodes. For those who don't really watch every episode and know them heartily, through TNG, DS9, Voyager, etc., common popular consensus will say, "I love the next generation" the best. That's because Captain Picard and his crew were fresh when they first appeared after decades of Star Trek starvation. But to be honest, I appreciate the creativity of Voyager's episodes more than TNG. Voyager's episodes also progress through time as opposed to TNG. TNG assigned data is good, but eventually it gets old, but Voyager's doctor - now it's creativity! Instead of making artificial intelligence uncomfortable and rough, it gives him the freedom to express beyond all that you have imagined. Not only is Picardo such a good actor, but the premise for his extensive, self-expanding, doctor, self-realization now is science fiction at its best! Endgame portrays him as a man married to an organic, inventive neuro-implant transceiver for human-machine interface, and even - in the episode before Endgame - to obey the captain's command and make human errors. Unlike DS9, which is blessed with 2 beautiful women from 1 episode, Voyager 3 seasons without Jeri Ryan must survive and I believe it is Picardo who wore his personality. Of course, the rest of the Voyager's casting chemistry flows effortlessly, Harry Kim and Tom Paris, of course. I love Tuvoc, sometimes humor, though I am a Vulcan. Finally, I'm so glad they got rid of the original female captain - oh, if you see the scanty footage, thank God for Kate! Throughout the 7 years, she has developed into an extremely confident, credible and respectful female captain. What a great job! Thank you Star Trek for making Voyager, I enjoy every episode, the creative exploration of possibilities, morality and our cosmic expanse.
