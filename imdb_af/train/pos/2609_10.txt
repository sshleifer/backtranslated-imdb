I'm writing this 9 years after the final episode is broadcast and I'm still having Wildside's impact on me. <br /> <br /> It went effectively where many other cop plays went and succeeded. But this took it further and did not go down from the realism of the streets, which often portray live events and characters to T. <br /> <br /> I miss this series a lot, instead we have the stupid "Underbelly", which dramatized and acted, created a whole load of American-esquire garbage. <br /> <br /> Wildside has remained true to Sydney's uniqueness, so I'm really guilty of this amazing series. The acting was A-grade and it is a pity to see that only a few actors promoted their career, while others faded into darkness. <br /> <br /> I don't want Australia to forget this wonderful piece of their television history. Therefore, I ask the ABC to release the full range on DVD, not the first three. Give this series the end it deserves.
