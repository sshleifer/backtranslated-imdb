A bus full of passengers stuck during a snowstorm. The police closed the bridge and said it was unsafe and they sat in a small cafe until the road was cleared. But after a while they were bored, as one of the passengers didn't seem to be on the bus and might just be a stranger !! This leads to a conclusion that is ironic, but also quite funny in a low-brow way. <br /> <br /> This is yet another fun episode of The Twilight Zone. Instead of the typical twists or social comments, this one has no lasting message. However, it is also much and viewable, so who cares? Exactly what happens, you just need to see for yourself. <br /> <br /> By the way, this one star John Hoyt - a face most of you will recognize from many old TV shows and movies. In almost every case he played a real grouch (like Charles Lane in the same era), but boy I loved to see him - as he made the coarse person perfect and at the same time was funny.
