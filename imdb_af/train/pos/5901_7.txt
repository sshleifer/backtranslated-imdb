It's a repeat of many recent movies, but only one has fewer stars, fewer complications and a more fuzzy feel. Abhay and Ritika (played by Fardeen Khan and Esha Deol respectively) meet at a friend's wedding where their own marriage (unknown to them) begins with the arrangement of their process. Within a time, the two strangers are married and sent to a honeymoon camp where they meet other couples who go through the movements similar to theirs. Since their time is spent together, secrets are revealed, hearts broken and / or manifested and love flowers. <br /> <br /> If you've seen Honeymoon Private Limited and / or Salaam-e-Ishq, you've seen this movie. The plot twist is the same, there is not a single surprise in the whole two and a half hours of the movie. Everything is predictable. I just enjoyed it because I saw 'Darling' (also the main roles of Deol & Khan) and enjoyed their chemistry earlier in the day. That's why I said, "Why not" when my sister suggested, we also rent "Just married." <br /> <br /> See it: Because Kirron Kher is co-star and her usual darling is in it. <br /> <br /> Skip it: Because you've had enough of all this couple's nonsense! <br /> <br /> C +
