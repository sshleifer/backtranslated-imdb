"Before the devil knows you're dead" is one of the best movies I've seen in a <br /> <br />. The performance of <br /> <br /> the excellent ensemble cast is incredible. Philip Seymour Hoffman puts in an excellent performance and every time he is on the screen electrifies. Ethan Hawke suits him at the scene and Albert Finney just walks up the screen. Marisa Tomei, however, is <br /> <br /> criminally underutilized, but looks great for her 42 years. The writing is excellent, the story line non-linear, but easy enough to follow. Sidney Lumet, although not known for his blockbusters, showed a jewel with this one!
