Have seen it on the Sundance Channel several times, and got a good movie on the system. A Semi-Surrealistic but tough rand takes on the modern media culture (or lack thereof) and focuses on some seriously shaky, past-the-Hollywood French people. It has an amusing early performance by Mark Ruffalo, and some memorable DP cinematography done by the Polish Brothers movies. There was a brutal humorous humor and a strange original feeling that definitely set it apart. This film has written cult classic all over it, and I'm surprised it's not yet on DVD. <br /> <br /> Hopefully soon.
