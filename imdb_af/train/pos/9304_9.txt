This movie is great. Simple. It's hard to find a comedy with levels, and that's a bloody good example. When I first saw this movie, when the credit rolled, a friend and I looked at each other and asked ... "just caught it?" For the doubters, look at the levels. See the comparisons between Vick and the people in the club, the DNA! Look at the different characters, each standing for position, and seeing nothing else, sees the connection between Vick's healing and the way through the movie. That's all in Vick's head! The opening line about Vick's world. The closing ring with the camera goes into Vick's head, and inside, a whole universe! Carefully quoting, wonderful cartoon gangs, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful!
