I can't believe I just see this movie. I think maybe I thought it was another movie about slaves being abused, and I avoided the same reason for Roots - just as I still have to see Schindler's list - I don't want to be "entertained" by other people's pain, No matter how authentic or insightful it is supposed to be. <br /> <br /> So I think the most important thing I noticed about The Color Purple was It's not about black people being abused by whites. The black people were completely capable of raping their own daughters - or giving them away to be treated as "slaves" by their "men". It was painful to watch, but everyone finally delivered himself, and the acting was phenomenal! I couldn't believe the character played Oprah at age 35! And I worship Whoopi to start with - she was wonderful. I'm so glad I had a horrible feeling yesterday afternoon and Showtime was The Color Purple.
