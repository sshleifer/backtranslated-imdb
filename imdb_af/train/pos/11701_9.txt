It's a great movie for all Generation X's. What a different world the United States of 1972 compared to our psychotic 21st century. You might get a sense of how a 1972 America went, was like watching this movie. I found that the clothes and the styles brought me back to good memories of a much better country than we now have. Just think ... there were only 4 or 5 TV stations to choose from. There were no AIDS, Muslim terrorists, Road Rage, 911, Bird Flu, Highway Snipers, etc., etc. The Vietnam War was just over. There will be another 7 years before Star Wars comes out. The personal computer and the internet will be another 29 years. <br /> <br /> When this movie came out for the first time, the producers had to market the film themselves because no other movie company wanted it. So it started to show small Protestant churches across the country shown on film projectors (that was the days before VCRS of course). The minister of a church who would be interested in showing a thief in the NG for his congregation would receive a copy of the film. Afterwards he set out to show it in church or lunch. Members of the congregation will invite "unsaved" friends and family members and this will be a social event of the week. <br /> <br /> If you get past the limited production values ​​of the movie and just look for its nostalgic value, then I think you'll enjoy the movie more. Of course I speak as a generator. <br /> <br /> If I had a time machine, I would go back to 1972 and give goodbye to the 21st century cesspool we now have.
