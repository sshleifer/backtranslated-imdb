Just ready to watch this movie for maybe the 7th or 8th time, it once looked at Blockbuster one night and loved it absolutely. I have shown it to 4 people so far and they also enjoyed it. Avoid all the Hollywood glamor, special effects and stress on the "shock factor". This independent film by Paul F. Ryan hits the nail on the head to deal with the adverse effects of traumatic situations. Two characters Alicia (Busy Philipps) and Deanna (Erika Christensen) form an unlikely band. Alicia, the stone-hearted girl, the Goth who has a pessimistic attitude towards life, helps Deanna overcome the problems of life and death and live in the aftermath. Meanwhile, Deanna is trying to help Alicia see the softness and light of the world again. Not emphasized on the shocking event of the shooting, but on the interpersonal relationships among those who survived, this movie is set apart. Despite its low budget and short filming time, this movie is far from cheese. Ryan pays tribute to a situation he has never endured and attempts to immerse in the human psyche. Featuring an incredibly exciting actress, Philipps, adding the necessary drama to the dialogue helps the overall feel for the movie and Christensen to balance the "punishment and gloom" that this movie may have. Overall, I recommend this movie and if you enjoy the subject of school aggression and violence and learn more about it, I also suggest that the documentary "It's a Girls World" issued by the CBC in 2004 is about the subject to social harassment, comparing and contrasting two groups of girls one in Montreal, Quebec and the other in Victoria, British Columbia, the group of friends and acquaintances of Dawn Marie Wellesley, a 14-year-old girl who killed her after being brutally plundered .
