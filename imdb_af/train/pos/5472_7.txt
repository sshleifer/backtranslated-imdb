Barbara Stanwyck as a really hard cookie, a waitress to the working class (and prostitute in the hands of her father) who escapes to New York City and uses her female will to get a filing ticket, to Mortgage and Escrow and later on assistant secretary to the second in charge of the bank. Dramatic study of a female character who is indifferent to being relentless has not lost its strength over the years. Barbara acted as a storm (depicting a first-rate actress herself). Placed with a little Niezschean philosophy in her devastating life, this lady shatters the sentiment, but she never loses our captivity. She is a simple, hard-boiled broad, but she is not a bitch, and she is not a man-eater or a woman-hater. This gall is all to herself and if we wait for her to finally learn about real values ​​in life, her journey on and off of learning success offers a hot, sexy entertainment. John Wayne (with thick black hair and too much eye makeup) does well in an early role as assistant in the file office, although all the supporting players are pretty good. *** of ****
