Don't expect a "truth" portrayal. However, the accounts of these veterans of the Iraqi and Afghanistan wars require careful consideration. <br /> <br /> The main force of the film is that it depicts the words and war wounds of these veterinarians and their post-war struggle to reconstruct some of their normality and functionality in their lives. <br /> <br /> My big criticism of the movie is twofold: it is one-sided and calls for anti-war activism, but nothing more to correct the serious shortcomings of the military and veterans affairs programs for those who " I suffered and the traumas of war still suffer.

These veterinarians describe the physical and mental pain and pain that most veterans experience and understand ordinary people, because the horrors of ALL wars are so traumatic and disturbing.
