I found the FBI story considerably entertaining and appropriately optimistic for my New Year's holiday viewing. His drama and action-packed episodes were exciting. The Hardesty character was well drawn and admirable. Overall, photography, writing and direction are completely credible. Rather than regard the film as a repulsive propaganda, I enjoyed it as a well-mounted depiction of the need for ingenious thoughts and brave bodies in the fight against crime. Again, the portrayal of a family who was even under the tension of the man's dedication to his (probably) important work, I did not find it to be a two representation but an ideal and exemplary one.
