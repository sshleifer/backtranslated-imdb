I read the book in 5th grade and now I have seen the film a few years later. There are a few differences: <br /> <br /> 1.Billy was oringinally supposed to eat 15 worms over 15 days, and not 10 worms in one day at 19:00. <br /> <br /> 2.Billy is supposed to get $ 30 after eating all the worms. In the movie after Billy's eating all the worms, Joe has to go to school with worms. <br /> <br /> 3. Joe is supposed to be some of the worms, but in the movie he is not at all. <br /> <br /> Although there are changes, this movie is another one that children will enjoy.
