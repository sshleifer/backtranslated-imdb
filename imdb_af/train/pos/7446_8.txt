I can't agree with any of the comments. The first time I saw the movie on a British TV channel, it was presented as an indie movie and if you take the film under this angle, I think it's a very different matter. I couldn't believe what I saw and got addicted right away. The plot can be as bad as a JS performance (ie there is no plot), but the play is evil, it's hilarious and it's all an incredible garbage movie. <br /> <br /> It says so much about America as a Bully or Ken Park without the drama perspective, but it gives a glimpse to American society, and more precisely to which afternoon TV viewers in America (and I believe there are many of them!) are interested. After all, it's the neighbors we're talking about, not us. <br /> <br /> 100% fun!
