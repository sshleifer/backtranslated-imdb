In my opinion, this is an absolutely romantic Disney masterpiece. If you ask me, the stepmother (Lucille La Verne's voice) was really deadly. You should see the movie if you want to know why. On the other hand, despite the fact that she did a lot of housekeeping, Cinderella (Ilene Stanley's voice) was a very beautiful woman. For me, the landscape was beautiful, the role play was well chosen, and the writing was strong. Before I upload it, I'd like to say that everyone involved in this movie did very well. Now, finally, I recommend this absolutely romantic Disney masterpiece to anyone who hasn't seen it. You're in a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend and watch it.
