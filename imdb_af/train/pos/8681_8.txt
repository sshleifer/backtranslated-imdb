This cartoon is short on plot but is a visually stunning piece of work. There will be many, very small spoilers: <br /> <br /> This short has a "story" that is incredibly small underground dwarfs, responsible for the return of spring every year, but has to contend with a winter not yet ready to withdraw. Both the gnomes and the storm have their own songs. This is pretty much the plot, as it is. But this cartoon is not about the plot - it's about color and animation. The visuals are exceptional. Back in 1936 such a bright color was something of a novelty and there is an incredible inspiration here. <br /> <br /> My favorite moments of the brief surround the movement of the liquid colors through pipes. At more than one point, there are a series of pipes in line, from the shortest to the highest, and the colors pass through the pipes and the musical track seems to be a pipe organ. <br /> <br /> The visual aspects of the struggle between the emerging green and the winter storm that refuse to remain silent are extremely well executed. These kinds of shorts were things that Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising are known for, but they also probably helped to lead their eventual departure from MGM, because this cartoon probably went over the budget and MGM eventually decided to better control the cost than the animation section is managed by someone, a little more aware of the cost than Harman and Ising. <br /> <br /> It's really a beautiful cartoon and is worth seeing. It is available on the DVD's' 30s Character Attack. Recommended, especially if you want good animation.
