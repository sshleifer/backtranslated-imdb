Henry Thomas was "great". His character kept my attention. I was so "in" the story I forgot it wasn't real. I wanted him to keep the baby and see how a special person he was. The other people in the story were essential in compiling his character. The way they tied together to help each other was truly awesome. I love movies that show the right side of human emotions without beating you, because you're not smart enough to figure out things for yourself.
