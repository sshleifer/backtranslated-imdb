When I got this movie in my local video streams, I expected it to be another American American vampire movie in the same vein of "The Lost Boys" (1987). To my surprise, "To The For" is a very good movie. It's a bit choppy at times, but still there are plenty of stylish pieces and surprises to satisfy vampire enthusiasts. It's a perfect blend of romance and horror and it's surprisingly gory at times.Highly recommended.
