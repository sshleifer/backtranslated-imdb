It's funny. This is not Arthur Miller or T.S. Elliot, but man, it's funny. Kline and Fields are wonderful. Kline enters the door to Teri Hatcher, who is also wonderful!) Robert Downey Jr. and Kathy Moriarty work flawlessly - to her. he finds out who she really is ... a soap opera turn if there was one! <br /> <br /> The scene near the end in the Chinese dining area had my kids and I threw on the floor - that scene alone is worth the rent. <br /> <br /> Do not solve any world problems or show the apparent underbelly of TV on the day (I hope). Just a lot of fun.
