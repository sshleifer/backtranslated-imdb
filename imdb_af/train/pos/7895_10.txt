In the opening styles of this movie, a man shot arrows through his hotel room in another man's bathroom and blew out all the lights. It had been very nice for 1936, but rather way out and had nothing to do with the movie. Robin Hood didn't see as far as I could see. But, Bette Davis (Daisey Appleby), "The Whales of August", 87 was very young and attractive and did one of her best roles in a long career in Hollywood. Daisey never stopped teasing or very sexy with her nightdresses and so-called swimsuit on her hunt with George Brent (Johnny Jones), The Spiral Staircase, '46. Daisey even suggested marriage to Johnny in a Ferris wheel upside down and even got a black eye. Davis and Brent made a big couple, one of whom is very rich and the other a very poor reporter. On stage, Davis and Brent were having a real urgent love affair. That is good reason why there were sparks when these two appeared in this movie. If you like Bette Davis and George Brent, this is the movie for you!
