<br /> <br /> If you like rap or hip-hop, watch this movie, though funny if you don't get the references, as a straight comedy. <br /> <br /> Not yet much of the promising CB4 has been seen, but what I have seen does not have the heart of this little storm. <br /> <br /> Not yet heard of those people who have been a surprise. The movie is very similar to Spinal Tap, which is not bad, and I think much of the dialogue, while priceless in Tap, is more funny here, probably because I am more into rap than rock theses. cloud indicating it. <br /> <br /> The rap songs are funny like hell, and it's basically the reference for most of the movie, but not everyone is in your face, meaning the physical comedy and the one-liners priority over the tasks. <br /> <br /> Great fun, one to watch twice if there was ever a movie.
