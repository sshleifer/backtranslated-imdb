How to start an ordinary day in Point Place, Wisconsin ... <br /> <br /> First, Red, the tyrannical father of the Forman family and a World War veteran, sits at the kitchen table and reads newspaper while serving his delighted wife, Kitty, breakfast. Then their skinny son, Eric, also comes to the table, and his father starts his daily scream, usually with the fact that he puts his foot in Eric's backyard. (Add reason here). When his in love, sister Laurie comes home, she comes along, then Reds cries out and shouts kindly with her, leaving Eric out of the family. <br /> <br /> Once this daily (painful) ritual is over, Eric rushes to his cellar, where all his friends are hanging out. And when we see it, it becomes clear that Eric and his redhead tomboy girlfriend, neighboring neighbor and childhood, Donna Pinciotti, are the cleanest people. Meet Steven Hyde, the conspiracy theorist who hates disco and doesn't really care about what's there, as long as it's not funny to watch; Michael Kelso, the kind of guy who thinks he will only get through his life through his body and that roots grow in trees; Jackie Burkhardt, the one who thinks of her as the most beautiful girl around, spoils a child of a rich father, and of course, a cheerleader; and Fez, a naive but exorbitant stranger who loves candy and can't keep a secret. Initially they just hang out, gossip and make Kelso fun, but then they all sit in a circle and start the right fun ... before they do anything, they'll regret it later. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Red goes out and meets Donna's strange parents, Bob and Midge. He's rude, but they don't mind because they think he's joking. Somewhere, Leo, an obsolete hippie, is constantly confused and makes word games without notice. <br /> <br /> Did you imagine the seemingly peaceful environment with all these wonderful characters? Of course, most "clichéd" looks, but the performance takes the cliché to a new level. Now throw some of the most bad story lines that a sitcom can offer, sit and enjoy one of the best TV shows ever. The one that never does the same thing twice and what is, compared to most "funny funny" sitcoms is hysterical. If you get addicted, don't let this show let you go. Bite on the hook over and over and, man, you will see the sitcom genre of a whole new prospective.
