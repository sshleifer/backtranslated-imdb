Hakhap (Black Mask) is what I would like to call a ballet with fists and explosions. Surely the plot has already been tried and heard. (A biologically manipulated soldier who is part of an elite fighting force of superpowers deciding that he feels deadly and brutal is not the way to settle everything and becomes a pacifist and a librarian. But When he finds out that the rest of his group is trying to get an antidote to keep them alive by adopting the police, his best friend is a policeman, he becomes the black mask.) The style for which the movie go. , very visual, work and at least am entertaining. I love martial arts movies that are a spectrum. People who fly lighter than air and recover a split second after the impact do not stop the pace and action. But that's what this movie is all about, a Jet Li showcase he does best, and it's a spectacular display of his skills. As with most of the quick action martial arts films ala. Jackie Chan and Sammo Hung who now show themselves here in the States for the first time, are low on plot and high on wonderful physical feats. But I have to say, even with the big holes left in the plot (like how do we see him safe in his apartment when he had only one scene before he had 20 men who were not more than 15 feet from him? the scene just cut for him in the apartment ... although my suspension of faith I think), the movie remains interesting. It is only until the last 20 minutes that the movie seems to be a bit shorter. But still around a big, high-speed action movie.
