It's one of the best movies to come from Hong Kong's "New Wave" that started with Tsui Hark's "ZU: Warriors of Magic Mountain". Tsui gave a tone for the New Wave's approach to martial arts film, which virtually all the New Wave directors (Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung, Wong Jing, Ching Siu Tung, etc.) from a given is accepted; namely, the approach to such films will require more than a hint of irony, if not straight comedy. "Burning Paradise" has put an end to everything and a revenge. <br /> <br /> It's not that there's no humor here; but it is a pure human humor, as with the elderly Buddhist priest who somehow manages a quick sense of the naughty young prostitute while hiding in a bundle of straw. But it is just like people are, even Buddhist priests can never be saints. <br /> <br /> Finally, when irony is implemented in the movie, it is the most beautiful possible, arising from the abbot of Red Lotus Temple, which is a study of pure nihilism, as has never been recorded in film . He is the great incarnation of Milton's Satan of "Paradise Lost": "Better to rule in hell than to serve in heaven!" And if he can't get to Satan's hell soon enough, he'll turn the world around him into a living hell he can rule. <br /> <br /> This is the motive that underlines the brutal violence of many of the images here. : It's not that the Abbot just wants to kill people; He wants them to despair, to feel completely hopeless, to accept his nihilism as all-embracing reality. So there is a definite sentence that permeates the Red Temple scene, that there is no other reality outside of the Temple itself - it has become all that is in the universe, and the Abt, who strives for eternal power, is in control. <br /> <br /> Of course, luckily the movie doesn't end there. Although there are losses, the human will to be just is usually humanly dominated. (If you want to know how, see the movie!) Still, there's no doubt we're going to look at hell in the movie. Hopefully we do not see our own descendants; but we certainly feel tested by the experience - and somehow better for it above all.
