Jim Carrey and Morgan Freeman combine with Jennifer Aniston to make one of the funniest movies so far this 2003 season (late May) and a great improvement on Carrey's past, crazy and personally forgotten roles in previous comedies. With a slightly diminished Carrey antics, with just the zap and crackle of his old self, Carrey is keeping the film up to speed with the laughter and also some dramatic, tearfully gloomy moments. Elements of Jim's real abilities remain in this movie. This beautiful summer entertainment hits most of the buttons, including dramatic elements, along with the goofy moments that perfectly match this writing. While still lacking in the highly polished ensemble comedy / drama, Bruce Almightly earns credit for a good date movie along with a solid message and gentle spiritual cynicism and parody that retains his good taste. Eight out of ten stars.
