Every movie critic and metal head hated this movie, but I enjoyed it. I saw it somewhere as a kid on TV and was amazed at the scene where Sammi came on stage and played Trick of Treat at Fastway. <br /> <br /> The movie itself was typically 80's, the man being bullied and moderated by Melrose Place on Skippy's Family Ties, so Skippy gets a record of Tony Fields from Gene Simmons to comfort him. Skippy gets a record from Tony Fields of Gene Simmons to comfort him. <br /> <br /> Losing all the heroes is the highlight where Tony sings (lip sync) and dances to a metal song before the shoot hits. <br /> <br /> There were many bugs and things, but the music and the overall images were enough to keep my fists pumping 8 out of 10
