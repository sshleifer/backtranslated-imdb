Guinea: The devil's experiment is without a doubt ***** stars at first glance, it's a raw realistic creepy and disturbing look in the dark side of human nature. This movie goes straight to the point, you might think what point? The point is to satisfy fan of just extreme violence and gore. This movie has a bit gore, more or less to torture a woman. There are actually only 3 plays that can be considered as gore. I'll tell you one thing, but Guinea: The devil's experiment makes Hostile like Sesame Street. If you thought Hostile was a crazy, brutal disturbing torture fly, you didn't see half of it until you saw Guinea pig: The Devil's Experiment. <br /> <br /> Movie Rating 0-5, Gore 0-10 <br /> <br /> Guinea Pig: The Devil's Experiment (Uncut) ***** (7)
