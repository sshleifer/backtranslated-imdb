It's one of the few movies I can watch over and over. If you've never seen it before, give it a shot. Richard Dreyfus and Raoul Julia are wonderful together and although the movie enjoys a lot of fun, I recall Julia's untimely demise. It is a good opportunity to sit back and laugh at the international plot that is too much with us in this time of terror and fear.
