It is a strong film from a historical and epic perspective. While the story is simple, it is pure and straight. In fact, it is the standard story of a simple, honorable man whose honor comes into conflict with the more educated and wealthy of the era. <br /> <br /> Poor vs Rich, honorable to cheat, a classic but well-known story without much of Hollywood's gleaming on the screen. <br /> <br /> Extra points, just because you can almost smell the people on the screen. :)
