Hurray! A space movie that doesn't take up too much and everyone can come together for the exciting space race ride. The movie starts slowly, the usual mixture of idiots and high-flying pilots is mixed in a dodgy soup. But when things get tough, the difficult ones are sorted out and it's not an incredible change in characters, as you can believe there's some responsibility in their minds. <br /> <br /> The only mistake in the movie is that Kate Capshaw is extremely annoying as the "I'm right and you're all wrong" instructor. I would recommend it as a nice night in the movie and a 7 voice.
