Marjorie (a beautiful and sounding performance by Farrah Fawcett) avoids the addict in her car by an evil rapist Joe (played excellently with frightening beliefs and intensity by James Russo). Joe steals her wallet and finds out where Marjorie lives. He paid her a visit to a fatal day. After Marjorie Marjorie was subjected to much degradation and psychological abuse, Marjorie succeeded in turning the tables on Joe and closing him in the fireplace. What will Marjorie do to Joe? Director Robert M. Young and screenwriter William Mastrosimone emphasize a hard, eager and often disturbing morality story that mockingly left the strong brutality and painful rape of rape, while also showing how any person when pushed to extremes is capable for shocking acts of violence and inhumanity. Joe considers women strictly as objects while Marjorie only sees Joe as an "animal". However, this film to his admirable credit refuses to make Joe just to be a dirty one-dimensional creep; Instead, he is a frighteningly real and ultimately spicy human monster with a woman and a child. (Joe's climax in particular is really poignant). Fawcett and Russo are both outstanding in the lead; they receive fine support from Diana Scarwid as the passive Terry, Alfre Woodard as the wise Patricia, and Sandy Martin as sympathetic police officer, Officer Sudow. Both Curtis Clark's agile cinematography and J.A.C. Redford's thrill, well-crawling count improves the significant claustrophobic tension. A real power station.
