I saw this film once in or near his release year 36 years ago (1969). Although I can only remember it, I long to see it again. The parts I remember just or wrong include Mosterdgas in the trenches and Suzie Kendall as a German spy. He offers some sexual favors in the back of an enclosed truck to get military information from him. The music score was especially memorable and emotion stirred in the league of Gone With The Wind and I would love to hear it again. There should be commercial or copyright why this movie is not available. Anyone know why? I doubt she has anything to do with a lack of quality or interest.
