While I want to say I enjoy the show, I expected something different than when I first saw, "What I love you," I expected to find something according to the lines of "All That" (I don't know whether it's more), but I have to say I love the show and while I don't classify it as a breakthrough show, it's very charming and I also like the chemistry between the characters (including the supporting cast) <br I will definitely say it's good to see Wesley Jonathan again on the screen because I really loved him in City Guy. I also saw the woman who plays Valerie's friend in Popular and while I think it was a good performance, I don't really like her character in this show because she's just not my cup of tea, but she makes it relatively good
