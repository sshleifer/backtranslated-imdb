One of the most challenging movies ever with excellent cinematography, backed up by Mc Clarens Lisp and beautiful quotation, "do you believe in love on the first site?". <br /> <br /> A trace of expressionism was evident in this photo, furthermore, the films catapulted to flawless integrity. Gabby (AKA Joey) who played Eva Longoria, loved the film and role she played so much. She couldn't even be bothered to mention it in her filmography. Lol. <br /> <br /> The best part of the movie will undoubtedly be the heroic rescue of MC clothing as he saved the young 'Disabled' child with the speech restriction. What I could add to was perfection! James Cahiil's use of sound effects is unprecedented until today. The drug chest he performs early in the film is painfully realistic. When I first watched the movie, I was so forced with the intense lack of respect for the Gang Inthused brothers of the Southside gang and the CTM (Cut Throat Mafia). It was by far one of the most intricate slits Cahill dedicated to filming. <br /> <br /> Personally, this movie has sentimental value to me and I'll be downloading it in the near future. That's when I can find it everywhere, LOL!
