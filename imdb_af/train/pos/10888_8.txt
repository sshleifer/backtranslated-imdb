It's one of those little Christmas movies for everyone. Our Scrooge is Ben Affleck, who decides money, is not enough, so he rents the family who lived where he thought his family had done. OK? This is a big little high school soap, PG-13, but the small sex references are comedy. If your child can't handle it, they can't live in the real world either. <br /> <br /> Affleck is now hungry, and as usual, this fun, OMG, remembers when we did ... ensemble piece as if he were in the final stages of a neuro-infectious disease. But that's right, because even this old Oracle keeps hoping that if Ben is so well divided, there is still hope for our ladies. Luckily, the rest of the ensemble - Catharine O'Hara, James Gandolfini, Christina Applegate, Udo Kier and Josh Zuckerman - alternate this hilarious, comfortable and warm Christmas-Ozzie-and-Harriet Christmas. br /> <br /> This movie is the kind you can jump and get popcorn, and when you come back, everyone wants to work it back to show you what you missed. <br /> <br /> It's a happy movie, and it makes you feel good about life, love, family, Christmas and Chanel. There is really something for everyone.
