While having a great respect for Disney's animated movies, they don't actually call what I "need to see". Atlantis got intrigue of the first movie poster and trailer, and happily met my expectations. <br /> <br /> Atlantis is a more "mature" Disney movie in that it has songs (a very unusual feature for a Disney movie indeed), and is more focused on action and discovery than any other recent Disney listing. The world of Atlantis, hidden beneath the Earth's core, is fantastic, presented as ruins of desert huts, and then slowly evolves into the real ecosystems, which, while usually containing a memory of hardness, become more and more intriguing to the tropical Paradise reached itself. The portrayal of just Atlantis's landscape and environment, without some agile songs, gave the kingdom a much more beautiful and intriguing appearance. The inclusion of an Atlantic language, as well as efforts to incorporate it into the mythology of ancient real-life civilizations, adds and works reasonably well. <br /> <br /> Also, with the exception of some scenes involving Mole jokes, there wasn't much of a "childish" element I usually associate with Disney movies. Instead, the main elements were the struggle to get Atlantis and the constant discovery that took place at Atlantis, since Milo could teach the outsider everything he ever needed to know about the location by helping the Atlantic Ocean parts of discover their own history that they did not know. Part of this involves the Atlantic weapon, which is used in a very action-packed climax which, due to a better word, is very exciting. <br /> <br /> Permitted, not the whole story does not make sense, and the movie does not contain amazing new computer-generated visual effects, but apart from the Toy Story movies, it is the most entertaining Disney movie I've been to for years seen.
