This Peabody Awards Division is one of the highlights of the 1st season where a holodeck malfunction Captain Picard, Beverly, Data and a Star Fleet historian, Waylan, caught up in a 1930s San Francisco area. This episode is a tribute to Raymond Chandler's "Maltese Falcon" where Patrick Stewart accepts the Humphrey Bogart role - completed with fedora and trench coat. The office itself is almost an exact replica of the one that appears in Bogey's "Maltese Falcon". <br /> <br /> This episode also briefly introduces us to a mysterious insect trap called the Jarada that communicates with mostly high sound. Communication with this alien race is difficult, and it is up to Picard to communicate with this race in their mother tongue so that negotiations and diplomacy can finally begin. However, the best part of this episode is the appearance of famous Hollywood actor Lawrence Tierney in the role of the gangster Cyrus Redblock. He was such a beautiful man back in the 1940s. Oh, well ...
