I watched the movie when I was about 8 years old on television in the UK (where it is called Laupta: The Flying Island). I absolutely loved it and was sad when it was repeated a while and I missed it. I was captivated by the story and the characters, but especially by the haunting and beautiful music. It would be the original English print version I saw - sometimes mistakenly referred to as the "Streamline Dub" (the dub was actually released by Ghibli and only distributed by Streamline) which is unfortunately not available except as part of a ridiculous expensive laser slide box set. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I feel that the issue is partly spoiled by Disney. The voice action is OK, but the dialogue doesn't have the same raw energy that the "streamline" dubs or had the original Japanese, and I think James Van Der Beek sounds too old to play. They made some senseless changes, such as changing the main character's name from "Pazu" to "Patzu", and adding some dialogue. But the worst of all I feel is that they have ruined many scenes with intrusive music. The original scene of the airships was originally quiet, but was spoiled by Disney's moronic requirement that music be played when someone didn't speak, which I find annoying in many Disney movies. <br /> <br /> This movie blows away the latest animation movies, and I can't recommend it highly enough. The plot is simple but engaging and the movie shows a flair that unfortunately lacks in the most modern mass market, homogenized animation.
