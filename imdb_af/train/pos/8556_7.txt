This movie is simple fun. I have nothing to do with the original America pie, but it's nice to watch. <br /> <br /> Once again, but better than Band Camp and The Nude Miles, at least funny. </ <br /> <br /> Just after the first five minutes I laughed my ass so I decided to call my friend and we'll see it together. We had a few beers and we had fun. <br /> <br /> You won't find a deep message in this movie, but it's worth watching. <br /> <br /> So, lie back and just enjoy.
