If you are a fan of plane type movies this is a must see! In the 1920s and 30s, Johnny Dangerously not only had good actors but also good lines. "knock that wall, knock that wall and knock that # @ $% # @ $ wall." "Don't hang me on a hook johnny" or "Sound like John's laid". It's definitely a ghost of old James Cagney Movies and they refer a lot. There is a wonderful scene when Jhonnys runs down the road and sets up a priest for his escape. Now listen to the false priestly readings, it's pretty funny. Another wonderful scene is when Dom Delauise plays the Pope. Looking at his response to Johnny after recommending the Pope, many said without making a noise. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves to laugh or old movie buffs.
