Miriam Hopkins is "The Lady with Red Hair" in this 1940's biography of Mrs. Leslie Carter, who also includes Claude Rains as David Belasco, Richard Ainley as Lou Payne, and good role-playing support players, including Laura Hope Crews and Victor Jory. <br /> <br /> Miriam Hopkins and Claude Rains perform amazingly. Hopkins was a beautiful actress who really made us feel like Mrs. Carter. Rains is great like the flamboyant, selfish producer / writer / actress / impresario David Belasco, one of the big names in the theater. <br /> <br /> Although Mrs. Carter's second man, Lou Payne, served as an advisor on this movie. , it is a poor representation of the actual events of Mrs. Carter's life. True, there was a lot of public and bitter divorce, and she was undoubtedly regarded as a scandalous actor and actress. However, she oversaw her son Dudley, so there was no custody battle. After she broke with Belasco, she did not return to him and indeed she started working in vaudeville and actually made films by the end of her life. She did indeed marry Lou, and in many productions she became her premier man. <br /> <br /> The drive for Mrs. Carter at the beginning of this movie regains her son, but she finally realizes that she is away from her, he is completely bound to his father. Also in the film (and I'm not sure if it was true in real life) she traveled with her mother and stayed in a theater, giving the film an extra interesting atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Not a bad movie, probably not a portrayal of the greatness of either Carter or Belasco. One of Mrs. Carter's most famous moments were in The Heart of Maryland, where she wore a six-foot wig. Outside, fans blow her hair while hanging 35 feet above the stage to hold the center of a bell to make it ring. Totally a visual.
