And a rather unexpected plot line - for the era: there is plague in the city of New Orleans - and only Richard Widmark can stop it! Elia Kazan's brands: water fronts, workers, crowds, refugees, blue collars, background violence - are all shown here. <br /> <br /> Jack Palance is pretty effective as the ice-cold mobster for a big score, Zero Mostel as Dom Delouise somewhat overlooked, but definitely viewable as she goes. I enjoyed Barbara Bel Geddes as a sturdy, cool woman. I thought she and Widmark were a credible couple. <br /> <br /> He always reminds me of Sinatra in the face and in the intense quiet way - and it is meant as a compliment as anything. I've never heard of this movie, and yes, you must admire Widmark's performance. I also enjoyed Paul Douglas. He played this role many times. They make an unlikely but effective team. <br /> <br /> The plague itself is a McGuffin - and you have to know it hasn't done exactly as it should. was in real life - rather small-scale at least no? - but I found that it had the plot well combined. <br /> <br /> See below. That's good. *** outside ****
