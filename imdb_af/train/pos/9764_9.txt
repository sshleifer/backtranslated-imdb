I watched this movie at the theaters when I was about 6 or 7 years old. I loved it then and recently owned a VHS version. <br /> <br /> My 4 and 6 year old kids love this movie and have asked to see it again. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed viewing it again. Although I have to admit it is not as good on a TV. <br /> <br /> I don't have older kids, so I don't know what they'd think about it. <br /> <br /> The songs are very cute. My daughter keeps them over and over. <br /> <br /> Hope this helps.
