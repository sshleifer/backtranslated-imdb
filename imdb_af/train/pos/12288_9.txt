The House of the Spirits is a gripping story of family intrigue, South American politics and super-natural powers. Meryl Streep, Glenn Close and Jeremy Irons bring Isabel Allende's novel alive with all his passion and excitement. It is, in my opinion, one of the best films of the 1990s. Jeremy Irons as Esteban Trueba is very credible, while in the role of Clara Meryl Streep holds her soft, loving warmth throughout her relatively short life. Winona Ryder and Antonio Banderas make an attractive couple struggling for family acceptance in a racist culture. Glenn Close, as Esteban's sister, gives a very moving show. The countryside of Portugal is a reasonable substitute for a non-tropical Latin American country. Statements from Clara's house and Esteban's farm are effective and the period of American cars adds to the post-war atmosphere.
