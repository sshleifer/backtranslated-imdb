In the Hollywood West, the route hands were a rough bunch that, when they came to town, ran properly. After all the route, a lonely business back in the day before the railway lines came to all parts of the US. <br /> <br /> The robbers who worked for route boss Gil Favor played by Eric Fleming were no different. But Fleming was a man of all affairs, he had a job to do and hired a top crew to do so. <br /> <br /> With the long term of Rawhide and the fact that the regulars mostly stayed there, we at one time or another knew all the drivers. A single point storyline was focused around them all, but the bulk was with Fleming and Clint Eastwood's character Rowdy Yates, the number 2 man with the herd. <br /> <br /> Clint Eastwood's western image was formed by Rawhide, It is a pity that it is no longer shown. Probably because they were made in black and white. If it was an NBC show, it would be done in color like Bonanza and be as regular as the shows. We will see much more of a man who has become a moving legend. Ironically, it was Eric Fleming who left the show before it was closed to make movies. He did some of them and hoped the show would give him a bankable movie name. Unfortunately, he was killed on a movie spot to do an action movie, drown in a river. If he lived, he might have become a name like Eastwood's. <br /> <br /> Last season Clint took over as rail boss and then the show completed its run. And of course he became the icon he is today and not just in the Western genre. <br /> <br /> Rawhide was a tough western who had a few tough guys. No frills in this one, it was working cowboys just doing work and bumping the elements and any situations in which they were thrown every year. <br /> <br /> They don't really make television series like this. What a pity.
