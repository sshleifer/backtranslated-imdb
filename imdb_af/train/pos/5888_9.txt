I was able to watch this movie as a whole and was deeply affected. I wasn't sure if it was really a comedy or drama - it had both elements. Mary Tyler Moore and Valerie Harper both looked well - our image of 60-year-old women has definitely changed since Auntie Bee! They are alive, beautiful, sexy! The only downside in this movie was that there was absolutely no mention of other characters in the MTM or Rhoda 1970s exhibitions. I thought that since it was in New York City (where "Rhoda" was set up), at least her sister Brenda would be mentioned or Julie Kavner would appear, obviously still quiet in the big apple. <br /> <br /> It is my hope that ABC will make it a series and bring back to guests all the old movies of these shows. By the way, what was wrong with CBS to do this reunion, or an ultimate series? Wasn't that the network that carried the "MTM" and "Rhoda"?
