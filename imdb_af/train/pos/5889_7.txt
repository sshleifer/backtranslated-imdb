Well, I have to admit I've never seen "Rhoda" and only one or two episodes of "The Mary Tyler Moore Show". Although I know nothing of this duo comic talent, I still love this movie. <br /> <br /> Mary goes back to work. Rose is trying her luck to be a comedian. Rhoda struggles with a photography career. And Meredith ... what is she doing again? These three stories we follow in two hours are entertaining and entertaining on their own. When the two long-time friends are reunited, it just makes the movie better. <br /> <br /> I was amazed at how well the writing was. The little jokes made by Mary and Rhoda were funny. The writing itself was very well composed. <br /> <br /> Over the past few years, I've seen in other movies in Moore and Harper and thought they were very good. But I had no idea that they worked well as a team. While both actresses do their part to fulfill the title of this movie, it never seems to drop me. (In the course of this movie.) Joie Lenz and Marisa Ryan play their roles well, but nothing good. The rest of the role like Jonah, Cecile and .... everyone also works well together. <br /> <br /> Since it's a reunion, you'll expect a fan of any show to enjoy it. Of a non-fan, I still enjoyed this small gathering. Good story lines for each character and the two main characters are what make this movie very good. (The newer version of the MTM theme song also doesn't hurt.)
