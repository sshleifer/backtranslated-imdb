And that's not because since her days at Clarissa it all explained that I had a little loved one on Melissa Joan Hart, who was popular at the time, already in her 20's, but still could get teen roles. "Sabrina, the Teenage Witch" was Hart's next big leap after her "Clarissa" days. Based on the comic strip, Sabrina Spellman - you guessed it! - A teenage witch who tries to collect her witchcraft with the demands of everyday teen life. She is helped in her efforts by her two aunts and a sensible black cat like her from high school, to college and eventually to her career in journalism. <br /> <br /> As usual, Heart is the show heart and soul. "Sabrina, the Teen Witch" is very mobile and very funny, and it is a pity that it took me so long to realize how good it was. I just wish there were some new episodes that we could all enjoy. <br /> <br /> 10/10
