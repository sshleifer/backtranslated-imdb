"Silverlake Life" is a documentary and it was simple and straightforward. Actually, it's more like a home movie, and if you want dramatic relief, you see something else. And it's not a tearjerker at all. But I mean it positively. It shows two men who love each other and how to be afflicted with AIDS affects the quality of their everyday lives. It is almost difficult to say whether it was a quality movie or not because it was so undone that I had to look for other ways to respond. It's an admirable movie, actually one of the most admirable, sincere documents I've ever seen. These two men have incredible integrity, as their lives are reduced to the most basic parts. It makes wood carving production on AIDS look hip and heartless. These men made this movie for themselves, which is one of the best reasons to create something. The scene where Tom sings "You are My Sunshine" to Mark and tells him goodbye is the right thing.
