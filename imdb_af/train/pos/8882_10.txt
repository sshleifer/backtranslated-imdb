John Singleton's best film, before a little wannabees such as Shaft remake, is a formidable film with overall good plays and wonderful balance between the 3 main characters, each with identifiable youth problems. <br /> <br /> What I like Most of it also covers the problem of self-sufficiency among young blacks, a problem that is mostly ignored by the media and other films that mostly focus on socio-economic problems and racism by whites. This movie shows that blacks can be equally ignorant and racist. <br /> <br /> The masterful thing about this movie is that it covers so many topics without getting leveled. It's not just about racism, but about how difficult it can be to embrace a new world (college), date rape, sexuality and isolation. Omar Epps, Michael Rapaport and Kristy Swanson perform well, and the supporting role is equally interesting with Jennifer Connelly as a lez (yay) and with Ice Cube and Busta Rhymes as college bombs that cause small riots. <br /> <br /> The only negative is the caricature of a professor by Laurence Fishburne ("Peppermint?"). Certainly, many professors are tired. But they are not so flat. The skinheads are also a little caricature, but I think they are also in real life. <br /> <br /> Overall, a great understated piece of film work, if you like American History X, you'll love this one. . <br /> <br /> 8.5 out of 10
