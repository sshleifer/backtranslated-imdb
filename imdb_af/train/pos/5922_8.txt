I found this movie to be exciting from the start - like a Spielberg movie - and the plot is interesting to try to find out what the real situation was. <br /> <br /> Straight from the Beginning - before the opening credits - start the action, with immediate tension. <br /> <br /> The two main characters are very nice. (I have problems with any of the Baldwins, due to Alec's extra-mural political activity, but William wasn't bad in this movie.) <br /> <br /> There were several highly unexpected twists and turns that contributed to the enjoyment. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there were many places where there was an annoying high pitch in the soundtrack - something like 19K Hz. I suspect the microphone picks up video monitors on the set.
