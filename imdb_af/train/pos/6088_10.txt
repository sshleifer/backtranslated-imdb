Was the writing more suitable for a 30 minute sitcom? Yes, but they still work! I thought the actors did a fantastic job with an otherwise mere writing, especially Jack Black and Christopher Walken. Most people on the board really seem to hate this movie. I can't personally see how it can be, but Envy is just one of those movies you don't love or hate. Much like Napoleon Dynamite and every Leslie Neilsen movie ever made. You also think it's one of the worst movies ever made or one of the funniest. Avoid this movie because of the reviews. See it and see if you are one of the people who really enjoy it! If you do, I guarantee it's worth your money. If you don't like it ... well, now you know.
