The first and second seasons started shakily, with good episodes plagued between the average, and sometimes in clich√© stories. But once it began to set the universe in which it exists and began to develop it more characters, and it became much more fun and entertaining. <br /> <br /> The main reason why this show follows it up because of four men: Richard Dean Anderson, Peter Deluise, Joseph Malozzie and Paul Mullie. Richard's dry sense of humor shows so much better, Peter's direction is excellent and makes an episode so much more entertaining. Joe and Paul never miss a funny, interesting episode. <br /> <br /> Once you understand what the show is about and get to know the characters, I doubt you won't like the show. For those in the show, I propose the episodes 'The Other Side', a good serious episode, and 'Window of Opportunity', a classic comic relief episode.
