I think the context of the story was covered by other posters, so I just want to write about the impact this movie had on me. <br /> <br /> For the first time I saw the film as the year of its release around 1987. My school organized a trip to the theater to see it, for a RE project I think. We were all excited, of course, because we were on a school trip to the theater! Little did we know about what we were about to experience. To this day, I still remember the feelings it made in me and remember I cry a lot like most of my friends. I think at the age we were, we found it shocking and quiet. It was right on our own youth rage. It had such an impact that I joined the Anti Apartheid Movement that same year. <br /> <br /> I think it did that in my case.
