In this truly fascinating, dark movie, a young poor student sells his soul for a lot of money to the devil. In return, the devil takes his mirror image (it is done brilliantly in the movie and honestly presided over when Balduin, the student was previously practicing swordship before the mirror), a visual metaphor for a "man in war with himself" what she focus on immediate future. The student enjoys his money, but the woman he loves is unattainable (he made a pact with the devil, he was cut off from love and other wealth of the soul forever). You can have love, or you can exchange your soul for money, you can't have both. Balduin is chased by his double ghost (the inter-titles speak it beautifully like the action. Some of the scenes are incredible, the sense of punishment if the devil disappears with Balduin's mirror image is wonderful, just like the sentence she takes forever cut off from human society (the scene where he ran away from his double and ended up in the 'desert' at the edge of the village, no longer quite human (he lost his soul), he is like a hunted animal outside of human society There are so many other things to say about this incredible movie, Paul Wegener was a wonderful actor and director, a cultural hero of mine, helping you know a little about German history film made and about the German duplexer Tradition (don't google it, get a proper book) Just remember, it's a very early movie, it's sometimes a bit bunch, but considering what it should say and that's tragic, this is one of the best ever!)
