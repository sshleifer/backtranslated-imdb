A strange, witty and wonderful portrayal of family life! Author Andrew Marshall wrote something funny, quirky and occasionally frightening! Yes, don't be fooled by 2 point4 children's cheerful songs and bubble characters; The show has a dark side, and at times it can be quite cold. And it's so good about the show, it's not just a simplistic sitcom, because every character is a 2D comic device (the case with My Family). Instead, the characters are completely rounded individuals showing the full toboggan run of human emotions. The occasional dark moments like Bill were supposedly sought by a curse and Ben awakened in a bizarre town are two examples of the show taking a surreal, dark turn, which helps to add some depth. Of course, the performance is also incredibly funny and it is guaranteed to make you smile. It's a real shame. Eureka Video stopped releasing this comic gold on DVD. Veoh.com is your last hope to get varied episodes in stores.
