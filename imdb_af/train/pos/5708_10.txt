It's so exciting! Having seen 'La Roue' this afternoon, a short, light little movie, I consider this one a real surprise! It's absolutely beautiful and one of the most beautiful photos I've seen this year. This is the most wonderful because it is an early talkie and puts some good pictures of the 30's due to its innovative use of audio in cinema. It's simply filled with music and a loving mood that's really optimistic and in the bottom way it made me happy! Obviously it would not be so difficult to get the lottery ticket that the male pilot was looking for, but the pace is so exciting and the movie is so spectacularly entertaining that I didn't even think twice. The comedy is often hilarious and I think it's even better than the Marx Brothers, possibly the greatest comic power of the time. It's quite perfect.
