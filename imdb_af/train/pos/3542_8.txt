If I was familiar with the stage production of Guys and Dolls before I saw the movie, I might not love it. Although, in all fairness, I would probably find the film production even better, because of my general worship of both Brando (for his acting) and Sinatra (for his voice, although he is also the actor, see the Manchurian Candidate or From Here to eternity.) <br /> <br /> As with some of the other judges' sayings on the songs, I have the Broadway soundtrack and although the voice of Isabel Bingley eliminates it from Jean Simmons, it is no nicer. I find it a little shrill quality. Jean Simmons's voice is much more realistic, although it is not always a major concern in music. Also, the only time I particularly noticed Marlon Brando's particularly weak voting register was during his version of "Luck Be A Lady" and just because I was previously familiar with Sinatra's version. I also find Vivian Blaine's voice much more enjoyable in the movie than it is on Broadway. And Sinatra's voice alone could leave the failures of all others, if they needed salvation. (They weren't) It is infinitely better than Sam Levene's, especially in my favorite song, 'Sue Me'. <br /> <br /> The complaint that many songs from the movie for inferior songs have been omitted also asks me to disagree. A Bushel and a Peck is almost a jewel and the song it replaced, "Pet Me Poppa" and its accompanying show, is more Hot Box material. I personally do not care about 'Go the Man Today' and are happy It was not included in the movie. I adore "I have never been in love", and although not in the movie, the instrumental version can be heard when Nathan is in Adelaide's dressing room. The song "A Woman In Love" expresses the same sentiment as well and probably in a series that both could reach the stars. And the movie wouldn't be the same without the song 'Adelaide', which wasn't included on Broadway. movie soundtrack was available for sale, I would recommend buying it instead of the Broadway. <br /> <br /> Although I did not see the original production, I cannot imagine that the play would be better than that of the movie actors. <br /> <br /> The important fact is that the story is as charming as ever and the acting and son are not making it any less.
