This afternoon I caught this movie on the cable. I have to admit I've never been a big baseball fan, but sometimes I can get a good sports-related movie. What I found interesting was the portrayal of the foster care system. As a therapist who saw both the good and the bad of the community's mental health and foster system, it was refreshing to see a movie showing both the up and down of this system: people from family to family, biological parents do not always take active involvement, and transitions that may be, but heartbreaking and heart-melting. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Danny Glover are the anchors of this movie, and both bring very credible performances. Maybe it was just my emotional state, but I found myself losing a tear to the end of the movie.
