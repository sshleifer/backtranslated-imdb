RETURN ACCESSIBILITY <br /> <br /> Don't expect credibility with action games where the superhero needs to run an endless series of incredible achievements, which are involved in the process, but turn into speedy and harmless gadgets, turning them into deadly weapons. especially when Renny Harlin directs. <br /> <br /> "CLIFFHANGER" is no exception. But the movie has many assets: breathtaking scenery, mysterious photos, beautiful special and visual effects (the first five minutes are grabbing and giving the tone of the film), excellent musical score, prosperous efforts to relieve life to relieve some tension , and a solid roll: two heroes (Stallone, star and cowriter, have the lion's share of the footage, but the excellent Michael Rooker stands above his ground), a beautiful heroine (Janine Turner) and one of the hottest bulls ever (valuable John Lithgow and fraudulent female Caroline Goodall, but also Rex Linn - share in a longer than usual part and use most of it, Leon, Craig Fairbrass). Good, solid entertainment if there is no credibility. As Roger Ebert wrote another movie. "It's the kind of movie you can sit back and enjoy as long as you don't think the mistake too much." <br /> <br />
