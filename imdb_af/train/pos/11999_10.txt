I saw this wonderful production, and I wonder if anyone can tell me something about the actress who played the blacksmith's wife. I'm not sure of her character's name. I went with her to BYU and had her contact with her - her girlfriend was Kim Luke - and I wonder if anyone has any information about her. She is not listed in the credits. This production was excellent, a tear barrier on all accounts, wonderful acting by everyone. I think I don't even want to put it in the general category of "scene", more like "portraying the incredible events that led to the opening of heaven for this last dispensation" ... something like that. If someone has worked with Kim or has a website or something, please let me know !!! She was fantastic in her role, incidentally. Thanks, Melissa Thorne
