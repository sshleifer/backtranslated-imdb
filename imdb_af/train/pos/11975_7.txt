Full House is a great family program. But after watching a few episodes over and over again, I realized that they were very boring and they seemed to be hiding a lot from the outside world. Yes, there is a lot of comedy, but there are times when it is incredibly cheesy. It's not as if I hate it, but just don't look over them again, because they quickly get old. Probably the best season is the first. <br /> <br /> Full House is about widower Danny Tanner (Bob Saget) and his three daughters D.J. (Candace Cameron) Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin) and Michelle (Mary-Kate and Ashley). When Danny's wife dies, he needs help. So, his best friend Joey (Dave Coulier) and the girls' uncle Jesse (John Stamos) move with them. Once they live there, they find that they cannot live without one another. <br /> <br /> Full House reminds you just how important family is and that you can always go home again.
