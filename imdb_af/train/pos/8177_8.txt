I'm surprised no one thought about doing such a movie. Horror is often the most effective when it uses real life unpleasantness as a theme. And no one likes to go to the dentist (except for Steve Martin in The Little Shop or Horrors). Dental mortality has previously been done (see, for example, the Marathan Man), but it brings the terror to suburbs. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around a dentist, dr. Alan Feinstone (Corbin Bernsen), descending into madness. Now our dear doctor didn't even play with a full deck, but with jealousy and an obsessive-compulsive disorder, he started to destroy the people around him. The doctors who aggravate the mental condition are similar to what we see in Michael Douglas's character in Falling Down, but with a horrible edge. <br /> <br /> Written and directed by horror warts Stuart Gordon and Brian Yuzna, it's spiritual and has a great flow. I'm also planning to play a policeman, but Ken Foree is always welcome. <br /> <br /> Now I believe this movie won't work without Corbin Bernsen's absolutely fantastic performance. Once I saw him in LA Law, I was fleeing through his acting. <br /> <br /> The sequel Dentist 2 is also worth looking at, but slightly less than the original one. <br /> TTKK's Bottomline - a fun movie with a few scenes that will cringe, capped (pun intended) by a good performance by Bernsen
