It's one of those movies I've seen so many times that I can quote most of it. Some of the lines in this movie are just unbeatable. I especially enjoy watching him stumble and fall while he's drunk, going out to the fine restaurant, drunk and sharing with the moose. <br /> <br /> I don't know how many times I've seen this order, but it's funny every time. From the moment Arthur arrives at Susan's father's place to the moose, you're laughing all the time. I remember looking at the look with the moose. It went down just as I thought it would be. They all laughed so hard, it was hard for them to film it. <br /> <br /> The late Sir John Gielgud was a wonderful addition to this. His attitude, his one-liners and the way he dealt with Arthur were all equally hilarious. It is always a funny moment when he hits his head with his hat or tells him he is a spoiled little ____. I laugh every time I listen to the "I'm going to have a bath" and the lines that follow.
