This is one of the best movies I've seen in the past 2 years (I saw the Prime Minister in Tel Aviv, Israel in the summer of 2006, exactly when the last war started.) This problem in communication between The People Who wars have been interesting for me, and it does not matter who boys and girls, straight and gays, Jews and Arabs. I've seen the Bubble three times, and it's still surprising and exciting - every character reminds me of one of the many people I know and the difference between them, as between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem ... The last time that I saw it - was with my friend, who is a Christian-Arab, and it was on the independence day of Israel (the most symbolic I could, how ironic) and ... he finally cried !!! - If he was touched and not embarrassed, everyone would be touched by The Bubble!
