I thought it was a very good movie. It would have been nice to have seen a little more in the movie about the 2 sisters who know about everyone who enjoys the same boy before being killed. I'm sure if the movie was done this way, there would have been a very different end, so this move made such a good movie. It shows that it doesn't matter what happens in your life with your brothers and sisters, that you can always get it and that if it is 2 sisters dealing with a boy, the same boy working through the pain and pain make things look better and easier to work out between the two of them. It is nice to see love stories that have a terrible thing to happen in someone's life that you can still get by going even closer to his ear. I really enjoyed watching this movie, and I still do it when it comes. It seems to me like this every time it comes. It would have been nice if there was a part 2 for this movie, maybe with the older sister to come up and have his baby. It would really have made a wonderful finish on the story since he died. He lives even though he's dead.
