Yesterday, my Spanish / Catalan wife and I saw this emotional lesson in history. Spain is heading towards political confrontation again. Therefore, this masterpiece must be shown in all Spanish high schools. This is a tremendous lesson in the hidden crime of fascism. The US pilot engaging in the Spanish Civil War opt for the democratically elected Republican government. The criminal role of religion has been shown surprisingly well in one of the most ingenious scenes Uribe ever made. The colors are wonderful. The cruelty of a war (can anyone tell me the difference between any war and a civil war?) Is used as a scenario of hope when two young children express their feelings and protect one another. The cowards that begin their abuse of power, even to innocent children, are now active again. A movie like 'El viaje de Carol' / 'Carol's journey' tells one of the so many sad stories of the 20th century. This is a better lesson in history than any book can contain. Again, good work from the Iberica Peninsula!
