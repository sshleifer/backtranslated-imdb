When the DVD was released, I bought and bought the market. And I think my money was in the right way as I expected before I bought it. Awesome movie I can say even more to Will Smith, he was a wonderful actor as always, whether in movies or serious. He always gives a record brake performance. I think it's the movie after August Rush that lets one cry while watching it. The way the director described the story was wonderful. His previous life and his new life in film have been worked out correctly. Even I couldn't find any fault in the story or the way they shot it. I think his DVD should be a household because it will really be a nice thing for your collection. It's not the movie that pops up for enjoyment, it's the movie that makes the reader learn a lesson. Now what is the lesson you can see while watching. And I advise the people who are film critics, please check here if you can find any criticism of this movie, please speak to me.
