I feel Monarch Cove was one of the best written and performed "Drama" series to come on any network in a long time. This show has great potential and I couldn't wait to watch it every week. It can be developed into a great Primetime Soap. People are looking forward to this kind of acting as our "Reality TV" is overpowering. I crave the kind of writing and acting that shows like Dallas, Knots' Landing, Dynasty, MelRose Place, etc. Monarch Cove updated this concept quite well and I expected it to get better. There is so much to expand with these characters and they were all very interesting and engaging in their own right. It will be a loss not to explore it and to develop these characters after we move into their world. I absolutely loved this show because it was mysterious, interesting and sensual without overboarding or offending. Was crazy about it.
