My third year French classes always enjoyed this movie very much. In a multicultural, inner-city high school, the film presented many topics for discussion (in French in class, but I know many discussions took place in English after class). The most obvious is the relationship between Protée and Aimée compared to the one between Protée and France. <br /> <br /> I always mentioned that I felt that this movie had one of the "sexiest" scenes I've ever seen in a movie. One year, a 17-year-old African-American scream, "Yes!" when he figured out the scene: the one where Protée Aimee lace helps her gown, both are looking at the reflection of the other in the mirror. Directors use the "mirror technique" when they want to focus on the inner conflict of one or more characters in a scene: this is a perfect example of the technique, and it is "sexy". <br /> <br /> Most students had trouble understanding the end of the movie. One suggested that a theme of the movie was "Africanism", and that no matter how much one of Africa or Afrikaners loved, one cannot become Africa (as the driver tried): one must be Africa .
