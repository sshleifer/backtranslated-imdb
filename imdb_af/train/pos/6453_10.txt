The advent of a world-renowned conductor presents unexpected events and feelings in the village. Some people are threatened by the way he manages the church choir, and how people change it gradually. This movie is heartwarming and lets you release the theater with both a smile on your lips and tears in your eyes. It is to bring out the best in people and Kay Pollak wrote an excellent writing based on the ideas he became so familiar with. The actors are outstanding, Michael Nyqvist knows us, but Frida Hallgren was a new and lovely acquaintance with me. She has a very lively face that no one is left untouched. Per Moberg does her part if Gabriella's husband is almost too good, he is terrible to see. One just wants to be stolen to play a nice guy someday so we can see if he controls that character too. <br /> <br /> It's a movie that won't leave you untouched. If you haven't seen it yet, do it today!
