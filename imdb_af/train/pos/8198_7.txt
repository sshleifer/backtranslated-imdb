Dirty Harry has to find a rape victim who takes revenge by shooting her attackers in the goolites before they are killed. Probably a more appropriate punishment would be to make them live after the initial shot and leave them forever as she and her sister have ... Anyway ... an action-packed story in San Francisco and Santa Cruz takes place. The main rapist, played by Andy Drake, is quite dirty and gets his sentence to the end (of course!). Not a classic movie, but better than the other, except for the original Dirty Harry.
