It was a very good historical drama. John Turturro is excellent as the tortured genius Luzhin and brilliantly portrays the character's manic affections like his strange dance. Emily Watson is fine in her support role as the sensitive lover Natalia. <br /> <br /> The relationship between chess and near madness is well explored by Gorris and well-known Nabokov recitals such as 'eternal innocence' (ie 'Lolita'). is clear in this movie. I think I'm going to read the novel now. It was a gripping and tragic end and it was difficult to keep a dry eye. Brilliant movie!
