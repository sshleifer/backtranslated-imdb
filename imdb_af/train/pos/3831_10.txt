This is a free adaptation of Clarence Mulford's novels; fans of the Willaim Boyd movies will probably feel a bit here at sea (and the reviews here so far reflect it). But first I knew about Hopalong's novels, and I never watched much for the Boyd movies. I first came to them. <br /> <br /> Christopher Coppola made a wise choice - he doesn't have a nostalgic "Western"; Instead, he approached the Cassidy story as a cut called 'Americana'; or what older critics called "homespun". As the film unraveled, I was reminded more and more of the great "Hallmark Theater" version of Mark Twain's "Roughing It", with James Garner telling. <br /> <br /> Both of these films remind us that, although movies over the 'old west' are probably always myths to Americans, they don't have to be 'westerns'; they may well be just movies about what it means to be American at that time, in that place. <br /> <br /> I never felt like watching this movie; There is no attempt to hide the Boyd-Cassidy legacy from our throat, no irony or camp. As a result, I get a sense of these characters as if they were walking - or riding horseback riding - over some true Western America, I could also walk a hundred years ago. <br /> <br /> Given that the simplicity of the movie - it positively avoids anything we've got to call "style" - is to its advantage; and the clear acting of the artists fits in neatly; Gosh, it really feels like a story told of a campfire on a cattle industry - no visual dressing, just the fuss and good humor - and sudden violence - which we expect from the good story of an adventure yarn. I was very pleasantly surprised by this movie, and if the viewer generates expectations, he or she will find great pleasure in doing so. <br /> <br /> I would have given this movie 9 stars, but I'll give it a ten just because most reviewers here have missed the point altogether; and I encourage them to set aside their memories of Boyd and give this movie another chance. Note 1: A reviewer complained that Hopalong was shooting people in this movie rather than shooting the guns out of their hands. (ala Boyd's Cassidy); First, Cassidy shoots people down in the novels; Secondly, if Cassidy were a real cowboy, he would have shot people. The problem with gunguns from people's hands is that they can always get a gun again. This is part of the subtext of this movie. <br /> <br /> Note 2: I admit I am jealous of the Coppola family, that they have the director of "The Godfather" among them, giving them the opportunity to make movies I can't do ; but a good movie is a good movie; And this is a good movie. If it's by someone called "Coppola", well, that's just the way it is. America is the land of opportunity (or was until Bush came into office) - that's what the big American novels are about.
