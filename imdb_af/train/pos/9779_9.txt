Three horror stories based on members of a transgressive Hindu cult who return home but somehow change. In the first story, our former cult member is now in an insane asylum and is visited by a report that wants to find out about what's going on at the cult. Slightly slow as a story is told in flashbacks, while the two sit on chairs and face each other. Reporter is especially interested in what leads to the death of participants. What suddenly looks nice, suddenly becomes very exciting with a surprising twist in the story. Things get quite bloody. <br /> <br /> Second story has a violent young criminal visit to a compulsory therapy psychiatrist. The patient seems to have some sort of agenda, but the psychiatrist is up to the task. Again, things slow down a bit and become strange. Then there is a strange twist in the story that is very well written and surprising. <br /> <br /> Final story deals with spiritual healer who claims to be able to remove people's illness with their hands. One of the patients is a former cult member, so the successful healing becomes more complicated. Again, we are surprised by a twist. There is a pretty gory scene there. <br /> <br /> There are some pretty feminine full frontal nudity as well as male full frontal nudity for some reason. I found the stories to be very well written, and the director is completely ready to set up every story with its surprising twist and the horrific aftermath. <br /> <br /> Note: review of the German DVD.
