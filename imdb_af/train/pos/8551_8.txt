Ten% s and As *, many boobies. A few great characters, fun pranks and well-teamed teen action in this spin of the Amercan Pie franchise. It feels like really old school. It feels a bit like Porkys for the 2000s. Some great funny characters combined with some very humorous situations make this one a real surprise to me. <br /> <br /> While the original cast is all but one, I entertained this movie very much. Let's not get excited, you have to take it for the booby teen comedy, but it's good. The characters are nice and funny, the girls are warmer than hell. The fun and games are hilarious, with a few things I've never seen in comedies, they make me crazy, but laugh at the same time. <br /> <br /> So ignore the haters and give it a go and see what you think. Don't expect the classic American Pie, but expect something to make you laugh and spark your attention for an hour or so.
