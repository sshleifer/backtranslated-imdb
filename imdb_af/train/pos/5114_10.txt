While the urban Cowboy did not contaminate the same testosterone, you could find a rodeo, it has an accurate look at that day and age, in urban Texas. I also think that to really criticize this movie, one should have been in the time and place it was made. There was good music, fun times and, yes, a few "rough and tumbles" at the bas-tonk huts. The relationship between Bud and Sissy, like "two ships passing by at night", is well thought out. When Pam tore the note Sissy wrote to Bud, it repeated the tragedy of many true life romans. The whole story was well thought out. I thought the throw and crew did an excellent job. I thought the screenplay was well written and directed. Scott Glenn had received an Oscar for the best supporting actor.
