I was delighted to see a "Milanese" film shot in Milan. Alessandro Alatri is a Roman director who has properly and happily printed a Milanian philosophy. <br /> <br /> Movie tells the story of a standard in-career Milanese couple, from "the birth" to death. The birth-wedding is so typical of any original scheme that includes all the wedding guests in a flash story of how the couple came together and fell in love. Life is difficult in the "urbe" of Milan and after the delicacies the old days have become harder and harder, and finally the product: a child who, instead of strengthening the couple relationship further, weakened because "the selfish effect "typical of a contemporary" metropolis "personality. The advertising environment with all the "creative" under stress atmosphere helps to get well involved in the plot. We lose the values ​​of life and it is well and deeply reflected in this beautiful and sharp film by the director of Senza Pelle. <br /> <br /> The actors are well-chosen, Stefania Rocca is good and well-marked, and a positive surprise, an unexpectedly good Fabio Volo, known by the "garbage" TV series: Le Iene. <br /> <br /> Rating: 7/10
