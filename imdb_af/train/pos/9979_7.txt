To start with, since this movie is a remake of a classic, the score must already be lowered. Since this release, stars Viggo Mortensen starred in Kowalski's role. <br /> <br /> It's not just like the US government to terrorize one of its own citizens. Sounds like Jason Priestley's character from the movie! But this is the truth, the government will do anything to destroy a man's life trying to go home to his wife. A woman who is in work is no less and cannot make it. <br /> <br /> "There was a time in this country that police would accompany a man to his pregnant wife." The words of Disc Jockey. <br /> <br /> There were some fantastic shots of the scenery in this movie, and a huge car chase and lots of spirituality. After much consideration, I gave this movie a 7.
