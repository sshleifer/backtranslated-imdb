Well, after long anticipation after seeing some tracks on Bravo's The 100 Scariest Movie Moments, I have been waiting a long time to watch this movie. The plot was simple, beautiful model Alison Parker (Cristina Raines) moving in an apartment building that is a gateway to hell. The Sentinel is a right creepy movie, even if it is a bit slow. It's a mix of The Omen and Rosemary's Baby. The acting is good, and there are a few bit of disturbing bits like the awkward orgy scene with the dead father and the female in the middle of the orgy eating cake and laughing. The end is a strange mixture of malformed people and cannibals. This is a very strange, camping, but in the end I really believe a good movie! One of my favorites from the 70's, even though it's nothing very original. It's funny and extremely spectacular! Probably one of my all-time favorites. 9/10
