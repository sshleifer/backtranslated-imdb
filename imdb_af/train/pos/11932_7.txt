I watched this movie on television many years ago and I saw this movie when I got it on tape. I thought it was done pretty well. It wasn't the best of all movies, but it was good enough. The movie has enough talent to inspire many people, especially younger ones. The play was good, with Danny Glover playing the role. The plot line was not very credible, but the writing was well written. This movie may also be the interest of keen baseball fans. It is not directly applicable to an action-packed sports movie. It is directly applicable to a great movie you can see with your family and some messages hidden in this movie. Overall, the movie was good but not good. I give it a movie a 7/10.
