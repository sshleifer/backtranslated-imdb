How can anyone argue the fact that Urban Cowboy was, and still is, the best document of Texas's life for that period? Consider the following: men are hitting their wives, getting drunk at bars, getting married, committing adultery, and competing on mechanical bulls. Try and name a movie that portrays real life alive. They no longer make them. It seems as if current films are always about people with lots of money, they live in big homes, drive expensive cars and work. This movie has a celebration scene about getting a trailer for the sake of marriage! <br /> <br /> Anyway, I watch it at least once a week. Seriously. I analyzed this movie from end to end. Feel free to email me to learn more about my reason for calling it a documentary. Consider the following screens: Bud sees Sissy - they are split - he makes him friendly and waves, she flips him the bird - he turns half of the peace sign lighting his horn to add collision, then tears off. <br /> <br /> Buds call him about. 18 hours after arriving in town on a Sunday to see if he still has a job - everything he has achieved is getting drunk and lying (x2), with the help of his uncle and aunt who covers him. <br /> <br /> "You all live like pigs." Think about why this scene is needed. Think about it. Was it necessary? Couldn't we figure it out without showing the dirty sink? God, I love it! <br /> <br /> Sissy allows West to help her drive the bull. Just a few days (or possibly the next day) after Wes kicked the crap out of her husband. Steve asks - Hey Sissy, remember Wes? Oh yes, you didn't beat my husband the other night, so let's get this lesson, not to mention that she later tried to comfort him in one Bud and Sissy's comfort. in public - in Gilley's! <br /> <br /> The wedding reception photo taking (oh mankind!) can at least arrange or move the chairs out of the way. "My legs are sweatin 'momma". In conclusion, you do not set scenes like this in a movie to prove insight into human psychology. This is a documentary of real life. <br /> <br /> I just wish there was a director's cut.
