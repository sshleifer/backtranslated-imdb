Another masterpiece of Woo! <br /> <br /> This is a best wuxie movie I've ever seen! Woo - RULEZ forever (except some Hollywood moments ...). John Woo - Bigger Director of the Century. Maybe he is no longer intellectual than very big directors. But he is the lyrical and spiritual idol of all freed people! <br /> <br /> Its movies like the great poetry! Woo is a Movie Sheakspeare! Woo is a Movie Biron! Woo is a Mozart or Bloodshet! <br /> <br /> IMHO violent in Woo movies is not a director's bloodlust, but a tool of art. Themes of Woo movies are more humanistic than more of the new movies.
