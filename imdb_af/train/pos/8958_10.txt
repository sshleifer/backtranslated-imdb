After seeing Vertigo, watch Bell, Book and Candle, made within months of each other. <br /> <br /> My second favorite picnic movie, Kim Novak, comes in third. <br /> <br /> All three performances are great, Vertigo, the best of all. <br /> <br /> Nowhere in Kansas Prairie Village, near me, at Salina, Kansas in the 50's, they came to film, Picnic. <br /> <br /> Bell, Book and Candle's musical score, I believe is one of Alex North's. Perfect for this little comedy. <br /> <br /> After Vertigo, Stewart and Novak did this comedy, how entertaining the dramatic contrast was. <br /> <br /> If you like Kim Novak, appreciate your time. The Greta Garbo from my youth.
