Let me start by saying that after this episode for the first time on DVD at 10:00 P.M. One night, I couldn't fall asleep until about 3:00. <br /> <br /> This short overview can include spoilers. <br /> <br /> I'm a long fan of The Sopranos and I can safely say this is the best episode I've ever seen. I'm not saying everyone should feel that way, but I do. This episode is identical to the weekend I spent with my family watching my own father before he passed. <br /> <br /> The episode starts with Tony in an alternative reality: he is a salesman who is mistaken for Identity for a man named Kevin Finnerty. <br /> <br /> By the time ten minutes were over, I knew if Tony was dreaming, or I had another look. It wasn't like the normal Sopranos, and I loved it. <br /> <br /> Option 1 is confirmed when Anthony (or "Kevin") looks in a "helicopter spotlight" and we see prodding, a flashlight doctor. We only see it for a moment and the sequence plays out until we return to real life in a situation similar to the one I just said. <br /> <br /> Tony just got out of the coma for a moment. His sons take A.J. home and karmella, overwhelmed by stress, breaks down in the hallway: a signature moment in the episode. <br /> <br /> For the rest of the episode, we cut between the real world: the family that is potentially facing the negative outcome of this coma, and Tony's alternative reality, which is in line with what is in his mind and in real life. world around him. <br /> <br /> Then comes the star point in the episode: telling AJ closer to his mother he went to school, she walks in to see Meadow sitting at Anthony's side. <br /> <br /> She approaches Tony and gives the best rule of the episode: "Anthony, can you hear us?" In Tony's world he enters a dark hotel room and turns on a light. He took off his shoes and went to the phone. He tried to switch, but he couldn't - as if to say something to Carmella again, but couldn't physically bring himself. Not yet. <br /> <br /> He sits down and looks out of his window. A glittering light repeated by the episode now looks as if he is calling to him from the other side of the city. <br /> <br /> "When it's cold, I want to die" by Moby getting married perfectly with these latest images. and helping to create an emotional roller coaster of an episode. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10. <br /> <br /> PS: Watch the next episode. You get what the light is. It's wonderful.
