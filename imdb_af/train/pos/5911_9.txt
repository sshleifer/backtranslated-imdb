Remember Ralph Bakshi? The guy at Terrytoons then at Paramount Cartoon Studios, then he was a director at Fritz the Cat 1 & 2 and Heavy Traffic? Well, this is Coonskin. And it's actually pretty good. Racist, but good. The film takes place in Harlem Nights. (No, it was a working title.) But with a twist that turns into a lamp from a Disney movie, Song of the South. <br /> <br /> It's about Sampson (Barry White) and Preacherman (Charles Gordone) rushing to help their friend Randy (Philip Michael Thomas) escape from prison but is stopped by a roadblock and in a shooting with the police arrived. While waiting for them, Randy reluctantly listens to co-escaping Pappy (Scatman Crothers), as he tells Randy a story about "Three Guys I Like You and Your Friends". Pappy's story is told in animation against live action background photos and footage. <br /> <br /> Brother Rabbit (Thomas's voice), Brother Bear (Voice of White) and Ecclesiastes Fox (Voice of Gordone) decide to pack and leave their southern institutions after the bank connected their home and sell it a man who changes it into a brothel. When you arrive in Harlem, Rabbit, Bear, and Fox, you find that not everything that made it. They have a kingman called Simple Savior, an ominous revolutionary leader, who is the "cousin" of Black Jesus, and that he "gives his followers the power to kill whites". In a flashy stage performance in his "church," the Savior emerges as a sign of black oppression, represented by images of John Wayne, Elvis Presley and Richard Nixon, before asking his congregation members for donations. <br /> <Rabbit first starts out against Madigan, a violent racist and homophobic white police officer and the businessman for the Mafia, showing his contempt for African Americans in various ways, including a refusal to bathe before there expected meeting with them. believe they are not worth it). When Madigan finds out that Rabbit has taken his payouts, he and his cohorts, Ruby and Bobby, are led to a nightclub called "The Cottontail". <br /> <br /> A black stripper leads him down while an LSD cube is dropped into his drink. Madigan is maneuvered under the influence of his speckled drink into a sexual liaison with a stereotypical slightly gay man, and then moved into clothes that were women representative of the racist archetype, decorated in something racist and ultimately expressed the back of the club where he discovers that Ruby and Bobby are dead. <br /> <br /> When he recovered his delirium to be swollen, his gun shot at random and the police were shot dead after killing one of the shots. them. <br /> <br /> Rabbit, Bear, Fox and the opponent boxer rush out of the boxing arena as it inflates. The live-action story ends with Randy and Pappy escapes while being shot by several white policemen, but alive. <br /> <br /> At that time of release, this movie was controversial, edited by the director Street Fight, which is obvious, as Street Fight is a documentary document on racism in the streets. In fact, this movie has the same subject as the documentary. <br /> <br /> This has eliminated Bryanston Pictures, this movie's distributor and the original Tobe Hopper classic, Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Because Paramount wanted to produce and distribute this film, but because of racism, Bryanston took over Bakshi's production. <br /> <br /> Despite the controversy, it was worth the entertainment. The animation was fantastic at that time, the plot makes sense, and it's actually funny too. <br /> <br /> FINAL VALUE: 9/10
