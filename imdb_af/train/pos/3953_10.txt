I saw this movie on TV when it came out, and it never saw it again. For my life, I couldn't remember the title and I just stumbled upon it while checking Roy Thinne's movie credits. Excellent, dark and haunting TV horror movie in the same class as "Crowhaven Farm"; "Don't be afraid of the dark"; and "Satan's School for Girls", has all lost satanic classics. I also think it has many parallels with Clint Eastwood's classic, High Plains Drifter. Why don't they let go of these big movies, especially if you are considering all the latest garbage filling the discount DVD racks at Wal-Mart? Most of these flakes have a cult effect, so selling shouldn't be a problem.
