Most of the comments are positive, but I would like to add that viewers should also focus on the sets. The set designer uses very beautiful art deco treatments along with beautiful buildings, stairs, doors, furniture and so on. It is worth paying attention to. The movie is powered by characterization and symbolism that is very rich. All the gangster actors were thrown - it was like seeing old friends and it was a surprise. The dialogue was sometimes amusing, but sometimes I stopped and I thought it was so meant. It's a movie movie. It's made by people, for people who like the medium. Do not miss this one.
