I was waiting for this movie to come out in Canada, and when it was finally up, I was very excited to see it. I really enjoyed it. Of course, in the beginning, it's a very sad movie (and it was New Year's Day - still make it sad) - but it bumps into you. The next day I thought about it again, because even though it was so emotionally drained, after a few days you realized that it was such a beautiful story. How one can be seen as the link to so many people, but sometimes you can be blinded to so many things. And how Diane Keaton's character kind of saves the rest of them by just being there. And how they also save her in the process. It was such an excellent movie, and Chris Pine (one of my favorite actors) offers the perfect comic relief. It's definitely a movie that needs a box of tissues, but will stay with you for a long time.
