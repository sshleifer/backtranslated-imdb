Again, I fled through the discount video bin and picked up this movie for $ 4.88. Fifty percent of the time the movies I get in the bakkie is pure crap (I mean terribly out of faith), but half the time it seems surprisingly good. This movie is much better than I expected. I found it very encouraging, although of course it was made by an amateur. <br /> <br /> The direction is nothing special, but the story is intriguing with some good excitement. I expected it to be more of a comedy, but I wasn't too disappointed. <br /> <br /> For a thrill, this movie is surprisingly good-natured. There is no bloody violence, no profanity, no nakedness, no sex. Usually these movies require all four elements. The PG rating is well-deserved - not like "Sixteen Candles" where the "f" word is used twice and there is a short, free postgraduate scene. <br /> <br /> I only wish to develop the romance between Corey Haim and his love interests. The film tends to be plot-heavy, and the potentially good subplots are shifted to the side. Instead of developing a chemistry between the two, we immediately end a three-hour assembly of them on their romantic efforts. They eventually end up kissing, but there is so little chemistry that it is forced. <br /> <br /> "The Drum Machine" is not a gem, but it is good, clean entertainment. It's pretty forgotten - especially with a throw of strangers, except Haim - but it's much better than you'd expect. <br /> <br /> My Score: 7 (out of 10)
