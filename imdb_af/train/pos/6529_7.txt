I was forced to see it because a) I had an 11 year old girl and b) we showed the 1930s Bonita Granville Nacy Drew movies, which she thoroughly enjoyed. Personally, I didn't think it was as humorous as the 1930s, but on the other hand, it wasn't the naughty piece of intelligence-abusive fluff. I was scared it would be. It was an unforeseen, pleasantly entertaining movie. Although I am happy that they did not try to "upgrade" Nancy after the 21st century (Veronica Mars holds the title of Modern Nancy Drew), I think they have mixed up a little, that they do not make it not enough to develop Nancy Drew. The movie could be titled "Jane Doe, Girl Detective". I have to blame the writing: I think every actor did a good job with what they had to do. I like Emma Roberts in this role, but they made her a TV, not released theater, script ...
