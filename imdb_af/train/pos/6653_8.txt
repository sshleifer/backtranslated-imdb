Feroz Khan and Anil Kapoor's Gandhi, My Father, is a good movie that is the confused-to-family side of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and the struggle of his eldest son Harilal Gandhi with society, his larger-than-life father, and Above all, demons in his head. One draws parallels with the nation's father Gandhi, and battles any boy with their father. <br /> <br /> The acting is good. Shefali Shetty, Darshan Zariwala and Akshaye Khanna string in that order - add color and pathos to this heartbreaking story of Harilal, who weeps to cuddle once and run away at the worst touch of the finger. <br /> <br /> Feroz Khan's direction and production noise is soft and attractive, but the script may have been firmer. I saw the play a couple of years ago on a pirate video-type DVD (it was Mahatama versus Gandhi, I guess) and it was definitely more gripping. Even though the movie's background score and dad and mom moments are just a brilliant surprise. <br /> <br /> This movie could have been good. It is bordered by it. It has the potential to be just a story difference between a father and a boy or just Gandhi or even both. Somewhere the plot is lost and if you expect the absolute image of emotions, nothing comes to you. <br /> <br /> It compares properly to other Gandhi's. Certainly not a review movie such as Kingsley's Gandhi, or abstract as Kamal Hassan's Hey Ram. The movie only succeeds in getting its foot; however, one remains to wonder "what if ..." worth a watch. 7.5 / 10
