I love this show. Now, I'm not a big fan of many science fiction shows, so if they look similar to them, I haven't noticed. I like the storybook quality of cinematography. I even love the love story, although I enjoy it, I wonder how much of the story really can develop, since Ned can't touch Chuck or anything else. Well, you know. I even like Chuck, I don't find her annoying and I usually hate cute, nice, perfect characters. I even like the narrator's voice, even if it bothered one of my relatives and a bit like some Walgreens ads. I can talk about the other things about Ned's trouble and how the writers will address it in the future, but I look rather and wait and see what story the writers are weaving.
