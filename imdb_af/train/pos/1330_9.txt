How nice my little French man tells a story that is alternately sad, scary and life-satisfying. It ends with a brutal final that you knew to happen, though you did hope - maybe even experience it. <br /> <br /> Extremely, it's the movie's greatest power: it plays skillfully with your emotions and expectations, then drops a bomb on you. <br /> <br /> I saw it in a mid-90s film theory class at USC. It's not easy to find, but is definitely worth hunting.
