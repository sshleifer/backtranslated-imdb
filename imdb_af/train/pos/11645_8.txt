I was in France around March 05, and I love these Film festivals. I knew about this cinema d'Am√©rique Latine de Toulouse, but I never went there. I decided to go and then I caught Cero y of 4. <br /> <br /> The movie is stunning. It didn't cause me the impact of Mexican users, as it was French subtitles, but it was still shocking. <br /> <br /> This movie is a satire on urban violence, on kidnapping and street crime. in Mexico. It is a rough portrait of the city. From a Metropole. Secuestro Express, with a beautiful Mia Maestro, which was also almost a satire of kidnapping, but with a more serious tone, and I think so, a bit related to Cero y of 4. A, kind of redemption story and that how much is too much? Man on Fire, who was amazingly strong, was also not a satire, but a rough portrait in the streets of Mexico. Or it's like The Brave One. A movie that shocks and hits you in the intestines very hard. It's like The Usual Suspects, it has a few weeks and turns, but it makes it even more credible. Pronunciation: A slide that shocks and lets you believe there is no more street security. Beautiful dialogue, impressive direction and amazing performances. Cero y of 4 is a movie you won't soon forget. Let yourself be shaken and amazed.
