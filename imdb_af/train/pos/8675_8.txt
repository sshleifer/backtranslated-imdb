Without being one of my favorites, it's good to change pace ... even if it's just for a few minutes. <br /> <br /> It all starts with a big battle between Tom, Jerry and Spike (who is renamed "Butch" here). They are all beating each other, but Spike suddenly makes a heroic and admirable decision: he stops the fight and suggests they should all be friends. So, everyone signs a peace treaty and becomes friends ... who won't last long. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the three are loving, patient and kind to each other. They even save each other when one of them is life-threatening. The ratio is nothing short of excellent until a very large steak appears and they all become greedy. The three are guilty of returning to their regular battles and rivalry. <br /> <br /> But still ... to see Tom, Jerry and Spike as friends, is truly a wonderful and grateful experience, even if it's just a while. <br /> <br /> Oh, by the way, as a strange fact, two songs from "The Wizard of Oz" are played here in instrumental versions: "We're going to see the wizard" and "Somewhere on the rainbow".
