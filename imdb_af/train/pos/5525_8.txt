Many of the problems that many people have with this movie are that they seem to think the story should be more entertaining (ignore it is based on a real story) or rant against a movie that glorifies Che (which really doesn't not). This movie is very close to Jon Anderson's definite bio on Che and gets the story right. Soderburgh is doing an excellent job of setting the mood for the unsettling debacle that Che's Bolivian adventure was. You really get the impression of the total indifference and confusion of the Bolshos farming on Che's revolutionary ideas or of the problems faced by his men's famine and terrain. Sorry to wear the addict movie fan out there, but that's how it happened. So don't go into this movie expecting a Rambo shoot em up, it's a real story!
