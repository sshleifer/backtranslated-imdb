Well, I was a teenager when I saw the movie. The songs were a big hit, but the elite class returned govinda movies, and then I watched govinda and karishma (aka karizma) movies not the thing for that 'class', but anyway a lot of people liked it as the series of these movies went through the 90's and most of them were successful. Today I watched it again for a long time and remember, there were long-standing old people and the riot they created. when the aa uo uo o song came on the screen .... the govinda and karishma dresses were complementary to each other (the worst gown duo of that time). Good charisma transformed in the late 90's, but govinda was still very faithful to his designer if his garment was the same ... but back then it was all mixed it was all good. everything worked and slowly the elite class realized how fun it was and then ..... there was no look back for this jodi as it went on to set up the Indians by some but loved by the masses. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a good time with nothing to rent or watch it on TV, you don't think you'll regret it ... but remember it's the worst of it best. <br /> <br /> I still watch those movies when I get time, I can't stop laughing ... so I say go ahead and enjoy a good time because there are times when we all love foolishness and especially when done by the kings of their time, it is surely visible ... I recommend it to all movie lovers ...
