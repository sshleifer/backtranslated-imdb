This movie may look dated today, but remember that it was made in 1974 - before Saturday Night Live, before Howard Stern, back when George Carlin was just outside the Hippie Dippie Weatherman and in heavy satirical humor. This movie is the grandfather of them all. Enjoy it for its historical significance, as well as its strong entertainment value.
