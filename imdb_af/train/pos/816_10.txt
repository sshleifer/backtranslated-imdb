First, I would like to say that, while I know my part about star wars, I'm not a fanatic. I don't know how many chromosomes a Wamp Rat has, or the extended family of TK427. What I know is this: Star wars, all the movies (less so with episode 2 though), caught something magical. It's hard to say what Lucas found and printed voluntarily, but it works. Star Wars is more than a movie. this is an idea. <br /> <br /> How can you ask? I'll explain. Star wars become the most universal of stereotypes, good to evil. It does so naturally, so deeply, that literally any person from any environment can understand. Episode VI makes the good fight between a boy and his useful and manipulated father, but also with the addition of the prequels, even more to the enlightened story. Suddenly it's Darth Vader in front, and viewers realize it's Anakin's story, not just Luke. but even for 1-3 there was incredible depth. It really feels as if the capsule has fallen off Lucas's lap and hides a historical version of a galaxy far away. <br /> <br /> Star Wars is definitely far above the norm, and I must admit, when I see them, especially this one, I feel very small. I feel as if I have been placed in a world where good and evil are so clearly defined. I get a tingling sensation when I see them, a feeling that something touched me somehow than any physical thing could ever hope for.
