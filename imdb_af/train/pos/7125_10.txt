Goodnight Mister Tom is so beautifully filmed and beautifully realized. It is not entirely true to the book, but should it be? No at all. John Thaw is fascinating as Tom Oakley. His transformation of abomination into caring was so well realized, making it more credible than Scrooge in Christmas Carol. After Inspector Morse, it's Thaw's best hour. He was seriously succeeded by a young Nick Robinson, who traumatized a thoroughly convincing portrayal of an evacue by the abusive relationship with his mother. The writing and music made the purchase worthwhile, and you also see that Thaw plays the organ. Amazing! The most moving scene, Willie, found out about Zak's death, and then Tom told him of his late family who died of Scarlatina. Buy it, you will love it! 10/10 Bethany Cox
