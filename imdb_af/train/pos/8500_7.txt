Surprised to see the low score for this movie. I saw this movie for the first time in 10 years and was reminded why I liked it. <br /> <br /> Come back with my kids, until a time when Michael Keaton was a straight comedian, and you might find some joy in this movie. It's a gentle comedy - the kind of Ron Howard specializes in - but if it's your thing, look it up. Keaton's low key charm is just right for this project. <br /> <br /> "Gung Ho" is a bit dated because it takes places in the last stage of the global economy where it still matters what country where a business was established. It said that laughing, as well as a lesson on how people can learn from each other, is of great benefit. <br /> <br /> You can watch this movie and enjoy it without remembering one In particular, you liked a lot of acting, but this is because the whole movie gives a slow but constant stream of laughs . It's like an I.V. drip. And I mean it in a good way.
