Any story consists of a foreground, characters and conflict. Characters who plan their own play promise to triumph, and a militant character easily gives it to them. Ardh Satya's premise is summed up by the poem of the same name written by Dilip Chitre. The line goes - "I like napunsaktha, which is the best in my paurush, what is it you want, or not?". A rough translation - "The delicate balance of right and wrong (generally seen on the bust of blind justice in the courts) has powerlessness on one plate and another person. Is the needle in the middle half a truth?" <Br /> <br /> The poem is reserved halfway through the film by Smita Patil to Om Puri at a restaurant. This deeply impacts on the protagonist and lays the foundation for many of the subsequent events that follow. At the end of the film, Om Puri ends up in exactly the same situation as appropriately described in the poem. <br /> <br /> The movie is trying very hard to make one on the poem. However, Chitre's words are too powerful, and at best, the film fits into the poem in every respect. <br /> <br />
