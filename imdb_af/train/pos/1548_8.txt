Fortunately, to know nothing about this movie, I was curious enough to paste it from TV. And then the band came out just five minutes before the end! <br /> <br /> But I'm glad I managed to get the most out of it, because it's a huge spy movie. There are the usual toy submarines and some foggy plots, but also very chilly and even daring moments. Mainly with the 1969 production year, some small lesbian overtones have to erect some eyebrows. Of course it is not surprising anyone and those scenes actually look beautiful, beautiful. And it's not just because of the two George's actresses. <br /> <br /> The gas attack looks very powerful for every viewer, no wonder. And that certainly struck me. Very effective. Also, the views of the two sides of the opponents give the whole story more depth alongside the usual tension and action. Not only is it a heroic war story of one victorious side, but it shows what is good and bad behind the victory. Well, a case of war, mostly bad. <br /> <br /> For fans of composer Ennio Morricone it is also a must. His work is always excellent, touching, but never over the top. And I think I should try to catch more movies with Suzy Kendall. Talk about Fr√§ulein! Let's hope they get it on DVD soon, so I can have the whole movie in my collection and more people will become familiar with this very little known jewel.
