It was a wonderful comedy with a great role to play. John Ritter and Katey Sagal were perfectly thrown as parents, and the kids were also good. Kaley Cuoco was a good choice to play Bridget, who was a finished version of Kelly Bundy from Getroud with Kids. The writing and performances were both top notch. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, John Ritter died in the series, and it made a damper on things. They had to scramble to change the show and bring in more role players, and that was, of course, an awkward situation, but they handled it well. James Garner was a great addition. It could have been longer if Ritter lived. <br /> <br /> I especially loved it when they brought Ed O'Neill into a guesthouse. It was wonderful. <br /> <br /> *** from ****
