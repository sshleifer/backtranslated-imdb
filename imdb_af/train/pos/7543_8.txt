this is a visual adaptation of manga with very little dialogue. What dialogue is there, appears in word boxes as it would be in the manga. The plot of this is existent, but only vaguely justified. There is an issue of the manga on which it is based in English available in the explosion books collection, 'comics underground japan', and it has a real caption dialogue that explains the plot a little more than here. I recommend checking the volume if you like, as it explains some of the "plot" of the movie, which is otherwise inexplicable. animation way it is fairly decent, good unpleasant use of computers and the images are largely realized. It jumps in and out of episodes, such as the characters, a cat and its brain-dead parent in and out of a series of strange images wandering: a boat, a circus, a desert. For half an hour they go through a number of semi-sites and institutions, which make me believe that the director has chosen a number of long-term manga issues to arbitrarily adjust, but primarily selected. To know what's going on can greatly increase appreciation. It mostly reminds me of the kind of things they play on the mtv show, cartoon sushi, especially a short one that contains a cat chasing a man's cut batting cheek around the house. Just in this case, the cats look more than hello kitty and their adventure is expanded to include death and reincarnation and a number of other themes [even though it's not easy to tell what's going on]. The DVD of this one has director's comments and a "make up" feature, but I can't comment on that because I didn't come to them. I give it an 8/10 for now, here is not much to compare it to anime, and I hope for more like this.
