Well, I must say it was one hell of a fun movie. Despite the fact that the dubbing was pretty cheesy, and there were some strange moments where the movie seemed to be dark blue for no apparent reason, I wasn't disappointed. The story was actually quite interesting: the last member of the poison clan must find and discover the other five members who use their skills for evil and who use it for good. The catch that was in training was masked by the whole clan, and everyone has since returned to society in disguise and changed their names. <br /> <br /> The fighting is a joy to watch, as every member of Clan has a different fighting style: frog (my favorite), snake, scorpion, lizard and centipede. The combat scenes have the actors everywhere in the place, and the camera is happily planted and uses a wide shot so you can see the action clearly. <br /> <br /> The one downside to the movie is that the story tends to drag a little in the first half to the first battle series. But stick to it and you won't be disappointed!
