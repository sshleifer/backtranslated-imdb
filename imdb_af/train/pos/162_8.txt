For a "no budget" movie, this thing rolls. I don't know if America will find it, but we laughed throughout. Some very funny, funny things. Really non-Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The Actors and Music shook. The cars and gags and even the less in your face we cracked. Whooo Whooo! <br /> <br /> I've seen the actors before, but never in such a thing, one or two of them, I think I saw in advertising or something somewhere. Actually, it's Rocked! Luckily I got a copy of a friend from one of the actors.
