"Winchester '73" is the first of a series of westerns including James Stewart and director Anthony Mann. As in most of them, Stewart's hero has a violent rand that threatens to explode at any time. <br /> <br /> The title refers to a "one in a thousand" rifle held at a rifle shooter Dodge City on July 4, 1876. In the city comes Lin McAdam (Stewart) and his sidekick High Spade (Millard Mitchell), who is on the trail of Dutch Henry Brown (Stephen McNally) for a fierce deadly act. They arrive just in time to see Marshal Wyatt Earp (Will Geer), Saloon Girl Lola (Shelley Winters) out of town. It appears that Dutch Henry is also in the village for the gunshot. Lin and Dutch Henry shoot it out for the coveted prize with Lin winning, but Dutch Henry robs Lin of the gun and escapes. <br /> <br /> Lin and High Spade Trail Dutch Henry across the country where they meet Lola with her cowardly beauwerie Steve Miller (Charles Drake) stops at an American Cavalry Camp awaiting the attack by the Indians, under Young Bull's lead (Rock Hudson), who received the prized gun by killing the murderous runner John McIntyre. He got the weapon by cheating Dutch Henry on poker. Young bull is killed during the attack and the gun goes to Steve. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, back at the farm, Lola and Steve meet the infamous armed Waco Johnny Dean (Dan Duryea) who kills Steve and takes the prized gun and Lola for himself. When Dean meets him with Henry Henry, he allows him to plan his "gun" to kill him later. In the town of Tuscosa, Lin, the Dean kills Dutch Henry's plan to keep the bank, goes bad and he escapes Lin into the hills. In one of the best final shoot outs ever, the two meet in the final action. <br /> <br /> I believe this movie was the only one of the Stewart / Mann collaborations shot in B&W. It is beautifully photographed, especially the screens in the "wide open spaces" and especially the final build. Stewart is playing against the type, playing the hero with a violent motion rim, an emotion he will wear in future films with Mann. <br /> <br /> As in most universal westerns, this one boasts a seasoned seasoned veterans and contract players. In addition to those mentioned above, JC Flippen appears as the cavalry sergeant, Steve Brodie, James Millican, John Doucette and Chuck Roberson as several henchmen, Ray Teal as the sheriff who is Duryea, Tony Curtis and James Best as smoking money and Edmund Cobb, Chief Yowie and John War Eagle in different roles in the Dodge City order. <br /> <br /> A classic Western in every sense of the word. It was responsible for repeating Stewart's career as an action star.
