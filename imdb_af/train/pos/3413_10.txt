Just got out and can't believe what a brilliant documentary is. Rarely do you walk out of a kiosk in such awe and astonishment. Earlier, movies were so elevated that the excitement of something special and unique is rare. Amores Perros did this for me when it first came out and this movie is doing me now. I didn't know anything about it until I entered and what a surprise. If you hear the concept, you can feel that it is one of those sensitive movies about a wonderful triumph over the top music and trying to fully convince us of what a good story tells it, but not let us in. Fortunately, it's not that movie. The people tell the story! It is such a good job to capture every moment of their involvement as we enter their world and feel with them every second. There is so much above the climb that makes everything they go through so much more tension. Touching the Void was also a good documentary about mountain climbing and intensity in an impressive way, but this film is much more of a human story. I saw it today, but I'll go and say it's one of the best documentaries I've ever seen.
