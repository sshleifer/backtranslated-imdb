It's a complex documentary that shows many things about early Gay life. To put it in perspective, it was when Gay spoke for the gay sexual revolution, not just Gay as a descriptor. Or is it still used today? I believe most of the films came from about 1968 to 1989. It was released in 1993. It was all around. <br /> <br /> I was touched by the documentary capture of one man's love for another over a strange year. A love expressed in ways that can only be true love. There are many scenes of incredible empathy and pain, along with scenes of joy and pleasure. There are scenes of life as a gay sex and life as a gay. The movie itself was a work of love, and I believe it is a diamond. <br /> <br /> At least one of these films will gain an understanding of the devastating impact of AIDS. As I write it, I think how much earlier this movie was to me. The advances in medical, political and social sciences and culture that have taken place since this film (about 15 years ago) are incredible. But of course, in the case of AIDS disease itself, we are not yet ready. Heck I think we're not done on all fronts. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's just a nice, good documentary. I want to encourage someone who feels they don't understand gay life, gay issues or the destruction of AIDS to see this movie.
