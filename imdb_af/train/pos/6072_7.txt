Branagh and Fishburne deliver outstanding performances in this version of the Shakespeare classic. Branagh plays Iago better than I saw the character in film or on stage. Some people may say this movie is exaggerated Iago-centric, but I disagree. Fishburne, the first black Othello in film history ironically, delivers a powerful performance. Fishburne has always been a good actor, but this performance as the Moor of Venice can be one of its best. <br /> <br /> The one problem I have with this movie is the simple subtraction of a number of important scenes. Desdemona's character is given far less depth than she has in the play. In this movie she can't be added at all. One of the worst tracks Branagh made in this film was the deduction of a conversation between Iago and Desdemona at the start of the second act. This part of the play shows that Desdemona may not be the innocent child she portrays as in this movie. There were a number of deductions that hurt the integrity of this movie. <br /> <br /> But if you haven't read the play or seen a movie version of Othello before, I recommend this movie. The story, cut or not, is still incredibly captivating. The acting, as mentioned before, is very good. If some important scenes were added, and Desdemona's character was slightly prioritized, it would be a good movie. As it stands, it's still an admirable version of the original. I give it a marginal recommendation.
