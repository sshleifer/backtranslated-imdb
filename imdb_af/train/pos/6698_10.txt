I loved Sabrina The Teenage Witch and saw every episode. I remember sitting at 6pm every night waiting for Nickelodeon to come, but when Sabrina left high school, the show began to descend. The best series should be when his friends were with Valerie (I'm not sure which one is). From there, the next series (friends with Dreama) was still really good, but when she left high school, it didn't seem right. All the main characters turned out to mean that it didn't have as much of the old "sparkle", but the first series where Sabrina is at school is still relatively good and viewable, but then her aunt left and Sabrina move In their home it is just not right. She is no longer a teenager, so the name of the show isn't right and without Hilda and Zelda and Josh the show doesn't look right, especially if Sabrina marries almost anyone who isn't Harvey. Thanks, he went through the last five minutes of the last episode to take her away. All in all, I like to watch the old episodes of Sabrina the Teenage Hitch, but I think the authors took it too far and had to leave it with Sabrina who left high school. Because after that the show certainly lost some of its magic
