I really enjoyed watching this movie! Initially, seeing his poster, I thought it was just another easy romantic comedy. But it's just more than that! I personally believe that this idea (which was probably a good part of the viewers just before they saw the movie) is another important part of the great concept of this movie itself (or even of its marketing strategy)! What I mean is: Today we are slaves to images! About Impressions! I went to the cinema to see this movie that has the wrong impression, the wrong expectations, and in the end I felt how superficial I could be! To illustrate, come to me the order near the end in which Sidney buys the plane ticket to go back to New York and if he is asked to sign, which means he has to sign for the ticket, he believes Just because he was on TV thanks to the scandal at the awards he is now a kind of celebrity. And that's just, I believe, the highlight of this main theme that the movies revolve around. In addition, I believe the film also offers us a solution to go with it, illustrated in the film by Sidney's attitude: don't get too serious about yourself or anyone else ... "even saints were people in the beginning". .. as Sophie once says in the movie. The saints of the moment are the stars. We write them an 'aura' of perfection, of eternal happiness, but reality is much less than that. Even the saints of any religion are images, ideal models of how to act and how to live your life. Even they weren't really ... they became "real" after they died and looked back. And this is the catch: we need our saints! we need our stars! We strive for them as if it is not for them, we will have nothing to strive for. And television and all other media is the way to create and capture our pursuit. We need desperate measures to measure ourselves. And that's how we got in the movie to watch this movie in the first place: to see if we can fit the benchmark, or if the benchmark for us is small. This time it was bigger than we expected.
