I have doubts about another love story in which disabled individuals find meaning and salvation through honest communication. And it's not yet my list. But the performances of Helena Bonham Carter and Kenneth Branagh and exemplary, almost stunning, save it to be just another tear. Carter's portrayal of an ALS victim is strong, perhaps even exaggerated at times (sometimes her dialogue is resolved into indiscriminate mutilation). But the overall effect is laudable and rewarding. Branagh can be the perfect compliment to her performance. <br /> <br />
