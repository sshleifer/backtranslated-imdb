I found this show very late at night and tried it. This is a refreshing change of other kinds of things that occur late at night if you catch my drift. The simplicity of values ​​and sweetness of heart help me remember how friendships were like children. It's something I enjoy when I find it (which is scarce, maybe I should have the lists! Haha) ..... and the tension between Joe and Nick is so cute. Like any good chick, you really get emotionally involved with the characters. Good o 'Louisa May Alcott continues to inspire good stories :) So apparently I have to complete 10 lines of text so my opinion is valid, so I think I'll tell you a little more. The kids are played by talented actors and actresses, and the institutions are beautiful and natural. Another thing you don't see much on television. I hope everyone gives it a chance. I acknowledge and am fully aware that it is juicy, but it is good heart. As I said before, it is refreshing.
