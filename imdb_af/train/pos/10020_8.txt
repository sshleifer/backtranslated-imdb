The legendary Boris Karloff ended his illustrious career by making four inexpensive scarecrows in Mexico. This is the token moody period Gothic horror entry of the bunch. Karloff gives a typical leap and dignified performance as Matthias Morteval, an elderly eccentric patriarch who invited some of his small, greedy and sincere relatives to his creepy castle for reading a will. The hateful guests are being pushed by deadly life-size toy people populated by the place. Onetime Mexican sex symbol Andres Garcia of "Tintorera" infamy depicts the dashing police officer and Julissa looks absolutely surprising as the only kind of female character. The turbulent, undecided (non) direction, trite by-the-numbers essay, ugly, washed-out cinematography, ridiculous murderous gossip (a brutal gig is blown by a miniature gun!), Bad dark dream atmosphere, largely common (Karloff specially singled out), cheesy soft gore, poor dubbing and exciting fiery conclusion, this delicious lemon lends a certain impressive cruddy and therefore strangely entertaining rotten charm. A true camping hoot.
