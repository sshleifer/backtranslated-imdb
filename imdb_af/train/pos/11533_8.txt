This movie, which starts with an interesting opening of two hot blondes getting it in the back of a driver-less moving vehicle, has quite the odd little personality to start. The film of seven (although one girl does not hang around for the body account, which is unfortunate because the death toll is already so small) is all super-warm, as our story around teens exchanging views in the desert (a strange but effective choice of institution), pursued by a creepy man in black gloves and jeans driving a black truck. It runs many of the vehicle-inspired slashers to date ("The Trip", "Joy Ride", "Jeepers Creepers") where the killer's vehicle itself becomes an evil antagonist. The murderer himself is very creepy and we find comfort in Jennifer McAllister (look at the interesting symbolic contrast of the evil killer in all blacks, while our benevolent heroine is all white clothes, as thin and stonewashed as it may be). Director Bill Crain does some very good things with his camera, some neat tricks on the screen, and the throws try their absolute best. There are plenty of gores in the low body account to encourage the gore fans, and enough T&A from some of the girls, to please T & A fans. Overall, this movie is highly understated and widely searched in the slasher movie world, as it seems quite rare to find video. Highly recommended.
