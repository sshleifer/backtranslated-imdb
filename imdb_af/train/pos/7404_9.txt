Recently saw the Australian premiere of Douche [Xizhao] at the Sydney Film Festival. The program notes said it was - a perfect joy - beautiful, touch, amusing, dramatic and poignant meaningful. I couldn't agree anymore. I just hope the rest of the festival movies will come to this standard of entertainment and I'm looking forward to seeing more Chinese films shown in Sydney in the coming months.
