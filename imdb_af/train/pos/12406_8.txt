A protracted prison, which has been closed for over 20 years, is reopened and Ethan Sharpe (the empty, big-character actor Lane Smith), once a guard there, is being replaced by the officer. While the prisoners are being set up to erect the place, they are instructed to break into the old execution room. It unleashes a fiery spirit that ruthlessly causes destruction on both guards and prisoners; cool-as-can-be-lower-key-prisoner Burke (Viggo Mortensen, who shows real relationships in an early role) is in the role of hero. <br /> <br /> I know it's a no-brainer to film the movie for it's atmosphere (it's shot in a real abandoned estate near Rawlins, Wyoming), but it raises this horror movie to a higher level . It has a good sense of premonition, which has been established right from the start. Director Renny Harlin made his fourth direct effort; It won him the "Nightmare on Elm Street 4" and effectively started an impressive career in mainstream action films, thrillers and horror movies. <br /> <br /> It may have characters, but it has a capable role for Chelsea Field as the young woman fleeing prison reform, Lincoln Kilpatrick as a brave veteran, condemns Cresus, Tom Everett as a restless king Rabbitt, Ivan Kane as the outgoing Lasagne, Tommy "Tiny" Lister as a gentle spoken giant Tiny, and Arlen Dean Snyder as captain Horton. It is also worth noting as an early acting credit for Kane Hodder (as the inventive spirit) who helped him play Jason Voorhees' game in the "Friday 13th" series. <br /> <br /> Good special effects moody lighting courtesy of productive genre movie maker Mac Ahlberg, haunting music by Richard Band and Christopher Stone, great footage, the incredibly gloomy place, and an overall flashy and intense presentation help to make it quite entertaining. It is nasty, gruesome and fun for a horror fan. <br /> <br /> 8/10
