The Groove Tube was initially shown on video, in the first "video theaters" here in Boston. In one room there were TV monitors on high stands, with old movie seats, in small groups looking out at the monitors. There were old fridges equipped with Pepsi, and baskets of York Peppermint Patties. In a second, smaller room, there were no seats, just big pillows. It was the 'smoking room', that is, people got into it. This act only contributed to the hilarity of the video. <br /> <br /> I was a "regular viewer"; The screens I liked the most and remember to this day are: Koko The Clown, The Kramp Family Kitchen (Kramp Easy-Lube Shortening), Safety Sam / VD PSA, the Chevy Chase Crocker w / Nude Walk Through the Forest, Finger Ballet that is eventually revealed to be the naked body of a woman. The last item was reminiscent of the late, amazing Ernie Kovacs. Now I have lost many readers under 48 ("who is Ernie Kovacs ??"), but trust me, it's funny things. <br /> <br /> One reason I was a "regular viewer" was that I, and my friends, would bring other "Groove Tube" virgins to see it. We will see the faces of the "virgins" as the "Safety Sam" PSA. As the camera slowly dreams 'Sam', we'll wait for it "OH!" of recognition on the virgin's face. Each time was more hilarious than the last. And then that virgin will bring a friend to see the show, and repeat what we've done. To get this joke, you need to watch the video. <br /> <br /> Yes, some of them are dated, but most plays, movies, television and videos are now. Just look for any video made in the 1980s. <br /> <br /> I saw "The Groove Tube" in a theater as a movie, a grain transfer of the original video. The first "Saturday Night Live" show, with Chevy Chase, immediately received comments from "This is the man of" The Groove Tube ", so it was a forerunner to Chevy. <br /> <br /> I can don't look at a tin can without hearing the voice, "cover your hands with a large amount of Kramp Easy-Lube shortening ..." and think of the "Kramp Holiday Loaf" recipe. in the grocery store. <br /> <br /> The early 70's were perfumed times, "The Groove Tube" was fresh, new and really got the humor of the times, offering a "hip generation", humor which was not available in any other format / medium
