I had about the worst day of my life. Then I stumbled upon this cute movie, watched it, and now I'm ready to go out and kiss a streetlight. <br /> <br /> I have to admit, I just watched it for 2 reasons: VERA ELLEN'S LEGS. But it's really so much more. The plot is actually pretty smart and creatively woven. It's almost like a Shakespeare comedy with all its wonderful misunderstandings. And of course there is ... VERA ELLEN'S BEN. <br /> <br /> The only unfortunate aspect of this movie is that the version I purchased (the "100 Family Classics" collection by Mill Creek Entertainment) does not have the best video quality, and I have the same audience about the Alpha edition. The brightness and contrast are a bit too high, so many of the screens look blurry especially when Vera is dancing in a white dress. But I suppose you can fail with the controls on your TV. I can only imagine how it looked on the big screen in '51. The scenes, costumes and colors are otherwise brilliant and beautifully creepy - kind of in a "Dr. Caligari Cabinet". <br /> <br /> Regarding romance, it's just perfect. Not juicy, not confronted, not melodramatic. Not 100% ahhhhhh. Sorry, your poor schmucks, your miserable lives will never be as charming as this. Has has. Wait, what am I laughing at? My life sucks just as bad as yours. Oh hell. Time to watch this movie again.
