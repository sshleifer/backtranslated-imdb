Picture Bride has an excellent look at Hawaii's past and the people who lived there at the time. Time, money, and the hours these people spent in their lives to survive and live take a whole new meaning to blood, sweat and tears. <br /> <br /> The concept of dating / matchmaking is something we do today via the net today. Just this is more of snail mail. Very slow snail mail. <br /> <br /> The song of the plantation's songs from the workers reminds me of the southern plantation workers' songs of their demise and future goals. <br /> <br /> The movie shows the hardships as well as soft romantic scenes that Hawaii can bring. Like the silence of a storm coming and the sudden chaos of the rain and then the tranquility.
