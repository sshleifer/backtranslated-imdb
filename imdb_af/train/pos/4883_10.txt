We were as a family so happy with 'The Last of the Blonde Bombshells', we bought a copy for our home library. <br /> <br /> The play is A1 and the movie features many favorite actors and singers. The theme is unusual and the writing is well written. The music / songs are timeless and take us back to our young days when we sang the songs on top of our voices. To sketch the story about this, the plot will spoil, as it is really nice to sit back and enjoy the story as it unfolds. <br /> <br /> Full points for this most enjoyable and uplifting production and we warmly recommend it to anyone looking for a stomach-laugh and a lot of music.
