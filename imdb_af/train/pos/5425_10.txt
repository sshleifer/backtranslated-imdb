This and not a slightly overestimated Southern Soap Opera was the biggest episode to come out of Hollywood's biggest year 1939. I will not give the obvious Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen (a Bengal Lancer) and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. wonderful comic performances. Yet I would like to note two other, less understandable elements of this masterpiece. The wonderful final battle sequence, like the amazing Sam Jaffe climbs to the center of the temple to blow his bug and warn the regiment, is simply great. It never fails me to encourage me. Another understated feature in the film is Eduardo Ciannelli's performance as the Guru. It is not a character of Fu Manchu, but a well-drawn, articulate, historically informed ("Have you ever heard of Changruputra Maurya? He defeated the armies in India by Alexander The Great"). Indeed, one can see parallels between this mystical, evil nationalist and a certain well-known figure of the thirties (a German, not an Indian). Gunga Din, anti-Nazi channel? Not quite. But still, a tremendous, funny, moving epic.
