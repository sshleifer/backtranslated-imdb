Paulie was cute, cool, enjoyable and fairly satisfying. I went to this movie to see a typical "family" movie, one that will get me unconscious and on the floor within moments. My mind changed immediately when I was quickly caught by the film's health. It is rare that you get a family movie that is thorough and healthy. Most are made cheap, written and manufactured purely to attract young relatives. They will then drag the unfortunate elders with a thought that has abandoned 65 minutes of overused eyelids and plots. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, Paulie has a plot. It tells the story of a young girl (Marie) and her best friend Paulie the parrot, who could talk incredibly and kept regular conversations with her. Marie's brave jerk father found this incredible and thought Paulie was damaged for his 4-year-old daughter's mental health and quickly tore them apart. We follow Paulie's adventures (and misadventures) as he attempts to reunite with his beloved owner and meet many unforgettable characters along the way. Oh yes, Paulie could really (smartly) speak and had a quick New Jersey accent. Cool. The plot was kept thick and entertained throughout and attracted me. Paulie is the best family movie I have found and enjoyed. Ever. Seriously. Pick up a copy and sit back and enjoy a real family movie with the whole family. No sleep. I promise.
