It's been a long time since I saw this mini-series and I am pleased to say that its memorable merit has withstood the test of time. <br /> <br /> Most of the components of a perfect spy, adapting LeCarré's best novel, are, in my opinion, the top draw. Outstanding aspects of this are the musical score and the masterful script, the latter written by Arthur Hopcraft, who was also Alec Guinness's screenwriter for 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy' a few years earlier. <br /> <br /> The actors are mostly very good, some are great, like Alan Howard's Jack Brotherhood and Ray McAnally's Ricky Pym. Peter Egan is fascinating to watch because his face changes with every camera angle. Over time and the effect on the physical appearance of the characters has been very credible. So much so that I wonder exactly how old Peter Egan was at the time of filming. The only stumbling block comes after the character of Magnus Pym was transferred from the particular hands of a young actor Benedict Taylor to that of a remarkably old Peter Egan, just fresh from Oxford. But it is a small and unimportant seam as a whole. <br /> <br /> Egan has difficulty convincingly when the text becomes melodramatic and he must be emotionally "upset", ie crying. None of the actors has a very easy time with these moments, except for the wonderful Frances Tomelty who plays Peggy Wentworth for everything she's worth and steals the episode with ease. <br /> <br /> Jane Booker is annoying as Mary Pym. She has a part of the character under her skin, but often displays an amateur-like petulance that diminishes her as a tough cookie diplomatic housewife, which Mary Pym is. Rüdiger Weigang is wonderful as Axel, amusing, ironic and brilliant. I also enjoyed Sarah Badel's camp as the Baroness. <br /> <br /> The British view of Americans is lively in some dry hilarious scenes. When the Yanks came abroad to confront with Bo Brammell (head of MI6), the US contingent is portrayed as head-to-head buffalo who have apparently memorized very long words from the Dictionary and liberated them with American jargon and psychobabes. to the bemused scorn of the English. <br /> <br /> The humor and sadness are subtly mixed. LeCarré has the ability to mix different elements in his stories and Hopcraft has captured the melancholy, but capricious, atmosphere of the original, brilliantly. <br /> <br /> Not a perfect production (what is?) And yet the best of the LeCarré adjustments to date to reach movie or television. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended to all spy-thriller enthusiasts and especially LeCarré fans. DVD available at Acorn.
