The first episode immediately gave a good impression of what to expect from the series! Mysteries are waiting to be solved and very good drama! I love the fact that they gradually announce the characters about the characters! Just explain enough to stay excited! Of course, this display has some bugs! In the first two series, there are a few characters that may not appear in the third season for some reason! Many characters have been sent off properly, but some are just not there! Like Rose and her husband! Where the hell are they? What happened to them? Maybe they will return in later episodes! But it's a bit inconsistent! It is said that "Lost" manages every episode (especially the first two seasons)! This is a very difficult thing to do! I note that in the third season the focus is more on character development than the mysterious aspects of the show! It's not a bad thing! It even saves some episodes to get boring! One of the elements that can be seen as the strength of this show is the wonderful characters! You will grow to love these characters! Good or bad! But in the end, I want some puzzles to be solved and closed! The danger of 'Lost' being canceled due to declining ratings is close! And it would be devastating!
