I can't believe this movie is rated a 6.9. Anyway, this movie was probably one of the most appealing real Indian movies I've ever seen. It was really refreshing to see a movie showing traditional family cinema. Regarding the story, I thought it was wonderful, it was about shahid kapur who was set up on a regular marriage with amrita rao. He's kind of a happy, happy kind of man, while Amrita Rao is a traditional Indian girl who is very helpful to her uncle, but the only problem is that her cousin doesn't get as much attention as she does. Amrita with a passion. It upsets Amrita because she just wants her aunt to love her. It was also very pleasant to see that although Amrita's family was not so rich, perhaps just middle class to lower the class, while the Shahids family was rather top class, they still treated their family with respect and did not. once asked to put them down did not hit a nerve with me. This is because I actually saw people being very rude to people who are not just as good at thinking their standards are very shallow. This movie showed that the Shahids family was prepared to look at the great values ​​that Amrita was educated and looked blind at the fact that she was not a wealthy business tycoon daughter or anything. All this movie deserves an 8/10 I wish more and more of these movies were made.
