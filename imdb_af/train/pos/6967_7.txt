A prequel to the re-imagined Battlestar Galactica series, the same creative team Ronald D. Moore and David Eick, as well as the new series co-creator Remi Aubuchon. Caprica is about 58 years before the events of Battlestar Galactica in the twelve colonies. The new series, in addition to its human drama, also chronicles the key steps in developing what the Cylon race will be. <br /> <br /> The pilot and series are set to follow two families; The Graystone, which includes Daniel (Eric Stoltz), a computer genius and corporate magnate and his equally brilliant but rebellious daughter Zoe (Alessandra Toreson), while the Adama's include a lawyer and his son William the future admiral of Battlestar Galactica. <br /> <br /> Like Battlestar Galactica, the series includes experienced, experienced actors in Eric Stoltz, Esai Morales and Polly Walker, as well as some talented, relatively new actors, including Alessandra Toreson and Magda Apanowicz. <br /> <br /> For the fans of Battlestar Gallactica there are similarities and continuities with the series, but it is also very different. In the pilot, the science fiction elements are definitely present, but it is smaller part of this series. The screens on Caprica, while reflecting a more technologically advanced society, also have a retro feel, achieved by some of the architecture, the costumes and the way it is shot. <br /> <br /> While the appearance of the two series has significant differences. Some themes will be well known. Religion is again very important here, while the racial object seldom touched in BG is much more important. We also touch on terrorism the existence of a soul and whether or not a machine can have, as well as crime and government issues. <br /> <br /> The pilot was released directly to DVD in an extensive and unprecedented version before broadcast on TV, the series will begin in 2010. <br /> <br /> Like Battlestar Galactica, this series is filmed in Vancouver.
