I thought Mr. Dreyfuss was perfect for his role as the actor and dictator. His co-star, Mr. Julia, played his role just as perfectly. It was interesting to see how reluctant Richard Dreyfuss was to replace the dictator against his will. But he was more confident and comfortable with the role of time. Since everything is happening for a reason in life, I believe he was forced to replace the dictator because he had to stay there for more than a year. I suspect he stayed because he was supposed to see how good his life is compared to the poverty he saw in Parador. I think he took on too many things for granted and he had to get a serious check on reality as long as he was in the country. <br /> <br /> But ......... .. anyways ........... that's why I gave this movie a 7 out of 10.
