Dark Remains is a home run simple and simple. The film is full of horrible visuals and horrors. This will be the most seasoned horror veteran jumping straight out of the seat. The staircase scene in particular, these guys are good. Although they don't work on a big budget, everything looks good and the actors come through. Dark Remains has one of those interpretive endings that may be negative for some, but I think it makes you think. Cheri Christian and Greg Thompson are on the verge of the sad couple trying to build there, but a few characters like the Sheriff didn't convince me. They are not that important. I give Dark Remains a perfect ten rating for ten times scarcer than any recent studio ghost story / Japanese remake.
