DO NOT judge this production by the 2-hour version released on VHS in the US, which is a messy and incomprehensible mess. I had the pleasure of watching the 6-hour full-length DVD on the UK and was spellbound. The deliberate pace and increasing sense of threat are fascinating, as are the wonderful visual and obedient landscapes; This is an ancient Rome we have never seen before, and much more authentic than most. <br /> <br /> Director Franco Rossi is justified for his 1968 mini-series The Odyssey, and this mini-series is equally strong. Just as Bekim Fehmiu has become the best Ulysses on the screen, Klaus Maria Brandauer can be the screen's best Nero. Now I hope one day to see Rossi's version of The Aeneid (Eneide) broadcast on Italian TV in 1971. <br /> <br /> I am unpredictable which version of QUO VADIS is stronger, this one or Polish mini series from 2001; each one has different virtues and in many ways they complement one another. Certainly, one sting over that Hollywood camp riot with Peter Ustinov.
