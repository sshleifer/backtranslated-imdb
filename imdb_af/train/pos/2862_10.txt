My comments are generally limited to the first season, 1959-60. <br /> <br /> This stunning series was one of the first to be broadcast on television, and it was very influential to convince Americans that they were a color television set, which was about $ 800 in 1959, the equivalent of more as $ 3,000 today. How many of us will pay so much for the privilege of watching a performance transmitted through a cathode ray tube on a 17-inch screen? I was eleven when the series started, and I watched it from the beginning. <br /> <br /> If you see it now, 50 years later, several things come to mind. First, many of the story lines include the Comstock Lode and the boom time of silver mining, dating back to 1859. For 1859, weapons and clothing are mostly non-authentic. It's basically a nitpick. And it would have been impossible for Ben to arrive in the Lake Tahoe area in 1839 and a 100-square-mile ranch in the next twenty years. Pioneers are still trying to solve the Sierra Nevada problem, and the Gold Rush only started two years later. <br /> <br /> Indians are not played by native American actors. John Ford used native American actors in the 1920s. The Bonanza producers could have done so easily this 30 years later. It's a big nitpick for me. <br /> <br /> There are other timeline issues. In Season 1, Mark Twain appears, and he is portrayed as a middle-aged man. Mark Twain was 24 years old in 1859. The stories also became popular between 1859-1860 (pre-Civil War) and were more suitable for an 1880 timeframe. There are continuity issues, over and over. <br /> <br /> It is also a bit daunting that there is so much murder in the first season. Over time, the murder was reduced. <br /> <br /> Many of the episodes take a socially liberal slope, which will be hard to believe, given the timeline, but credit the authors for the seismic shifts in the nation's attitudes beginning in the 1960s. <br /> <br /> Having said all this, the play is good, and in recent years I have come to see that Adam's character is better off than anyone else. I don't think Pernell Roberts ever earned the credit he earned. Season 1 also strengthens the fact that Dan Blocker (Hoss) was a good actor. <br /> <br /> Many of the stories are real historical events. The guest stars were interesting. <br /> <br /> It was a good family entertainment, and the series goes well with any measure.
