I went to a movie to a movie because my friend, a producer on the movie, invited me. Forget what you've seen in the ads, forget what you've heard, look at this movie for yourself. I was more than surprised. In a world of The Grinch, Charlies Angels, The 6th Day, Unbreakable, here's a movie worth earning your hard earned money! Glorious scenes, wonderful movie and a role you want to eat with your heart. I found this to be one of this year's most orchestrated Powerhouse movies and with reason. Robert Deniro deserves an oscar nod. If you could give an oscar to anyone involved in a package, it would be the movie.
