Not sure if it counts as a spoiler, so beware: <br /> <br /> Just a small but important thing to note, an intriguing possibility: the boys steal a green lemon at one point , for a joy, and send it back to the owner after doing purposeful and vengeful hidden damage to the car, hoping the owner will collapse. Is this the same car they steal much later from the picnic family? We know the original owner sold it. They end up on a dangerous road, which I understand was closed to pedestrians over the past ten years. A new new incline to the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> On another issue, this movie could be called "Woman's Smell". I do not remember another movie, certainly not American, which treats the smell of a woman in such an open and open manner, such as the "nose" of a good Bordeaux.
