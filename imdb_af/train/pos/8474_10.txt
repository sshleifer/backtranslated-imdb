I saw this movie when I was 13 and I really chose dana plato who later played in different strokes as kimberly drummond. I don't think it's rubbish. it was not meant to be a successor to the documentary. It's just a cute kid movie about 3 kids going to men trying to find the boggy creek monster. the men get hurt and the children save them with the help of the creature. Shots of the Arkansas marsh and landscape were neat. It's a great movie for kids, no real violence, a few grim stories, but great fun for the young ones.
