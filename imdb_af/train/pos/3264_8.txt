What a loss of director Emile Ardolino! He can take a light screenplay and, with the right casting and editing, shine it in and make it shine like a star. This particular star may not be the brightest in the air, as great romance goes, but it is definitely one that will fit you to the end. You really want to know how things work out. <br /> <br /> The script is perfect for Cybill Shepherd, who at the time needed to use her "Moonlighting" success for the new generation that was happy. for her) probably unaware of how big screens big duds she had after a very promising start. In this film she is back in shape every time as a relaxed widow who will live alive by her daughter (Mary Stuart Masterson, on the creep of stars, who two years later with fried green tomatoes). She may have looked too young for the role, but it works well for the way the story unfolds. It's her movie, but she doesn't hide her boundaries as a head start. <br /> <br /> Shepherd lets Robert Downey Jr. graciously much of the film and carries a more mature comic flair than he had in his life. previous films up to that point. And there's plenty of support from Ryan O'Neal (in his best role in years) and Christopher MacDonald. Masterson's natural charm is actually completely coastal, or she has a way to make her character look like a fresh air with every word. <br /> <br /> Ardolino makes good use of his role's sex, appeals to the Net as he did with Dirty Dancing, but this movie isn't quite as sick so you can still see it with your parents as they was in the room. (Use your best judgment, it's your parents.) I give this movie a high point because it's very user-friendly, romantic comedy enthusiasts will find it sublime, and those who just watch with them need to find a lot of them. humor to enjoy too. <br /> <br /> Once again credit to Emile Ardolino to make the best of a lovely script by Randy and Perry Howze. (Where are they now?) Ardolino's next film is the sequel to Three Men and A Baby, but his final Suster Act will eventually give him the nine-digit brutal smash hit he earned. Mr. Ardolino, your movie is missing!
