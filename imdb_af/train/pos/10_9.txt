I'm a man, not given to women's movies, but it's really a special story. I have no personal love for Jane Fonda as a person, but she does one hell of a good job, while DeNiro is his usual, wonderful self. Everything is done so well: acting, directing, visual, institutional, photography, decisive. If you can enjoy a story of real people and true love, it is a winner.
