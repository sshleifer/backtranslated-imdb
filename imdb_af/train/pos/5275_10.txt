This movie is great! This movie is beautiful! Finally, a movie depicting Muslims as PEOPLE is not stereotyped here. This film is driven by the story, by acting and especially by its theme, of cultural affirmation and discovery. They may look like clich√©s, but they are not, at least in this movie. The view of the Great Mosque of Mecca is absolutely wonderful and the audience gets a glimpse of a side of the Muslim world that is rarely ever shown in the West. Here, people are caring, supportive, dedicated, tolerant, and committed to each other. What a welcoming and outdated deviation from the ordinary negative portrayals of Arabs. Outstanding movie.
