I went into this movie after reading it was a drama about a man with a supernatural gift made by society in a monster. Suffice to say I expected something completely different from what I got. But it was a happy surprise. My friend and I both thought the movie was very romantic (the fact that the male head is not bad at checking) and there was plenty of plot development, action and even humor (the fact that it takes them to the 3rd time ) part of the movie to name has the whole movie laughed) to entertain and invest in the story. So briefly: Not what I expected, but a very good surprise. I will definitely buy this movie when it comes to DVD.
