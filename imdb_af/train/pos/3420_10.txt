This movie is a must-see movie for everyone. Congress must see this truthful documentary from the point of view of the soldier, as everyone in America must do. The previous reviewer missed the point altogether - the point is to reveal the truth to teach our soldiers to kill people who are NOT terrorists, but who only live in our enemy territory and do it to the soldiers . We need to support our troops by bringing them IMMEDIATELY home, before another person is killed or injured. It also reveals that government does not help its veterans, those who are spiritually injured, with ptsd post-traumatic stress disorder, or physically, with lost limbs. Julie A.
