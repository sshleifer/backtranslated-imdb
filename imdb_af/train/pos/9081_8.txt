If you like Sci-Fi, Monsters and Ancient Legends, then you will love this movie! <br /> <br /> The special effects are by far the best I've seen since Juarassic Park hit the big screen years ago. While the acting may have been a little less than desirable, the story line and effects have adequately compensated for it. <br /> <br /> Now I wish I had seen it at the movies on a theater screen instead of our 42 inch screen TV. <br /> <br /> If you want non-stop action, great visual arts, and taste for myth and lore .... watch this movie !!
