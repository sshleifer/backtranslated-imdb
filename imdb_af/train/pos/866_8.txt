Put yourself in Carla's shoes. She is an overworked, untouched administrative drug that is invisible. You know her: she has trained three of her last three bosses, knows where all the bodies are buried and maybe even looks at you in the mirror when brushing your teeth. Always keep time for another ungrateful job and do it better than most despite a severe disability. She has the desk on her way to the toilet, which becomes the repository of semi-treated cups of coffee being smeared. What? You don't want to hear it? Well, she can't and can't do it until your hearing aid is in place. Prepare to experience life from the perspective of the hearing impaired. <br /> <br /> Carla (Emmanuelle Devos) needs a change in her life. Work is not forthcoming; friends rely on her to meet their household needs and the only way out is to start a collapse that is almost unnoticed. She won't take a holiday - a contract goes critically - so the only alternative is to hire an assistant. Carla sets requirements that convey her real needs: a "well-groomed" man. It brings an applicant for approval that reminds us to be careful with our wishes. <br /> <br /> Paul (Vincent Cassell) does everything wrong from the start of his job interview and he is hired, clearly showing Carla's interest in his non-work qualities. She sees potential in this former thief and as the story unfolds, their relationship grows in a very unusual pattern of cohesion. <br /> <br /> Paul has a difficult transition to the world outside the prison walls and finds himself in a different kind of jail: one of the misconduct and another complex servitude to pay off an old debt. His skills as a thief help Carla win a political battle in the office. But Paul sees a greater chance with Carla's lip reading skills and even moves her into a world of intrigue. <br /> <br /> It's a cruel movie noir that's not counted and probably suitable for older teens. Carla grows more vigorously, professionally as well as personally, as the story progresses and her disability gives her clear advantages over the rest of us. She grows as a woman who discovers her sensual side while using her resources to overcome the barriers to competition in a man's world. <br /> <br /> The two main characters are in a strange way meant to each other. Without Paul, Carla remained in her role as a doormat. She has our sympathy, hope and best wishes even though she doesn't make the best decisions along the way. <br /> <br /> You will hear the world through Carla's ears, from uncomfortable adjustments to your hearing aid, muted sounds, anything but inaudible without being relatively different voices if you can see who is talking. With a big sense off, we see Carla's increased intuitive power to compensate. And we can all use that sentence to not only hear what people are saying, but also what they really mean.
