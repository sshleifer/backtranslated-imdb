OK, so the music was badly written and generally sang poorly (though Walken and Marner, especially Walken, sounded good). And so they broke the fourth wall at the end by singing the king and his nobles about the "battle" with the ogre and praising Puss's efforts at Boots if they didn't even know by law. /> <br /> Who cares? This is Christopher Freakin 'Walken, a movie based on a fairy tale, and he sings and dances. His acting style fits the role very well like the devastating, naughty Puss who wants his master in deeper and deeper trouble, but in reality he has a plan that he has moved from seven or eight. And if you've ever seen Walken in any of his ominous roles, you know * the ogre has the dust at the end when Walken got into his fall. <br /> <br /> A fun movie and a must-see for anyone enjoying the unique style of Christopher Walken.
