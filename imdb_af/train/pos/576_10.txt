This movie was just brilliant, decisive, location food, story, direction, all really suited to the part they played, and you just think you're there. Robert Redford's is a wonderful actor and now also the director, Norman's father came the same. Scottish island as myself, so I loved the fact that there was a real connection to this movie, the funny remarks throughout the movie were wonderful, it was just brilliant, so much so that I bought the movie once it was released for retail and would recommend it to everyone to watch, and the fly fishing was wonderful, really crying, it was so sad and you know what they say if you cry on a movie, it should have been good and it was certainly lucky too for the Two boys who played the movie of Norman and Paul were just brilliant. Children are often left out of the praise, I think, because the stars they are all growing up are such a great profile for the whole movie, but these kids are wonderful and should be praised for what they did, don't you think? The whole story was so nice because it was true and someone's life was shared with us all.
