Paris, you t'aime (2006) is a 18-segment film. You can do the math - 18 segments in 120 minutes. Each director had seven minutes to tell her or his story. The movie is based on the premise that you can indeed tell a story in that short time. The premise works. Almost all segments are powerful, complete and satisfying. Each one offers a different aspect of the Parisian experience, and almost every director draws outstanding performances from a role play of big and almost big actors. <br /> <br /> There were so many powerful representations in this movie that it's hard to choose one or two favorites. Probably the most memorable for me was Juliette Binoche as a sad mother in the segment "Place des Victoires," Gena Rowlands as an outdated beauty in the Latin Quarter, Catalina Sandino Moreno as a slave in the segment "Loin du 16Ã¨me" and Margo Martindale as a post box from Colorado who taught French so she could visit Paris ("14th Arrondissement" segment). <br /> <br /> Special mention should be made to Gulliver Hecq, probably the meanest little boy ever to damage an American tourist in a Paris metro station ("Tuileries" segment). <br /> <br /> It's an excellent movie. My wife and I decided to rent it within a few months so we could catch some of the subtle points we certainly missed. However, Paris is so beautifully photographed that I would suggest you try to see it on a big screen. Do not miss it!
