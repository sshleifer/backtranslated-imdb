A well-made running movie with a tragic end. Pluses: The way the story moves - starts with Soorya who is struggling to live, followed by a long flashback on why he is there. The music. An uninvolved look at the lives of policemen. Minuses: The violence and the gore, but I think they add to the realistic consequences. If one's heads were cut down and sent in boxes and bags, it could be avoided. <br /> <br /> No complaints - 7/10
