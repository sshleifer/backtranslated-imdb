I watched it as a child, but when I bought Blue Underground's set immediately because of the limited issue, I just adjusted it to my viewing schedule. This is mainly because Bakshi's American POP (1981) just arrived. on the late night Italian TV (see my review of the movie below)! <br /> <br /> Anyway, I found that the movie is a very good sword-and-magic animated epic with especially impressive backgrounds (the rather awkward rotoscopic characters were less) with an excitement than derived count. The plot was not exactly original yet, but undoubtedly grabbed at a youthful level and the leading characters developed well enough - especially interesting is the villainous ice captain Nekron and the mysterious warrior Dark Wolf. But the hero and heroine are rather mere stereotypes - but one can't complain, if Bakshi and Frazetta portray the girl so kindly (her bra can be torn every second) and half-naked to start (her little panties have disappeared forever her ass)! Still, this is clearly an action-oriented piece and it definitely delivers on this front (including that Darkwolf is particularly cruel); The final action, though short, is also properly handled and sees our heroes terrifying pterodactyls who attack the villains' tents in a cave. <br /> <br /> In the long run, apart from the former Frazetta wallpapers, the main appeal of this movie to me is now its nostalgia factor, as it has led me back to my childhood not just movies like CONAN THE BARBARIAN (1982) and THE BEASTMASTER (1982), but also animation series such as BLACKSTAR (1981-82) and the HOUSEMAN AND THE MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE (1983-85). <br /> <br /> As for the accompanying making of "fire and ice" (TV) (Mark Bakshi, 1982) ** 1/2: <br /> <br /> Vintage featurette on the sword -True animated movie available only through the erased VHS print owned by Ralph Bakshi himself! It goes into detail about the rotoscope technique and also shows several instances of live action (in a studio) of segments of the screenplay - which are then detected, with the backgrounds and filmed. Nevertheless, it made a very compelling piece to watch several such behind-the-scenes featurettes on the animation art (on the Disney Tins and the Looney Tunes sets).
