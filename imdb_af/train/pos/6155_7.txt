"Bedknobs and Broomsticks" is a wonderful adventure movie with a certain charm, though not one of the best Disney works. It has a good story, good songs, great characters, good actors, magical and wonderful special effects, good settings and beautiful England landscapes. <br /> <br /> It also combines great live action and animation. Of course, the animation itself is pretty good. The animation looks much like that of the 1973 animated film, Robin Hood, and the same can be said about the animated characters: there are many wild animals such as bears, elephants, hippos, lions, crocodiles and others like in Robin Hood. The King (a lion) looks like a mix of Prince John and King Richard, not to mention that the bear looks like Little John. <br /> <br /> This movie is often compared to Mary Poppins for a reason "Both combine live action and animation with a similar artwork. Both have similar institutions in London, both have their own magic and a magical wife. The children (Carrie, Charlie and cute Paul) are a bit like the banks say. Both movies were directed by Robert Stevenson and both threw David Tomlinson, but instead of a very serious man like George Banks, David Tomlinson plays a cheerful and magical man - Professor Emelius Browne. some, but significant, similarities to Harry Potter's stories. <br /> <br /> The majority of songs are good. "The Age of Not Believing" and "The Beautiful Briny Sea" is the best. "Portobello Road" is also nice. <br /> <br /> David Tomlinson is again in this movie. Angela Lansbury is great as Miss Price and the 3 child actors are also good: Cindy O'Callaghan as Carrie, Ian Weighill as Charlie (a boy who doesn't believe) and Roy Snart as the youngest brother Paul. br /> <br /> I like the black cat. It's pretty cool. It looks a bit like Salem, the black cat from the TV series "Sabrina, the Teen Witch". I find cute when one of the film's characters is turned into a white rabbit. Rabbits are really cute, soft and lovely animals. I just love them! Even harder is when prof. Emelius Browne is turned into a white rabbit because, when he is changed back to man, he shakes his nose like a rabbit. It is really hilarious, combined with its comic figure and that mustache. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a good movie, but its ending is pretty bad. The first minute of the movie is nothing special, but it does improve a lot. However, the end is weak. This is my big criticism about it, largely because the animated knights are too much for me and also because of the war.
