Orson Welles hits me on my ass with every photo she sees. Lady of Shanghai is on the same level as his other masterpieces, The Magnificent Ambersons, Touch of Evil, The Trial, and Chimes at Midnight. The plot can sometimes be confusing, and sometimes it may seem a bit too fast (about an hour it worked out when test screens got bad). But it doesn't matter. You can't watch Welles' movies and succeed in concentrating too much on the plot. Its direction determines how big the direction is. Almost any scene from this movie can hold any other scene that he directs. Look at the courtroom scene. Usually they are such stock scenes that I cannot stand. Case in point, trying to put Welles' own speech close to the end of the case. In Lady of Shanghai, just note the level of detail in that courtroom. Look at the legal representative who always suppresses the nest and interrupts the proceedings. Or just look at the lighting in that scene. I know, it's just a simple blind, and it is constantly used in movie and film films of the era, but Welles gives it a beauty itself. The dialogue is also remarkable. Welles had the skill, a skill that no one else seemed to do, to make a crime film containing examples of the greatest poetry. Whether he speaks Shakespeare or spits hard-boiled lines, it has the power to stir the soul. 10/10.
