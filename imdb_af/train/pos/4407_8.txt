For those who commented on The Patriot as accurate, (which basically had English satanism), it was interesting to see this movie. In all cases, this was the bloodiest war Americans ever had, and they were the only nationality present. It was therefore very refreshing to see something resembling historical accuracy coming from the Atlantic Ocean, which did not paint America as martyrs or rescuers. However, all that this film brought home was the real horrors of any conflict, and just how any acts of war are committed, will only produce worse deeds, which often result in the suffering of the innocent. It was not a movie that encouraged anyone, but both of them became indignant.
