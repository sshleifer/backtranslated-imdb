Stephen King movies is a funny thing with me. I really love them too, or I despise them. I didn't enjoy some of the most popular productions (such as Desperation and Storm of the Century). I really loved some of the little ones. Sleepwalkers are one that I really enjoy and watch regularly. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around Charles Brady and his mother Mary. They are sleepwalkers, form shift creatures that, although one looks like a cat in a look. They are immune to the scratch of cats and when they move to a new town, the falls lie down to catch and kill the animals. When they go to their youngest town, they have to look for a virgin and when Charles gets one, he actually falls to her, but his mother needs to feed her to stop her power. The story revolves around what will happen to the girl. Will Charles save her or use her to save his mother. <br /> <br /> Although this story has wars of incest, which some find unattractive, it actually plays a role in the story and is not just plucked into the movie. for the sake of scandal. Like most Stephen King stories, it is based in a small town with many interesting characters. The acting is not the best, nor the special effects, but one thing tends to gel and is very visible and pleasing. <br /> <br /> For UK readers: This production has most recently appeared on BBC1, Sci-Fi and Sky Thriller / Horror channels.
