Hrm-I think the line was from the old movie posters. <br /> <br /> This is a silly movie translated from some languages ​​that was totally unknown to the translator. Here's a tip: Any movie starting with a black screen and text reading "In the future ..." will be fun. This means that the premise is so unconditional that they have to explain it to you. <br /> <br /> In this case, "In the future ..." means that instead of fighting war, nations have guys to get into. giant robots and duvets it out to determine, well, it is never terribly clear, but it is probably something really important. There are good guys (of course, capitalists, that is, "us") and bad guys (Kommie!) And there are big stop robots. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the effect budget was pretty slim, I get a lot of big robots. There are many inexpensive indoor screens, and then a large space is near the end. The space battle is especially nice, as it serves no purpose whatsoever if the blow is the rest of the effect budget. <br /> <br /> With the money being spent now, the climate is being fought in (and I don't make this up) two guys beat each other with sticks. I can always get a laugh in a bar by re-creating the final scene, completing with a last line that guarantees that any audience gets their head scratched. <br /> <br /> As I said, it's stupid. That's why I bought the tape.
