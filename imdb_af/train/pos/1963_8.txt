We start all our reviews with the following information. My wife and I have seen nearly 100 movies a year for the past 15 years. Recently, we were honored by lifetime film to get any movie without any cost! So we can see what we want when we want. The point of this is that CRITICS count for ZERO. Your local critics or national critics like Ebert are really no different from you or me. The only difference is that they are going to write about the movie and are forced to watch hundreds of movies, whether they want to or not. Therefore, it is our belief that if you value your money for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us! We never listen or ever read the critics. We only care for our friends and those we know as the same things as us. Well enough about it. <br /> <br /> This movie is very good. Not only good but very good. The critics are a lot of morons. Just because there is nudity and language, they hate it. It was worth the price of the ticket and that's all you could ask for. Isn't it right? Every movie can't be an academy nominee. Sharon stone is beautiful and does a good job in the movie and it despises me as the hell the critics want
