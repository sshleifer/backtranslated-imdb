In a time when Hollywood is making money by showing our weaknesses, despair, crime, drugs and war, this film reminds us of the concept of the "Indomitable Spirit". If you feel like being beaten, this movie will release your mind and elevate you. We all know how difficult life can be, sometimes we need to be reminded that perseverance and courage will endure us. That's what this movie did for me and I hope it will be for you.
