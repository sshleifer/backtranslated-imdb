I just watched this movie and found it very enjoyable. It's a quiet, small movie that won't overwhelm you with special effects or "big" performances. It only takes you into the lives of the people living in a small hamlet in the backwoods of North Carolina. <br /> <br /> Henry Thomas gives a good performance as Raymond Toker, a young single who leaves a baby in the forest. Toker's search for the baby's parents takes him on a journey that will have a huge impact on his life. David Srathairn plays Truman Lester, a slim-backed motley man. And David plays the bad man to perfection. <br /> <br /> There is much more to this film than the first one to come to mind. Filmed on site in North Carolina and with a wonderful soundtrack of traditional music, it is worth watching.
