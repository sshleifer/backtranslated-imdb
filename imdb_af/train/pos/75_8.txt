The great Vincent Price has made many fantastic Horror movies, some of which are among the greatest genre jewels of all time. Prize's greatest achievements were undoubtedly his films in the 1960s, with films such as Roger Corman's brilliant Poe cycle (still the biggest Horror cycle of all time), Michael Reeves' "Witchfinder General" (1968) or Ubaldo Ragona's " The Last Man on Earth "(1964) highlighting the ultimate highlights of this brilliant man's career. The films that the man made and made him the immortal Horror icon, however, date back to the fifties, with the "House of Wax" (1953) indicating his rise to the observatory. "The Mad Magician" of 1954 follows a plot very similar to that of its successful predecessor. However, it is not to say that this film is not an original, wonderful macabre and absolutely wonderful jewel itself. As the above rules may suggest, Vincent Price is my favorite actor, and while I don't personally let myself miss anything the man is, none of my fellow fans of the man can't miss this jeweler. <br /> <br /> Praise stars like Don Galico (aka Galico the Great), an underrated master artist and inventor of magic, whose boss, a messy businessman, stole his wife (Eva Gabor) from him. When the boss removes one of Galico's inventive inventions and gives it to his rival, the Big Rinaldi (John Emery), Galico, and a murderous spree of revenge begin ... <br /> <br /> We don't Vincent praises when he's out of revenge? Some of his most famous and best films such as "The Abominable Dr. Phibes" (1971) or Theater of Blood (1973) were about absurd and delicious macabre revenge murders. This previous film in his Horror career is another proof that nobody takes revenge like Vincent Price. This movie offers a great eccentric leading role for Price, which, as always, delivers a brilliant performance, and guarantees 70 minutes of shameful entertaining and easy fun for every Horror fan. Another must-see for my fellow prize fans.
