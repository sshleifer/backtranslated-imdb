This is a good thing I hired the movie before I saw the viewer rating of this site. It was a wonderful movie I would add to my Christmas selection. The role-play has been chosen wonderfully and Ben Affleck plays a good lead role. I will see viewers who haven't seen the movie to go ahead and buy it. I set it right up there with Christmas holiday. The movie was very funny and well written and Ben plays the eccentric rich CEO very well. The things he says and does is just how I can imagine a person with too much money to act on. The movie is much harder than the Santa Claus and Christmas with the Kranks. Plus it has a good story line and teaches the true meaning of Christmas, because you can't buy love with money.
