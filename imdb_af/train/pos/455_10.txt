"Magic" is not too strong a word for the game to weave this film. You find yourself relaxing and seeing others in a more benign light ... Any film that has shamed the civilization of an effect deserves a lot of attention. Rarely are we so clean in beauty. As if that wasn't enough, it's funny. Exceptional performances are exceptional, but the miraculous Miranda Richardson, and the outstanding Josie Walker, both of whom are opening roses, are specially mentioned. <br /> <br /> Why isn't this movie on DVD? It lives forever to live.
