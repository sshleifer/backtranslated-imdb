I've seen this movie for the first time and have seen it several times a year when I have an opportunity. It's on my favorite movie list with some of the classic movies. If someone tells you it is foolish or outdated, they ignore ... this movie is for everyone who likes to laugh and music. The dance is not as important in this movie as in other Astaire movies, so the comedy and play shine through. See this movie if you can, it may be light, but it's still quite amusing. So I know many people hate black and white movies, they think old movies can't really be funny. This movie should make them change. No one I know can see this movie without being at least generously amused. The only problem with the movie: Fred Astaire sings without dancing. He can be a good artist and capable singer, but it's just not fascinating and leaves a big hole in the middle of the story. The comedy gets a bit of clich√©, but the vaudevous performances of G burns and G Allen are perfect for the piece and can please anyone who is looking for some easy laugh. Giving this movie a chance, even if you don't like old movies, this movie can be ridiculous in anyone.
