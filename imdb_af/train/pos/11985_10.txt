I was only 11, but I discovered Full House when I was about five and looked it up until I was seven. Then I got older and thought that Full House could wait and that I had "more important" things to do. In addition, there was also the fact that my younger brother, who had been faithful to me for the two years, began to deceive and thought it "girly". <br /> <br /> Then I realized every afternoon at five o'clock that it was 23, and then I became addicted again. Full House made me laugh and cry. It made me realize how good it would be if our world were like the Full House world plus a mother. I heard people say Full House is cute and incredible. But look at the big picture: three girls whose mother was murdered by a drunk driver. The sisters fight and get their feelings hurt. The three men who live with the girls can sometimes become bikers at times. What is more real than this? <br /> <br /> As something, the show lifted me when I was down and even raised me higher when I thought I was on the verge of perfect happiness. I cried to the show like a hyena and gained a massive obsession about Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen. (Of course, Hilary Duff has now taken the place, but they were literally the cutest babies I've ever seen. They are great actresses and look very nice people.)
