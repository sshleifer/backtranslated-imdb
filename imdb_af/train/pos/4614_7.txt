This movie is ridiculous! This is exactly what I like about this piece of 'Guilty Pleasure'. It is easy to condemn this movie for not Patpriester and Butch Patrick, the original Marilyn and Eddie. But look at the year and do the math. Patpriester and Butch Patrick have grown their parts for a long time! Time makes it for young stars. Yvonne De Carlo, who won her role as Lili, pushed the Big 6-0 (though she still looks good and still was the perfect "Lili"). <br /> <br /> It is a pity that Yvonne De Carlo was not given a greater share. Still, it was good to see Fred Gwynne and Al Lewis in the roles they've made so familiar! During the 2 seasons the MUNSERS were in the lead, it was the Gwynne / Lewis chemistry that made the series so successful. The rest of the cast was supporting members, not to say they were not needed. They were! The TV series would not have survived as long as it did without them. Given the choice between Butch Patrick or Happy Derman (the original Eddie), the choice was too easy. Yvonne De Carlo was also the better choice for Joan Marshall. <br /> <br /> Although this movie does not measure on the original TV series, it still measures nicely and is one of the better "rainbow" TV offers. which hit the boob tube during the late 1970s / early 1980s. <br /> <br /> '
