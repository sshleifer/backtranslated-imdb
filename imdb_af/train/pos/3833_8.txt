I cannot believe that others have taken such a serious view of all these things. God, it was a lot of fun for Hop-a-lung Cassidy. It was a great tribute to the Western series of years ago. It wasn't meant to be a good movie experience except it was. So, if there wasn't a big special effect bonanza. It was a fun, tongue in the cheek, looking at old Western. Man, relax and enjoy.
