This movie is humorous, charming and easily becomes a favorite for those who enjoy light entertainment. Hollywood is hardly the place for serious history lessons, so I accept it just as it is. Bing, in his usual inimitable style, performs quite well like the blacksmith, Hank Martin, who is accidentally transported to another age, the time of King Arthur. Beautiful Rhonda Fleming is breathtakingly like Alisande, or Sandy, the object of Hank's love, though engaged to brave and formidable Sir Lancelot, played by Henry Wilcoxon. <br /> <br /> I just like that episode when King Arthur (Cedric Hardwicke), Sir Sagramore (Wm. Bendix), and Hank (Bing Crosby) dress in dressed clothes and take their backpacks to the highway first experience the kingdom. King Arthur's commentary, "I say, we're not alone", while his hoe clothes are a good scratch, is one of those hilarious moments in the movie. William Bendix's portrayal is wonderfully ridiculous, not to mention his efforts in the beautiful "Olde English." <br /> <br /> The story isn't deep, but it's done well in my opinion and I enjoy it more every time I see it. It's also good family entertainment. <br /> <br />
