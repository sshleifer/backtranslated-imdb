By the end of the first hour my jaw was comfortable between my feet. The movie never, and I never mean, late in action. It can be light action, but it is action. Again every member of the cast fits perfectly. The explosions were realistic, the chase was feasible, and the battle was incredible. Matt Damon will be Jason Bourne forever. <br /> <br /> All I really have to say is that every Bourne movie is getting better and that's no exception. The action, the game, the plot. How they do that, I will never know. I applaud the man who wrote the screenplays for each of these movies. Because if he didn't do such a good job with the first movie, we wouldn't talk about this one. <br /> <br /> It's not going to be seen in theaters, it's going to be in theaters. if it's still where you live, but if it doesn't, come December 11th Bourne with you!
