This movie answers the question, how does a relationship survive if your girlfriend is dependent, clawed, needy and jealous .. and have powers and abilities far above those of deadly women? <br /> <br /> Without spoiling the movie, I can assure you, don't do it, but it's fun to be on the road. Uma Thurman is perfect as the mercurial superhero, a uber babe, secretly called G-Girl, who, unlike most in her sisterhood, is not always dedicated to truth, justice and the American way. <br /> <br /> Thurman is also credible, as it does well, but once again, curator Jenny. When dumped for a less fortunate but more emotionally safe and well-matched rival, G-Girl goes ballistic, and what follows is not pretty. It's funny, but it's not pretty. <br /> <br /> It's a great point of departure, hell has no rage like a super hero, and those involved don't quite wear it, but it has its moments, and I think I'll get the DVD . <br /> <br /> I like this movie.
