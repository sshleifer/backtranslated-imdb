I loved this first show of this show, and I always look forward to each episode every week. The plot, characters, writing, special effects were outstanding! Then the sci-fi channel refurbished and canceled a very entertaining, well-written show. I say bring it back, I know all the actors will come back. I would recommend buying the DVDs, I'm. I hope the executives of the scientific channel get word from these comments, and realize that they need to be more involved with their viewers. I'm just watching one show on the channel, (Ghost Hunters), but I'm pretty sure they'll cancel it soon.
