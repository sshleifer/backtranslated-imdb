I really enjoyed the Night Listener. This is one of the better movies of the summer. <br /> <br /> Robin Williams gives one of his best performances. In fact, the whole cast was very good. Everyone just plays the right notes for their characters - not too much and not too little. Sandra Oh adds a wonderful comic touch. Toni Collette is wonderful like the mother, and never goes over the top. Everyone is very credible. <br /> <br /> It's a short movie, just under an hour and a half. I noticed that the general version version is nine minutes shorter than the Sundance version. I wonder if some of the more disturbing images were cut from the movie. <br /> <br /> The director told a story and did it straight. It's a refreshing change from many directors they think work today is to impress the audience rather than tell a story and tell it well. <br /> <br /> Do not harass sucker through the previews and advertisements. It's not a Hitchcockian thriller. See The Night Listener, because you want to see a good story. If you expect Hitchcock, you will be disappointed. <br /> <br /> My only complaint to the movie was the end. The director could have left a little more to the audience's imagination, but this is a small problem.
