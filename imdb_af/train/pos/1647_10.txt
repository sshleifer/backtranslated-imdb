Excellent. Anxious and true portrayal of the pioneer country life on the Western plains, emphasizing the woman's role and place. A moving movie, lovingly made, and based on real people and their real experiences. Low budget, independent film; never made money. Certainly not the romantic, unrealistic Hollywood version of the pioneering life.
