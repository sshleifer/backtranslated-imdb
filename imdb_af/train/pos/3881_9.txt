This movie grabbed me with the incredible opening sequence that knocked me into a complete turnaround of perspective, so I was addicted by the time the title arrived. The theme of this movie is that everyone is acting, trying to rediscover themselves, but not in a difficult way like Identity of the Usual Suspects, but in the way we all try to make any banal life, we find ourselves in a little more interesting. The scenes in the chicken warehouses are spectacular. At one stage, Jorgen (who owns the chicken farm) attends a seminar in which he is the worst student. His discomfort to this makes you see the depth of his desire to change himself. The film made me wonder about the hidden mysteries that lie behind the surface of the everyday people I see every day. There is not much plot here. Guessing the old man's secret is pretty easy, but the fascination lies in guessing what all the other characters will do if they find out. This movie addressed me the same way as Sideways did, although the characters could no longer be different.
