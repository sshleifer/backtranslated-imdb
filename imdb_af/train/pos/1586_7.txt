Rosen Strasse is more of an intimate movie than one of the epic relationships that many filmmakers could have kept, looking for a similar plot of a Pianist. Fortunately, Von Trotta, a good screenwriter, chooses a feminist look at an era that is too much illustrated on his colorful exterior, but too little analyzed in terms of intimacy and from the point of view of ordinary Aryan German, rather from " a Jewish point of view. Rosewood finds its strength in these unimportant burdens of people trapped within historical circumstances from which they emerge as victims. The pace of the film is introspective, very slow, meditative. In addition, the characters are so alive while transitions between generations and time have been thoroughly made. Rose stripe is not a masterpiece, and some narrative errors are well distinguished. Another mistake lies in trivial cinematography that cannot capture the intensity of the internal drama that the characters live. Yet this movie is worth seeing. Finally, Rosen Strasse is part of the latest trend in German films dealing with the ghost of a nightmarish past, the trend that includes such excellent films such as Nowhere in Africa, and recently the controversial downfall. I would recommend this movie to those who know how to read outside the images.
