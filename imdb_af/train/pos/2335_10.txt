This is what tsv. must be. And Pushing Daisies remains to the expectation. A beautifully crafted show, Pushing Daisies, is one of the few primary shows left over which has integrity. It's good for the whole family and explores your imagination. It's not about the normal action, gender, money or murder angles of every other show at t.v. It's a show that makes you think and laugh, but although the basic plot may seem impossible, the concepts are really for us all. Want something you can't have, hope someone wants us, run away from your past and search for family, even in the most unlikely places, etc. ... <br /> <br /> I realize that ABC basically canceled this amazing show at this point, and will probably replace with some performance beyond the point of integrity. I suppose everything comes back to money ... it's too bad there's now no other show on ABC that really makes you feel good after you watch it.
