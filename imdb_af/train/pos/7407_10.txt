This movie took me by surprise. I watched it 2 or 3 times. I really like this movie. There were many truths that raised this movie. I also love all the characters in this movie. This movie makes a lot of sense because society is "getting ahead". What does the culture lose? Doesn't sound preachy. I can really relate to this movie from my grandchild and loose from my life that will never be again. This movie is on my top 5 movies I've ever watched. There is just such a raw truth that I feel when I watch the movie and it is not the kind of truth you have to dig for his face in front of you. The creators of this movie did a good job and I enjoyed this movie very much. This movie may not be for everyone, but if you have an open mind, I think you will love it.
