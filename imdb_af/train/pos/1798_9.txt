This Saturday night at Provincetown Film Festival, it was a stick-to-your-legs movie - it really stayed with me. Adapted very cleverly from what is probably an excellent novel, it is a dramatic drama with full-bodied characters, thoughtful recognition of life choices and I exaggerate. one of the biggest role players ever made in 100+ years of movies. Beautiful work by all, led by light Vanessa Redgrave as a dying, desperate Newport matron, and Claire Danes as her much younger self. Meryl Streep's daughter Mamie Gummer, like Mama, is the real deal; Patrick Wilson looks like Paul Newman around 1958 and doesn't play the charm; and a pleasure to see such excellent stage actors such as Barry Bostwick and Eileen Atkins, wearing sharp, detailed cameos. Hugh Dancy, also of the stage, does not waste much of the somewhat cloned role of an unlucky empire, and family issues may be resolved more neatly than would allow real life. But it is a deliberate, visually beautiful meditation on real-life problems, and you can cry and feel like you're being recklessly manipulated. Also, what a beautiful parade of 1940s / 50s cars.
