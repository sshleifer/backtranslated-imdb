Once you have chosen your jaw from the floor to realize that they ... somehow managed to put this thing together so quickly that it was released the same year, you will find that it is not half bad. The plot is appealing and interesting, and the pacing is fast, with so many situations, and so quickly jumps to the next one after a line or two is spoken. Where it really stands out is the play. The performances are excellent. Neill and Streep are both impeccable. It's also cool to hear so many Australas in a Hollywood movie, and even those who don't come naturally, try at least an accent. The cinematography and editing are good enough, but they don't really go beyond the standard stuff. This film's story is compelling and the fact that it is authentic makes it increasingly cold. While I haven't read or heard the novel from what happened outside of this picture, I understand it's very close to the truth. There is some moderate and strong language and distorted content in it. It is, sometimes, a straight, big courtroom drama. I recommend it to any fellow fan of such. 10/07
