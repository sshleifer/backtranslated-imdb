Ren√© Clair's groundbreaking musical. If you want to see where songs first drove a story, this is the place. This is the story of a hungry young artist who finds he won the lottery just as his creditors call. Unfortunately, his ticket is in his coat, which is in his girlfriend's apartment and sent to an attack, which then ... oh, but it will tell. <br /> <br /> It's a light and foamy story where much of the dialogue is sung (most people don't think it happens to Oklahoma or Andrew Lloyd Webber). It's the kind of movie they don't make and rarely did when they did. It sounds like a movie from the early days playing five or six years later like a movie. Clair moves his camera around in ways that did not even Busby Berkeley (although it is fair to compare the two filmmakers, is unfair because Berkeley did indeed do stage-bound dance numbers and Clair moved the camera through the "real world"). It's an incredibly small movie. And this is a beautiful movie that will only make you smile. It's just a fluffy piece of pleasure. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, I can't say anymore. It's just a nice little movie and it's really all you need to know.
