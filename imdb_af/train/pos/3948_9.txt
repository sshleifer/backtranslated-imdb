So, finally, I know it exists. Along with the other British contributors here, I saw it on what MUST be, it's just the British screening in the 70's. I remembered the title, but nowhere when I mentioned it to people. It's scared me (it's 2''s), but if you go to sleep with a punishment that runs around your brain and listens to the threatening terror, isn't it a REAL CLASSIC horror movie about? I can hardly remember the intricacies of the movie, but what I remember is my shaky flesh and raised senses. Can anyone confirm my suspicions that it is black and white? Again, if anyone has any information on how to obtain a copy of this, please contact ...
