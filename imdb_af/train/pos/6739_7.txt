"Film noir" is an overused expression when it comes to describing movies. Every crime drama seems to be a "noir". But "Where the pavement ends" is really a good example of what the genre is about. <br /> <br /> Very short, a surviving detective (Andrews) accidentally makes a no-goodnik working for the gangsters. The murder is on the father (Tom Tully) of a woman who meets Andrews and is blamed for (Tierney) blamed. To save Dad from Old Sparky, Andrews grabs the rest of the crowd and turns it on. <br /> <br /> The morally guilty policeman is driven by past impulses. His father was a thief murdered to shoot his way out of jail. But it did not excuse his actions after he accidentally rejected the no-goodnik in self-defense. He immediately went to the phone to report the incident, but he hesitated. He is already in hot water at the department and this can complete his career. Then, at the wrong moment, call the phone. This is Andrews partner and Andrews tells him the suspect is not staying at home. He hides the body and later removes it by swallowing a keeper and pouring the body into the river. <br /> <br /> What motivates a man to do something so stupid? Okay. His work was in danger. But now he has committed several crimes. At least I think they should be multiple. I counted barriers to justice, assault, the disposal of a body without a permit, littering, first-degree mothers, and false testimony against his neighbor. <br /> <br /> In the end, we don't know whether or not root for Andrews. The suspect didn't deserve to die, but it was an accident because Andrews didn't know he was a war hero and had a silver plate in his head. Perhaps it is such a kind of ambiguity that it is not so, including such as distinctive lighting. If noir was involved more than black-and-white photography, murder, criminals, mystery and suspicious women, we should include all the Charlie Chan films under the heading. <br /> <br /> Andrews is pretty good. He is a kind of Mark MacPherson (from "Laura") who has become bitter. He never laughs, and seldom smiles, even when sitting over a restaurant table by Gene Tierney, probably many people in the hospital will smile. He has no sense of humor at all. His pair of erasers are crashes. When he says a chair in a taxi shift and the chair says, "Caution. I almost hit my head," Andrews riposte said. "It's good. The taxi is secure." Andrews may look like timber, but it is a role that is looking for stubborn and humorous determination and he does it well. His underplay is perfect for the part. Few twitches or blinks projects his thoughts and emotional states. And I think the director, Otto Preminger, has stopped expressing bullet as "BOO-let" and police as "POE lice." I can never think of Gene Tierney. She does well in the role of Tom Tully's daughter, a model, but she is like Marilyn Monroe in that you cannot separate the adopted ways of true personality traits. Did Tierney actually have such an innocent, almost holy person? When she replied to the phone at home, her voice had the same quality of singing on the screen? Poor Tierney went through bad psychiatric things before there was any effective bipolar disorder co. And Andrews, good man, though he seems to have, slipped into alcoholism before eventually recovering and making public service announcements. <br /> <br /> The DVD commentary by Peter Muller is unpretentious, informed and sometimes amusing. /> Anyway, this is a great movie, as well as a good example of film noir. The good guys aren't good, though the bad guys are all bad. Perhaps that ambiguity is what makes it an adult picture instead of a popcorn film. For the kiddies, only one shot is fired on the screen and no one's head explodes. Sorry.
