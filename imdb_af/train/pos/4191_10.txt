This Sam Fuller 1953 film features his best work, and it's sad that he can't support the backdrop of the big Hollywood studios to do his good. The story line goes like this. A hard, loud broad (reading prostitute) drives the subway one hot summer day, and gets her pocket book by Skip McCoy. What Skip (and the lady) doesn't realize is that she also wears a microfilm to play. This opening shot without dialogue, and mostly in close-ups, is a beauty, one of the many that Fuller uses the entire movie. Playing the baby known as Candy is Jean Peters, who never looks better or better. One forgets how beautiful she was, and she handles this role very well. The Pickpocket is played by Richard Widmark, who has already made his mark and his style with 1947's Kiss Of Death as the mad creepy with the creepy laugh, and although he is a bit softer here, he is still frightening. These hardened characters have soft spots here and there, but its noir and nasty all the way. The outstanding performance belongs to the wonderful Thelma Ritter, who plays Moe the stool that stores her dough to pay for her own funeral. Ritter received a well-deserved Oscar nomination for her performance, but lost to the boring but popular performance of Donna Reed as the B-girl (read prostitute) in "From Here To Eternity." Hollywood loves it when a good girl goes bad, and loves Oscar, although their performance is usually awful. See, for example, Shirley Jones in Elmer Gantry. Among the New York City ports and dives, with sharp black and white photography by great Joe MacDonald, and a very good artistic direction. Especially good is the set that represents New York City. subways and Widmark's cockpit near the river. At the height of the cold war and red scare, the villian of the piece is the usual commission, played by Richard Kiley, which is far more dangerous than the cookie that is a criminal, but just trying to make a living and above all, loyal Americans.
