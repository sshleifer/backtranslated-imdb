This movie is hard to see in our fast-paced 21st century culture, but it's worth the messages it carries, mainly the effects and effects of technology on society, especially when technology is used for warfare. /> <br /> This movie offers a full circle cycle of dehumanization and rehumanization, as influenced by the advent of technology and subsequent deconstruction of civilization, and thus serves as a warning against technology abuse, but as the circle completes itself, well-known themes and sentiments again to offer self-service rather than self-destructive ways that humanity can use technology. <br /> <br /> Brilliant for the time, the picture and sound quality may be some challenges for some, but as a focal point in the history, development and evolution of the sci-fi genre, it is a must . Ultimately, free will and free choice is again set for mankind as a way to control our own destiny rather than serving it by someone else or even the state of <br /> <br /> community as formed through world events. <br /> <br /> Those who are oppressed by throwing away their lives are sometimes inclined to stay so, yet there is always a brightness of hope and continuity that stays like this movie. br /> <br /> As far as sci-fi qualifies, it is one of the largest general demonstrators of the genre. It is speculative in nature. This asks us the questions, what if these events happened in this way, and what effect will this have on society or the individuals in it? How will we respond? <br /> <br /> As far as this effect is concerned, this film projects those speculative sci-fi sciences that are as unique as they are and keep us important questions.
