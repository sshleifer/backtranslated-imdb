A very funny east-facing west movie influenced by the closure of GM's Flint, Michigan plant in the eighties and the emergence and integration of Japanese automakers in the US. It is in West Pennsylvania, and has major performances by Michael Keaton, Gedde Watanabe and George Wendt. Music by blues legend Stevie Ray Vaughan.
