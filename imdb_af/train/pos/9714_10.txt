What if you cross the Matrix with The Truman Show? <br /> <br /> I'm sure you've seen The Matrix already. The creators of The Matrix say it's "anime inspired". Just as you watched the trailer to these classics, you can see where they took the plot. <br /> <br /> The movie is kind of in 1980's Japan, and it really shows. The costumes, music and words (in the recent English language version by AD Vision) are all as they were lifted directly from the era. I believe it was made at that time too, but because of some plot points, it doesn't date the movie! <br /> <br /> As you probably guessed by my reference to The Matrix, the world is not really. It's not really the 1980s. In fact, it's something more like the 2480's. After a nuclear war, the Earth (or "Biosphere Prime") ecosystem was destroyed. The survivors have forced us to escape into space, where the conflict continues. Once the planets (or 'Biospheres') have all been abandoned, people in MegaZones have begun living in spaceships, where hypnotism techniques and Truman Show-esque have made them believe they are again on earth, In the most peaceful time in the recent memory ... The 1980s. When young Shogo gets a mysterious, advanced search bike, it leads him to more than he is supposed to know ... The Garland (a bike that gets me), a weapon out of the 2400's, helps Shogo she escaped from the pursuit military. As more and more of the MegaZone is being discovered, the war comes closer to home, and as a result of conflict between the army and the computer, the war also comes to the MegaZone. I apologize if these points are considered spoilers, but the Plot is basically sketched on the synopsis. <br /> <br /> Emotions are high in this movie, rather than the Matrix. You really believe the war is going on, and Shogo is really scarce about what he discovers. What begins as a uber-happy cool 80's flick becomes a tragic story of war and unreality. These characters are real people, not the cardboard cuttings we've overturned in the Matrix. There is really the feeling of suffering that people can penetrate after being caught in such a conspiracy and a war. It can just push you to the end ... I know it did me. <br /> <br /> Animation is pretty impressive for his day, and the image quality on the ADVISION DVD is incredible because it's age. The artwork style is beautiful and reminiscent of traditional anime, very cultural. Be prepared for much violence and blood. There is also an erotic sex scene. <br /> <br /> The end can be seen as a "rival", similar to the Matrix, or, presumably, followed by the successor I haven't had the pleasure of watching. <br /> <br /> I have to say that this is one of the best animes I've ever seen as one of the best movies I've seen and seen by many as one of the greatest animes of all time. <br /> <br /> I recommend the ADVISION DVD, as they adopt the English language, are incredible, and make the movie justice, and can be purchased with an artbox for holding the two successors when released , which will have the same voice. <br /> <br /> All in all, MegaZone 23 is an amazing movie and deserves to be highly regarded and must be an essential part of any anime fan's collection. Heck, even my mom enjoyed it.
