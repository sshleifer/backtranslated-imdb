Good Western filmed in the rocky Arizona Wilds. Very tough guys throughout; Cobern's character seemed to be standing between a furious psycho and a light back type. Several holes appeared in the picture, but not enough to make it exciting and worthwhile. One very dumb scene shows Heston empty .45 cases of their powder and collects it in a bag for the purpose of starting a fire. A. To collect so much powder, he would have needed a packing mule to carry the ammunition. B. Of course the grass was dry: why not just leave a game on it and let it rip?
