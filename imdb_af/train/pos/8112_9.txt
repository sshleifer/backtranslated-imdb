Geniuses William Cameron Menzies and Herbert George Wells produce this extraordinary anticipation film, with ambition and scope difficult to find today. They predict World War II and the way Britain was attacked, and the fact that the war will be followed by a spacecraft. They change the timing; In the film, war and space exploration are much longer, but there are so many qualitatively correct things that are wonderful. We even see a helicopter (the movie is older than them). <br /> <br /> Unforgettable giant aircraft and a futuristic meritocracy of scientists who look like Romans with helmets: if you can see through the funny costumes, you can appreciate it. the latest architecture of the masters of the 30s, Well's vision of a rationalist society, interesting reflections on the nature of power and John Cabal as an archetype of the adventurous and inventive person, the one who chooses to form reality and not become thereby formed. <br /> <br /> 9 1/2 out of 10. Inspiring like the final monologue by John Cabal.
