I had no knowledge of this movie before I saw it on the Rialto channel, but it was a pleasant, attractive and enriching film. <br /> <br /> The casting was excellent. I loved all the characters, they were a little exaggerated in places, but it's a movie. The way it looks and the enjoyable frenzy ride took the main character until it got bad, as real life can and does. Yes, I thought Andy MacDowell was wonderful. I was especially interested in watching this movie as soon as it started, because people often function about her acting (I find it very funny because she is always a solid actress). <br /> <br /> I loved the little thing at The End where Andy's character said, "I sometimes feel he was never here" etc. It was so quite how it really is in a situation I can personally identify. Then there was that beautiful classic piece "Nocturne" I think of Chopin, which was a beautiful way to end. (Bar the light comedy at the end, which was probably unnecessary). <br /> <br /> I say "done well" to the filmmakers - I've seen 1000 movies of worse movies!
