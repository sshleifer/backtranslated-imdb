I'm shocked. Shock and frighten that the 428 of your IMDB users who voted in front of me didn't score this movie above 7. 7 ?! ?? - It's a C! If I could give FOBH a 20, I'd like to do it. This film is high on the pantheon of modern comedy, along with Half Baked and Mallrats, as one of the most hilarious films of all time. If you know something about rap music, you should see it! If you know nothing about rap music - learn something! And see it! Comparisons with 'Spinal Tap' fail to appreciate the inspired genius of this unique movie. If you like Bob Roberts, you'll love it. Watch it and vote it a 10!
