This is an excellent example of early Bette Davis talent. The production is above the average for the 1936 time frame. I can't understand why the rights owners of this movie don't have it on DVD. OWNERS, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE. I'll buy it right away. I haven't seen it on television for more than thirty years, but remember it well.
