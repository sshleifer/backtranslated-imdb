I lived during those times and I think the program caught the heart of the era. I think it should have dealt more with the African American issue, but I think it covers a lot in the program. It was frightening to sit and watch the riots on TV and hope they would not go as far as your family home and that it would not be burned down. I thought Jerry O'Connell did a good job depicting a veterinarian from the war. I went to school with guys who came back. Some have changed more than others and some do not. It makes me difficult when someone comments that a problem isn't covered enough or it wasn't enough. Live through it and then comment. I thought the movie was great and everyone in it did a remarkable job. Thanks for traveling (sad and good).
