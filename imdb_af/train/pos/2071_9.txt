For those of our Baby Boomers who arrived too late to appreciate James Dean et al. Al, Martin Sheen showed us the way in this great feature. <br /> <br /> The premise is easy: cool hood meets small town sheriff and All-Hell, but the nuts and bolts of this movie enchant the motorcycle in us all. <br /> <br /> No, it's not Casablanca, nor is it a great literature, but it's a serious movie about cars, revolt and the genius Martin Sheen is. <br /> <br /> Enjoy It appreciates what it is and what Martin will become. I loved this movie as a teenager in the 70's and you will too.
