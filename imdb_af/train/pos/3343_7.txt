My daughter is really turned to me when I refer to Drew Barrymore as if she was hit with a frying pan in the face, not to mention her Dudley Dooright chin that Jay Leno would die. How wonderful when I discovered in "Chorus" that I really am Mrs. Barrymore likes; and Jimmy Fallon; and the Red Sox; and Boston! This film is probably best characterized as a sweet, light comedy. To be absolutely stereotypical, the girls will find the movie for its romantic charm and Jimmy Fallon's vulnerability, and the boys will love it for all the male band and portrayal of sports mania. <br /> <br /> My sports-hate wife, my teenage daughter, and I found everything in the movie. It says something in itself. It's a pleasant way to spend an hour and a half or so, and it's probably also a very good date movie.
