Can't believe a movie that can be made good in 1987 and is virtually unknown in the west. Not to repeat other reviews here. The score is very good and moving. Literally, this means: "Dawn never comes" - when it comes, the beautiful ghost and the lover will be separated forever. After 24 years, Joel and Leslie still look good. I enjoyed Joel in God of Gamblers and many movies by Leslie including Beter Tomorrow.
