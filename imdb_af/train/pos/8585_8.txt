Enchanting, resounding story of captured American army dress to prove his innocence to avoid the hangman. Paul Ryker dodges friendly fire in an apparently doomed attempt to convince a military court that he was actually an American spy on a secret mission in Korea. <br /> <br /> In the year of classical courtroom dramas, "Sergeant Ryker" is an extremely well-crafted puzzle, accompanied by an excellent film, director Kulik's constant momentum, and effective plot turns and turns. <br /> <br /> This film was originally made in 1964 as a television film making this review with the presence of many "name" factors, and some action series. Dillman, who portrays his role, is dissatisfied with the dubious defender, whose attention sometimes deviates from Ryker's supportive but somewhat distant wife, with Vera Miles playing with aplomb. To round off the front line is Peter Graves for the prosecution, and Norman Fell and Murray Hamilton are key supporting roles. <br /> <br /> Marvin's interpretation of the Paul Ryker character is a balanced portrayal of a simple but committed man who has usually laid back. Challenges are challenged by the desperate circumstances in which he is placed. Marvin blends perfectly with thankless indifference, passionate determination, and a convincing, often intense performance that is the culmination of this otherwise small-scale drama. It is this show that raises the film to a platform where it occupies a place on the best list of courtroom dramas. <br /> <br /> Despite his apparent darkness, Sergeant Ryker remains a firm and compelling exam, like a book you just can't lay down. Highly recommended.
