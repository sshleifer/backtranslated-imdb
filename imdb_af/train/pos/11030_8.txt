Watching Cliffhanger makes me nostalgic for the early 90s, a time when virtually every new action movie can be described as "Die Hard in a / on a." Cliffhanger is "Hard on a Mountain," and pretty good for what it is. <br /> <br /> But unlike Passenger 57 and Under Siege, which are decent Die Hard clones on their own terms, Cliffhanger differs with the closed feel of many action movies and embraces breathtaking landscapes that threaten the tremendous misery to combat and abuse people's conflicts. They fight and die under the peaks. Years before other films such as a Simple Plan and Fargo dramatized crime and killing snowy places, Cliffhanger director Renny Harlin acknowledges the visual impact of the assault of brutal violence and fierce struggle to survive against the cold and indifferent natural environment. <br /> <br /> The opening sequence has already received considerable praise, all it deserves: the intensity allows us to forget the art of the camera and the actors and simply believe that what we see is actually happening. Not even Harlin's shot of the falling animal that is powerful, but still threatening to become too much of a joke (and what he repeated in Deep Blue Sea), or the ridiculous expression on Ralph Waite's face, reduce the order's power. <br /> <br /> The next impressive set is the gunfire and lift aboard the aircraft. As written by Stallone and Michael France and directed by Harlin, the audience is turned down by not even knowing which agents are involved in theft and what not: the bloody double cross is completely unexpected. As Roger Ebert observed, the stuntman who made the air transport between the aircraft deserves some special recognition. <br /> <br /> Later, during the torrent series, one of the terrorists / thieves seems to fall the wall of snow carries him down the mountain. As far as I know, no one was killed in making this movie (a small miracle, taking into account the very nature of some of the stunts), so of course a dummy was used for the shot. But the shot itself remains impressive because we wonder how Harlin (or more likely one of the second unit directors) knew exactly where to put the camera. <br /> <br /> I will take Sly Stallone as my action hero every day of the week, as he is one of the few movie stars I have ever seen that is totally convincing as someone who can withstand much physical and emotional pain And at the same time feel that pain. The role of Gabe Walker really complements Stallone's acting strength: he plays an older, more vulnerable kind of action hero, and gives an impressive low key performance than a savior who has to leave himself. <br /> <br /> Unlike many of today's post-Matrix, comic book-inspired action heroes, Stallone's Walker is an ordinary man who becomes a hero without any paranormal or computer abilities. In Cliffhanger, the hero froze almost dead, and his clothes start to protrude big tears as he almost escapes one dangerous situation after another. He wins when he strikes and bleeds when he is cut, especially in the pit when he takes a rocky-style pummel of one of the mad doggy villains. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that the completely despicable villains really contribute to the movie's effectiveness: when I first saw this movie as a teenager, I rooted every step of the way for the good parents and expect another bad man to bite the dust (or rather the ice); at one stage I was actually cheering when one of the cold-blooded characters in the movie had a violent downfall. <br /> <br /> Lithgow's British accent is as unconvincing as the movie's occasional level or model helicopter, but he's basically a good actor, and one of the mines who can perfectly call a silly dialogue: in one scene, watch his hostages Stallone and Rooker, and try to decide which tasks to give. He actually says, "You're staying!" Even a better actor, like Anthony Hopkins, might have had trouble with the line. <br /> <br /> Even if Cliffhanger sometimes throws away credibility, it does it just for the sake of a more entertaining performance. <Br /> <br /> Early in the movie, for example, Lithgow says openly to one of his men: "Retire [Stallone] when he comes down." No real criminal mastermind would even have made this mistake unconscious: his indifference allowed Rooker to scream a warning to Sly on the rock. It makes a tug of war between Stallone and the bad guys trying to break him down. the rope attached to his leg. <br /> <br /> Lithgow could have given his order a more subtle means, but the order might not have been so much fun to see if it didn't give Rooker an opportunity to be open. Defend the arrogance of his prisoner. <br /> <br /> Much done in the style of a Saturday matinee series or (sometimes) a Western, Cliffhanger is built on such a solid foundation that it survives some poor elements that would <br / > <br /> In addition to the painfully obvious aircraft models previously mentioned, the weak moments include a few scenes shot on inexpensive indoor sets, with REAL fake snow, as well as two other scenes that have bats and wolves unnecessarily. resembles a story that has already been performed. Eventually, Harlin's decision to make some of the dead scenes look slow, seems senseless, as the technique doesn't add anything to the screen. It's a pity that Stallone is now too old for action flicks, because his character in this movie seems so credible that I wonder wonderfully what he would be like years later. But perhaps it's best for Cliffhanger to stand on its own forever, without a successor: there's enough tired and outdated film franchises. There was an unofficial successor who called himself Vertical Limit: Compared to the vowel cliffhanger belongs to the IMDb's Top 250 list. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8 (Very good, especially when most of Stallone's other movies are considered.)
