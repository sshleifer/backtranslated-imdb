Until I saw it specially on HBO, I've never heard of Eddie Izzard. I'm sure I got it now! He's one of the funniest comedians I've ever seen! Rarely did a comedian immerse himself in his craft so much as Eddie. I couldn't stop laughing for the whole show. If you want to laugh, you need to see this particular!
