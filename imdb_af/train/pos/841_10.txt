I found this to be a deeply enjoyable dark comedy. Brosnan is genius; As someone will now testify, he should not be in the bond roll. Kinnear was so charismatic and as funny as anyone could have been in the role. I don't know if I laughed so hard during a movie! What an unexpected pleasure! My favorite line would be, "I feel like a bang hooker on a Sunday to the town's fleet." Brosnan delivered this very un-bonded line with such an unexpected comic finesse. I was also very impressed with Hope Davis' performance. Everyone in this movie seems to have branched out of their previous work to such an extent that it actually improved the comedy. If you like the dark and hilarious The Weather Man, you'll definitely love it. <br /> <br /> I voted 10.
