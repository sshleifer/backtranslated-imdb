A few years ago I stumbled upon rerun syndication of this show and fell in love with it. It contains TÃ©a Leoni and Holland Taylor and laughed at me, one episode after the next. I think it didn't make it that big and was canceled after a few seasons, but I believe it was a good race and would recommend watching it ... if the opportunity arises.
