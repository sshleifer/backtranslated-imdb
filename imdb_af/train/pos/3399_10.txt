It was Eddie Robinson's 101th movie and his last, and he died nine days after being shot dead. Although some of the hair and clothing styles are a bit dated (also note the video game shown in the movie), but the subject of the movie is fairly timeless. Heston said he wanted to make the movie for some time, because he really believed in the dangers of overpopulation. <br /> <br /> Several things make this movie a classic. The story is solid. <br /> <br /> What's more, the play is also the interaction between Heston and Robinson, with good performances by Cotten and Peters. <br /> <br /> The music is absolutely perfect. The medley of Beethoven, Grieg, and Tchaikovsky combined with the pastoral visual elements make for some real moving scenes. It was the icing on the cake for the movie. <br /> <br /> And the theme (or "point") of the movie is an important one. Yes, this is a film about overpopulation, but on a more important note, it is a warning story about what can go wrong with man's stewardship of the Earth. It's in the subtext that you get the right message from the movie. Notice what Sol says about the "old days" of the past (what is our present), and notice how Thorn cannot understand what Sol says. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of my top sci-fi movies of all time.
