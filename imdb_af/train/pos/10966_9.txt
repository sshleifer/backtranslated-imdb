Gray Gardens is a world for itself. Edith and Little Edie live in close total isolation, eating ice cream and liver pate in a temporary kitchen in their (apparently) shared bedroom. Cats lol over while Mrs. Edith insulted her daughter's disillusionment. This is a Tennessee Williams play that comes to life and should inspire writers and playwrights. The bizarre and overlapping dialogue is 100% real. <br /> <br /> The home situation reminds me exactly how my grandmother and her 50-year-old daughter lived for a decade (except that they were poor and clean). They will visit all day long, grandmother talking about her glorious past while her daughter has always been guilty of missed opportunities with men, work and self-expression. <br /> <br /> This movie is a must-see for anyone writing. a relationship between mother and daughter. It is sad and voyeuristic, but the filmmakers have done a wonderful job of making the Edies comfortable enough to expose themselves so recklessly. It is rare to see real life this way and all the more special in the context of context. The remains of a powerful family that does not fade into the skeleton of their own home.
