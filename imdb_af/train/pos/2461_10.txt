Kenneth Branagh's "Hamlet" beats all points. The play is beautiful, the 70mm cinematography is beautiful, the Oscar nominated costumes and sets are beautiful, and Patrick Doyle's score (also Oscar-nominated) is sensitive and moving. Oh yes, the script, by a guy named Will S., is not bad either. Film critics arranged Branagh for receiving the film's fourth Oscar note for "adapting" the screenplay, but his decision to use the full text was a gutsy. I can't think of much better ways to fly for four hours. <br /> <br /> Almost every decision Branagh makes work brilliant: the use of England's Blenheim palace for outside, the Edwardian dress and the staging of "Being in a mirror room or not being," The casting of Hollywood lamps such as Robin Williams, Billy Crystal and Jack Lemmon in small parts can be distracting, but it is a nod, the main cast cast excels: Derek Jacobi captures the confronted nature of Claudius; Kate Winslet depicts Ophelia's descent in madness, Julie Christie brings passion for her portrayal of Gertrude, Richard Briers is peak-perfect as the conniving Polonius, and Nicholas Farrell raises the potentially ungrateful role of Horatio to the apotheosis of true friendship. Every line, every word is delivered with passion and conviction, there is no lost moment in the whole movie, the final scenes increase the extent of Shakespeare's tragedy in a way that is not possible with theatrical adaptations. /> <br /> Branagh's "Hamlet" is a brave, ambitious and ultimately successful attempt to match the grandeur and poetry of Shakespeare's language to equally eloquent images. This is probably the biggest Shakespeare adaptation ever filmed? strong praise, but well deserved.
