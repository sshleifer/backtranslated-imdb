I only saw this movie on a movie channel a few times ago. I was a fan of Public Enemy, NWA and other early rap and saw CB4 in theaters. Anyway, the promo for that caught my eye and I wanted to see what it was all about. Well, to the right of the bat I knew it was going to be good (WARNING!) And I was right. The parody songs alone make this movie worth watching over and over (My Peanuts), but the overall flow and delivery of the movie was wonderful. You must love the satire of rap groups (of course NWA), certain rappers (Eazy E, Flava Flav, Ice Cube) and the humor of the three members of NWH. Who can forget Tone Deaf with his ass? It's too bad, this movie didn't earn the credit it earned because it was overshadowed by CB4 during their spending, but I think it's a much better movie. If you know and like 90's 'gangster' rap, you're watching this movie for a long time. If you're not in a rap or don't like, you enjoy the jokes at the expense of the genre.
