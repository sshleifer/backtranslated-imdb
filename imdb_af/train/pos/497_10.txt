Call me adolescent, but I really think it's a good series. If you haven't had a chance to experience a few episodes of the latest Star Trek series, you should definitely look at this one. Perhaps more compelling than Voyager's Caretaker, who started the series with Cpt. Janeway, Archer's adventures are completely different, but strangely familiar ... The music is also striking. No true Sci-fi fan can go without seeing at least one Star Trek episode - and these installments make the wait worthwhile.
