Does anyone else cry out for joy when they watch this movie? I love it! One of my Top 10 movies of all time. It just makes me feel good. I look at the closing production number with all the players over and over again !!! Bebe Benson (Michelle Johnston) is the babe of the movie, IMHO! I never saw the scene, but I get angry when I read reviews that say the play was better than the movie. The two are like apples and oranges. The movie process will rarely deliver a finished product that is true to the original work. I believe it is only because of the fear of public alienation that many well-known works adapted to the screen are no longer changed than they are. It's a very good movie, it's very satisfying. That's all you need to know!
