The movie was actually a romantic drama based on three sisters who wanted to become a well-known girl group. In their efforts, the eldest sister meets a drug dealer and a street theater called Satin, whose sister goes because she believes he is the "big time" that will give her everything she ever thought she wanted to be out of life. Although he was accused of killing her, he just killed her spirit and wants to live, after which she became a drug addict and eventually died of an overdose. The story is not about street life or the Italian mobster trying to buy Stix, and threatens him. It's about how love can even overcome the worst tragedies in life as portrayed in song and style and the character in which life was the times for young women who are trying to be discovered again.
