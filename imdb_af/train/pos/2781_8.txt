It was a beautiful movie. A real feel-good movie when you need one. The story is light (it's not Gone With the Wind), but sometimes you need this kind of plot. Funny and warm characters, fantastic acting and beautiful costumes / wardrobe. <br /> <br /> Parminder K. Nagra (also from the TV program ER) is great in this role. She is definitely a new star for Hollywood. Everybody must keep an eye on her, she will be BIG in the future. <br /> <br /> The impression was also the soundtrack for this movie. A tasty mix of modern and Indian tunes. I danced most of the movie. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended as a fun movie is what you need.
