This is one of my favorite martial arts movies from Hong Kong. It is one of John Woo's earliest films and one of only a few traditional martial arts films he directed. You can see that his influences from work under Chang Cheh work in this movie. The action is good, the battle choreography is performed by Fong Hak On which appears as one of the bad guys in the movie. This is star Wei Pei of the "Five Venoms" fame and a whole face familiar to fans of Golden Harvest and Shaw Brothers productions. The story line is interesting, there are some decent plot twists and the build up of characters and their relationships with each other are cleverly done. This movie had only a VHS release in the UK. Media Asia has released a region of 3 DVDs and versions of the DVD are available on the US. The movie is nice to look into whether it is original language or in the English duplicated version. I recommend this movie.
