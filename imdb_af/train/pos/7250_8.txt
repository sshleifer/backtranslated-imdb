I first read the book, when I was a young teenager, the film saw one night. About a year ago I checked it on IMDb and no copies were available. I then hit the web and found a site that offers War Movies, soooo glad I did, ordered a copy and returned and could confirm why I wanted to see it again. <br /> <br /> In my opinion To really enjoy the movie I suggested, read a copy of the book and then watch the movie. The book is no longer in print, but I found a copy via E-bay. Author Alan White was a commando / paratrooper during the 2nd World War who participated in unequal clandestine operations. It was his first book. It is written by someone who knows and this fact I believe gives the book and film authenticity. I didn't just give the movie a ten because of the nature of the movie, not as good as the book. There are also some plot lines that are different from the book, which is strange because the book is not about the large-scale nature of the war, but about the individual in the war. The film illustrates this particularly well. I have the copy of the book to have my son read and then the movie to show him in that order. <br /> <br /> If you can find it on the book and the movie, it's definitely worth it. and I just wish it was more readily available to ever read and see one of my best war movies!
