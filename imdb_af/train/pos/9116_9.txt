The idea is a very clever title. The film has a serious tongue in the cheek. But it's so subtle you don't know how to read it! Are these guys doing a full blown comedy or are there anything else going on? The small dialogue the movie has is not very delicate and it adds to the power of the film. If all the sound of the movie was turned off, it would actually take nothing off the film. The physical action or art to show is so strong that it carries the whole of the story. <br /> <br /> I'm a blessing and with the blessing the emotion is followed by shame. First I say this movie as part of a "black" film festival. After watching the movie, I was so impressed with the work. But then I asked myself what next? Where can anyone else see this work? The common art association without purpose cannot be found here. You can see the intention in the design from start to finish. The use of African music, the style that throws everything, seems planned and for a reason. Character development is wonderful. The crucial thing I think is the strongest aspect of the movie; The characters are easily defined within 2 minutes of the 6 minute real movie. <br /> <br /> We need to see more of these movies, there really needs to be greater support for developing short films across the board.
