A good idea: 11 stories about 11 September. 11 directors from different countries with different results. Ken Loach talks about an immigrant (as usual) is just brilliant (as usual). The Frenchman also does a very good job, while the Burkina Faso movie was a nice surprise. However, the Israel movie was a bit boring, and the Mexican man has to stop working in a Mexican restaurant. 8/10
