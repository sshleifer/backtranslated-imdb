This movie will usually classify as the worst movie production ever. Ever. But in my opinion, it may be the funniest. The terrifying direction and script makes this movie invaluable. I bought the movie while sifting DVDs at my local pound shop through the bargain. Some friends and I watched it, even though they were drunk. It soon happened that it was not a normal movie. Instead, a valuable relic of what is likely to be James Cahill's last movie. Initially we were confused and screaming for the DVD player to switch off, but fortunately no one can be bothered in our abnormal condition. Instead, we watched the film throughout. In the end, we soon realized we had a storm dream, something that you could laugh for hours, while laughing at all the wrong reasons. We quickly showed all our other friends and they also agreed. It was not a work of a deadly movie. It was a movie that you can really laugh at yourself. It was a movie everyone can enjoy. It was genius.
