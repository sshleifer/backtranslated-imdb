Although it is recognized as the best movie treatment of the problems of building (or buying) a home in your country according to your specifications, this is not the first or the last. In 1940, Jack Benny and Ann Sheridan starred in the film version of the comedy GEORGE WASHINGTON SLEEP HERE by George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart. And about fifteen years ago, Shelly Long and Tom Hanks took the lead in THE PONE PIT. The former was about to move into an 18th century mansion that ... misses, needs work. The latter was about building your dream home - in the late 1980s. Although the two films have their moments, both are not as good as Blends, based on an autobiographical novel of the same name. <br /> <br /> Jim Blandings and his wife Muriel (Cary Grant and Myrna Loy) mark the angles of their apartment, which they share with their two daughters Joan and Betsy (Sharyn Moffett and Connie Marshall). Although Blandings has a good income as an advertising executive (in 1948 he makes $ 15,000 a year. It was like $ 90,000.00 today) and lives in a luxury apartment that is renting in the New York City of that day! - He feels they need something better. He and Muriel take a trip in the country (Connecticut) and soon find an old ruin that can both be imagined as the dream home they want. <br /> <br /> And they both fall into the financial worm that can buy land and construction. For one thing, they are so gung ho about the idea of ​​building a home like this they fail to guard warning after warning by their way, as cynical friend and lawyer Bill Cole (Melvin Douglas, in a nice sardonic role ). For example, Jim buys land from a Connecticut dealer (Ian Wolfe, puts his khaki still), with a check before he checks the correct cost for the country in that part of Connecticut. Bill points out that he is paying about five or six thousand dollars more for the country than it is worth. There are problems with water supply that both mixtures never think of, such as hard and soft water - leading to the Zis-Zis Water softening machine. They find that the designs that they have in mind, and worked out with their architect (Reginald Denny), cannot be taken cheaply at a decision by Muriel to build a little smoke for which no one planned. <br /> <br /> The escalating cost of the project is one thing that intends for Jim. He was appointed to handle the "Wham" account ("Spam" became a popular result of World War II, because the public used it as a meat substitute in light of its success with the armed forces). Jim can't touch this (he's not alone - one or two other executives blew it in front of him). He comes up with the following little poetry (?): <br /> <br /> "This little piggy came on the market <br /> <br /> He was pink and as beautiful as ham. <Br <br /> <br /> He smiled in his tracks, <br /> <br /> As they gave him the ax - <br /> <br /> He knew he would end up as "Wham"! " <br / <br /> <br /> His Secretary looks at him as if he needs a straight jacket when he reads that one! <br /> <br /> Jim is also becoming increasingly suspicious of Bill's attention to Muriel, though (in this case) bill is impeccable. But he's always around (Jim likes to forget that the bill is the clear one and that he likes Jim and Muriel for so many mistakes). All three have accidents, the best is when they are locked in a room in the half-built house, just as the men left the day. They can't open the door, and Jim (in a panic) tries to break the door through a sliding foot. He broke a window, and the door opened in itself. <br /> <br /> The movie works quite satisfactorily, with all the actors enjoying themselves. This is a film that (despite changing price levels and salary levels) does not age at all. Most Americans dream of having their own home and always have. <br /> <br /> A couple of years ago, a fine-tuning company using Myrna Loy and Emory Parnell made use of the Parnell company's paintwork to do the different rooms. She shows the various shades of red, blue, etc. What she wants - even a polite Parnell gives a single thread for the right shades of blue. The ads have shown that the paint company has a wide variety of colors to choose from for your paintwork. They proudly named Loy "Mrs Blandings" in the advertisements' introduction. You can imagine how the nonsense Parnell then handles the situation when Loy leaves him with his painting person.
