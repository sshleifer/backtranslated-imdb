I was totally impressed by Shelley Adrienne's "Servitude" (2007). This movie just confirms what was clear from that movie. Adrienne was a wonderfully talented writer-director, an original and unique artist. She showed the misery of everyday life with absurd humor and a real warm optimistic and humanistic tendency. Ally Sheedy steals this movie with a tremendous performance as a woman who has fallen over the edge. Male chairman Rod Rodgers, like Judd Nelson, is good. There is also a big cameo by Ben Vereen. The song at the end of the movie "The Bastard Song" written by Adrienne can be her optimistic promise: <br /> <br /> "It's a world of suffering, <br /> <br /> In a sea of ​​pain <br /> <br /> No matter how much sun you bring, <br /> <br /> you are being pumped through the rain ... <br /> <br /> don't let down, <br /> <br /> Don't greet the heartless at your door. <br /> <br /> Don't live in the heartless life "
