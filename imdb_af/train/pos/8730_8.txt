Many American people would say ... What ??? after opening my comment. Yes, I know my comparison is undoubtedly an insult to the supporters of Master Akira Kurosawa, but if you analyze this movie, my comments are right. We have the farmer who goes to the village for help against a group of locusts who want to steal the harvest from the village. The big difference is the way the story takes. Our samurai, a band of circus artists as in the original, is a very complex mix of personalities, but at the end is what the village needs, HEROES. Please look again at this amazing movie (the Seven Samurai, of course) and find another movie that stole the story and tried to get the same magical effect as the Masterpiece of Akira Kurosawa. A tip is The 13th Warrior with Antonio Banderas, Michael Crichton copied the story to write his best seller, but he did not get the third foot of the cat.
