Although the plot was a bit juicy and actually rushed fast, as if the director had kicked off and needed to pick up and finish the story from his dedicated time, it was generally pretty good for the Made-For Backwood's -Cable TV genre. <br /> <br /> However, the actress who played the babysitter, Mariana Klaveno, was very good! I hope to see more of her in filmland. The music was also well done, building every possible chill out of the dah-DUH-dah-DUH (think "JAWS") music-based tension. <br /> <br /> I don't think I want to look again "While the kids are sleeping", but if I did, it would be to focus on the performance of the talented Klaveno.
