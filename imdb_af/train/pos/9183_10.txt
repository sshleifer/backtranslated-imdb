This wonderful 1983 television production (not a movie like others written here) of the classic love story "Jane Eyre", with Timothy Dalton as Rochester and Zelah Clarke as Jane, is the best version ever made. since in Charlotte Bronte it is the concept and dialogue most faithful to the novel. <br /> <br /> For many reasons, a classic becomes a classic; when film producers begin to interfere with a classic's lifeblood, those classics are destroyed. Fortunately, the makers of this Jane Eyre approached the story with respect and faithfulness to the original, resulting in a spectacular addictive fusion that is worth seeing several times, to enjoy its multi-layered sweetness and joy and excitement . The performances are beautiful, the music is just right, even the Gothic house design and outdoor shots are beautiful and the right show for the production. <br /> <br /> My only criticism, however, is that this version, like any other version that Jane Eyre ever made, ignores the Christian influences that built Jane's character and influenced her moral choices. In today's modern world, a woman in Jane's situation would not think twice, but to stay at Rochester after finding out that he had a mad woman and was still married to her. "Oh, just get a divorce," she would tell her husband or she would live with him in sin. But Jane Eyre knew she couldn't live for this course and could respect herself. Why? This decision is based on the foundation of the Christian faith she has been taught since childhood, not the brutal Calvinist Lowood Institution, but the Christian example of a true friend, Helen Burns, who was martyr, rather than turn the other cheek. One day I would like to see a version that reflects these influences a little more fully in an adaptation. A classic novel that ends with the heroine writes: "Yet, come Lord Jesus!" Don't have the foundations of that faith stripped of it.
