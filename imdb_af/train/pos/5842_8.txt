Can I be as simple and primitive in my evaluations as just saying, "I liked it"? It's pretty funny with bits, it has big stars and it's great to look at. The songs (there are about two that are repeated) are forgotten, but they get a healthy ironic treatment (like the incredibly attractive Mr Fairbanks who exploded in the Wenzerian version of the tender ball, Grable just delivered). There is not much dance with all of the 1861 crinolines that care about me. Grable has been draped, and the comedy can be handed a little heavy, but the result is still very uplifting. The photography (including real outdoor shots that are a thrill) is great to play around with various curious heavy gold. Miss. Grable is a little past her first and on the plump side, but still fresh and comfortable in this continental "olde worlde" comedy. It's pretty much down the line from "Down to Earth" with Rita Hayworth, and one tends to keep a lot of them off. So I suppose some people would regard "That Lady in Ermine" as outdated and distressed. But it is a fairy tale, and it tends to move in some way. My suggestion is - just enjoy the artwork, the costumes, the witty script and all that this movie offers, and stop complaining. The film was released on DVD in Germany, with both German and English soundtrack.
