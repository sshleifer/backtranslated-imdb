THE NIGHT LISTENER (2006) ** 1/2 Robin Williams, Toni Collette, Bobby Cannavale, Rory Culkin, Joe Morton, Sandra O, John Cullum, Lisa Emery, Becky Ann Baker. (Diretor: Patrick Stettner) <br /> <br /> Hitchcockian suspenser gives Williams a strikingly low key performance. <br /> <br /> What about celebrities and supporters? What is the close paranoia that one associates with the other and why is it almost the norm? <br /> <br /> In the latest alternate fan scenario, based on real events, no less, Williams stars as a talk radio personality called Gabriel No one, who reads stories, he is over the airwaves written and has an interesting fan in The shape of a young boy, called Pete Logand (Culkin), who submitted a manuscript about the hassle of his difficult youth to Nobody's editor Ashe (Morton) who does not care about anyone to read for himself. <br /> <br /> Of course, nobody was disturbed, but eventually intrigued by Pete's nightmare existence abducted and sexually abused for years until finally rescued by a Donna nurse (Collette who give an excellent performance). Son, but her correspondence with Nobody reveals that Pete is dying of Aids. Of course, no one wants to meet the fans, but is suddenly in doubt about their potentially ominous motifs when the seed is planted by his estranged lover Jess (Cannavale) whose sudden deviation from their apartment in New York City has. No one in an emotional tailspin. just grown into a storm in a teacup when he decided to investigate Donna and Pete's backgrounds to discover some truths he didn't expect. <br /> <br /> Written by Armistead Maupin (who wrote together the screenplay with his former lover Terry Anderson and the film's novice director Stettner) and invented a true story about a fan's hoax, " a few Hitchcockian moments that run on full swing like any good old-fashioned pot shaker. It helps Williams give an outstanding low key performance than the clashing kindness person who really wants to believe his number one fan really is and loves him (the one thing that escaped his own reality) and has some disturbing terrible moments with the creepy Collette whose one physical trait I will not leave, but underline the despair of her character that can cause you to be in the core. <br /> <br /> But the movie is out of gas and eventually becomes a bit repetitive and predictable despite a fine-tuned piece of cake junk and mystery by Stettner. It pays to listen to your own inner voice: be careful what you hope for.
