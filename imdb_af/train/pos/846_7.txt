Two years ago I watched "The Matador" in the cinema and I loved everything about this movie. It was clear that I was totally impressed by Pierce Brosan's wonderful role. Yesterday I caught this movie on TV again, and I looked a little deeper. Now I can say with certainty that this movie is not so special, but just love it because of one man. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Brosnan elevates my upgrade with amazing performance from Julian Noble, a tired hit with no friends. Soon Julian meets Danny Wright (Greg Kinnear) in Mexico, a man with an accident: his son accidentally died, his work is not so good and he is not sure he can keep his wife Bean (Hope Davis) no. br /> <br /> I always liked movies like this; crime movie with great humor. Mostly, the humor comes from Brosnan if he tells jokes about dwarves with big d ... or one of my favorite lines in this movie: "I look like a Bangkok hooker on a Sunday morning, to the fleet's left town. " Brosnan says it with his charm while usually drinking his margarita. I also like Greg's typical American face Kinnear in the role of loser, which is very lively, because there are many like Danny Wright. <br /> <br /> Therefore, I recommend you the best role of Brosnan ever. He will make you smile and admire him at the same time. Big Brosnan in not equally good movie.
