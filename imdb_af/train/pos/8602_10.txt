One told Nathaniel Hawthorne that his failures were more interesting than his successes. I believe that the same comment applies to McDonald-Eddy's photos. And especially this one. <br /> <br /> It seems to have many features of a failed movie: it is kitsch, the writing, due to censorship, sounds contradictory ?? Still, this movie also gets some good points: good Rodgers-Hart's music ("I married an angel", "Tira tira tira la"), acting well with E.E.Horton and Reginald Owen. <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you don't like it, you can't forget it. This strange movie actually makes a very strong, dreamy impression, and you will keep that in mind for many days, maybe for weeks. Why? In the thirties and early forties, films did not mean the same as today: as a dream, it sought to divert the public in order to forget a difficult reality. Of all the dream movies made at that time, this one is so strong. <br /> <br /> In short, let's say the better way to appreciate this movie is to see it without wondering if it's good or bad. To see it, as you would see a dream.
