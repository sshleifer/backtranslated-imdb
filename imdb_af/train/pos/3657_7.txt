This film is like a 1950's version of Ettore Scola's Brutti sporchi e cattivi. Less sex and less realism, but a story with great humanism and warmth. I wouldn't call it a neo-realistic picture. It is very sentimental and more like a fairy tale, and should probably be classified as a comedy, although it does deal with serious issues (a bit like Chaplin or 1930 comedy). Typical Italian daughter, very emotional, and hard to resist, except for a stone cold. Sentimentalism is a deviation, although this picture was not a realistic drama. It's not a masterpiece like Umberto D or The Bicycle Thief. But it's a lovely and hilarious comedy with good music. <br /> <br /> 7/10
