I was so surprised when I underestimated this movie so much ... I understand why some of you don't like this movie. His pace is slow, a feature of Japanese films. Yet, if you are absorbed in the movie like me, you won't find it a problem at all. <br /> <br /> I have to say this is the best comedy I've ever seen. "Will we dance?" is often considered a masterpiece of Japanese comedies. It is very different from Hollywood, eg. Austin Powers or Scary Movies, in which a gag is guaranteed in every few minutes. It is rather light-hearted, a movie that makes you feel good. <br /> <br /> I love the movie because it makes me feel "really". The plot is straight but pleasant. I was so pleased since Sugiyama (the lead role) found the meaning of life in dance. Before I watched the movie, I was slightly depressed because of heavy schoolwork. I was lost. However, this film made me think of the bright side of life. I believed I was in the same boat of Sugiyama; If he could find himself in his hobby, why couldn't I? It reminded me of 'exploring my own future' and discovering happiness in my daily life. <br /> <br /> It is important to note that the actors are not professional dancers. Although some of you do not like the dance screens as well as you expect, I find it so nice, because it makes me feel that the characters are really "alive" and learning to dance while the movie is running. <br /> <br /> Everything, this movie is encouraging and heartwarming. As a comedy, it does its job perfectly. It definitely earns 10 stars. <br /> <br /> And yes, Aoki is funny :-D
