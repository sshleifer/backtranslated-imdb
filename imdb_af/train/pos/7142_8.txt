Holes, originally a novel by Louis Sachar, has been successfully transformed into an entertaining and well-made film. With the lead roles of Sigourney Weaver as governor, Shia Labeouf and Stanley, and Khleo Thomas as Zero, the roles were very well cast, and the actors portrayed their roles well. <br /> <br /> The film has interim stories that all lead to the end. The main story is about Stanley Yelnats and his punishment for spending a year and a half at Camp Greenlake. The second storyline deals with Sam and Kate Barlow. This plot is about racism and that is the deeper storyline of the film. The third is about Elya Yelnats and Madame Zeroni, who explain the 100-year curse on the Yelnats family. According to me, these storylines are very well-coined. <br /> <br /> Contrary to many people's beliefs, I think you shouldn't read the book to understand the movie. The movie is pretty easy to understand. <br /> <br /> The play in the film was well done, especially Shia Labeouf (Stanley), Khleo Thomas (Zero), Sigourney Weaver (governor) and Jon Voight. Sir). The other members of D-Tent, Jake Smith (Squid), Max Kasch (Zig-Zag), Miguel Castro (Magnet), Byron Cotton (Armpit) and Brenden Jefferson (X-Ray). Although Holes is a Disney movie, it's the best parts with Zero and Stanley teaming up with a good team. <br /> <br /> While it's a Disney movie, it's about serious issues like racism, shooting and violence. The film's dramatization on some points has been very well done. <br /> <br /> I would suggest this movie to people of all ages, whether or not they read the book. Don't miss it.
