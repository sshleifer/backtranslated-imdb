Eventually, this classic TV movie had to be seen on an unofficial disc recorded from an old VHS. It's a classic piece of horror. It's a pity more about this neglected angle of horror in terms of official releases on DVD and VHS ... the TV horror movie. Recommended for all fans of the 70's TV movie, like trilogy of terror. Those interested should get the book on the subject by David Deal - Television Fright Films of the 70s. Email me for a chance to see it ..... it's great to see it again. <br /> <br /> It does, however, have problems like many TV movies, but they should rather be inventive in the effect depth, and even at 70 minutes, we may be able to drag. We are all accustomed to more modern editing, but still good stuff and much better than many theater shots released today.
