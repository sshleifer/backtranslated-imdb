It was the best documentary I've ever seen !! I just saw the Lord of Dogtown and wanted to know more about Stacy Peralta, and was amazed and happy to find out that it was also one of his films. Great Job Stacy! I started kicking at work last week, bored O * & ^% less and this movie started. I grew up in Orange County in the 80's and I followed up on the local beaches and so did my dad when he was a teenager. I grew up on the beach, my parents took me every weekend, I fled the body, boogeyboarded and turned away. This movie just enchanted me. It was gone before my time, but it was great to see what these guys were going through. TRUE PIONEERS! This movie is a collector's item.
