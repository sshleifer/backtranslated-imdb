If you like me war games, it's pretty good. Some of these are cheap, but the robot battles are worth seeing. I've been enjoying the mech war field for quite some time and it's almost the only movie I've ever seen that is close to the feel of how it would be to launch one of those great mechs. If you like the genera, games you'd like are Mech Warrior Three and Four, and if you have an Xbox and $ 350 to save the Steel Battalion. The movie is worth at least once. There really should be more movies about the same theme out there. Less remakes and more original works. <br /> <br /> Enjoy
