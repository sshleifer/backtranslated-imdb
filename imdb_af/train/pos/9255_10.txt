If you want a fun skirt with very subtle humor, you will enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> I don't understand why someone won't enjoy this one. Take it for what it is: a Dennis Hopper vehicle to waste your head and make you laugh. It's not Shakespeare, but it's done well. Ericka Eleniak is absolutely beautiful and holds her own in this one - Better than any episode of Baywatch - and shows a talent for subtle humor. She didn't have many opportunities to expand. <br /> <br /> Tom Berenger fits his role of "real Navy" perfectly and William McNamara does a solid job as a hustler. <br /> <br /> Throw a walk through Hopper in the middle of the chase for "The Cherry on this Sundae" and you have a movie that kept my attention and makes me laugh. I bought this one once it was available. <br /> <br /> Brain Candy.
