This movie found in a video store, it costs $ 2 to buy. The whole movie really stinks badly! The so-called colonel, who would have to trust the hero here as the cover, must be in his eighties and barely walk. He still manages some of the dumbest ninjas in the world. Then the story leaves the colonel, who gives meaning to the old man's inability to name anything, a couple of scary eighty-cute guys are taking over, which was a kind of story. I lost a hundred times, but didn't mind, because the movie is so bad, it's really fun to watch. Zero budget waste with actors who do not earn the name. Go it out!
