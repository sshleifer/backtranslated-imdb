I really enjoyed this movie. In addition, all aspects of the film were the most important, for me anyway, the script and the play. This is definitely one of Richard Widmark's strongest roles. He is completely convincing in his performance. Just out of curiosity, imagine how Humphrey Bogart or Robert Mitchum addressed this role. This is my first exposure to Jean Peter's work I can remember. She impressed so much here that I would definitely look for her other work. Thelma Ritter, in an ominous role, deserves the Oscar nomination she received to play the informant. This movie works on every level. The black and white photography is perfectly fitting and the story hooks the viewer from the beginning. Widmark and Peters have good chemistry in their difficult romance. Highly recommended, 9/10.
