I must say, this movie gave me double personality. I said again and again to stop and start talking like a normal person. But it's very difficult ... no not the cheek. Did you find it disgusting and disrespectful? Well, get a lot more in the mood. This movie is just dirty! It's not a movie to show your grandparents, but you have to show it to a teenager or an immature guy in your workplace. Anyway, back to the voice ways. Fortunately, this site has a ladies' man (has anyone in the studio noticed an apostrophe (?) Between the e and s), so you can always have a nice thing to say to your boss or the police . I have a sheet in my wallet.
