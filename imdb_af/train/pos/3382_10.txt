Not often have I had the feeling of a movie, it can be visionary. Obviously, this movie has the appearance of seed. <br /> <br /> We should not be inclined to be alarmists and see armageddon in something because it seems to fit our emotions of the moment. But, didn't we say this in 1984? James Orwell knew that the Internet hadn't become reality long after 1984; In fact, it was in 1994; He might have reconsidered his story as he did. Rewards reward. <br /> <br /> It doesn't matter. What is important is that we often consider ourselves to be better than our environment, but indeed become emotional about a "love apple" when necessity strikes at our door. An overview of ourselves in old age. <br /> <br /> Whatever the timeline for us, I know for a fact that we haven't seen it before. <br /> <br />
