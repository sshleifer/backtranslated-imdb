I saw this movie the first few seconds, the voice of T.R. took me on the journey. Well, I didn't like the big stuck thumbs in the beginning, but the absurd humor and the scary appearance of both sissy actors. I don't know who played the young hair - but she was wonderful and so was it. !!! - <br /> <br /> The two other people, who went to the cinema for about half an hour, were with a friend - and it's always a test to watch a movie, I like one from my friends - and we also enjoyed the maximum - hilarious laughs - sadness about the "realistic police normalos". both fans of T.Robbins's books ... I did well - thought Robbins would also approve, although I don't have a clue if he likes the movie or not ... <br /> <br / > I want to see the cut out - I heard gus v. sand had to take out many scenes because of first-time viewers (or producers ???), but it is still an artistic movie. much too short though ... it's one of my all-time favorites - and I'm aware that the majority of people can't stand that kind of movie and accept that people who enjoy those movies are what they think. .... what a pity. hopefully there will be a DVD with the full material - hopefully to see more of crispian, keanu - expect to see her baby and all <br /> <br /> if you have the chance see it, think twice and enjoy it if you made the choice to look ... m
