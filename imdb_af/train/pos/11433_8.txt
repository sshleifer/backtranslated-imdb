Despite the protection of George Lucas, this fascinating and completely original fantasy is in "Lumage" (a combination of animation through live action cutouts) so far from the usual kiddie prize as anything Ralph Bakshi made in his heights has. Brilliant gifted characters like the Shifting Ralph Ralph (one of the thumbs of bumbling, rejected heroes), Synonamess Botch (the hilarious dirty-known villain) and Rod Rescueman (the pompous novice superhero) blow life into a unique, clever concept: Frivoli vs Murkwood or the eternal battle between dreams and nightmares. In this context, the MOR-infused songs on the soundtrack should not be worked, but somehow they do it. So it's a pity I had to see it through a really bald song (cut out of a TV show) of the uncensored version ?? There is also a milder variant that has dropped the language for its VHS release? otherwise the movie is not available on DVD. Interestingly, both Henry Selick and David Fincher worked on subordinate capabilities on this photo.
