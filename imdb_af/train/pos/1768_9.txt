I didn't laugh at a movie for a long time in a long time. I had to go to a preview and was excited to be dead to see it. I laughed tears in my eyes with a lot of the movie. The audience all shared my laughter and clapped most of the movie and shouted. <br /> <br /> Kudos by Steve Carrell (who I've already been). In this movie he proves his tremendous talent for comedy. He has a style I haven't seen before. And Catherine Keener is excellent as always. Thanks, there wasn't a cameo from Will Ferrell (love him, but saw him too much in the summer). <br /> <br /> There were parts of comic genius in this movie. Thanks in part to Carrell, and partly thanks to the writing (also Carrell). The wax scene and speed dating with the "obvious problem" were absolutely hysterical. <br /> <br /> I'll definitely see '40 Year Old Virgin 'when it's released. My advice: watch it for big laughs and an incredibly nice movie on top.
