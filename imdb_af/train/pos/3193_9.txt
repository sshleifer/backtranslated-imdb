The movie that starts this movie is the true image of a man named Gary, apparently taken randomly in the parking lot of a television station where Gary works in the town of Beaver. Gary is a little "different"; He is a mimic and drives an old Chevy named Farrah (after Fawcett). Look, watch, the filmmaker gets a letter from Gary a little later and invites him to return to Beaver to get a picture of the local talent competition he put together. Gary's cute show like Olivia Newton Dawn. Oh, me. The two short shorts that follow are Gary's story, the same one you just saw, only the first being portrayed by Sean Penn and the second by Crispin Glover titled "The Orkly Kid." If you're in the mood to make someone's pleasure, it's definitely the movie to watch. Most of the time, I was doubly laughed, especially Crispins' performance, which certainly stands alone. When it was over, I had to rinse the movie back to watch the real Gary and all his shiny idiot. Although Olivia was the focus, I would have liked one of the "fictitious" shorts to have a jab on Gary's Barry Manilow imitation, which he was equally ridiculous.
