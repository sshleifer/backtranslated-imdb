That's right. The movie is better than the book. Don't get me wrong, I love the book. But the movie is just as much better. This movie has Jack Nicholson and Shelly Duvall at their best. (I didn't see Scatman Crothers and of course Danny Lloyd in anything else.) Some of the ideas used in this movie are better than those used in the book. But I've already talked about those in my comments on the mini-series. But I missed some. The movie is shot in a better place than where the mini-series was shot. And the REDRUM scenes are creepier than those in the book. So if you're looking for a good movie, get Stanley Kubrick's The Shining. But count on nightmares every night for 3 weeks
