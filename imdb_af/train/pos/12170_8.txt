Romantic comedies can really go completely, you know? You will see one that is very nice and you will think you want something more realistic. Then you will see one that is realistic, but it may be too boring to interest you. Or maybe you'll see one doing everything right, but just fail to make you smile. Romantic comedies are tricky movies. You are expecting a lot of expectations, and usually you just want to know if the filmmakers expect your expectations or that of the girl or girl next to you. <br /> <br /> Of course, if you have a girl next to you, and you're a guy like me, it doesn't matter if the movie is good, you have other things in your mind. For you, I say, "Get her, Tiger!" For the rest of us, I say, "See _A Guy Thing_." It's great fun. Because _A Guy Thing_ knows you're dealing with these expectations in this movie, it doesn't mean she's meeting Guy with the dreams of his wife, and it's not his wife! "Plot is going to make everyone happy. Sure, maybe you like it, but maybe it doesn't sound true, or you think it's cruel. _A Guy Thing_ covers it. What _A Guy Thing_ is, fill the screen with the best supporting role that I've seen for a long time. If you're not the main plot, you have something to make you smile. <br /> <br /> Whether we're talking about seasoned veterans of big and small screens, like Larry Miller, James Brolin (Traffic), Julie Hagerty (Airplane!), David Koechner (Saturday Night Live and Conan O'Brien regularly, Dirty Work, Austin Powers II) or Thomas Lennon (The State and Viva Variety), or new faces like Shawn Hatosy (The Faculty), or Colin Foo (Saving Silverman), talks about a lot of talented and capable actors who know exactly how to take advantage of the film's inspired characterization, stealing time from time to time, and the piece with nevertheless, the energy and joy that are seldom seen in the romantic comedies set it. <br /> < And it does not detract from the real romantic passage and the stars that bring it, because it is very sweet and terribly well done. Jason Lee (Mallrats, Chasing Amy, Dogma, etc.) Touch as the young professionals whose lives can be out of control, and Selma Blair shows an understated brilliance to portray the aspiring social and sophisticated career woman what every man wants wedding. For the guy who is actually. <br /> <br /> However, much of the movie's success falls on Julia Stiles, the right girl in the right place at the wrong time, and she's wearing it well. Not since, I don't know when I saw an actress in a romantic comedy that so easily fell in love with her. Of course this is all in the close-ups, the voice and the subtle smile, but it is magic. This is one of the major reasons why we are first in the movie. <br /> <br /> But Julie Stiles's a bit of horrible sophistication would be lost as it is not the fact that the rest of the role in their classic simplicity is so incredible. It's a movie that hides a broken world of irreconcilable supplies, letting them fall over each other to make you laugh and then get through. <br /> <br /> A Guy Thing is a movie you've probably seen before, and the filmmakers knew it clearly when they put down to make it. We haven't really seen new romantic comedies since Shakespeare; The relative success of this one or the one is entirely dependent on the performance of the classic story of the boy, meet girl. A Guy Thing embraces it with a bit of a meta-mathematical edge, which often takes the scenes into the absurd to give the audience the opportunity to recognize the powerful emotions and ancient plot devices. <br /> <br /> For the record, even the fun of the fairly traditional structural concepts of sex and gender is at the heart of every romantic comedy. So even the feminists out there might get a chance. <br /> <br /> And guys, I think we can all agree that we wish our friends are as cool as Jason Lee's friends in this movie. I'm not going to spoil it for you, but if you're trying to explain to your girlfriend why the pharmacist and the clothing store clerk are among the coolest dudes in the theater, I suggest you just say, "This is a Guy Thing, "And leave it at that
