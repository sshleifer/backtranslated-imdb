It's the only David Zucker movie that's not the first of its kind spoof. The funniest movie of 98 with Night at the Roxbury right behind. But I didn't think it's something about Mary, but it's not funny, except for the francs and beans he has. Don't listen to the critics, especially Roger Ebert, he doesn't know solid entertainment, just look at his reviews. Now you see that you won't be addicted.
