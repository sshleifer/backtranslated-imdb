A few years ago, I commented on the IMDB on the "The Real McCoys" series. I then said and repeated now, it was a beautiful, funny and entertaining performance that was well-behaved with wonderful characterization. <br /> <br /> I recently watched four old episodes on PLUS the Reunion of 2000 with Richard Crenna, Kathy Nolan, and Tony Martinez. As another author mentioned here, it is curious that Lydia Reed (Hassie) and Michael Winkelman (Little Luke) are not referred, but perhaps they can be found via SAG or AFTRA. <br /> <br /> The reunion show was well done and gave us many unknown insights into the show. One of the inside information we didn't get was whether Kathy Nolan regretted leaving the show in an unpleasant contract dispute, which Luke left a widow in last year. It wasn't very good. Nolan continued with a bomb of a comedy called "Broadside", on women nurses in the Pacific Ocean in WWII. Get it? Street? No, not funny. <br /> <br /> Unlike the sloppy, lazy and violent TRASH on TV, which undermines our values, "The Real McCoys" entertaines with decent values ​​and fine people. And I thank everyone involved, including the creator, Irving Pinkus, for bringing it to my family. We never missed it.
