At this moment I watch this movie for the second time (on television) and for the second time I fell into it when it was an hour long (I think I saw another 2 minutes). This movie is really impressive, as Goldsworthy looks at nature, changing nature in a way that you will never think of, is really wonderful. This whole movie gives you a warm feeling as he plays with him around the world with such love. Or just to see his hands, cover with dirt and broken nails, just touch it.
