What starts out as a very predictable and somewhat deadly thing is, in the end, quite hilarious and entertaining. "Right to die" is not very exciting, but it does more than that with some exorbitant pieces and over. <br /> <br /> Spoilers here: <br /> <br /> Top credits also go to the death display of Martin Donovan as one of the most despicable characters ever to gratify the screen. If you play the character in a big "separate" way, you almost feel bad for the guy when his big plan eventually fails. Corbin Bernsen also chews the scenery and plays a not-so-good man who only gets his dessert. <br /> <br /> End of Spoiler. <br /> <br /> As a revenge-of-the-dead movie, "Right to Die" is very beneficial to its artists and is more than a good way to spend less than an hour.
