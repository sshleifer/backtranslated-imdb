Nick and Kelly are ready to marry, but Travis (Kelly's dog) leads Nick to a strange blue wall that will change Kelly's honeymoon. Richard Burgi and Susan Walters play Nick and Kelly and make a good couple. Nick loves drinking, smoking, and playing pool with the fellas for fun, but Nick suddenly remembers this kind of fun. Sex is the one thing he loves because he wants a child. We find out that an alien race is dying and must interfere with Earth's women to save their population. It becomes a fight of survival between humans and strangers with the dog population also involved. A good movie.
