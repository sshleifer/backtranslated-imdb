While this movie's style is not as understated and realistic as a sound version would probably have been, it's still a very good movie. In fact, it was regarded as an excellent film in its day, as it was nominated for the first Best Picture Oscar (lost to WINGS). I still see WINGS as a superior movie, but this one is excellent despite a little exaggerated by head, Emil Jannings. <br /> <br /> Jannings is a general of Tsarist Russia who lives his last days. make a few bucks in the 1920s by being a Hollywood extra. His luck seems to change as he gets a decisive call - to play an imperial Russian general who is fighting the Communists during the revolution. Of course, it's not much of a dramatic way, but it also gets the old man thinking of the old days and the revolution. <br /> <br /> Exactly what happens next, I'll go to you, but it's a good movie, especially at the end. By the way, watch William Powell as the Russian director. Despite being made in 1928, the make-up doesn't look much younger than he did in many of his later films.
