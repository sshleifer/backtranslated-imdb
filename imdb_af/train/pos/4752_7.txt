A busy story of a Marsian attempt to colonize the Earth. (Things need to be pretty bad on Mars.) Two state patrons are investigating the scene of a reported UFO accident. Whatever landed, is buried under Tracy's Pond, but there are footprints in the snow that lead to a nearby dinner. <br /> <br /> The dinner has been going on since. Eleven no customers in the morning. Now there are a handful of bus passengers moving around waiting for permission to cross a structural poor bridge. The bus driver insists that six passengers were on board the bus, although he did not realize who they were. The problem is that there are now seven people waiting for the journey to resume. One of them is a stranger, but which one? All of them are suspicious. There is the crazy old man (Jack Elam), who obviously exerts a sub rosa white. There is an emerging businessman coming to Boston (John Hoyt). A young couple on their honeymoon. (Excellent performance by the man, Ron Kipling.) Except for the couples, no one else noticed. And even the couples are suspicious of each other. Bride at newly married man: "I could have sworn you had a mole on you." The story continues in a sharp but slightly haunting way. The phone rings without reason, the lights go on and off, the jukebox turns on - and nothing has to be taken seriously. <br /> <br /> It's a very enjoyable ensemble game and the climax revelation is worth it. There is no noticeable "depth" to it. This is not a moral message about pod people devastating as ordinary citizens. It's not a warning of any kind, just a fairy tale that deviates and amuses. <br /> <br /> I always enjoy it when it's on. It is particularly interesting to see John Hoyt as the irritated and impatient businessman, knowing that he was the Roman Senator in 1954 who murdered the assassination of Julius Caesar in MGM's version of Shakespeare's game. And here he is - with three arms. <br /> <br /> Oops.
