Look at this movie, I was a little skeptical because fantasy movies aren't always my cup of tea. Especially a romantic fantasy. <br /> <br /> Little did I know that I was a ride through cinematic magic. Everything in the movie from plot to dialogue to effects was very close to perfection. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes shines like the star she is in this movie. From beginning to end you fall more and more in love with this character. <br /> <br /> Michelle Pfeiffer is threatening as an evil witch bent on capturing the star for eternal youth and beauty. <br /> <br /> Robert De Niro is a lovely character who gives the audience most of the comic relief, as the film reaches momentum on the climax. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a movie that surprised and delighted me as a movie fan. If you are looking for a fun and enjoyable movie that will be fun for kids and adults, Stardust is the way to go.
