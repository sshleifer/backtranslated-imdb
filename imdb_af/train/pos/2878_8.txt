For quite a long time in my life I didn't like this movie, or I liked this movie, but not as much as so much. I recently watched it (at a place of sleep, funny enough) and I enjoyed it more than I did since I was under 6. I appreciate more now, like me with some other Disney classics I've watched recently (including "Sleeping Beauty" and "Pinnochio" or how you play it). <br /> <br /> I now appreciate the animation, the clever "Disney" plot, the humor of the mice, the emotions expressed and the plot. The animation is very well done, it often looks as if you are where the other characters are, and look at them. The animation also well shows the styles of the backgrounds, including the town (which is shown twice briefly). Disney changes it from the original fairy tale in a surprisingly good way, indulging in clever plot twists, such as the mice that make the clothes and the key role (usually I don't like many Disney movies if they are not the same as the original story but with this I'm not too bothered, I feel they've made the necessary changes to make it a good Disney movie, often I don't think Disney has the book in a good way in some of their movies does not change. <br /> <br /> You know the story, Cinderella is a girl who works for her horrible stepmother and step sister, she goes to a ball with the help of her fairy-tale grandmother and loses a glass knob ... <br /> <br /> This is a movie that is very much watched by other people. Immediate family is not good enough to enjoy it, so I encourage you to see it with friends (and immediate family, if you like :-)). <br /> <br /> I recommend it to people who love Disney, people who love fairy tales and people who like mice. Enjoy it! :-)
