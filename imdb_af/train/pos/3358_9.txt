First, for this movie, I have only one word: 'wow'. It is probably one of the best movies that touched me, from his story to his performances, so wonderfully played by Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni. I was very impressed with this last one, because he really brought depth to the character, because it was a very hard part. Yet, the two of them formed a few that surprised me from the beginning to the end, which appears in the road, a friendship full of love developed throughout the day, established in the film. The story takes time to roll, because the introduction of the characters is long, but eventually we are rewarded with a wonderful story about love and humanity. If you have the chance, see it, because it is a movie that will stay in mind for a long time. Simply surprising - 9/10.
