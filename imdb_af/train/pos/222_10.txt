A Hilarious Neil Simon comedy that cries out laughs from start to finish. The late Walter Matthau is the coarse ex-comedian who is persuaded to work with his former partner (u.19 winner George Burns) for a final reunion show on stage. <br /> <br /> Benjamin Martin is Matthau's agent and cousin, and the two have as much chemistry as Matthau and Burns. I love Matthau's lot of character - he is just the same as he always is, and yet very different. <br /> <br /> Burns, like the absent old man, is just as funny as Matthau. <Br /> <br /> Matthau: Do you want some crackers? I have coconut, pineapple and graham. <br /> <br /> Burns: How about a regular cracker? <br /> <br /> Matthau: I'm not getting clear. I have coconut, pineapple and graham. <br /> <br /> Burns: Good <br /> <br /> Matthau: They're in the cupboard in the kitchen. <br /> <br /> Burns: Maybe later. <br /> <br /> What about these: <br /> <br /> Matthau: When I was black, the whites knew what I was saying! <br /> <br /> You have to see it in the movie to understand it! All in all, a refreshing, hilarious, sweet, cordial, warm, credible heart-shaped character comedy and some of the most memorable quotes of all time. <br /> <br /> They just don't make them like this anymore! At a time when all the latest comedies are rough, youthful and stupid, it leans back to the heart of what the comedy really is - funny characters, clever and funny dialogue and great entertainment. <br /> <br /> One of the best friend comedies of all time, upstairs with "planes, trains and cars," "deadly weapons" and "the difficult road." <br /> <br /> You may find it difficult to find rent or TV, but trust me, it will be worth your while! <br /> <br /> 4.5 / 5 stars. <br /> <br /> - John Ulmer
