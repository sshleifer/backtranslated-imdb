The part of The Grinch was made for Jim Carrey and I was very impressed with his performance. I wasn't a big fan of him, but was pleasantly surprised with the outcome. Taylor Momsen as Cindy Lou Who was the cutest girl I've ever seen on the screen and she has seen a maturity past her years in her acting. I was even drawn to tears at one point! I have never read the Dr Seuss book of the story, so I did not know what to expect, the humor was rather dark. Overall, I enjoy the movie (apart from the songs!) And will recommend it, especially for family viewing.
