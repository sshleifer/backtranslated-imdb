Well, when I watched the movie one night, I was simply amazed at its greatness. Fantastic screenplay, great plays, costumes and special effects, and the plot turns, wow !! To get to the end, you have to become a writer yourself. <br /> <br /> Great, I would recommend this movie to everyone, especially if I don't like so many of them. <br /> <br /> Great
