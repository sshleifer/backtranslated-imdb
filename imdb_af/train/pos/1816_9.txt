Many reviews on this page mention that this movie is a bit dark for kids. It depends on the child. It's not a 2-6 year old movie; It is more aimed at the 8 year and older crowd. I saw this movie when I was 10, I absolutely loved it. At that time, most animated films were a little too childish for my taste. This movie is about more serious issues, so it has a bit more emotional impact. In this movie characters can die, and sent to HELL! It gives a bit more emotional weight to the scenes where characters endanger their lives. The good guys are not always perfectly sweet and nice (like other cartoons). They have "real" motivation, such as revenge and greed, but also compassion and friendship; show that things are not always black and white. <br /> <br /> Excellent movie
