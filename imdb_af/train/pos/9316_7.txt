Walter Pidgeon is Braley Mason, a civil lawyer who plays a criminal case in the Unknown Man, a 1951 film, also starring Ann Harding, Barry Sullivan, Keefe Braselle and Richard Anderson. A great believer in justice, Pidgeon accepts a pro bono case that defends a young man, accuses Rudi Walchek (Braselle) of murder and gets him acquitted. Shortly afterwards he realized that the man was guilty and expressed protection from his victim as well as other shopkeepers in the neighborhood. He is advised by the DA (Sullivan) that Rudi is little change, to eradicate organized crime, the top man must be found. Mason finds the top man and has a dilemma. <br /> <br /> "The Unknown Man" is a small black and white film that manages to keep the viewer's interest in its various plot movements, although the plot is somewhat confronted. It really is the story of a good man seeking his God, righteousness, and what he is willing to do to achieve it. And this is the most complicated part of everyone. I think there was a time before O.J, the Menendez Brothers, etc., Etc. When people believed in justice and the integrity of lawyers. For this viewer anyway, those days are over. <br /> <br /> Walter Pidgeon does an excellent job - his attractive, elegant attitude and explanatory voice show us a successful, confident man but also a great deal of care. Pidgeon has had a wonderful career stretching over 60 years, but has never really risen to superstars. He was a solid actor who could play and do just about anything. It could be because by the time he was leading, he was good in his thirties and missed being a matinee idol; Or it could be, he lacked that certain thing; or that he was typed early as second leading to a large female star like Greer Garson. Hard to say. He gives an honest and pleasant show here. <br /> <br /> Very good movie with good performances.
