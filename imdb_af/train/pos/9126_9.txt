This film is excellent and great. Prince's Oscar for music was richly earned (many people don't know he won one). I think it's one of the best movies to watch DVD late at night. A big surprise: Prince does a good job, and is pretty good at transporting the camera. Morris Day, Wendy, and Lisa are good at supporting roles. Very cool landmark film.
