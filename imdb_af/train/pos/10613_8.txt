It's a lost horror jewel with Sydney Lassick ("Carrie" and others) and Barbara Bach. It is sometimes difficult to find a copy of this movie, but it is worth it. This movie is creepy but cheesy at the same time. It appears that 3 young news women (Karen, Vicky and Jennifer) travel to the small town of Solvang, California to cover a festival when there is a refurbishment with their hotel room and they seek refuge at the home of Earnest Keller (Lassick) and his strange wife, Virginia. Vickie stays behind, feels sick, while the other 2 wants to film their story. She is soon to be murdered at home, in a very cheesy way by an unknown force hiding in the ventilation system (she is cut off by the snag of the vent as it crashes on her while being pulled through and into the basement) . Soon Karen comes back and she is even more brutally murdered by covering her face with the lid. Jennifer fights with her (ex?) Lover in a rather boring subplot, and when she returns home, her hosts (who we have discovered now, brother and sister, and whatever is in the basement are their son) a plot to kill her too. Virgina doesn't quite agree with Earnest's plan to kill Jennifer, but she goes to the basement where she meets Junior. Here, the movie is almost comedies like Junior (hysterically portrayed by Stephen Furst) a distorted, mentally deficient man's child whose actions and movements will cause some chuckles, although it is supposed to be frightening. This is where the pass of the movie picks up and the end is well done. The actors / actresses do a wonderful job with the material especially Lassick, Furst and Bach and although this is not the most horrible movie ever made, it is very entertaining!
