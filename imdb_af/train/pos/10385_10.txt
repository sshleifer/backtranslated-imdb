It's been a while since I watched this movie and the series, but now I renew my memory! It was a very funny movie based on the classic series! Johnny Knoxville and Seann William Scott were hilarious together. Bo and Luke Duke help Uncle Jesse run Moonshine in General Lee. When Boss Hogg enforces the Dukes of their farm, Bo and Luke sneak into Hogg's local construction site and find coal samples. They soon realize that Boss Hogg will dissolve my Hazzard County unless the Dukes can stop him with the help of their beautiful cousin, Daisy. My only two problems with the movie were that Burt Reynolds was not right for the part of Boss Hogg, and Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane was far too serious. Other than that, I recommend the DUKES HAZZARD!
