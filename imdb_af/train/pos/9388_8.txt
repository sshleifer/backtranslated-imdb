Many of your allegedly fortunate readers, Cage and Hopper, met happily and fortunately not in a Lynch movie, because RED ROCK WEST is better than any Lynch movie. Nicolas Cage is a third-actor actor, the porcelain babe is a surrogate femme deadly, just daddy Hopper is as mean as ever ??. RED ROCK WEST, despite the trite cast, is one of my favorite American thrillers; In a word, a thrill with a few twists. <br /> <br /> One of the mainly gusto, the tremendous pace, the excitement, the excitement, Lara Flynn Boyle's cute tight ass, Kag's enviable physical form (although undeniably ugly, with sharp, bird features, thick eyebrows and thin, scarce hair, Kage displays a fine overall shape?), Hopper's perfect routine, a few moderate but really funny moments, Cage's play with his intended person, Hopper's rigid, psychopathic allure, Lara's meanness , Cage looks like a roamer, archetypes, bleak roamer of noir theater, hungry, hard as needed, naive, dirty, tired. Lara Flynn Boyle acts as the cold mean seductress, Walsh as her heartless man, and Hopper as the Lynchian hit. He's already been done. <br /> <br /> Cage indeed looks rough or dizzy or very confused and has a serious hangover. But it can be its regular look.
