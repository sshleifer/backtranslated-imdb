If most people have not already had a bitter prospect in the field of dentistry, this little movie will make sure you are bothering paranoid patients. A successful dental hygienist witnesses his wife going down on the pool man (on their anniversary of all days!) And grasps great time in a raging collapse. After shooting an attacking dog's head, he goes to work and ends his marriage expression on the patients as he plans to do about his "slut" from a woman. There are many exciting shots of mouth-jabbing, tongsny, and beauty queen darling, as well as a wonderful depraved performance by Corbin Bernsen. The scene in which he makes ties and makes his wife gasses before she puts her teeth out effortlessly is hard to see. A dentist is absolutely the wrong kind of person to go from the deep end and this film explains it in detail. "The Dentist" is incredibly entertaining, fast, and sometimes laughing. Look at it!
