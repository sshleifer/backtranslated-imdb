Too many sources beat this line of thought drama partly due to the historical fact along with the superficially similar "nunsploitation" which was a pillar of the 70's Euro waste film, overlooking the righteous rage that made the whole effort. Maybe it was Mr. Gianfranco Mingozzi, director of Gianfranco Mingozzi, a particular attempt at narrative film making outside of the world very well received documentary programs. <br /> <br /> In a historical context, FLAVIA sets the growing uprising of an early Italian nun (Florinda Bolkan's career performance, which even surprised her stars in Lucio Fulci's devastating work, do not distort a dive) , in the monastery of her not so noble father in a desperate attempt to curb the girl's emerging, sensual nature, in the monastery. To wonder why women are best moved at their best in life than in Holy Scripture, she is confronted by ways in which male domination can break out women's lives, inspiring rebellion fueled by the ranting of half-gray older Sister Agatha ( indelible by veteran actress Maria Casarès of Marcel Carné's LES ENFANTS DU PARADIS) and - more constructively - by a Muslim invasion. Joining the oppressors and perhaps unknowingly manipulating her, Flavia is really wiping out what she's already felt herself, with expected tragic results. <br /> <br /> With its breathtaking widescreen compositions by Alfio Contini, shot by Michelangelo Antonioni's ZABRIC POINT, this is a uncompromising and solid version of a woman's fiery but ultimately endless battle against the patriarchal society that she gave no rights than she tolerated and did not commit fornication like Sister Agatha. A prolonged drug-induced fantasy series, clearly modeled on Ken Russell's otherwise distant flamboyant DEVILS, seems to have a relatively solid role in the skin department. It makes a mockery of his semi-porno reputation. It is a serious work deserving rediscovery and restoration of its unfairly strangled reputation.
