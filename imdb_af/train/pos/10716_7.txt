I watch it on the Star World network overseas, which buys the American and Canadian series that hold one or two seasons like The Jane Show. I thought of how many female pilot comedies I could actually watch on my own. There is Lucy, Bewitched, I dream of Jeanie (the one with Barbara Feldman) and then my thoughts look good. I can't think of others, the women are not all supporting roles at all. So for me, The Jane Show is in pretty good company. One thing I just thought about. I watched several things in Canada, and I never remember filming in a regular SNOW show! It's all up to the summer, LOL! Admittedly, this is a good place to live in climate change in the summer, but you will think they will show a little Canada in winter, as it is also part of the lifestyle. I mean SCTV, Just For Laughs comes in mind as two comedy shows that have been filmed in Canada for a long time and very few or no are shot at snow, although they both do many outdoor shots. I'm pulling out, but I'm similar to a bit of Jane and her obviously liberal ways accused of racism to her neighbor, and I love the naked man and his madness. I did the same as a British series called The IT Crowd (I Think) office comedy with a female head. Not in any way the best comedy ever, but for a guy to say he can see it alone, that's something to say. If I was with my wife, she could really enjoy it as it addressed office sex and things like that could be a good light comedy for couples to watch. 7 out of 10.
