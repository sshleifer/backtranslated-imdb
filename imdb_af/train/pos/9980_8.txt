Any film showing federal PIGs (People in Government) to be the powerful threats they are in real life has highly recommended me. <br /> <br /> Alas, the script supervision and editing and even, At times, directing is wrong, so there will be people who will disrupt the whole movie and ignore the good moments. <br /> <br /> I saw the original way back when it was new and hated it, despised it, disgusted It. I thought it was a terrible, irrational piece of junk. <br /> <br /> But now I don't know why. <br /> <br /> I believe the two should not be compared or even connected. <br /> <br /> Consider them as two different movies. <br /> <br /> Rate them as two different movies. <br /> <br /> This "Vanishing Point" offers a battlefield, a banner for people who want to encourage individualism, who believes in human rights, which recognizes the threat to government freedom, especially the federal government. <br /> <br /> "The voice" carries a cap with New Hampshire's state force: "Live Free or Die." At one time it would be the motto of most Americans. <br /> <br /> Despite its obvious flaws, "Vanishing Point" is a movie to cheer.
