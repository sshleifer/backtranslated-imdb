This series came to me in Deighton's writing and the genre when I was younger and I like this presentation of the story. However, I would disagree with the above comments. From what I have read in the past, it's not Holm's show that Deighton refuses to release the series, but the victim who has received all three books in the screen translation. A good example of this is rewriting the border crossing that Samson's field career ended. The scene is not in the book, the character dying in the minefield was never in one of the books and the crossing in Sinker was from East Germany to West Germany, not the Polish border. This whole storyline is cloth. The changes in Set also damage the integrity of the story. My perspective on Holm's performance was that he portrayed Simson's disorientation during his wife's devastation, and I believe he relieved him well of depicting the aging field agent who was desperately trying to bridge class. Samson both pays for his father's idealism and suffers from his influence on his life. As Clevemore commented, if he had been educating himself, he would probably have managed the department. I think the true loss of performance is due to physical appearance more than anything. Holm is dim in comparison to the Samson of the book - a physically impressive man who is able to use his size to impose a presence.
