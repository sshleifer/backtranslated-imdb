I was 16 when I first saw the movie, and I've always been a favorite of mine. Of course, you can't deny Kristofferson's appeal in the movie. How good is the man ???????????? Wow. He's still. He's the bad boy every woman wants in secret. His play is flawless. He just played a drunk / druggy just like someone who really went through it - and he did - in 76 he finally got on the wagon, so it was all really real. <br /> <br /> The music is BIG and although I later thought that Streisand was not the right person for him in physical beauty, I think this is more of a problem for male viewers than female. Our gals just look at Kris - and of course the guys look at the female interest - my husband can't watch the movie b / c from her - he doesn't like her look. But I just let him sit through the red Ferrari scene on the road to the end just so he could see how well it did - the camera work was so perfect and you were completely in the car with him with the musical shooting you had to see it on my 50 "plasma - WOW! And finally, the transfer quality was BIG - anamorphic widescreen and really clear with good color and very low noise, except for dark areas normal to all movies. <br /> <br /> I brought some good memories of my mom and I loved this movie together. I bought a copy for her for Christmas. I would have loved it with her last night. <br /> <br / > I tried to put the original with Judy Garland, but I think it's first to see, I just can't go in the early era, all the concert material in the '76 version was so much like what I'm at the time. <br /> <br /> I work through Streisand's comments, but she just wants to talk about hair eleven and the s ongs, so far she has almost even called Kris or details about scenes in the movie. Her voice sounds exactly the same as now. <br /> <br /> Check it out, if you grew up in the same era, you'll love it. <br /> <br /> Wendy
