Fantastic movie! Recently rented the DVD and was finished off by this beautiful piece of work. Douglas Sirk was a film-making genius and he gets performances from Rock Hudson, Dorothy Malone (Oscar winner), Robert Stack (Oscar nominee) and Lauren Bacall who can't describe words. Paul Verhoeven gave brilliant luck to this film by playing Dorothy Malone in Sharon Stone's murder-inspiring guru in his Basic Institute. What a great joke! <br /> <br /> In turn, the movie is hilarious, sounding, camping, biting, trashy, compelling and eye-catching! It is definitely the grandmother of every dull, big-and-small screen soap opera, but no one has the brilliant style you will see here: the camera work is smooth and polished, the use of color is breathtaking, the opening mounted on the title song is unforgettable, the one-dimensional characters are memorable, and the final image will make your head scratch about how the sensors back then make it the final cut! <br /> <br /> While most older, highly regarded films can sometimes be a tedious task to go through, Written on the Wind has so much and goes so fast that it's actually a shame when it ends. Thank you to Mr. Circle for craft and Todd Haynes to pay attention to what has become one of my favorite movies now! See this movie!
