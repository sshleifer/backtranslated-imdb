When I first heard about Moon Child, I thought it was a joke. After a few months I thought I thought it was real. The few reviews I read that were NOT made by squeaky fingers were not very promising. <br /> <br /> When I had the opportunity to see it, I was fully prepared to groan, win and otherwise shut my eyes to avoid foolishness. <br /> <br /> I was more than a little surprised and in a good way. <br /> <br /> Yes, Moon Child has his moments of cheese, camp and general dorkiness - I think it's impossible to avoid when it comes to Gackt Camui, a man who is not known for his common sense, but it was quite enjoyable. <br /> <br /> No, it's not a work of movie genius, but it's very, very cordial, amusing, with fun choreography, a touch score, and a fun role. I don't know much about the Japanese theater so I can't really judge the play, but the fact that the cast speaks to them at some time or a foreign language or extreme dialect and that some of them have almost no acting no. was quite impressed. <br /> <br /> If you can enjoy a good action movie, a good drama, a good comedy, watch this movie. At least rent it because it comes to Region 1. <br /> <br /> There is zero homosexual / homoerotic content in this movie on a synot. I didn't even see much of a subtext. Don't let people who read too much in things ruin it for you.
