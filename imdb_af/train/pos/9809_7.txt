Randolph Scott is heading to Albuquerque to work with his uncle. But on the way there, the stage is held - although they do not carry a safe. But a pretty lady on board is $ 10,000 for her and her brother's business ... and the robbers seem to know it. <br /> <br /> Once in town, Scott goes to this uncle about the job. However, he soon learns that this uncle is for a while - the typical bad guy of the Westerners. You know the rich man who just wants to be rich by cheating and stealing and threatening until he owns everything. And it just happens that this jerk was behind the robbery. Scott demands that the uncle return the money and then Scott goes with the beautiful lady and her brother. <br /> <br /> Not surprisingly, it's NOT the end of the problems --- just the beginning. Again and again, intrigue of different kinds occurs to wipe the uncle's opposition. One thing is to bring in a beautiful woman to befriend Scott and his partners. She's been shot and it seems scarce to Scott. Until he finds out why she came to town. <br /> <br /> Unlike most later Randolph Scott movies, this one shows Scott as a bit more worthy man. Too often in his films, he is the last to propose violence, but in this movie he quickly makes a line string. (Screw the law, let's have a hangin.) And later he can threaten the uncle. What a surprise to see him so hot, but in most other ways, he's the same old Scott you'd expect. <br /> <br /> As far as the movie is concerned, there's nothing special about It. Gabby Hayes plays the usual character, Scott is a hero, the bathing can not be argued and is eventually destroyed and Scott gets the girl. Despite this very typical plot, it is all handled very well and as a result it is worth it. <br /> <br /> Incidentally, there are two strange scenes in the movie. First, late in the movie, there is a fist fight between Scott and the uncle's # 1 fellow, Lon Chaney, Jr. In it, Chaney smokes as he fights - something I've never seen before and I admired how he could extinguish while kicking his butt. Secondly, get a cargo from the runaway cart with the whip - now it was one impossible thing!
