It's a cute and sad little story of cultural difference. Kyoko is a beautiful Japanese woman who drove to California to escape from a failed relationship in Japan. Ken is a Japanese American craftsman with aspirations of rock and roll, but little concrete to offer a potential partner. Kyoko "married" Ken to stay permanently in the US provided that while they will stay together until they get a "green card", the marriage will be in name only. It soon develops that the parties are not at the same wavelength - or perhaps in the same "time zone", thus the title of the movie. As an immigration attorney, I saw such "arrangements" take on their own lives, and I was pleased to see how well the filmmaker developed the dramatic possibilities of this situation.
