Good story and great animation. The influence of Frazetta and Bakshi is obvious, and that's a good thing. Anyone who enjoys Conan the Barbarian or the Dungeons and Dragons game should enjoy it. The battle between good and evil is clearly cut, although it may seem that our hero is sometimes neutral. Most often in fantasy films, elves are usually portrayed as white skin and blonde hair and gnomes and orcs have dark skin and hair. Anyone who is familiar with Frazetta's, Bakshi's, or even Tolkien's work, knows they are not racist. Anyone who enjoys fantasy movies should like this movie. It is not for young children because of violence and sexual innuendo. The casting was well done and the screens and music were first. I hope someone will put this jewel on DVD soon. I consider myself happy to have a VHS copy in good condition.
