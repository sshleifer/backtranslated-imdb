Winchester 73 gets credit from many critics to bring Western back to World War II. Director Anthony Mann needs a lot of credit for his excellent direction. Jimmy Stewart does an excellent job, but I think Stephen McNalley and John McIntire steal the movie with their portrayal of two bad guys involved in a high-poker game with the winning Winchester 73 going to the winner. It's a great script with several stories at the same time. Look for the first appearance of Rock Hudson as Young Bull. Thanks, for a few years, we will begin to let Indians play in Western movies. The film is in black and white and was shot in Tucson Arizona. I won't place Winchester 73 in the Stagecoach, High Noon or Shane category, but it does get an above average recommendation from me. <br /> <br />.
