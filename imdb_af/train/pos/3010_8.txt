William Powell's final outing as Philo Vance takes place in The Kennel Murder Case where the murder of a championship show dog leads to two more murders and one attempt of human kind. This is all about figuring out how it leads to those who and why. <br /> <br /> At the time, the Philo Vance murders by SS Van Dine were the most popular and the smart mr. From Dine has a way to sell his books one by one to the highest studio bidder. That's why you see so many Philo Vances and so many studios to put them out. If Bill Powell was no longer known to MGM as Nick Charles of the Dun Man series, he would have been known as the biggest of Philo Vances. <br /> <br /> It appears that Powell entered his smaller terrier captain in the same game where the murdered dog was enrolled, and then another rival became the first murder victim. As usual, Powell shows Eugene Palette as Sergeant Heath, whose biggest contribution to the proceedings used his bulk to break down the locked door from where the first murder victim was found. <br /> <br /> I said it was from the inside and it was a top story, so it was to find out how. Powell has a beautiful group of suspects, as comprehensive as usual in a Thin Man secret. People like Paul Cavanaugh, Helen Vinson, Ralph Morgan, Mary Astor fill their roles well. <br /> <br /> Warner Brothers likes this version so much that in the thirties they again with James Stephenson in his one and only trip as Philo Vance. It does not contain a candle for this one. <br /> <br /> Since it's the only Powell Philo Vance that comes out on all levels on VHS or DVD, watch this or get it if you can.
