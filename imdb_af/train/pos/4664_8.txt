"Warm Millions" is a wonderful comedy made even better by the presence of the wonderful saucepan that is put together. The film is a tribute to the genius of Peter Ustinov, who wrote the screenplay and appears as the key figure of an enterprising eclipse. The film, led by Eric Till, does not show signs that he is so terribly dated as some others of that period. <br /> <br /> In the midst of the action, a friendly man, Marcus Pendleton, before being released from prison, determines the income tax forms for the officer, surprised by the repayment he owes by the government is. Marcus, who is a genius at numbers, sees opportunities where others will not. He is starting to work for a firm that uses the latest computer for its accounting, but Pendleton is an inventive man who finds a way to take advantage of the system and establish different accounts in different parts of the continent. <br /> <br /> Marcus is assigned a secretary, who also has an apartment in his building. The inactive Patty is seen as a bus rider who manages to make a mess of everything. How she enters a job as a secretary is wise, but things are never the same in the office when the creepy Willard Gnatpole decides to follow her, but she is not afraid. Patty's heart belongs to Marcus, who is a perfect pianist and she is a whistle and they make beautiful music together. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the movie is Peter Ustinov. He clearly understood how Marcus should be played and run away with the film. Mr. Ustinov gives an assured account of the embezzlement. The excellent Maggie Smith is also at her best with Patty, the friendly wife who is worshiping Marcus, and who is a genius rewarding herself in investing the money she finds in Marcus' s bags. <br /> <br /> Karl Malden is perfect as the US in charge of the corporation. Bob Newhart also appears as Gnatpole, the man who wants Patty, but can't get her back. The wonderful Robert Morley is seen as Caesar Smith, whose identity accepted Marcus. Cesar Romero also appears in a cameo role as an airport customs inspector. <br /> <br /> "Warm Millions" will all look for a fun time in the company of that improper but charming character, Marcus Pendleton.
