This movie pleasantly surprised me. It has a touch, slightly out of town approach that never loses your attention. This is a movie I never heard of, but if you want a "sleeper", it is. Great writing, production, and acting. I highly recommend it to audiences who want something considerate. Nick Nolte, Sheryl Lee and Alan Arkin are wonderful. Why is this movie no longer made?
