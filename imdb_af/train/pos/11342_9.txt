I watched Pufnstuf every weekend when I was about 10. It was right next to Bay City Rollers. I saw it one day at family channel and tackled it for my three-year-old girl. I forgot all the things I loved, the magic whistle, the buzz, the Witcheepoo's makeup. <br /> <br /> This show is definitely low technology. The Mayor is certainly a precedent for Mayor McCheese, and everyone is a stuffed being with annoying googly eyes. But children love these things. They'll be on their way, rather watching how an old job is a sock doll than sitting in front of high-tech computer animation. There is (soft) slapstick, but no adult themes like sex or people die, and kids accept Jimmy's schemes. Children think it would be neat to wear a bag of smoke and convince someone that their home was on fire, and I loved how every time my daughter saw a jet in the air, she thought Witchypoo was over the head. The music is old, but you get used to it a lot, and my daughter really loved it. She sang "otherwise hard, otherwise lonely" in the car. My daughter watched this show at least once a day for about 5 months and it is still one of her favorites. <br /> <br /> I see that a new Pufnstuf 2000 is in the works. I really hope they are trying to keep the old taste and do nothing like computer animating characters. I think a whole new generation will love Pufnstuf.
