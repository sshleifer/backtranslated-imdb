This version of Anna Christie is in German. Greta Garbo again plays Anna Christie, but all the other characters have different actors from the English version. Both were filmed from behind, because Garbo had such a next in Germany. Garbo herself probably favored Anna Christie in this version of the English version. It's a good story and a must-see for Garbo fans.
