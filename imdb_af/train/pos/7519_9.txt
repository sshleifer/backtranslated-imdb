The Better Announcement (2006) *** 1/2 Gretchen Mol, Lilli Taylor, Chris Bauer, Jared Harris, Sarah Paulson, David Strathairn, Austin Pendleton, Norman Reedus, Dallas Roberts. <br /> <br /> Mol shines as legendary pin-up queen Bettie Page in a fine biopsy. <br /> <br /> Gretchen Mol is probably known to be The Next-It-Girl for the next few years. Since then, no one knew who she was despite a notorious cover story by Vanity Fair among other media doubles, but despite some co-starring here and there her predicted asterisk has so far less brightly sounded. Here is the well-known Bettie Page-known queen queen, Gretchen Mol is indeed a shining star. <br /> <br /> Born in Tennessee, Bettie Page was raised as a God-fearing and family-oriented proper girl who seemed to herself the unjustified object of lust and love as she grew older. A gang rape that is flash-directed is not sensibly depicted graphically, nor the subtle display of her own father who has less than decent designs for his own family. It is important to understand how Page could escape the possible nightmare life for a career as an actress in the 1950s to New York City when it was actually the time and place to capture lighting in a bottle. What the page didn't realize is that she would just be the same when she arrived. <br /> <br /> A beautiful raider darling with a divine figure. Page 1 is seen on Coney Island on one summer day by a black policeman asking to take her photo leading to her in his basement and finally to the studios of Irving Klaw (Bauer) and his sister Paula (Taylor) who are tackling their kitschy but as pornographic silence is considered a unique client: fetish types. <br /> <br /> Although Page is rather naive, she is unmistakably smart and knows her body is not sin and can see the forest for trees in the sense that she is in control - or at least in what she is presented as working in that it is not obscene and she has pleasure in her increasingly less-colored portraits - until a congressional witch hunt points out a few scapegoats to make pornographic images a crime. <br /> <br /> Talented movie maker Mary Harron and her writer writer, Guinevere Turner ("American Psycho" and "I Shot Andy Warhol") streamline the biopic stairs rather neatly and perhaps a little too hurry to who really was Bettie Page, although they are justice in portraying an era of withdrawal at its peak. Big thanks to the gifted filmmaker Mott Hopfel for his carefully beautiful black and white images and also the sprinkled color segments that remember Douglas Sirk films of the era for his melodramatic kindlings. A part-feminist treaty and a part-American dream followed the story with good performances by his ensemble, including comic Bauer and Taylor as brothers and sisters in the smut, and Harris has a field day as a co-photographer with a taste for wine and chatting. It is amusing to see Strathairn as a senator on a campaign for justice after portraying news bullet Edward R. Murrow in his last outing, Good Night and Good Luck, as an opposite table role. <Br /> <br /> But hats off to the real fine talents of Mol as the unobstructed yet deep morale and most important intelligent Bettie Page that makes her childish innocent set by her brave nudity and now-judged-easy-borderline kitschy the male for decades and is still a bookmark for human sexuality in this country and perhaps the world in general. Mol is perfect and looks unpleasant with her portrait's subject, after her legendary smile. The real Bettie page was allegedly not involved in the project, but gave her seemingly gift and continues to live a somewhat secluded life which in the last moments has indicated that he is a notorious image once and for all. got it. A disgrace since this film strangely surrounds the surrounding decency that has taken place in his subject for all to see in his sheer beauty.
