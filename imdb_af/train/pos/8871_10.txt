It was a big movie that had many underlying issues. It deals with issues of rascism and class. But it also had a message to know yourself and take responsibility for yourself. This movie was very deep and has given you the message and only you can control your fate. It also showed that you know yourself and are comfortable with who you are, the only way you will ever fit into society. What others think of you is not important. I believe this movie has done a wonderful job of showing it. The actors I think could convey every character wonderful. I just thought it was wonderful how deep this film really was. At a glance, you do not look at how deep the film is, but you also see the underlining meaning of the movie.
