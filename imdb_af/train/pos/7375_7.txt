Not at the same level as Ring (or Ring 2), but still a good Japanese horror. I wish North American horror producers would take a page out of the Japanese horror template and place more 'spookiness' and less cheap shocks in their flashlights. Very good examples in this one, scenes where a colored face faces the scene behind a young actress, pictures on a wall suddenly appear, smiling, just for a second and more. Worth finding out if you want the genre.
