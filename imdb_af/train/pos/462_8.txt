"The Luzhin Defense" is in the foreground a story of an idiosyncratic chess savant (Turturro) that is consumed by the game and, in the background, became flashbacks, his boy's life and the forces created by the man. Factor in good and evil in the forms of his love interest (Watson) and former "mentor" (Wilson) respectively, and you have a distinctive drama with splendid and delicate humorous moments blended with the richly picturesque beauty of Italy's Lake Como and the intensity of high chess games. An excellent movie for those who play dramatic dramas, the author's euphemic chess game metaphor for orgasmic pleasure, is an indication of the subtle white behind the film.
