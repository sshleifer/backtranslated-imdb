Victory. I must first say that I was a little disappointed in the first few episodes, but with the confidence in the show, and Abe Forsythe's undisputed talent, I continued to watch. I can safely say I'm glad I did. The story has evolved well, and all the characters have a strong base, and most have no information. <br /> <br /> The only thing I can fault in this production is the somewhat annoying voice and pronunciation possessed by the character Lizzie. <br /> <br /> Some good acting along with a star plot really get this show across the line. Here's to hope for another season!
