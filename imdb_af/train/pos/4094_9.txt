For anyone who just saw Disney Productions' beautifully animated version of 'Beauty & The Beast', or even Jean Cocteau's surreal fairy tale vision, this 1975 French (but with a director from Poland) will be quite surprised. The plot relates to a French family of faded noble stories that marry in a pit to do English family. The most important catch is that the groom wears an old curse on the family. The movie also contains many flashback sequences (possibly) to explain this family curse. From the opening credits, to the end, it's an almost non-stop erotic fun house ride, with a lot of VERY explicit and graphic sexual content (hence the movie's X-rating in the US in its original run, which is now indefinite ). The film's somewhat contemptuous sentiment at the ruling class is likely to remind one of Bunuel's similar territory flights. If you have a taste for the truly bizarre, and are not insulted by 'taboo' material, then this movie can just scratch that itch.
