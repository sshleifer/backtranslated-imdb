For the first time I met this show when I stayed in Japan last six months in Japan. I found it on the internet when I was looking for subtitles to help me with my Japanese. My host mother warned me to stay away from it because she thought it was weird, but I found it enjoyable! Koyuki showed such contradictory characteristics and Matsujun's spirit has my day every time I agree! I saw him for the first time on Hana Yori Dango, but I liked him much better in it! <br /> <br /> Although the characters were interesting and well-developed, I was disappointed to find that they didn't change much throughout the show. Their relationship grew, but they didn't really. Still, having a fun time by everyone (even Fukushima!) Has.
