I can't believe how many people hate Hal Sparks! He was my favorite host of the show, hands off. I hate well-known gossip stories and usually do not like talk shows, but when Hal Sparks Talk presented Sop, it has to watch my television. I rarely missed an episode during his run, and was sad when the host poured guests (although most guests did a good job). <br /> <br /> Anyway, for all the people who keep Hal Sparks, I think they should never have seen the weekend specials. They were hour-long episodes of Talk Sop that included the best clips from the whole week, and were outlined by sketch comedy pieces. The original bits that Hal Sparks did were hilarious. In one he had a bad comedy devil, and in an exorcist scene, his head jumped as if he had told dated jokes about airline food. One episode was dedicated to making Multiplayer, as a lot of cloned Hal Sparks are still multiplying through the episode and moving over the studio. <br /> <br /> OK, maybe it doesn't sound as funny as I describe them, but all I know is that except Talk Sop, the only other two shows I've consistently watched during those years were The Simpsons and Late Night with Conan O'Brian. So if you like the comedy styles of those shows, you'll probably have Talk Sop during the Sparks years. <br /> <br /> It was also Henson and Tyler who were both good hosts. All three hosts brought something else to the table, but they were all good comedians in my opinion. Of course, my interest in this show in the Tyler and guest star years has started to decline, but from now on, I take the soup, the show's spiritual successor, and probably enough, the new host can laugh at some pretty unexpected bring time to time. <br /> <br /> OK, I wasted enough time on a TV program that is no longer on the air and on a channel I usually despise. Go and see something!
