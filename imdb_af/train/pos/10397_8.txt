Making The Thief of Baghdad is quite a story for himself, almost as wonderful as the story tells in this movie. Alexander Korda almost broke to make this movie. <br /> <br /> According to the Citadel movie series on The Great British Films, adopted son of the United Kingdom, Alexander Korda has taken this film in 1933 and years of planning and preparation. But World War II unfortunately confiscated Korda and the increasing cost of filming a great spectacle. <br /> <br /> Budget costs also occur in American movies, but only Cecil B. DeMille had a free hand at Paramount after 1932. He came there. But DeMille or any of his American contemporaries had to worry about enemy bombs while shooting the movie. Part of the way through the shoot, Korda transported the whole company to America and shot those series with Rex Ingram as the genius in our Grand Canyon. He will definitely not get such scenery in the UK. Korda also completed the interiors in Hollywood, already in time for a release on Christmas Day 1940. <br /> <br /> The spectacle of the thing deserves the Thef of Baghdad four Oscar nominations and three Oscars for best color kinematics, the best art & set direction for a color film, and the best special effects. Only Miklos Rosza's original musical score did not take a prize in a nominated category. Korda really had to be happy to decide to shoot in the Grand Canyon because it is impossible to get bad color photographs of that place. <br /> <br /> The special effects, however, do not overwhelm the simple story of good victory over evil. The good are the two young lovers, John Justin and June Duprez, and the evil one is Conrad Veidt as the magician who steals both a kingdom and a heart, both of which belong to Duprez. It was Veidt's career role at Casablanca where he played the Luftwaffe Major Stroesser. <br /> <br /> Of course, getting a little bit of help from an unlikely source. Tiggie boy and thief, Sabu, who could very well have been one of the few who could call him an international movie star at the time. Literally from poverty that worked as an elephant-stable boy for the Maharajah of Mysore, Alexander Korda was in need of an indigenous lead for one of his jungle traits. Sabu catches all the innocence and injustice of the youth if he fulfills the Arabian Nights fantasy of the boy who overturns a tyrant. Not a bad message to send out of it in 1940. <br /> <br /> The Baghdad Thief is doing very well today. It is an eternal story of love, romance and adventure in any order you want.
