Normally I don't watch action movies because they are usually all similar. This movie had many stereotypical action scenes, but the characters and the originality of the film's prospect made it much easier to watch. David Duchovny bent his normal acting approach, which was good to see. Angelina Jolie was of course beautiful and had great acting. Big throw everyone together. A must see for people bored with the same old action movie.
