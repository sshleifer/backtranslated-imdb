The information contained in this movie is well known to many who have recently given attention to the news. The Walter Reed scandals show a small part of the fact that we are not doing a good job of caring for our injured heroes when they return. <br /> <br /> What further shows this movie is a truth common to all wars. The psychological trauma suffered by soldiers when they wage war and the problems they have when they return to civilian life. They are not only changed or affected, they are different people and most do not know how to handle them, because they do not know themselves. <br /> <br /> Finally, this film showing the army is doing to our young women in women shows them getting ready for war and the policies and practices they need to follow in the prosecution of war that leads to all the psychologist trauma. <br /> <br /> We have over 3,000 dead soldiers in the four years of this invasion; but we have many tens of thousands who will suffer lifelong physical and psychological trauma as a result of this war. No matter which side you are, it requires you to know the cost of the war to decide if we should be in that business. This film illustrates the cost to men and women perfectly.
