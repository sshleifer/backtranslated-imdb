Although I was in the movie by Sheriff Hodges, it still jumped me in several places and I believe I'm not that easy. You can say I'm biased about the movie, and, OK, I'm, but I didn't see the final product until 12/27/2006 and was very happy. I'm not a Horror movie fanatic as such, but like the old "B" movies and black-and-white Sci Fi movies. This movie will make you think, you know when something will happen, then do it, then do it. It will keep you completely out of balance. I suggest first watching the movie as the director's notes and special features. It's so well written, directed and filmed and I can personally tell you that it was a real joy to work with this role and crew. I hope to be part of Brian and Laurence's future projects.
