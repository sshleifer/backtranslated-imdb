Yes, this production is long (good news for Bronte fans!) And it has a somewhat dated feel, but both casting and acting are so brilliant that you don't want to see any other versions! <br /> <br /> Timothy Dalton IS Edward Rochester ... it's so simple. I don't care that other reviewers claim he is too handsome. Dalton is attractive, surely, but not pretty. In fact, he has a creaking, angular dark charm that, in my mind, is very much in keeping with the mysterious, very masculine Mr. R. And he took Rochester's sad, tortured person so terribly. He shows anger when the scene calls for it, but also shows Rochester's soft, passionate, emotional side. (IMO's new A&E production suffers under the circumstances that Ciaran Hinds - which I normally worship - seems to be piercing and bullying all the time. I've read the book many times, and I never felt that Rochester was meant to be a unceasingly speeding animal to be seen. <br /> <br /> When I read the novel again, I always see Zelah Clarke as Jane. Mrs. Clarke, to me, looks like Jane as she describes herself (and is described by others). Little, childish, fairy ... though true, the actress doesn't look like 18, she describes Jane's attributes as well. While other reviews claim that her acting is wood or emotional, one should remember that the character who spent 8 years at Lowood was trained to keep her emotions and "passionate nature" in control. Her main inspiration was her youth friend Helen, who was the picture of the suppression of ruin. Although her true nature was different, Jane learned to master her temper and look decent, in line with the school's goals for her charity students who would be employed. Jane becomes a governor in the household of the rich mr. Rochester. She will definitely not speak to him as an equal. Even later when she did so well, she always remembered her station being far below the employer's job. Nonetheless, if you read the book - where this production is incredibly close - you can persevere with the little struggle that Zelah-as-Jane sees when she represses her emotions to stay soft and level. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between Dalton and Clarke is just right, I think. No, it doesn't look like Hollywood (thank you! It's not a Hollywood-type book), but they are a romance that is true, dedicated and loyal. And for a woman like Jane, who never meant to have love, she's gone, it's a little miracle. <br /> <br /> The rest of the casting is great and I love the fact that almost every character in the book is present here. So, much of the rich, poetic original dialogue. This version is the only one I know to include the beautiful, notorious "gypsy scene" and, in general, has more humor than other versions I've seen. In particular, the mutual plague between the main characters comes straight out of the book and is so delicious! <br /> <br /> In many ways, Jane Eyre was one of the first feminist writings. She eventually accepted love on her own terms and independently, and eventually as Rochester's true equal. Just beautiful!
