"Hitler, the rise of evil" is made clear by people who are emotionally unobstructed by the horrors of World War II. It makes a refreshing experience. <br /> <br /> I think its greatest value lies in its crystal clear revealing of the Nazi mechanism. Of the completely corrupt ways Hitler made it to the top. Once it arrives, this movie ends. <br /> <br /> When the top of the "Fuhrer" (= German for "leader") led his Germany to the greatest and devastating war in the history of mankind. He ends six years later in Germany's total defeat. As a result, Germany lost its eastern provinces (about 35% of its pre-war land) and had to accept a 44-year division of its remaining territory. Both West and East Germany had to be rebuilt from waste, their reputation was severely damaged by the many racist-inspired Nazi atrocities. <br /> <br /> As I said, "Hitler, the rise of evil" makes a good look. Set in an acceptable thirty environment, with (more than) competent acting. In particular, Peter O'Toole's role as elderly president von Hindenburg stands up and adds even an extra dimension. <br /> <br /> My copy of Hitler, the rise of the Bose, also offers a second DVD with two good documentaries. The one deals with Hitler's personality, the second dealing with the falsification of the Hitler diaries. In 1983, this counterfeit caused a hilarious scandal in England and Germany, damaging the reputation of various historians and journalists.
