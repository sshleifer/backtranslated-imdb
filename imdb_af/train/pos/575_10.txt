Great drama with all the areas covered, except for the screen that was too slow and had to have more relevant scenes like Pitt's character questioned by the President, or Pitt being murdered instead of just describing it to us.

The drag of the movie has kept this one of all time great, though you see Pitt here, making the movie worth watching. Also great fans of physics, early 20th century styles and Montana will really ........
