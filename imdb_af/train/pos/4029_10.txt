I don't have words to describe how good this movie is. Only a genius such as Amrita Pritam could have written such a true portrayal of the days of partition. The movie chased me for many days. <br /> <br /> Urmila has the role of her life in this movie. She did life in the role of Puroo and Manoj Vajpai, not less in his role as Rashid. It's hard to think of anyone other than these two who play the role of Puroo and Rashid. The Punjabi costumes look so natural on Urmila and Manoj looks like a natural Punjabi-Mussel Moon. <br /> <br /> Sandhali Sinha as Lajjo and Suri as Ramchand did great work. Priyanshu Chattarjee did good work as Triloki. <br /> <br /> Some of the scenes you just can't get out of your head. When Puroo first meets Lajjo, it brings tears to your eyes. The climax is just a killer. I expected a tragic end, but thankfully the end was wonderful. <br /> <br /> This movie is in the same category as Pakeezah, Mughal-e-Azam, Banaras etc. Not to be missed.
