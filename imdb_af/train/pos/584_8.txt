Excellent movie that deals with the life of an old man as he looks back over the years. From 1910 he reminded his son and young adulthood; his family, friends, romance, etc. Very nostalgic piece with a bittersweet final .... "All things in life come together like one, and a river runs through. And that river haunts me." Worth to see.
