It is a trio of stories, "Shakti", "Devi" and "Kali", about an experimental congregation (or something like that), the Taylor-Eriksson group, that brings people inside themselves and into the kingdom of the unknown, and left some damage here and there, I want to say. Many years later there are still some of the damages that are still at the right moment to show. Shakti tells the story of a woman whose husband died mysteriously. In fact, he was torn apart, and the suspect was a man who didn't exist. Seems that this woman can produce an inner devil, or so the sister of the man who was killed tries to talk to this woman while acting as a reporter. Devi tells the story of a young man who "wants to jump out of his skin". He is a skinhead, a speeding freak, and is sent to see a psychiatrist who is just a former member of this congregation, leading to the good doctor helping the young man realize his desire. This is probably the best of the three segments. Kali tells the story of a healer who tries to heal this woman who was part of this congregation, leaving a kind of demon living in this woman, but one wonders if he did it or if she detached it because it could no longer survive in her. All three of these stories are pretty dirty and exciting, because you're never really sure what to expect, and the premise and the settings are so different from conventional horror movies that add it to strangeness. It has some kind of low budget features, but it also manages a beautiful, unpleasant atmosphere, much to its credit. I saw it with my mouth opening a good part of the time and when the real scarecrows (and gore) came, it hit pretty hard. I found this to be a very interesting and disturbing movie and liked it a lot. Finding a good little, this one, I give it 8 out of 10.
