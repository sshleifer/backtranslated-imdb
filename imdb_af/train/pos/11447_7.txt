This movie is probably for you. It has an overall meditative quality of music, beautiful photography, and listening to the often clich√© of life that Andy Goldsworthy would say if he worked or between shots. If you are familiar with Buddhism - this is the kind of sense I got from this movie. The inability of life, the beauty of nature, the interconnectedness of all things, etc. But what I didn't understand, confused and eventually forced me to go without ending (I saw it in an hour) was the dismissal of the whole thing. You only get pieces why he is commissioned and how he can even afford to keep off this kind of work. The artwork is alive, but all his talks with no conclusions lead to death.
