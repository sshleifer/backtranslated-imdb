I watched this movie after watching Blue Crush and others from Michelle's movies. I thought she had a pale future in this business. I was extremely wrong after seeing her performance in Girlfight. I was amazed at the way she was the emotion of one fighter, but also a fighter. In this movie she confronts her about the treatment of her and her brother, the way she bears anger when she is hit. Her characters learn curve in the film she can always make a wall and hide from love, or it's just because she has power, she won't win. I believe this role was perfect for Michelle, although she didn't have previous experience, the director saw talent. I criticize myself for not seeing the talent in her.
