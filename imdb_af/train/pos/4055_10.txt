This movie is great and I would recommend for kids and adults. The animation is beautiful, the characters are rich and interesting, and the story is fascinating; much better than the American studios produced at the time. However, there are some examples of this statement. It is a pity that Disney bought the Studio Ghibli catalog and then started with a slaughterhouse. My main point is, Disney has renamed the film, despite the fact that the original English version is very impressive. The new cast with Van der Beek et al destroyed it and took away much of the appeal of the characters. Pazu and Sheeta went from adventurous companions to bright teenagers. The original music score is also much better than the Disney remix. That is why Disney made such changes? It seems as if it was thrown by Van Der Beek et al, Disney can raise more money, which is fair, but in the process they infected the film. It's still a beautiful movie and I still recommend it. My main beef is that Disney has ruined a childhood movie that I loved and still love. I'm happy to have an original Japanese import with the original English dub I'm going to watch with my life now!
