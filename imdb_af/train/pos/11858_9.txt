This movie is just fantastic. If you have a chance to see it, run to see it. Although the movie has almost nothing to do with its original 1932 original, Pacino plays a good job as Tony Montana gets around. <br /> <br /> Pacino has so around him where he can say something anyway and makes it sound just fine. If you thought Pulp Fiction was good with the swear words (if you saw it), then you should also see Scarface to see another angle how an actor can say it. (it's pretty sweet) <br /> <br /> Although the movie has a lot of action and the plot is moving very fast by the time, the real-time aspect ratio is not right, but it's still easy to follow along , but you keep your eyes at all times to lose nothing. Personally, I found that watching this movie make three hours look like a breeze, it's really just as good. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of those movies that is so well-respected and so well-liked that it doesn't just forget that this movie is made in the crappy 80s, but it actually makes you root for the bad guy ... "So good night says to the BAD guy"
