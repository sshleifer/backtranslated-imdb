George Lopez is a funny man, even without the sitcom. The first episodes I saw on this site too often made jokes at the expense of his mother. As I watched it more, there was more and more variety. No one on the roll is really safe from his side. <br /> <br /> It seems to me that this season has progressed that George gets more comfortable with the family sitcom daddy role. Initially he wasn't, but he was getting more and more in a groove. It makes him and the performances progressively harder. They also added a few characters for George to play this year as well. His wife's father is becoming more and more involved in the plot. <br /> <br /> His mother is still there, but not as central as last seasons. I think it's wise to say with George's sense of comic timing, and ABC's lack of good sitcoms, George Lopez, has a good chance long after George W. Bush here on ABC.
