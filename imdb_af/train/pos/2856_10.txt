It's one of the movies that gets better every time you see them. It's full of so many original and unconventional ideas that you always get a new detail. As in Sabu's subsequent movies (I didn't see "Unhappy Monkey", but the others are so big) Failure, chance and humanism are playing a big role. The cutting and fitting is inventive and artistic, without the movie being an art photograph, but a highly entertaining one. When compared to "Run, Lola, Run", remember that "Dangan Ranna" was made a few years earlier and was shown on German TV as early as 1997. It is therefore more likely to serve as inspiration for Tom Tykwer's movie, and not the other way around. In addition to the other reviews, I must add that I enjoy the acting and the end very much. This movie is fun in many ways, and it manages to deliver a message without being annoying or pretentious.
