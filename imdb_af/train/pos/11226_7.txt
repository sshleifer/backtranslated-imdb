Star Trek Hidden Frontier will surprise you in many ways. First, it is a series of a fan that is only available on the web. It mainly contains friends and neighbors who have put the computer programs and home video cameras and sewing machines on display, as Mickey and Judy once agreed. It's definitely friends and neighbors, you can tell. Many of these people aren't the most beautiful people you've ever seen, either the youngest or the thinnest? some stumble through their lines as they walk on marble? some of them have thick accents, or simply do not look good at first, which makes it almost impossible to understand a single lonely word they say. Yet, you have to admit that everything these friends and neighbors have compiled is actually fun to watch. Yes, some of the dialogue is hokey. Yes, it's a bit weird (though a little cool) looking at two Star Fleet males (although some of the kisses are apparently going on.) TOS, TNG, other apps and movies, or when you hear the theme of Galaxy Quest at the beginning and end of each show. Okay. We can get through it. Why? The graphics are first time. Better than almost everything you saw. And sometimes, a show or two really tells story? some of them are actually real tear-breakers. <br /> <br /> Hidden Frontier is a total guilty pleasure in every sense of the word ?? but you need to give those involved credit where credit is due. It takes a lot of effort to place a production of this size. People, sets, costumes, graphics? This is a huge effort on many people's parts. We look, we return, and we thank them.
