Does anyone know what the 2 sports cars were? I think Robert Stack's might be a Masseratti. Rock Hudson's character told his father he had taken a job in Iraq, wasn't it in time? I had Dorthy Malone in my bank for most of my life, maybe that's the movie that impressed me. Loren Bacall definitely had a few chops in this movie, and Malone both acted Malone. the Oscar for the best supporting role. Was Loren's role seen as a leading role? Old Man Hadley's character was probably a nice general picture of tycoons of his era by being an ordinary man who made it big in an emerging industry, but in building an entire town he forgot his children to to get wife. In the widow he realized that they were all he really had, and they were rotten, looking for attention, so rather than talking to his children, he sounded. off his head. An ancient morality story. But seriously, what were those sports cars?
