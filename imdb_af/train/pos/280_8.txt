Undying is a very good game that brings some new elements to the tired genre of first person shoot em ups. It tells the story of Patrick Galloway, an occult expert and a formidable fighter called by a friend to his estate in Ireland to investigate some strange phainom. The game is set in Ireland after the First World War, so don't expect weapons like chainguns or rocket launchers. All the weapons in the game can be considered antique, but the real fun in the game is its play and the system they work on. . Our hero is ambitious so he can both use his hands simultaneously: he throws spokes with his right arm and uses his guns with the left side. So you can shoot and throw at the same time as you have fun and also unique to this game! The graphics are good and they can run very well on a medium power P.C. flat design is also cool and atmospheric. Usually the game revolves around the covenant and the mansion, but there are many other places waiting to be discovered as you progress. Thanks to the talent of Clyve Barker, the game has an excellent story and plot (something very rare for a First person shooter) and I have seen a great and very haunting atmosphere that the voice worker is good but not excellent. But the game has two main mistakes. First, it's fairly linear. For example, when your mission says go to the room, all the doors in the house will be closed off by those who lead the room of your mission, this can save time but it limits your freedom of exploration. Secondly, the fact that all the weapons are antique articles may not be with most fps players used to appeal high-tech weapons. As for the problem, the game is well balanced. Most of it is of medium difficulty, but sometimes it becomes more difficult, but not frustratingly difficult. Overall unnecessary is a good game. Definitely one of the best fps out there.
