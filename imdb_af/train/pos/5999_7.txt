It's a strange movie for me. After reviewing a nice movie by a new filmmaker (FAR OUT by Phil Mucci), another author / director, Ryan Jafri, contacted me and asked for his film, THE CURE. I don't normally watch movies this way, but what is it? I like shorts and can't wait to see another. <br /> <br /> Interesting, as it turned out, I like THE CURE, I wasn't excited about it and let Jafri know. He encouraged me to review it anyway. It gives me honest evaluation. <br /> <br /> The movie has tremendous style and as far as Jafri's direction goes, it's exceptional - especially for such an inexperienced film maker (it's his first movie). The combination of exceptional choices of color, pacing and music that suited the film has created a good atmosphere. You're really drawn into the movie and it's a credit for the movie. The thing I didn't love, however, was the writing. While the basic idea was great, the end was just too easy to provide. I would really love the end if it was a surprise or an unexpected turn. However, since this film is from someone who cannot give such a professional film, it is good for his future. Good work.
