I don't easily give out ten star ratings. A movie must really impress me, and the Bourne Ultimatum has gone a long way. Furthermore, this trilogy came together so well that I believe it is one of the greatest movie trilogies of our time. Although all three films no longer differ from the Ludlum novels, they still stand as a powerful landmark in the film. The Bourne Ultimatum made me cry that the series was complete, but I couldn't even try to stop smiling for hours. <br /> <br /> From the moment the opening title appeared, I knew we were in for a drive. Paul Greengrass did it again. Everything we like about the previous Bourne movies is here again: the action, the dialogue and of course the shaky camera. But for me the last one was never a problem. I think it adds to the tension. <br /> <br /> I'll be back to see this movie a few times before being released on DVD, simply because it's genius. It is a completely satisfying conclusion, and should be the test of time as a fantastic movie, and totally an unforgettable trilogy.
