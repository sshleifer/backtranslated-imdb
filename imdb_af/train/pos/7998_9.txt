I loved this movie. I am a Mexican and was least insulted by it. In fact, I think this movie should be shown at the Mexico police station. It is a sad truth that our police system is as rotten as a 3-month-old looks. It makes me anxious to read in the news how murderers, kidnappers and other murders go free by paying a fake fine or living like kings in prison cells. We need someone like Creasy, Denzel Washington's character. A bodyguard became angry vigilants. Abduction is a thriving industry here (at least in the big cities). I really wish the actual kidnappers could suffer the same fate as one's Creasy did his good job. It would be so wonderful (sorry, it's a pity!). MAN ON FIRE is a gripping movie you can't miss. It may be difficult for some of you, if you don't read subtitles (Mexicans do it ALL time while watching American movies), but the effort will be worth it. Some of the editing is a bit vague ... kind of TRAFFIC, remember? (Another brilliant assumption how corrupt Mexico is). The movie starts a bit slow, but the pass picks up the second half. I swear you will rejoice when you look, Denzel Washington sends out the wrong perpetrators. His performance is nothing short of excellent. The end (no spoilers, OK !!!) is a bit sad, but I'm sure you'll keep it anyway. MAN ON FIRE is one of the best movies of the year. A "must" for a DVD collection! 9 * out of 10
