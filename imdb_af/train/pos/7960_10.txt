In the past, there were numerous talk-animal films, the majority of which animated animals' mouths digitally to suit almost the voters, or ridiculous amateur. Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey is not. <br /> <br /> This film does not need the baby-pleasing addition of moving dog lips, or gesture cats limbs. It has the ability to make you believe that the animals are authentic, and you can rather be emotionally attached (like all the big boys and girls). <br /> <br /> Homeward Bound is the hallmark of all family-friendly animal skirts for me, boasting stunning cinematography, an inspirational soundtrack (by Bruce Broughton's genius) and an impressive cast ... < br /> <br /> Michael J. Fox ... Chance <br /> <br /> Sally Field ... Sassy <br /> <br /> Don Ameche ... Shadow <br /> <br / > Frank Welker (Voice God) ... Various <br /> <br /> This is a modernized version of the children's classic work of fiction 'The Incredible Journey', long ago in 1963 in a semi-documentary film made by Disney. The sequel (lost in San Fransisco) is not nearly as good a movie but expands the adventure of my favorite furry friends and is a fun urban twist on the great outdoor adventure theme. Want to entertain your kids with a witty, beautiful, heart-warming mini-epic, without the idiotic and often utterly ridiculous comedy of modern children's cinema? Parents, buy all three movies for your kids - now! Thanks, Disney, for every time I look classic this early 90's, bring a tear to my eyes!
