I love this movie a lot. The animation was well done and the romance was cute. I love most of Bryan Adams songs and the Hans Zimmer score was excellent. What many people do not realize is how well it relates to the heart of darkness / apocalypse. Themes (what happens when so-called "civilization" enters someone's home, which means being civilized, etc.). The open landscape and music were very stirring. The film is a lament for America that was once beautiful.
