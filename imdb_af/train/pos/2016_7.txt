Higher and Higher was one of Rodgers & Hart's lesser Broadway musicals. It had only 84 performances on Broadway in 1940. Yet, it produced one of their bigger hits. It never took my mind. <br /> <br /> However, except for one minor song, So Disgustingly Rich, the entire Broadway score was scrapped when RCO bought the movie rights. Instead, a whole new score was written by Jimmy McHugh and Harold Adamson, mostly to accommodate one Francis Albert Sinatra who made his film debut. <br /> <br /> Sinatra, who made vocal comos in previous films, takes a leaf from the page of his vocal competitor, Bing Crosby. When Bing made his movie debut in The Big Broadcast, he played Bing Crosby. Frank Sinatra assumed the role of Frank Sinatra and I can't think of anyone who could do a better job. <br /> <br /> The chairman of the board has been charged third here behind stars Jack Haley and Michele Morgan. He is the butler and she is the shoe girl to Leon Errol. In fact, Errol is a millionaire who hasn't paid his help for seven months. Mainly because he is about to go to Chapter 11, he notifies staff. <br /> <br /> Errol is a great old soul to work with and none of the staff wants to lose a good thing. They pool their resources and get Michele Morgan to personalize Errol's daughter in Switzerland with her mother. The idea is to save a rich bankroll in the hope of saving the family's fortune. Only Michele started looking at another. <br /> <br /> It is a small plot and certainly not worse than a lot of musical, but RKO invests this movie with good role players. Barbara Hale and Elizabeth Risdon play another debutant and her mother who suspects something is not right, Victor Borge is a fortune that doesn't take into account. Dooley Wilson, Paul Hartman, Grace Hartman, Marcy McGuire, Mel Torme and Mary Wickes are playing the Errol household. staff. Not a bad bunch. <br /> <br /> Sinatra sang three good ballads, everybody had some sort of commercial success, The Music Stopped, a great way to spend an evening and I couldn't sleep. Last night. The last one was nominated for an Oscar for Best Song, but lost to Alice Faye's. You will never know. <br /> <br /> 1943 was the year of the Musician's Union Strike against the recording industry. To get their material out, Frank Sinatra recorded the songs of Hoër and Hoër with an akapella choir for Columbia. Bing Crosby recorded songs from his film Dixie in the same way for Decca. Both were condemned by the trade union president James C. Petrillo as strike breakers and both did not cross the picnic line again. The strike did not completely resolve until 1944, although Decca had previously listed other record companies and was formerly established as Columbia, RCA Victor and the other. <br /> <br /> The strike gave Angola's anxious moments. He just left the Tommy Dorsey band when the strike was called. It ended a required place for his artworks when he wasn't sure if Dorsey would leave a real career. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Higher and Higher is well received and a legend has been launched.
