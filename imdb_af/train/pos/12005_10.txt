This movie was the best movie I've ever seen. Being LDS, I recommend this movie because you can feel a better understanding of the life of Joseph Smith. Although the movie is not made with highly acclaimed actors, it is a remarkable and life-changing film that can be appreciated and appreciated by everyone. I saw this movie with my family and I can testify that we all had a heartbreak. This film allows people to really understand how difficult life was for the prophet and how much tribulation he faced. After I saw this movie, there was not a single dry eye in the whole room. Everyone was touched by what they saw and I wasn't the same since I saw it. I recommend this movie to everyone.
