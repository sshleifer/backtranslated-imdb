I first read Pearl S Buck's beautiful novel in my ninth grade history class, and I enjoyed every exciting page of it. It was almost inevitable that Hollywood would get it, and given that it was made in 1937, the results are excellent. <br /> <br /> Certain things have to be accepted: in 1937 there was no question of decisive Asian actors in a major Hollywood movie. In this way, it makes the end product even more interesting than if they could use a more genuine look-out throw. <br /> <br /> With that hurdle to overcome, executive producer Irving Thalberg and director Sidney Franklin (among others) have taken the trouble to choose a beautiful and starring role. Paul Muni plays Wang Lung. During this period, Muni was at the height of his powers as an actor and could play much anything he thought. Once you're past the make-up (it's good, but no one is really going to miss a Chinese man), his performance has all the likelihood of his best work. <br /> <br /> Then there's Luise Rainer. The previous year she won an Oscar for her performance in THE GROOT ZIEGFELD. The stars of the Viennese actress were on the rise and she got the crop of the plum despite her lack of experience in Hollywood. Her performance won her a second consecutive Oscar, the first time in history. <br /> <br /> Many criticisms were made of Rainer's performance, and her Oscar won here. She is called wood and one note. There is a small grain of truth. However, it is said, all you have to do is go back to the book. For Rainer, although not Chinese, O-lan played pretty much like Buck wrote to her; It's actually a great show, and one of the best book-to-screen transfers I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the cast, it's MGM. At the time, they had the biggest roster of stars and character actors in Hollywood, and a great budget to pay for the best, and eventually they had the best. <br /> <br /> The movie slightly eases Wang Lung's marriage to O-lan. In the novel, the wealth of the flesh comes with wealth and he takes a concubine, a move that destroys his wife, but her feelings as a mere woman do not touch him. In the film, an indignant Wang Lung returns to his wife on her deathbed, the two pearls he had taken from her years ago, and made her realize that she was his true love. <br /> <br /> Corny, yes. But it's Hollywood. In view of the obstacles they were facing, the film might well have opened its doors to screams of laughter. But despite the noticeable lack of real Asians in the film, this role has surprisingly been good with the course of seventy-three years. In fact, the most wonderful thing about this movie is how good it is, if it could easily be a disaster.
