I was very interested to see this movie when it first appeared in the theaters, but I couldn't get there. So, finally, it hit the shelves, and I picked it up. I don't know exactly what to expect; What followed was one of the more enticing movie I've seen in the past few years. <br /> <br /> * SOME SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> This is the story of the Wonderland killings, which led to the seaiest parts of LA and straight to the biggest porn beginning of the 70s , John Holmes (Val Kilmer). <br /> <br /> I was hooked from the start, and the feeling of the movie ran completely to the very bloody end. I was surprised to find that the movie focuses less on actual murders and more on the events before and after the investigation. Aside from a few blood-splashing walls in the beginning, and the actual performance of the killings to the end, the movie was more or less an engaging display of great dialogue and great acting. Val Kilmer everything, but sell me as a junkie pornstar, and even the "beautiful but that's it." Bosworth was a joy to watch (and just for her look, you think) <br /> <br /> I personally felt the best aspect of the movie, as I mentioned, his lack of genuine murder. It was shown in a very dark atmosphere, so you couldn't quite see the brutal blowing of the foursome sleep. Furthermore, the sound effects of the murdered murders were more than enough to devour my appetite. They beat lead pipes, there is not much more to be said. <br /> <br /> My only real problem was Carrie Fisher's short look. Her portrayal of the exaggerated religious figure was, in my opinion, a bit too clich√© of her appearance. Perhaps that person was actually part of the story, maybe, but I wasn't sold, and Fisher was for some reason a little too akward in her portrayal. <br /> <br /> Overall, an excellent movie Appreciate the watch, even if it is once! <br /> <br /> *** 8/10 ***
