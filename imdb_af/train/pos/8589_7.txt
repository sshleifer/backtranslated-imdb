I'll be honest, I finally checked this movie, not because of the stars - although they were fairly vigilant and compelling, especially the three leads - or even the compelling story of a breach in the Presidential Secret Service (something I "I was informed by the DVD extras of this show, never happened. It is true, it's remarkable!). I did it because it was targeted and had a choice came by none other than Detective Meldrick Lewis !! Well, okay, Clark Johnson, one of my faves of "Homicide: Life on the Street" and a veteran (mostly) TV director. I will say that he does as well as he can with a project that is visible but fairly average, despite the possibilities. <br /> <br /> Veteran and bait. Secret agent Pete Garrison (Michael Douglass) has to find out both who killed him and killed and inflicted his friend, an Air Force One helper has blown. He played for the Prez. (David Rasche. Anyone remember "Sledgehammer"?). His relationship with the first lady (Kim Basinger, obviously one of the first ladies we ever had, fiction or really) certainly doesn't help his status. He has to get the right mole in the service and avoid the dog dog like the hunt of his former best friend and co-agent and chief (Kiefer Sutherland, almost still in the "24" mode). Throw some other central service agents (Martin Donovan and the foxy, who are difficult to buy as gig Eva Longorria) and shady strange characters, and you have a fairly standard political excitement that is not as high as it claims and the desired reach. , if it is extremely large. <br /> <br /> The summary line is about the best way to describe how this show plays without giving spoilers. The DVD extras for me were more informative and interesting than the movie, although the movie itself was enough to keep most (myself included).
