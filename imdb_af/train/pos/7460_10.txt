I think many people just wrote it as another of Tom Cruise's strange films (Magnolia, Eyes Wide Shut), but Vanilla Sky is definitely his own movie. Many people said it was strange; It wasn't. It was different and confusing but not strange. Weird is Stanley Kubrick or Pauly Shore. Otherwise, the Trumanskou is. Confusion is The Matrix of The Game. And unlike Kubrick, this movie has a conclusion. Everything makes sense - maybe not immediately, maybe not even today, but it will make sense. Vanilla Sky is confusing because David Aames (Tom Cruise) is confused. That's the point. This is where the so-called "strangeness" carried by critics has come. If they had bothered to open their eyes to the original Spanish film of 1997, they would have seen it. And if that's not enough reason to see it, go and watch it for the music. Cameron Crowe offers a wonderful soundtrack; He uses it to set the "feel" - that infamous element lacking many movies. With songs like The Beach Boys' "Good Vibrations" playing at the dramatic and emotional highlight of the movie, he creates a horrible but amazing "real" feeling. A wonderful movie, in his screenplay, music, acting and imagery, Vanilla Sky is unfortunately a superficial bandwagon movie that critics chide to appear intelligently. Excellent: A +
