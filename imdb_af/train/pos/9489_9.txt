I'm not tired of saying this is one of the best political sensations ever made. The story takes place in a fictitious state, but it is obviously about the killing of Kennedy. A true and honest district attorney (played by Yves Montand) does not believe the single-man murder Daslow (= Oswald) has planned and executed and although all other officials want to close the case, he must investigate with his team. br /> <br /> The script is fast and fast and keeps the tension to the end. Only the section dealing with the Milgram authorities' experiment is (though not uninteresting) a bit out of place. The end series - to explain who Icarus really is - partially shot in slow motion and enhanced by a Morricone soundtrack is the strongest sequence I've ever seen in a movie.
