this movie was one of the best disney movies I've ever seen. Great for the whole family to watch. The ideas may be a bit far-fetched, but it's a great comedy and the play is great. love the little boy, jp. and adrien brody's share of the winner, Adrien Brody, could have been very short, but very memorable. highly recommended.
