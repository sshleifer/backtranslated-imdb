Greetings again from the darkness. Mary Heron collects the list of films that offer a glimpse of their specific era. Her previous "I Shot Andy Warhol" and "American Psycho" were at their best when commenting on the sense of society during that period. Although "The Notorious Bettie Page" is about me. Page is, it's just as much a highlight behind the curtain in the world of tricky photo shoots in the 50's. <br /> <br /> The movie is fun to watch both from the perspective of the story and the technical aspect of the way it is filmed and composed. The grainy B & W movie and photos capture the time and the launch of color in Miami Beach through the pictures of Bunny Yeager is very well done. <br /> <br /> The supporting role is strong with David Strathairn (fresh from his Edward R. Murrow role), Chris Bauer (like Irving Klaw) and Lili Taylor. The star of the film is the wonderfully talented and understated Gretchen Mol. Me. Mol always brings an edge and spirit to her roles. She was absolutely fascinating in the small, Jason Alexander director "Just Looking" in 2000. Here she is the infamous Bettie Page. Her smile is fascinating and her body is flawless. She really seems to enjoy this role and helps us understand how the girl next door from Tennessee can become the Underworld Pin-up Queen. As one would expect, the era's soundtrack is great. Patsy Cline and Peggy Lee are just two of the best artists. Although the film gives hints to a history in this industry, the final third kinda falls flat and prevents pure film magic. But the magic of Gretchen Mol and Bettie Page makes it a fun movie to watch and one that will deliver endless performances on HBO in the near future. Now someone will be mrs. Turn around in the star, must she be?
