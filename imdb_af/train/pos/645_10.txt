I hate exaggerated over-talky French movies, but my favorite movie of all time is the longest and most spoken French movie of all of them. I saw it twice in the mid-70's, and then it disappeared. But I finally saw it again in 1999, and fell in love again. What is most remarkable is that it feels so fresh every day, as it did 25 years ago. If you haven't seen it, don't miss your chance!
