This adaptation of Pearl S. Buck's movie is definitely a classic. A true Hollywood epic, it has all the things that a great Hollywood movie has: Birth, Death, Happiness, Sadness, Excitement, Despair, etc. There is only one thing that irritates me. I know it was a sign of the times, but none of the two main characters played by Asian actors. Paul Muni was a good actor, and he does an admirable job as Wang Lung, owner of a farm in China. Luise Rainier plays Olan. She didn't even see Chinese! I think she was trying to get the role, but they had to put Anna May Wong in the role. I know why they did not, and Mrs Rainier is very good at the movie, but they hardly tried to make her look "authentic". Still, it's a good movie, especially when you read the book (I've been in high school, decades ago). It's a must see, just look outside the casting. I think you can.
