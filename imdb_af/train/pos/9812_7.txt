"The big goodbye" presents us on the first holodeck adventure, in this case, Captain Picard, who appears as private investigator Dixon Hill. These episodes create a kind of standard pattern, repeated several times on TNG as well as DS 9 and Voyager. After entering the holodeck, something goes wrong and the characters have to handle the game under different circumstances (represented by the failure of the holodeck's security program). <br /> <br /> This concept is used to expand Star Trek's ability to create a kind of genre mix. Picard's Dixon Hill stories are examples of 1940's crime fiction and their on-screen performance is referred to as Film Noir, which often has the stereotype antihero (for example, Chandler's Marlowe stories or Polanski's all time classic Chinatown). Star Trek never focuses on the story (usually it is a simple "how-to-do-it-out" scenario), but allows the actors to take a different approach to their characters. The Holodeck games are widely used for recreation and reflect the private interests of the crew members. Therefore, the technical aspect is always neglected. From this point of view, the stories are never healthy (but has Star Trek ever had a technical, scientific point, I mean besides some utopian concepts?). <br /> <br /> "The great farewell" shows a relaxed Patrick Stewart, a McFadden that almost ever looks better in a Star Trek episode (at least early) and Data also has some great scenes ( although I find it hard to believe that the lamp's lamps Plug out of the wall would really surprise him because he did research on that period and his uses. Wesley continues to turn peaceful Trekkies into potential killers (why didn't they take him to the holodeck and let the gang members shut him down?) But all in all this one's fun ...
