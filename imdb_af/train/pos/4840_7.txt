I saw the recent Region 2 DVD of this movie in the horror section in an Oxford Street store and also advertised as a "classic thriller". In fact, it's almost exclusively a vehicle for Arthur Askey, one of the most popular names in British comedy and light entertainment for more than four decades. <br /> <br /> Perhaps his incessant cheerful, exuberant, and good humor is a bit of a culture shock to many accustomed to the sour and cynical taste of many British comedy of the past twenty-five years. But there are still those who appreciate his lively and cheerful persona and total avoidance of pathos. Askey was an idol of the great Tommy Cooper, who regularly borrowed the "self-confusion" gag that Arthur tried to entertain the stranded passengers. <br /> <br /> There is a striking, rare appearance of the inferior Linden Travers, which impacts on the mysterious July.
