Excellent comedy with Dudley Moore, supported by Liza Minnelli and well-known John Gielgud. Moore is Arthur, a man who belongs to a multi-millionaire family, who gets $ 750 million, provided he marries another lady (Susan) with another multi-millionaire family. In principle, Arthur accepted the conditions, but he eventually refused when he met beautiful and poor Linda Marolla (Liza Minneli). Arthur was just a parasite because he didn't work, he just enjoyed himself drinking hard and having fun with prostitutes. After several serious thoughts in his life and for the first time, Arthur decided not to marry Susan only a few minutes before their wedding. The end was happy for Linda and Arthur, although the latter knew that his life would change in the future. This comedy is a great lesson for life for everyone. Rich people are not usually happy with their way of life.
