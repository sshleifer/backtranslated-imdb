The third and final installment of "Hanzo the Razor" is the most concrete of them all. The training is even completed within the first five minutes of the film. Not for everyone, this movie details Hanzo's investigation into loan shark is carried out by an order of blind monks. It also makes a historical comment on the early refusal of old Japan to include Western technology. Where the first Hanzo movie was just a funny ride with a bit of connection to his plot, Hanzo 3: Who's Got the Gold did it all and brought it all to the end. Definitely the perfect final. Oh yes, Hanzo still has a lot of sex, and there is a lot of unnecessary blood and violence (that is * Hanzo the Razor).
