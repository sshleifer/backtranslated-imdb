The last (I believe) of the movies The Boys made with Hal Roach, it's also the last really funny movie they made before they went to the 20th century fox. They got their talents so famous. For example, although there are weak moments, the business with the "lung tester" is a bit, ah ... blown (but worth seeing "Dr. Jimmy Finlayson") - but in general, this movie is a good summary of what the boys have put on the screen. Richard Cramer (uncredited) appears in other L&H flicks, and he is terribly threatening here as the offender Nick Granger. The scene where the boys have to eat their own synthetic meal ("It looks good, smells good and it probably tastes good. Eat it.") Is one of my favorite moments in the oeuvre. Stan & Ollie will always be pleasant companions in the lives of their millions of dedicated supporters.
