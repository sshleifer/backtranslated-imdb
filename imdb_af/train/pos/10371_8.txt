It is a very powerful based-on-a-real story movie that is watching. I say this, because how brutally a frightening press can be for people, in this case an innocent Australian couple accused of killing their baby. <br /> <br /> Meryl Streep received a lot of recognition for her performance when this film came out. but I thought Sam Neill was just as good. Let's just say they were both excellent, but the role was much more difficult for Streep because she had to learn an Australian accent. (She learned it so well. I have difficulty understanding her in parts.) <br /> <br /> Without giving away anything, all I can say is that this movie will carry you emotionally.
