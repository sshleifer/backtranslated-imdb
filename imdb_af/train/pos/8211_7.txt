Having never seen the original Dirty Harry, I judged this movie on a clean slate. And I have to say, I really enjoyed it. Sure, some of Sondre Locke's acting made me a little squeek - but hey, it was the 80's. But even if you can't get past her (and I almost can't) or her vengeance (which was a little bit .. overdo it, P), it's worth only for Dirty Harry. Or at least, the bull dog is called 'MeatHead': P <br /> <br /> 7/10.
