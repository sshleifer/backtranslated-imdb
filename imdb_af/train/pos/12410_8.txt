This is an excellent example of what can be done on a small budget film. The acting is excellent considering the script and the whole atmosphere of the movie is very premature. The gore is well done and sparingly used (look out for excellent barbed wire death). The action is punchy when used. It is true that sometimes there are dodgy rules in the dissertation, but compared to other movies on the same (or larger!) Budget, it's hardly discernible. Overall, it is recommended. Believe me, it's better than it looks! 8/10
