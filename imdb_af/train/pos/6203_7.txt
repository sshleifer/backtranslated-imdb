A wonderful peculiar movie with enough twists for a pocket pretzelle. Parker Posey plays Fay Grim as a sexy, vulnerable, loving mother who may or may not be what she looks like. The story is a lot of tongue in the cheek, and the dialogue is skillfully underestimated. Hints of humor and intrigue, which do not dominate the characterization, Posey pulls off so well. The supporting role is stars. The downside? This movie needs your full attention, almost to the point of stopping the movie and making notes. Posey has more sexual appeal in her lifting of an eyebrow than most actresses in their entire body. She is worth your time, even if you do not understand the denial.
