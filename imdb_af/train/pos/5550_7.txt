are highlights of this 1917 feature. The Pride of the Clan tells the story of a young girl who becomes a chief after her father dies. On an island along the coast of Scotland, residents live the simple lives of "fisherman people". My copy is very dark and sometimes difficult to read, but the movie boasts a beautiful ocean, and camera work on boats is great. Maurice Tourneur directed Pickford to this pleasant movie. Pickford was already a big star in 1917, and this film just seems to have been written to her: a gentle young woman is passing on accident. Pickford whip lazy villagers to church is very funny. And the final scenes on the sinking ship were done very well. Not a great Picford movie, but still worth seeing. Matt Moore (Pickford was married to his brother, Owen Moore) is the love affair, and is good as the transfer island. Leatrice Joy is one of the villagers, but I couldn't see her either. My copy splashes a lot of bells and gongs and adds an ominous feeling when the village is driving warning bells. Very effective.
