It looks like it's a perfect day for swimming. A normal family wants to benefit from it and travel to the beach. Unfortunately, it happens that the father is trapped under a pier and not his wife or the little boy can help him out - while the tide rises. The woman (Barbara Stanwyck) takes the car and looks for help. <br /> <br /> John Sturges' short film (69 minutes) is powerful because of unanswered questions. Stanwyck finds a man who can help but there is a price she has to pay for it. There is a double question the film puts. How far will you go to help the man you love, and on the other - to observe Stanwyck's behavior towards the stranger - does she really like her husband? As a good short story, this movie leaves the viewer for himself with questions he can only answer himself.
