When I saw this movie in the 1950s, I also wanted to be a scientist. There was something magical and useful in science. I went with a girl to see it a second time. I don't think she was as impressed as I was! This film was still comical, at a time when synthetic fibers were quite new. Lessons from this film can be applied to issues relating to GM experiments today.
