I thought it was a very clever movie. I was very happy with it and couldn't really ask for more. I actually own the movie because I didn't give it back to anyone. What I have to do, but I really want to do it because of how much I enjoyed it. Also the fact that I do not own too many foreign films and that is a first. Now, I personally like Finnish stuff, it certainly added how much I enjoyed it. But overall it is worth looking at. However, if you're not trying to understand Finnish altogether or to read Subtitles, then this movie isn't for you. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
