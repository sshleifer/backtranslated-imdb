This "tragicomedy" written by renowned Serbian theater / film writer Dusan Kovacevic is probably one of the best films ever made in the comedy category. And yet the appearance of a play that has been transformed into a feature film is nothing of its value. A masterpiece that you should not miss (preferably with captions, and not baptized). <br /> <br /> In an elderly bus en route to capital Belgrade, an impending war decides the passengers' behavior. Two Gypsy musicians sing of their unhappy life, but also provide a tragedy to come; they sing both split and join phases in this extraordinary road movie (the real life Kostic brothers are amateur actors, but along with Stanojlo Milinkovic as a farmer who plowed the way, gives it a real show.) <br /> <br /> The spectrum of characters gives a brilliant image of a society facing war, an insight into the people's collective person. Everyone is aware that the war is just beginning, but they are trying to make their own lives the best they can, hoping that ignorance can prevent the tragedy. . Director Slobodan Sijan, with a simple film language, paints a picture of the society torn apart by the previous war (World War I), but also highlights personal portraits with success: provincialism of a singer, inexperience of newlyweds, seriousness of the Great War - veteran on his way to visit his recent popular son, and gloomy predictions from a man who is a German spy. <br /> <br /> Brilliantly in his narrative, with an unforgettable soundtrack (especially the Gispsy songs) and custom atmosphere, well photographed and edited, this feature (Sijan's debut) is only an introduction to a series of directors containing bitter-sweet comedies that will define Serbian cinematography of the 1980s: "Maratonci trce pocasni krug", "Kako samsistematski unisten od idiota" and my other director's favorite "Davitelj protiv davitelja").
