Despite a British perspective, it is the best WWII documentary ever produced. Presented in digestible (as digestible as war can be) episodes such as the tomb of Laurence Olivier connect the multitude of eyewitnesses who were forced to lead the events of that terrible time. Fly in anticipation of the release on DVD in the US. The Europeans had their opportunity earlier this year to release the DVD.
