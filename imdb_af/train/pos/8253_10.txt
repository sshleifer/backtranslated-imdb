This is the first movie I've seen in the past year! It's crazy funny, incredibly original, incredibly beautiful (they've gone for this super cool wide screen technicolor look that is great to watch) and it actually has depth in character and what it says about society. It is really smart satire that has left everything from Homeland Security to solve problems while at the same time letting down and realizing how much the world is living in fear. Carrie Anne Moss turns in a comic performance I never thought she would come from! She is sweet, funny and sexy! Billy Connolly is great if Fido can just groan and groan! And Dylan Baker as the Dad is invaluable. In fact, the entire casting is perfect. Henry Czerny as the bad guy, Tim Blake Nelson as the neighbor with the hot sexy zombie girlfriend (get the idea now?) Funny but challenging and just fantastic! Check out this movie! It's like nothing you've ever seen.
