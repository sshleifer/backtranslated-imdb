Hot Millions is a good movie in every respect. A fun, cute story with amazing performances by four of the best professionals ever working in the business. Peter Ustinov is brilliant, as usual, and Maggie Smith - definitely one of the best actresses of all time --- is a total joy. Karl Malden and Bob Newhart round the roll and are also perfect. If you want a movie that pours perfectly, this is it. What is so impressive is the way these people work from one another in such a natural and effortless way, with very happy and fun moments. Peter Ustinov was a genius with a wonderful sense of humor and one of his most memorable performances. The direction, photography and editing are also the first time, and this is a wonderful time capsule of London in the 1960s. It's definitely on my all-time favorites list.
