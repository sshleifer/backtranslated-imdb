Jim Carrey can do anything. I thought it was going to be a dull childish movie, and it was not. It was so incredibly fun for EVERYONE, adults and kids. I saw it once because it was almost outside theaters, and now it definitely comes out on DVD this Tuesday and I'm excited, as you can see. you should definitely see it if you haven't done it yet, it was so nice! <br /> <br /> Liz
