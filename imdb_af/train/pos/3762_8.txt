Alex Winter and Keanu Reeves return as the two shell of San Dimas sent on a different journey of a lifetime, as someone of the future feels exactly the opposite as it was presented in the first film. <br /> <br /> The only difference is that their journey is somewhere between heaven and hell and ultimately both are. When they meet the Grim Reaper, they get the chance to play an after-life to stop him and prevent two evil robots from destroying what future they should have. Besides playing roles, they have ... perfection, they also play (and revive some extra sales in the process) a few classic games (I even have my original copy of Battleship in the closet). <br /> <br /> The reason I looked this movie better than the original is because it's about "how it can be" instead of "what was." Without spoiling the movie, I can't give you more information about this (I think you should just watch them and decide for yourself! 8 out of 10 stars.
