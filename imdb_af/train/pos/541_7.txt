As a successor, it's not a bad movie. I really liked it better than the first one. I found it more entertaining. It looked like documentary style was shot. For the first time, it bothered me because I thought it was just too low budget. But it grew on me, and it made the movie look more authentic. This movie has more dry one linen than the original, which I think is a good thing. I think sometimes they have gone a little over the top. with some of the screens and the characters. It almost becomes a parody of himself, which may be the point. This movie has at least some tension, which didn't have the 1st. In my view, it has some of the same great music from the original, which is great. The acting was pretty decent, but as I said, it was from the top. I also felt that the movie lost a lot of momentum towards the end and there were a few minutes that looked very slow and didn't seem to flow like the rest of the movie. Although, I thought it was a nice sequel. y rating for "Back to the cabin at the lake" is 7/10 *
