It's one to watch a few times. The excellent writing shows that they had to live this story or know someone who did it because they nailed it. Freebird revived me and laughed at my miserable youth. The title was a good choice. Great movie, setting, story, soundtrack and characters. It's a biker movie, but it will be a pity to do so. Funny to the bone, like Trailer Park Boys in the UK If you've never seen TPB, make a point if you like this movie. You will thank me. I hope to see more of these characters in other movies. Successor? Can be done. There is much more of the world I would like to see through their eyes.
