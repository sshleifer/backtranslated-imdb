It's one of those movies that makes me feel strongly about the fact that I have to make movies. Generally, I'm a fan of movies based on worthy true stories. And this one is GREAT! In addition to Meryl's performance which received much recognition and praise, the film's greatest asset is the story on which it is based. The disturbing story of a couple undergoing social and legal torture after experiencing a tremendous emotional pain at the unexpected and brutal death of their grandchild is really a sight-seeing screen that exposes the inhuman side of fellow human beings and the barbaric of " a very refined and legal society. It is interesting to see how people who regard themselves as friendly and intelligent people (for example, the emotional jury ladies in the film) are in fact nothing more than selfish dupes who, for their dogmatic beliefs and bias, would close their minds to any deliberation and consideration Even in the light of all the facts, they clearly point out their opinions. The other face of the so-called "civilized" society exposing the film is the apathy for the pain of fellow human beings (it is unnecessary to say it is very common, although this particular story unfolds in Australia), it goes as far as " a real cruelty. See if you are willing to make something serious and maybe foolish.
