Every time you think you have a deal on Deathtrap, another plot turn comes along. Best to just sit back and enjoy the ride on this one. Mostly known for his boxing between Michael Caine and Christopher Reeve (unfortunately cut from the television version I saw), this movie recommended much more. <br /> <br /> Sidney Bruhl (Michael Caine) is a very unhappy man. Once a successful playwright, his last several plays on Broadway slept. And while his wife Myra (Dyan Cannon) is nothing but supportive, in both the monetary and emotional sense, it doesn't mean Sidney feels better. To add shock, the young playwright, Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve), just sent Sidney a play to watch. This is Anderson's first, and Sidney can see that the young man is a gifted author. He jokes to his wife that he must invite Anderson, kill him and hand it in as his own. She laughs with him first, but if Sidney actually walks out for dinner, he worries that he can really do his scheme. And her fears can only be justified. <br /> <br /> It's a brilliant writing. There are twists and turns all around the plot, and they get faster and more furious when you get to the end. It's the kind of movie you keep on the edge of your seat from the beginning, and keep you there all the time. An absolute masterpiece of tension and mystery. <br /> <br /> The acting is excellent. Caine gives his usual excellent performance, and he shows a talent for playing cultured, refined and intellectual men. Reeve also gives an excellent version of a man who is not nearly as wide or innocent as he seems. Canon's franticness works well for Myra. And Irene Worth gives a good performance as a nosy neighbor who is also a psychologist. <br /> <br /> This is an endless movie that you will never expect, and repeated views help pick up things that were missed earlier. -visit. An unusual classic that is unfortunately just remembered for a scene that had some sensitivity at the time - and that is a real shame.
