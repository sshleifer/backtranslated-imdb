As others in this forum, when "Fobidden Planet" was presented in 1956, I rushed to see it. This story is an interesting feature I have suggested because young, old, male, female, scientists and people who have such a chance can follow and enjoy the movie's story and plot lines very well. This is the first movie. Leslie Nielsen was somewhat vocal for his role at the time, but Walter Pigeon, Marvin Miller, Anne Francis, Richard Anderson, Earl, had a different planet than Earth in the 20th century. Holliman and especially Warren Stevens donated themselves very well. There is so much visual beauty in this one, it's hard to choose a favorite from the movie's scene. The approach to Altair-4, the starship itself, the landing on the planet's alien surface, the descent via extensor staircase, the first landscape view, the approach of the rocket, dr. Morbius, from the outside and inside, the underground complex and its wonders, setting up the weapon, the battle with the monster, the final approval of the invisible destroyer, the escape of the doomed planet - all these scenes are in the viewer It's spirit etched, because we discover it with the participants. Veteran Cyril Hume's literary screenplay was filmed with intelligence by the long-time director Fred McLeod Wilcox, and it is clear and imaginative. it is a shock to realize there is no music at all; the film is carried by the words, the actors and the mysterious revelation story. It can be viewed again with pleasure - I have done it for almost fifty years. Until this well-known and beloved movie was created, no film attempted to represent a world outside the Earth; and for decades, ships ran back on the planet - as if the authors' imagination failed and caused the accidents. Still, the best, many say. It says something negative about this nation's so-called intellectual leaders' imagination - and something very positive, I suggest that those who made this gem suggest.
