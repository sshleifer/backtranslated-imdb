This movie proves that film noire is a lasting style and remains very dignified to stay. For me, this is the best example of film noire since Chinatown. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it will never get the recognition it deserves. It was never properly promoted when it was first released and built its frameworks of supporters through venues such as Vanguard Cinema and Mouth Rental References. <br /> <br /> I recommend that people looking for something more than senseless entertainment rent this movie and immerse themselves in its highly complex plot.
