You'll think you're in for some serious sights when the movie is portrayed mainly between two characters, as they travel 3000 miles or so from France to Saudi Arabia, most of Europe traveling, Italy, Bulgaria, Croatia, Slovenia, Turkey, before arriving in the Middle East. But it's not a tour, and there are no stops to escape the attractions. <br /> <br /> Reda's dad is in his twilight year and wants to do the Haj. However, as it runs and takes the mule, it is impossible to travel to Mecca by car. He can't drive, so Reda's help to his son's protest is used to get him there in their broken down vehicle. <br /> <br /> But Reda didn't see the point of letting him go, when his father could opt for the plane. He denies the idea that he has escaped his personal life for this pilgrimage he could not understand. And so we acted in this difficult journey with father and son, not the best of the poles. <br /> <br /> The beauty of this movie is to experience the development of the father and son couple, the challenges they face, the strange people they meet, to exchange it in varied weather conditions, and varied rest between motels and sleep in the car. We see a clear gender gap in those who try to communicate with each other, the father trying to lay his son, and the boy tries to claim himself as an adult, but circumstances we see reveal that Reda is quite a fish out of water. . Through the many encounters, they actually haunt good, despite their differences. <br /> <br /> It may be quite difficult to release this movie here last week to coincide with Hari Raya Haji, and have the opportunity to watch our protagonists. Join the other pilgrims in their Haj. The final scene in Mecca is really a sight to behold, and you will also feel the claustrophobia and fear, because Reda is trying to hunt his father among the thousands of people coming together. The tourist attractions of Europe may not be intentionally built to build the expectation and focus on the final destination. <br /> <br /> It definitely had the idea of ​​telling and telling loved ones how much you appreciate them for who they are. Don't miss it, and yes, book early. I was pleasantly surprised that tonight's session was still a full house.
