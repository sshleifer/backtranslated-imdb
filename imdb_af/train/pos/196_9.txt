It was a wonderful introduction to the talents and beauty of Marion Davies. She is not only beautiful but hilarious in this movie. (I believe Lucille Ball could model her later career on Davies's style, which can be called "zany beauty".) Vidor's direction is light but certainly handy, the story is, of course, a chestnut, but the play is wonderfully contemporary And the star-looking element for fans of the silent era, with many cameos, adds to the overall fun. It combines the elements of slapstick with adult drama and good old timeless romance quite well. For all movie fans who have a knee response to watch silent movies, sit through this one and this can change your attitude. <br /> <br />
