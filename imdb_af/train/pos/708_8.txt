An okay film about down syndrome. A mother has twins, one is very sick, the other is good, but he has a disadvantage. The mother doesn't think she can raise him, so she gives him some people who have 15 children, they have! the mother doesn't like it and she thinks he should be with his family (I also agree) so they take it to court and break the family and lose the grandparents, it never really says as the mother and daughter make-up not? I think this movie is good, but the plot is well known, it is still good and has some unintentional laughs!
