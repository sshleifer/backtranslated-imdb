Normally I don't like series at all. They are all predictable and they become very boring and boring. <br /> <br /> However, this series is well played, the story follows through all the episodes and even if you miss one, the story will still be considered. <br /> <br /> The episodes are all filmed in a hospital and take you further and further to the mysteries of dark and old secrets that lie just below the surface of the mighty hospital.
