Hello Dave Burning Paradise is a movie for everyone who loves Jackie Chan and Indiana Jones. The movie's main cartoonist is definitely the bastard son of these two strange fathers. As for the other characters, they are familiar with transformations of similar action movie stereotypes. Where this movie is original, it is blended with the traditional Hong Kong movie style with the Hollywood action adventure. Unfortunately, it's not true of the films he made in Hollywood.
