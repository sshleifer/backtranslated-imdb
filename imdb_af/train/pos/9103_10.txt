In life, we first organize stones (Piedras in Spanish) such as a career, family, friendship and love. In this way we find the space between these smaller stones, our small necessities. If you act in a reverse way, you won't have enough space for bigger stones. The five main players in this movie are women who couldn't organize the big "stones" in their lives. Ramon Salazar, a Spanish film director, defines his first feature Stones in this way. The film tells the parallel, conflicting trajectory of five women: Anita (Monica Cervera, 1975-), Isabel (Angela Molina, 1955-), Adela (Antonia San Juan, 1961-), Leire (Najwa Nimri, 1972-) Maricarmen ( Vicky Pena, 1954 -). Everybody tries to remove the stones that appear in their paths or the worst in their shoes. They are five Cinderella's looking for Prince Charming and a new chance in life. The best story of these five Cinderella's is that of Anita (Monica Cervera) which is also in "20 centimeters," "Busco", "Crimen Ferpecto," "Entre Vivir and Sonar", "Hongos" and "Octavia" stars.
