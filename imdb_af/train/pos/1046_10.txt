Probably my all-time favorite movie, a story of selflessness, sacrifice and dedication to a noble cause, but it is not preaching or sowing. It never gets old, despite having seen 15 or more times over the past 25 years. Paul Lukas's performance brings tears to my eyes, and Bette Davis, in one of her few really sympathetic roles, is a pleasure. The kids are, like grandmother saying, more like "dressed midgets" than kids, but it just makes them more fun to watch. And the mother's slow awakening of what's happening in the world and under her own roof is credible and frightening. If I had a dozen inches, they would all be "up" for this movie.
