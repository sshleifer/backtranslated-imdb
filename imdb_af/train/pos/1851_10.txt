See this movie in August at the 27th Annual National Association of Black Journalists Convention in Milwaukee, WI, this is the first public show. THAT MOVIE IS GREAT !!! Derek Luke is wonderful like Antwone Fisher. This young actor has a very bright future. The right Antwone Fisher did a good job of writing the movie and Denzel's direction is right on the money. See it open weekend. You won't be disappointed.
