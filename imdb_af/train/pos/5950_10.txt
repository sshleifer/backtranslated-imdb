This movie is wonderful. The plot is very true for the book, which is a classic written by Mark Twain. The movie starts with a scene where Hank sings a song with a bunch of kids, called "when you stamp your toes on the moon". It reminds me of Sinatra's song High Hopes, it's fun and inspiring. The music is fantastic and my favorite song is sung by the king, bing crosby and sir "saggy" sagamore. Everywhere a great family movie or even a great date movie. It's a movie you can watch over and over again. The princess Rhonda Fleming played is beautiful. I love this movie !! If you like Danny Kaye of the Jester Court, you'll definitely like this movie.
