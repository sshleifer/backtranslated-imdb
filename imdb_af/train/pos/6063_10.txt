Wizards of the Lost Kingdom is a film about a young prince (Simon) banned from his kingdom because his father (king) was murdered by the clich√© "evil counselor". This movie is about Simon's adventures. The special effects, plot, acting, and overall are all about this movie BAD. However, it's so bad it's funny. You will continue to watch this movie, just because it's so bad, it's funny, and like the other reviewer of the movie said, it's so bad it's good.
