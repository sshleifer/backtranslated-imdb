It is so unfortunate that because of his title, people who hate football are being avoided. Bend it Like Beckham is much more than a cheese-like sports movie. The story line was touched and intelligent without being sweet, the jokes were funny, and the characters were acting well. Parminder Nagra and Keira Knightley are brilliant as teenagers Jess and Jules, who perform well on and off the field. Anupam Kher is wonderful as Jess's worried father, and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, who was so incredibly angry with 'Ride with the Devil', comes as good as the good guy aside, making full use of his beautiful Irish accent! Even if you don't like football, check out this movie. If anything, it will make you smile.
