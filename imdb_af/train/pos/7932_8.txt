Looking at a low budget movie, I know what to expect. I expect the acting won't be that good (budget reasons), I expect the lighting won't be that good (budget reasons). I expect the sound won't be that good (budget again). Stop rating these low budget movies like a big budget movie !!! I'm a movie maker myself, so I understand the budget constraints on a low budget movie. Shows places, shots etc ... the list goes on and on. I don't want to say all the acting was bad. Jose Rosete, Chris Angelo, Victor Zaragoza is good. Raul Martinez is a natural. Not sold on Carl Washington. He must understand that each line is not important, some are throwing lines. I say if a movie shows you what happens next, it's a good movie. I like this movie. I gave it an 8. I wanted to see what would happen next. Great work Quiroz brothers!
