This movie is about two guys making a sport on the spot and trying to get 2 the hot chick. BASE Ball becomes a nationwide sport. Joe Cooper (Trey Parker) is the beloved captain, but is hated when he loses the NBA to another rival. He meets the girl of his dreams Yasmine Bleeth, and in the end they kiss. The first time I saw this movie, I watered my pants. It was so funny. a definite must be for all comedy fans. If you like South Park, you'll love it! Maybe not looking with children, it's a little inappropriate for small dudes. some duds give it 6 1/2 out of ten, I give it 11 out of ten. I like a copy he rocks, I need to thank you for reading this
