I went through a list of Oscar winners and was surprised to see this movie Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid beat the best picture in 1969. However, after I see it, I'm no longer surprised. It was far from his time in terms of style, cinematography and flashback to help Joe Buck's character develop. <br /> <br /> The most wonderful thing for me is the depth of Joe Buck's character in such a short film. I think Voight caught the naivete and the malice. The two scenes that really caught me were after he got the blowjob in the theater and when the older man requested him. I think when he looks in the mirror, he tries to see if it really is he who did - or something he has to do - something terrible. <br /> <br /> I think it was a brilliant decision by Hoffman to take this role. Otherwise, he may be selected for the Postgraduate program. Anyway, it's considered an all-time great for a reason.
