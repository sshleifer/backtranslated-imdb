Blade Runner (Deckard is a Replicant!), <br /> <br /> City of Lost Children (enlarged senses or whatever is used and abused, and mostly, but only we give us less than we can dream) and </ br> <br /> <br /> It's really been a while. <br /> <br /> For a while I have been waiting for an animated movie that can affect me as much as Miyazaki's stuff. This one is the 1st. <br /> <br /> Hmm, scratch its "animated" part. <br /> <br /> I have an intense love-hate relationship with film noir and, hey, if you don't leave, it should mostly be love, right? But there are so many sci-fi and noir themes completely under the film in this movie. It's just a wonder to watch. <br /> <br /> These people have done an incredible job!
