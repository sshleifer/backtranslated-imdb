Going with Cavemen, presented by Alec Baldwin, is a glimpse of all the hominids (that's us!) Species of the past 5 million years: who they were, how they were and how they became extinct. Along with a very interesting scientific look at the information we have on these species, Walking with Cavemen also explores what makes us. I waited a few weeks to see it, and I was not disappointed.
