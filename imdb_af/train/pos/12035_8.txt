I recently stumbled across this movie at TNT for five minutes while on vacation in Florida ... (hey, there must be a little quiet in the hotel, right?) I was initially surprised to see Melissa Joan Hart in any feature length to watch movie on TNT. I mean, "Drive Me Crazy" isn't it old, is it? <br /> <br /> But I got stuck with it and was thoroughly surprised and entertained. Melissa plays her role as the psychic Jennifer excellent. Supporting role players (Nick, former boyfriend, Karen, her best friend, and her life-controlling parents) all added a great deal of credibility. The turn at the end was a nice ending to this story of the girl who was always one step ahead of everyone. <br /> <br /> If you get a chance, check it out! <br /> <br />
