Documentaries of this nature are often many opinions. This movie seems to take out all opinions and make the viewer decide what to do with the information provided. It's sad the conditions that poor people have to work on, this film does a great job of showing the ugly side of sweat shops. The movie Mardi Gras: Made in China was a great way to show the world how something as small as beads for a celebration can affect the lives of so many people in another country. <br /> <br /> I had to watch this movie for an English class where we spent time on sweat shops and how some people tried to eliminate them and this movie helped to get the topic rolling. It was a wonderful, very informative movie and I would recommend that someone see it, it opens your eyes.
