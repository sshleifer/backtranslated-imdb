The movie was good, and I thought it was a good performance from Christopher Lloyd, of whom I liked previous movies. The movie was a great family movie, nothing to worry about showing it to younger children, a good story line, lots of laughs, happy and fun. If you want to entertain children without boring on tears, apply it to the account. Child is pleasant, and not difficult for a parent to watch.
