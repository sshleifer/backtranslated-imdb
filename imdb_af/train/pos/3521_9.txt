Other reviewers have summarized this film noir well. I just wanted to go to the "Whew!" Add. Comment on a reviewer made on Elisha Cook's natural coke-fueled episode. It was a doozy, I have to say. Cook deserves praise for his surprising performance. <br /> <br /> A little trivia I think about: Cook appeared as a waiter in the Barbara Stanwyck movie of 1941, "Ball of Fire". He was a waiter in the nightclub where Barbara sang and legendary drummer Gene Krupa was dreamy, most energetic. Is it too much to suggest that Cook's spazzy drumming in later film, Phantom Lady, was inspired by Krupa's work, as Cook testified 3 years earlier? <br /> <br /> If you look at Krupa in Ball of Fire, I think you'll notice some similar body movements. Of course one hopes that HE was not influenced by drugs at that time!
