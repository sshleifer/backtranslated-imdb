Why aren't more movies (especially American) more like Meatball Machine? <br /> <br /> This is my first official online review and I have been charged with "electric ecstasy" after choosing "Meatball Machine" as my first attempt. It's a review, so I'll try to stick to mere reflection and emotion. <br /> <br /> I mean, it's a creative work, though clearly inspired by the now classic TETSUO! So if it's not all original? I own both of these films and although Tetsuo is a strange boy of a bitch, Meatball Machine is much better and can be confused without the strong desire to adjust a dose of thought to clarify drugs. Meatball Machine is so expanded in its story as it is in its high influx of blood and gore. Thanks for Jesus for the Japanese Cinema! <br /> <br /> Simply put, the last time my dreams were flooded with horror visions, I was watching Nightmare on Elm Street when I was 7. For weeks, I can come across a tongue in a dream from a telephone. This time (at 31) my dreams were pleasantly awesome. <br /> <br /> In this film, human bodies are host to Aliens whose only purpose is to try to reach their eternal quench for human flesh and blood. People become flesh that eats cyborgs! There's more !!! Fight scenes !! Great music !! Great point-of-view shots! Good behavior by woman Cyborg (at least better than her male counterpart). The battle that is finally seen is worth watching ten or twenty times. <br /> <br /> Oh, and I forgot to mention this is a love story! Wow, I hate love stories, but it takes the cake! <br /> <br /> I can't wait to have friends to see this movie again just to see the reaction to their faces. Unfortunately, I took the time to write this review because I'm afraid most friends and family will get used to Meatball Machine. The truth is America as a whole is not prepared for the Meatball machine. <br /> <br /> Finally, my wife walked while I was finishing the climate battle scene and she was speechless. Usually she says something like "why do you look that junk?" This time she had nothing to say. I was happy! <br /> <br /> It's not mess. It's not just SPLATTER (splatter for the sake of splattering is also big). This is Art my friends. Art. <br /> <br /> CHACHO
