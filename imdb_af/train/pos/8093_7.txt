My friend had the idea to watch the animated LOTR after the Peter Jackson Return or The King. So I finally bought it from e-bay, and from the beginning I thought it was going to suck. Actually, it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. The animation was good for their time, they used a unique method to mix live animation action to create some interesting effects, and the man who did the voice for Frodo sounded a bit like Elijah Wood. <br /> <br /> Not the biggest adaptation of a book, but trust me, I've seen much worse. It kicks a lot of things, as both Fellowship and The Two Towers are compressed in one two-hour movie. Definatley is worth watching, kids like, but still, absoutley, no comparison with the Peter Jackson trilogy.
