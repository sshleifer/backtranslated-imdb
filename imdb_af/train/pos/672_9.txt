This movie has a steady, ghostly fit, with a great drama (one of Chamberlain's best performances) and a story we are exposed over time. Back to that, the music fully sets the mood and helps maintain an awkward, cautious and gloomy tone. <br /> <br /> Weir's story is enhanced by the use of aborigines, their stories and their tensions with the dominant white population to deliver a fantasy story that is ominous. <br /> <br /> Although not related to story as well as genre, it maintained the same feeling in me as Ursula Le Guin's "Sky Lathe" (1980). <br /> <br /> "The Last Wave" is a dramatic thriller with a few shocking moments. Remember, hacking and slicing doesn't make a movie a horror movie, it's the psychological element of fear and tension that rests in us all.
