California is a film about lost ideals. A journey on the darkest road ever. The road of no return. The plot is about a few that have set out to find a better life in California. The man (David Duchovny in his best role so far) wants to write a book about the well-known crimes that have happened in America and his girlfriend, a photographer, is going to take the photos. So they came out on a trail of famous murders without knowing what they were waiting for. To share the travel expenses, they decide to find another couple and they place an ad. But the couple who answer it are not just a few. It's one of the strangest couples ever. The girl is a naive, weak creature who dreams and likes cacti. The man is exactly the opposite. A cruel relentless killer. We learn it early in the film and we follow him on the journey to California (not with C as usual, but with K, who supposedly symbolizes the word-killer), alongside his betrayal, murder and eventually defeat. All the leads, Duchovny, Pitt, Lewis and Forbes really give good performances and you have to keep in mind that when this movie is recorded, not even one of them was a star. Photography is wonderful, with darkness covering most of the movie, and the music fits the dark character of the movie. In general, this is a very good movie. Don't miss it. You'll think again before you take a stranger in your car to share the gas!
