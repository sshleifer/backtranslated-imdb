When I was a child, it was Lex Barker's time as Tarzan. I often heard from older people that Johnny Weissmuller was "Tarzan" and I wouldn't understand why since I saw some Weismuller's last movies in the character and I thought he was no longer in shape. It wasn't after many years that I got "Tarzan and his partner", and then I understood it. Weasel lover is in the form of this photo and has the presence and rough eyes that the character claims do not match with other Tarzans such as Barker, Gordon Scott, Jock Mahoney, Denny Miller, Miles O'Keefe and Cristopher Lambert. <br /> <br /> As far as this film is concerned, I was also amazed at the sensual presence of beautiful Maureen O'Sullivan, a strong, self-confident, active and "non-inhibiting" woman as Jane before the movie made. (Tarzan pushes her into a dam that is naked while she is amused; one of the explorers kisses her and although she doesn't kiss him, she lets him do a little bit and does nothing about it; such behavior was unthinkable with the Janes to come like Brenda Joyce, Vanessa Brown, Virginia Huston or Dorothy Hart, and all play kind of perfect, sweet vulnerable women, making it hard to believe they can survive in a hostile place like the African jungle . <br /> <br /> O'Sullivan's character's sparkling personality steals the show from Tarzan himself, except of course when it comes to action and Weismuller takes the lead easily; The combination is perfect. Another highlight of the movie is Cheeta's secondary role and not the lead role, as in later Tarzan pictures where she often saves the day. <br /> <br /> "Tarzan and His Mate" is a good product in his genre ( Tarzan movies) and maybe as the best, although I have to admit that I too "Tarz An's Greatest Adventure "(1959) enjoys a higher budget and a strong supportive role (and in spite of the only acceptable Gordon Scott starring his perfect" all gym "physical appearance that is not suitable for a rustic monkey man). <br /> <br /> Good for Jane and her partner!
