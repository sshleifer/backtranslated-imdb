And a while from South Park comes to an end. It wasn't as strong an episode as I had hoped, but Night of the Living Homeless was a stronger coach than Stanley's Cup, Tsst, Bloody Mary or Erection Day. It still can't hold a candle for Woodland Critter Christmas and Goobacks, but few episodes can. <br /> <br /> Night of the Living Roofs is a spoof of the zombie genre, done in a way that only South Park would think of. Instead of eating meat, the entities are homeless that the request changes and seems to survive. <br /> <br /> Randy and other residents are locked in the Community Center, although this time on the roof, where they can investigate the scene. A special funny moment is when one member finds out that his home is gone and homeless. Randy has no choice but to shoot him. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the four boys have solved the problem with the whole story behind the homeless takeover trying to convey a message, but being seriously uninspired. South Park is at its best many of the times when it is ridiculous. Matt and Trey played safely this week and did not criticize the homeless but solved the lights. <br /> <br /> The shock moment of the episode comes when a scientist himself tries to avoid the homeless. This is the first time a suicide on the South Park goes wrong, and we watch the poor man miss his brain and try to shoot himself many times while dying. Another inspired South Park moment. <br /> <br /> Overall, the episode was funny, but it's of great importance by keeping any real comments on the homeless and keeping the zombie shtick right. The end is somewhat funny, but nothing new. <br /> <br /> Now we have to wait until October for the next series of episodes. It's a long haul, but South Park must be applauded for running. The show ran out of steam last season, but now it's in full shape again.
