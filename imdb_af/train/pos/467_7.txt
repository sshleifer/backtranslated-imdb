This movie is one of the few quality films of 2000 and definitely one of my best. The scenario is based on the novel by Vladimir Nabokov and the transfer to the big screen is absolutely brilliant. <br /> <br /> Photography of the movie is excellent, such as the play of both Turturro and Watson. Turturro definitely delivers its best performance to date and proves that it is much more valuable than we thought. Watson also plays brilliantly. <br /> <br /> The story is about a phenomenal chess player (Turturro), who is also extremely eccentric in his everyday life. The film is presented in a non-linear time, with several flashbacks of Luzhin's childhood. This describes Luzhin's complex character. <br /> <br /> I have nothing more to say, but to introduce this movie to someone.
