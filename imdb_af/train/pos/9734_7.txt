Well, here comes another, well, romantic comedy ... but unlike all other movies of this genre, it's by far the best I've seen. <br /> <br /> I would admit that I first wanted to watch this movie because of Megan Fox, and a little bit because of Simon Pegg. <br /> <br /> First of all, if you watched a decent amount of movies, you will know that Sidney and Alison will somehow be at and off the movie ... but from the beginning the end of the movie you will not know how ... <br /> <br /> Well, now this movie is just made for Simon Pegg. I can't see any other actor in Sidney's role, and I'm sure it'll be a much worse movie if it's not for Pegg's big show. <br /> <br /> There are a number of great gags and jokes in this movie that make me laugh very much, thanks to Simon Pegg's character Sidney ... but I think everyone in this movie is good. For example, Kirsten Dunst is really strong in this movie (usually don't think of her as more than an average act but she was really good at this one), then there is Jeff Bridges, there is Gillian Anderson, and of course Megan Fox who Tired Bitchy Star Sophie Maes Play ... Big Role For Her ... <br /> <br /> All in all, I disagree with ratings on IMDb, but this time I will totally agree with them. <br /> <br /> Look at this movie, it's really light and positive, and I highly recommend it ... My rating 7 out of 10 ... but 7.5 actually ...
