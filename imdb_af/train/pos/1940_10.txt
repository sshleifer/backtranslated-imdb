I was really impressed with this movie. The writing was fantastic, and the characters were all rich and simple. It is very easy to connect emotionally to everyone. The creators of this movie really hit the nail when it comes to creating real characters and sucking the viewer right in their world. Furthermore, the music is great. They employed some independents to do the score, and some of the soundtrack, and they do a fantastic job adding to the movie. If you have a chance to catch this movie in a small theater or at a movie festival (as I did), I strongly recommend you see it. Also, on a personal note, Paget Brewster is beautiful in this movie. That's enough reason to look at it.
