Telemundo should definitely consider making a DVD collection of the novel Xica! I know tons of people, including myself, who want to buy the novel Xica! It is a very entertaining novela set in Brazil. The costumes worn by the actors are beautiful and the town where the novela takes place is beautiful. Xica contains a lot of history from that period. I wish Telemundo would do it again, even though it was 2 o'clock in the morning. If you ever see Telemundo again, I would be advised to watch Xica. I emailed Telemundo a million times to show the novela again, but my pleas fell on deaf ears. The only warning statement about Xica is that it sometimes has difficult scenes, so I recommend that children under 14 do not watch Xica. Overall Xica earns 10 out of 10!
