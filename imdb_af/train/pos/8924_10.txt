This movie is great. What separates the other 50's sci-fi is the fact that the stranger has no features, no face, eyes anything, but it can't be murdered. I especially like the idea that this movie doesn't take place in a few days, it happens in one night, which is supposed to stay past midnight. It's also scary that when the blob comes over you, you can't get it. you are stuck in it as it dissolves your flesh and slowly digests your body. My all time favorite 50's sci-fi movie, and what is sometimes considered the real one. I can see why it looked Steve McQueen at the stars. All this and a catchy theme song! How can you go wrong?
