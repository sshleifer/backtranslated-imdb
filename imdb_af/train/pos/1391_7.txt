As it was made on a low budget, the DAY TIME ENDED most of its budget with some surprisingly good special effects. <br /> <br /> The story involves a family that will soon be moving in their sun-inhabited home in an isolated part of the Mojave Desert in southwestern California, just to find it when it gets started - by motorcycle vandals, they think. But their youngest daughter (Natasha Ryan) began to see mysterious things - a green pyramid, strange humanoid figures, etc. And just recently, the light of a star-star blast resulted in extremely unusual aurora in the desert schemes. So, the family, led by Jim Davis and Dorothy Malone, find themselves face-to-face with strange alien powers placed in a time-and-space warp. <br /> <br /> Mix in elements of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY AND THIRD CHILD CLOSING, THE DAY TIME ENDED, despite the obvious flaws and uneven acting, remains interesting due to the beautiful special effects work of David Allen. The desert setting is very suitable for the movie's close encounters; And while the movie can't really be compared to Kubrick's or Spielberg's films, THE DAY TIME ENDED much better than many other 2001 / CLOSE ENCOUNTERS knock-offs. I give credit to director John 'Bud' Cardos, whose 1977 thriller KINGDOM OF THE SPIDERS made for an interesting precursor to ARACHNOPHOBIA, at least to try - and on that basis I END THE DAY TIME END a 7 10.
