I just picked up the DVD edition of this movie while on vacation in Norway where it was released with English subtitles. <br /> <br /> The film was beautifully photographed and performed vigorously. The young man depicting Frits's main character has an astonishingly open face that reflects the tragic events unfolding around him with painful accuracy. <br /> <br /> Early in the film we see that the father who loves Frits has mental health problems and it is raised when the brutal principal denies having assaulted the boy and suggests it was his own father. <br /> <br /> The climate scene where Frits refuses to show respect to the principal; just to stand his ground and repeat 'Liar' while being brutally assaulted before his classmates is a scene you probably won't forget. <br /> <br /> The movies are but a weak point, the rather split 'Flower Power' teacher who uses every 'friendly teacher' trick in the book. Other than that, I'm sure it's a movie you'll really enjoy.
