More Crazy is compared to the Spinal Tap as both are comedies on the scrubbing R&R groups. Actually, the similarities end here because Still Crazy is much better written and performed, while the Spinal Tap script deteriorates from the scarce amusing first 10 minutes to a drift that makes Beavis and Butthead look similar. Still crazy is formal, but the equivalence of the characters and the unexpectedly high quality of some music numbers for me set off the predictability of the movie. People who expect the Spinal Tap-like attempt at satire will be disappointed by the light nature of the movie, but I want a successful self-ironic skirt of Still Crazy over a pompous, but failed shot at satire who is Spinal Tap , take.
