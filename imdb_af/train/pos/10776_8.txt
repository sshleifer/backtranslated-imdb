"Radiofreccia" is still a good surprise in Italian theater. The film is based on a book by Italian songwriter Luciano Ligabue, who also writes the film directly and writes the music score. Of course, the film is a portrait of the Northern Italian province living, in Emilia Romagna region. We were in 1975, the time of the first free radios. One of the movie's sons creates "Radioraptus". Youth wishes, friendship, love, sex, individual dramas and unemployment are among the themes, but the film also talks about drugs. Freccia, the main character, is a victim of heroin slavery. <br /> <br /> Without being boring and moralistic, the story flows very well; the spontaneity of actors is strong and directing. Obviously, Luciano "League" League Cups are not Fellini or a movie profession. First, he is a musician. But he manages to make a good product. Unfortunately, he will not repeat the success with his second movie "Da zero a dieci". Not good. <br /> <br /> In the Radiofreccia actors, not all is well known, the only star is Stefano Accorsi - one of the most popular young Italian actors. In a small role, see another Italian songwriter -Francesco Guccini, he is the nice communist bartender and soccer coach!
