Thank you to the Hong Kong VCD / DVD distributors, that I only paid US $ 1.4 and I could have such a surprising delight. <br /> <br /> Adultery? How common in our modern day. Eva grabbed her two children and kidnapped Nick to drive to Luis and Charlotte to Italy. She wants to do her revenge, but in the end she also commits the same crime of Luis: she has sex with Nick. <br /> <br /> In this small indie production, Vivian Naefe treated the dental problems of modern marriage with a light heart. How can one treat the marriage seriously in this fast food, where people now have more mobility in physical, spiritual and technological areas? Joint commitment demands too high a price that most people will choose to submit to circumstances. Nick trusted Charlotte once, but he caught Eva after he abducted the trip, which forced him to experience a lot of growth. <br /> <br /> Most viewers may feel happy about the end because Eve and Nick get together. greatest recompense to the wife's unfaithful act. However, I want a sequel, I want to see how the four will develop after this exchange. Maybe they can swap back, how can one be so sure of the shaky love affair. <br /> <br /> Good acting and good scenery. The two little child actors should not be neglected especially as the boy cries when he receives the hotel in Venice. And of course, how can we forget the "bella, bella" landscape of the city.
