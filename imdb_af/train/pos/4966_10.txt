Diego Armando Maradona was sixteen years old in 1978 when Argentina won the World Cup. He was already the biggest star and the biggest player in a country obsessed with football. Everybody begged Cesar Luis Menotti to play the boy's genius, but the driver thought he wasn't ready yet. <br /> <br /> History records that Argentina won the 1978 World Cup fairly convincingly - they didn't really need it. Maradona. The same was not true in 1982. Spain was a catalog of disaster for Argentina. Menotti - still chain smoking - played Diego this time, but the opportunity was too much for such a temperamental boy. Maradona signed for Barcelona on June 4, 1982 for about $ 7 million. Nine days later he played his first match at the Camp Now and Belgium won Argentina ninety-one. It was not a favorable debut, and although he played twice against Hungary in the next match, Maradona will remember the oral as the place of his nadir - a rough, petulant dirty on Brazil's Batista in the second round. his tournament suddenly ended and Argentina's government as world champions. <br /> <br /> But now it was all behind him. Maradona ruined his way through Barca and left in 1984 to join Napoli. It was as if he was finally home. The Neapolitan tifosi did everything to give Maradona to poverty, oppressive Napoli. Gifts from old women and pocket money from young boys were uncomfortable with the Camorra's millions as part of the transfer fee, and the city was determined to make it feel at home. Maradona was El Rey at that time - he brought his Argentine team to Mexico as one of the favorites, and with a new manager - Carlos Bilardo replaces Menotti. <br /> <br /> Maradona is the hero of this story, a one-man World Cup winning machine. In 1982, hundreds of young men died in a senseless battle for the Falkland Islands; now the British press needs a repeat (with the same result) in Mexico City. Maradona is still regarded with distinction in England, remembering an excellent performance in Britain during a 1980 tour than for Spain. But he was still an Argie: the enemy. <br /> <br /> In fact, England started well, and Lineker could have achieved just after twelve minutes. An important event took place in 8 minutes. Fenwick, the big and limited English defender, has been recorded - he was frightening to face any challenge around the area. <br /> <br /> After a tense first 45 minutes, the second half started with a bang. Maradona danced forward after 50 minutes, but could not get through. Likewise, Valdano's attempt only hit white shirts. Then the moment of infamy serves as Diego's grave. Hodge suddenly returned the ball into his own penalty area, Shilton suddenly jumped to claim - but there was Maradona, somehow above the English goalkeeper, pushing the ball into the net. How did he do that? Simple: handball. <br /> <br /> The most famous mistake in soccer history has passed in almost slow motion. Every spectator waited for Mr. Al-Sharif from Syria to blow up the dirt (he didn't). Shilton looked at the linesman and he returned to the center circle. Unless he kills the Pope, or the first man to walk on Mars, when the big man dies, this moment is only shown - in long, long, slowness, followed by the appearance of pleasure on his face. The next image will be his next gift to the world - the World Cup's best goal. <br /> <br /> Burruchaga threw the ball to Maradona, moving on the right side of his own half. He teamed up and accelerated from Beardsley and Reid. It was the real Diego - he broke through Butcher and attacked Fenwick. Fenwick now had the opportunity to stop the attack. Normally he would have directed his boot somewhere near Maradona's thigh - sure he would have picked up a red card, but who cares? Then Fenwick had a brainwave - he hesitated and decided to run at Maradona waving his arms. Maybe he was trying to put him off? Diego shot in the box when Fenwick attacked. Butcher ran along the genius as if he was offering encouragement. Shilton was caught in panic and Maradona turned around and willing to score. Now Butcher remembered his role and tried to tire the Argentine man. Instead, he gave an extra boost to the shot, which collided with the goal. England was home. <br /> <br /> During this magical Mexican summer, the world found a successor to Pele. In fact, the biggest ever footballer was outdone. Pele was excellent in 1958 and 1970, but had big players around him. Maradona didn't. 1986 was his World Cup.
