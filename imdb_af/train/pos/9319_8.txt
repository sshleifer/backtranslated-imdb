........ Kaddiddlehopper, Col San Fernando, etc. The man was quite wide and screaming. I like to let him see how he communicates with each other. Amanda Blake, or Don Knotts or whoever - he clearly had a ball, and I think he also made it easier for his guests - as long as they were awake beforehand, it was not a disciplined, 19 kind of production . Relaxing and releasing was clearly the name of the game there. <br /> <br /> He reminds me of guys like Milton Berle, Benny Hill, maybe Jerry Lewis. Great timing, antique gags that kept total audiences in stitches, pure pleasure about what he did. His sad little one he played was also good, but in touch. <br /> <br /> Personally, I think he is wonderful. He just bought a DVD series of his '61 shows, which brings his stuff back to me in a good way. I can remember seeing him on the TV at the end of his career as he alternated the series in 1971. <br /> <br /> See if you're a fan or curious. He was a riot.
