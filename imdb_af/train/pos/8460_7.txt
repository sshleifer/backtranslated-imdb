Gundam Wing is a fun show. I appreciate it in Gundam and anime in general. But after watching his predecessors, like Mobile Suit Gundam, Zeta Gundam, and even G Gundam, I find Wing to be Gundam Lite. Characters: An aspect that has long been held by Gundam is to have characters. pressed into problems and growing into adulthood. It doesn't happen in Wing. Heero is top dog at the beginning and he is the best dog at the end. Personalities do not change, growth is never achieved. The best character is Zechs, who is for all purposes a hero in most of the series. But suddenly the series betrayed him and didn't make him a villain for a clear reason. <br /> <br /> Mecha: Wing has good pack designs. The Gundams are super cool, with the Epyon my favorite. I even see some of the OZ pack designs that are similar to some of the classic Zeon packs. But sweet pack designs do not save the series from boring characters. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: In the end, Wing has cool battle scores, though dug with reclaimed animation, but shallow grave and character development. Enjoyable, but not like previous Gundam outings.
