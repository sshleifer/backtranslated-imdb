Maybe I'm too generous with the rating ... but I just love this movie! I've seen it so many times, but every time I see it, I fall in love with it again. It's just a simple romantic comedy, with nothing great or monumental happening. But I'm a great romantic and this movie is * romantic. I love Meg Ryan and Tim Robbins, and Walter Mathau is so funny. The scientists make me laugh so much ... I recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it. It's such a clean, good movie - and it's so rare now! My 20-year-old brother also likes this movie, so it's not just a chick. ;-) I recommend it if you have to laugh, or if you are just lonely and need to * watch a romance if you can't participate in one yourself. It's a good one!
