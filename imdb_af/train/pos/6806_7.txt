Ernst Marischka, one of the most respected Austrian directors of that time, made films with beautiful scenes, delicate love and all that is precious in life. <br /> <br /> Nowadays, if people have to hear from him, they associate the name Marischka with Sissi trilogy (1955.1956.1957). However, he also made other great films such as DAS DREIMADERLHAUS (1958), EMBEZZLED HEAVEN (1958) and definitely this one, MADCHENJAHRE EINER KONIGIN, showing the young years of Queen Victoria. Though it is a slightly different theme to SISSI movies, I don't see much difference between this movie and SISSI. They are strikingly the same. <br /> <br /> The movie is almost identical. The style, the music, the photography. In fact, the crew is almost the same. Anton Prophes, Bruno Mondi! <br /> <br /> The cast ... Romy Schneider is one of the first lead roles. It was a wonderful introduction to her role as Sissi, as this film was made one year before the first part of the trilogy on the Austrian empire. It is also a movie where Romy plays with her mother, Magda Schneider. But Ernst Marischka was not the first director to play Romy to play with her mother. Romy's debut, WENN DER WEISSE FLIEDER WIEDER BLUHN (1953) was also her performance at her mother. Therefore, there were voices that Romy began her Austrian career on the grounds of her mother's fame. Indeed, there is some truth in it. <br /> <br /> Again, as in Sissi, these movie shows are very soft. Victoria meets Prince Albert in a Dover room. Their sympathy is based on pure elevation in dance and soft smile. And now ...? How would this be shown? Only sex ... But is this the only thing love based on? <br /> <br /> I am grateful to Ernst Marischka for these movies. They had a soul and a message. Some people can call them kitschy, but I will never stop admiring these movies. They are IMPRESSIVE !!! Indifferent, highly endorsed!
