Harman and Isings 'Old Mill Pond' is a true masterpiece of the art of animation. The complete skill and artwork that characterizes this duos work is nowhere in evidence as in this cartoon. It is a pity that so many people can only see offense in what is always meant to be a light entertainment that in no way denies black people. As something, it is a tribute to the infectious humor and musicality of the black race. I have not been able to see this garment for many years, as the 'racial commissioners' in England have considered it too offensive to be shown in multi-racial Britain. If anyone knows where to get a copy, I'd love to see this masterpiece again. I think those who regularly look for messages and intentions never intended in these cartoons are after 60 years of age, and remember that the world is a very different place today, but that does not mean anyone has the right to censor that is visible from the past.
