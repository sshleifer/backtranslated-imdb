Not a bad word to really say about this movie. I was not even impressed, but it grew rapidly on me. I like it a lot and I think it's a shame that many people can't see beyond the fact that it has been banned in some areas because it is my one. The film delivers in the shock, gore and atmosphere section. The score is a beautiful piece of voltage-delivery device. It just seems fair that Chris Young has become one of the best composers in the business. The play in this film is of a somewhat high standard, as a little wood in some spots, and the effects are very real and eager. All this is great praise for a good slasher movie in my book. I noticed in some reviews that the movie became serious with the famous killer's P.O.V shot. And I ask: What's wrong with that? It's a classic shot that fears in a good fan of the genre, and it's great to keep the killer's identity a secret. The only thing that prevents this movie from getting top marks in my book is that the surprise cheek (killer revealed) is not handled with more care. I think this happens just as quickly, although the big performances just make it credible. In addition, PRANKS is a good movie (although I prefer the original title) and it is a pity that so many people switch it off as just a cheap piece of crap. It's more than that, but few know it seems to have been lost in the early 80's. What a shame .... It's a very good movie people! Believe me!
