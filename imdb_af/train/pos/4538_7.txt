I didn't even want to see this movie after reading Maltin's review and 1 1/2 star rating. Anyway, I looked at my son's advice and found it much better than I expected. I will give it 2 1/2 stars from a 4-star system. You have to watch the movie more than once to understand it all. If you don't know much about religion, you will miss out. I graduated from high school the year in which the film was made, so maybe I can link it better to it. Yes, there is a little pretense in the movie and it is weird to some extent, but it was the 70's so what do you expect. I can see why people may not like the movie; However, I don't understand people who say it's boring. The movie is nothing but sowing. You will hate or love it. If you find it boring, you're probably brain dead.
