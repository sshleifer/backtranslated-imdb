What surprised me most about this movie was the sheer audience that attracted it. Similar movies like Anita and Me have never caused as much hype as this movie has, although I think it's probably due to Beckham's title in the title more than anything else. <br /> <br /> This is a brilliant movie about a brilliant message - you can do anything if you have enough and think about it, which is such a positive message for anyone watching this movie . <br /> <br /> I think it's one of Keira Knightley's better movies, and I think she's a brilliant actress, and was great for the role. Parminder Nagra was also brilliant. Unfortunately I can't tell Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, because I don't think he was so good at a good actor, and to be honest, his eyes were terrifying. <br /> <br /> All in all, a brilliant movie, and a brilliant story
