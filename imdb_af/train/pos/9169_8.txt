I loved Timothy Dalton very much, even though he was a little young and handsome for Mr. R. But I thought Zelah Clarke was too plump and short. However, this version was very true to the novel and very well filmed. I saw 4 versions, Orson Welles is still my favorite Mr. R, although George C Scott did very well and it is a throw between Joan Fontaine and Sussanah York, although they were both a bit too old for the role. I recently saw a brilliant TV version of Rebecca with Charles Dance and Emilia Fox. I'd love to see the two Jane Eyre. When I watched the Ciarin Hinds version, I think I was Jane Eyred, but I'll never get tired of the first few minutes Joan Fontaine's voice tells, opening the first version I've ever seen. I always want to go back and read the book again.
