I feel myself this movie is a rare treasure. Not only is it the beginning of the Shirley Temple's career, but scarcely looks at how our society has changed. You must understand that certain things we consider to be sexual today will be considered innocent. For example, the parents of the children in the movie as well as the many parents who took their children to see this movie, saw it as just children who imitate adults. Most people did not think of anyone who is sexually appealing to children, except teenage girls engulfing teenage girls. For them it was not sexual. Remember, it was before we had internet, TV, etc. Most sex crimes were not openly educated. Sometimes there is a whisper about the child with the "funny uncle." But it was often all that came from it. Yes, very sad. But it is rather sad today, because even I can see this movie as something else than it was meant to be, innocent and funny. When I see Shirley so dancing and the boys' eyes emit her, yes, I feel annoyed. I must remind myself of the time it took! Those kids didn't know what sex was. The parents knew that both of the kids in the movie and those who saw it. The thought may not even have entered their minds. In the eyes of the average adult, it was no longer sexually played by Shirley's house. Even today, children will enter beauty competitions, dressed for a three-year-old. However, the child is just pretending. I don't blame the child because I want to act like an adult. Or the old movies that show it. First, our media has made many things look and feel sick and wrong. It can sometimes be the best. But I believe this movie is not one of them. It gives a scarce look at an innocent mentality, which we have long lost.
