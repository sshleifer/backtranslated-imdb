**** SPOILERS **** The movie "Sniper" is undoubtedly based on the exploitation of the legendary American Marine sniper Carlos "Gunny" Hathcock. The trivial mister Rogers draw, which confirmed a score of as many as 300, killed confirmed and unconfirmed Vietcong and North Vietnamese army during his two tours in Nam. What shows just how deadly and effectively a trained military sniper really is. is. <br /> <br /> Tom Berenger is cool and deadly like Sgt. be a citizen. useless. Since there is nothing left for him to do with his skills he has learned in the US Marines, unless he decides to become a mob hit. Backett accepts his fate as a lifetime professional killer for his country. <br /> <br /> The story of the movie "Sniper" is focused on Sgt.Beckett with the help of formerly sharp shooting silver medal and American government agent Richard Miller, Billy Zane, is being sent deep into the Panamanian jungle. The two snipers will take out rebel general Miguel Alveraze, Frederick Miraglittoa, and Colombian drug queen Raul Ochoa, Carlos Alveraze, who support him in a planned military takeover of the country. <br /> <br /> We see earlier in the movie Sgt. Beckett expanded and took a rebel leader who I felt was the best scene in "Sniper". Because it shows step by step how Sgt. Beckett with the help of his spotter Cpt. Papich, Aden Young, she does work. There is also a sub-plot later broken down by a rebel shooter DeSilva, Eward Wiley, who bumped Beckett and later killed Papich because they were both waiting to be lifted by a military helicopter from the jungle. You would have thought a deadly cat and mouse would be played between the two who would culminate when the movie ended, but Sgt. Beckett didn't even bother to send DeSilva into the movie early because he used an unsuspecting Miller as a bait. <br /> <br /> What hurt the movie was, most ironically, the last fifteen or so minutes when the story of one shoot one death snap movie after a Rambo-like ending with Sgt. Beckett and Agent Miller fight from a whole battalion rebels with dots flying as thick as a London miss. <br /> <br /> "Sniper" is still worth watching for the fact that it tells the story of a person who until now is not really glorified in glory films: A killing solitaire killer with the accuracy and skill of a master diamond cutter or completed neurosurgeon and doing it in total secrecy.
