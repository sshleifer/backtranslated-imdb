I was not a fan to see this movie, but when my gf called me and said she had a free advanced screening, I just typed to see eva longoria and laugh at jason biggs antics. <br /> <br /> Overall it was better than I expected, but not much. It was like a hybrid of how to lose a man within 10 days and just like heaven. A typical romantic comedy with his moments I think. The movie was rather short (about 85 min), but it was enough to tell the whole story, build character development and have a decent happy ending. The whole idea of ​​a ghost haunting his former husband was an interesting plot to follow. eva properly kept the sarcasm and paul rudd and the rest of the supporting role (especially jason biggs). The overall laugh laughed at me. <br /> <br /> Overall, I just got the movie because it had a good amount of laughter to keep me different, I would have given this movie a lower rating. hey it is a chick flame and i see this movie of a guy's persepctive in order, it would be fairer if women reviewed this movie and gave it some thought.
