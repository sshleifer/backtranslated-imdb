I really like this movie. I can watch it regularly and don't get tired of it. I think this is one of my criteria for a good movie. <br /> <br /> The story is very interesting. It introduces us to 6 characters; each has a unique kung fu style that is very secret and very deadly. Each of these characters is trained by the same master, but their identities are kept secret. The dying master sends the 6th poison, his last student, to justify the mistakes he suspects some of his students have committed. How will the last pupil get the other toxins? How will he know which of them is bad? The way these questions are answered is part of what makes this movie good. <br /> <br /> We also see that the venetes fight each other in each combination. It is nice to see how their styles fit together. <br /> <br /> If you want to see if you want Kung Fu movies, it's a great movie to start with. It doesn't get any better than that.
