The young woman's name is Bonnie (Polay). She is attractive, apparently living a fairly decent life, but suddenly it is inexplicably beaten out of her home and the life of Evil Dude and the Various and Several Devils out of the house. Now she has no idea what the hell is going on, just that a lot of armed teeth want her death ... and she's going to die, not even knowing. <br /> <br /> God, I hear the groans all the time. Now the content is so cheap to produce and people can create their own movies / books / cartoons / internal organs, no one will be there to ensure a standard of quality! We're going to drown! The only people who actually think are people who haven't watched any movies or recently read any books, because we're already doing a dead raft in the crap. It's people like Ferrari and Rodriguez who put the lie to this ignorant so-and-sos by throwing and making $ 8K on the table. Well, what I would say is a better action movie than anything you've seen in theaters years ... but you haven't seen any action movie this year in the theater. I saw the checkout. You stay away in villages. You'll do better to make a copy of this, entertain twenty minutes and entertain your lives. <br /> <br /> It's pure entertainment. You enter, like Bonnie, with many questions and where the whole thing ends, is misty. The whole mind has been done in various ways before, but not in such a compressed amount of time, and not without such concentrated nice-play. You are there for the atmosphere, the riddle and the guns. That's it - it's all the filmmakers promised, and they deliver. <br /> <br /> It warms my heart's black holes to think it's made on such a budget. We get a good number of indie movies here, but rarely do we see anything as polished as this is short, and we have never seen one in the action genre that looked so good. Hell, you can hand over these two guys MI: 3 and that can bother me. The Bond franchise. Hell, anything. No, indeed, even better: I'd like to see these guys make a mark on their own and stay away from Hollywood. Whatever is outside the film industry, is undoubtedly contagious. <br /> <br /> Best indie we've seen for a while and the most effective indie calling card we've ever seen. The DVD is $ 20 and has bonus features from the ass. Take your movie ticket budget instead.
