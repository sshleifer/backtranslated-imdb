A hit at the moment, but now better categorized as an Australian cult movie. The humor is broad, impeccable and in the final scene where a BBC studio fire is extinguished by smelling it, rough. Contains just about every click on the traditional Australian pilgrimage to the old country, and every click on that ravenous, trapped, whinging, Tory Brits. Will be acceptable to the British because of its strong role players of well-known actors, and of Australians of that generation, who can get the humor. Americans - Forget it. The language and jokes are in the Australian dialect of English and as such it will be incomprehensible.
