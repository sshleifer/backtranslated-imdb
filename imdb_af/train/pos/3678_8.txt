this is a very nice movie and I would definitely recommend it to everyone. But there are two minus points: - The level of the stories has a large spectrum. some of the screens are very good and some are just boring. - Many stories are not self-reliant (if you compare to coffee and cigarettes, where each story has a point, a message, a punchline, or, but you want to call it), but well, most stories are really Well, some are big and overall this year is one of the best movies! <br /> <br /> Irritating, I have to fill at least 10 lines, I no longer have to say and I don't want to start analyzing the single rows ... <br /> <br /> Well, I think that's it!
