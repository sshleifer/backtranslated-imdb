As a child, I chose the first Care Bear movie, as this one looks so dark. I always sat down and looked at the first one. When I got older, I learned to prefer this one. What I think is that this movie is too dark for babies, but as you get older, you learn to estimate it as you understand it more, it doesn't look as dark as it was when you were a child. <Br /> <br /> This movie, in my opinion, is better than the first one, everything is so much deeper. This may contradict the first movie, but you must ignore the first movie to watch this one. The cubs are just too adorable, I rewind the 'Flying My Colors' scene. I tend to annoy everyone by singing it. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is great! A great hand for Carol and Dean Parks. I love every song in this movie, I downloaded them all and everything I listen to is listening to "We Start," also known as "Revocation". I always preferred this soundtrack to the first one, although I only love Carol Kings song in the first movie 'Care-A-Lot'. <br /> <br /> I think the animation is great, the animation in both movies is fantastic. I was surprised when I sat down and watched it about 10 years later and saw that the animation was excellent for the time being. It was really surprising. <br /> <br /> There is not much support from other people to say that this movie is great, but it is. I don't think it's strange / strange. I think it's a great movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is basically about how the Caregivers came and defeating the Demon, Dark Heart. The end is amazing and again, any 'Pokemon Movie' hits the Care Bears moral issues. It has an effect on you. Again, this movie can teach everyone of all ages about morality.
