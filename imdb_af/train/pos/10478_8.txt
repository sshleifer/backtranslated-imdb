<br /> <br /> It's definitely a "must see" for those who sometimes smoke a reefer in their secret hiding, trying to prevent them from getting through parents, teachers, police, etc. caught. The protagonist is a lady in her forties who lives in her home, breeding orchids, and totally unaware of the fact that her so-called rich and true man is actually broken and deceived. When he suddenly dies, she is confronted with the truth. The sheriff comes to tell her she's in great debt. She didn't know what to do until her gardener told her about the recent success of dagga in Britain. She decided after a few long thoughts to get rid of her flowers and to start breeding instead. The story is very original, the outstanding achievements! I can only think of a few movies that make me laugh more than this one. Yet the melodramatic touch is present. The movie is typically British: the jokes are not vulgar, there is no violence involved. It should not be mentioned that it is recommended to take a few concepts before looking at 'Savings'. It will be so much nicer! Especially the scene with the 2 old ladies in their tea shop is hilarious. I thought my jaws would burst. 9/10
