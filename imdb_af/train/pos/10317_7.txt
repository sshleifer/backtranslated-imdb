You know how Star Trek fans streamed to all the Star Trek movies, even the bad people? Why? To see their heroes again in action. So I feel about Doc Savage. I am a big fanatic for the character, and the prospect of seeing Doc and his crew in an adventure was overwhelming. And the first 20 minutes of the movie just increased that sense of anticipation. Then they decided to crawl elements of a number of Doc adventures and toss them into this one film, resulting in a somewhat unfounded film. There is a lot of promise in this, diluted by a number of unfortunate choices (the music, the "camp" elements, etc.) But the spirit of Doc is there, and that's what the people of us are familiar with Doc and his crew op. So, on my long way, that's what I'm trying to say, it's not a bad movie: it's just not as good as it should have been. And anyone who is a fan of Superman, James Bond, Indiana Jones, Buckaroo Banzai and many other characters, should watch this movie just to get acquainted with the hero who gave inspiration to all of them.
