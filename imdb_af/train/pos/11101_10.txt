The soprano was probably the last best show to air in the 90s. It's sad that it was over, it was the best show on HBO if it wasn't on TV, and not everything was spelled out for you. It was brilliant. the throw was excellent. Tony (James Gandolphini) is a good actor and plays his character excellently as well as the others. Each character had mistakes that made it so real and allowed the viewers to link with them, which is one reason why it took so long. The last episode was good, I don't know how to use it. Many different things can be explained by the terminated ID, such as thinking that Tony is not dying, but pasture came in and sat down with them and that the blackout was just for tension. Tony will have to go to trial and to go with it hopefully it's not dead, that's how I feel ... Life lives the Sopranos and Tony Soprano .......
