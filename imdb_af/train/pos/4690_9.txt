Twenty years ago I showed this movie in some children's classes in Entomology and can still remember the excitement of the children; they were spellbound! It's not just about the termites built in the "Castles of Clay", but also about the other animals that use the hills. There is a fantastic scene in which a cobra fights a shoulder while a colony looks mongooses. It is not only good for entomology classes, but also for the teaching of ecology, as there is so much about the interactions between termites and other organisms and the entire ecology of all the organisms living in and around the hills. <br /> <br /> I wish it was available on DVD so I could see it again and show others.
