A very high-standard Columbo story, which was actually the first filmed episode of the long-running series, but was originally transmitted second (after "Murder By The Book"). <br /> <br /> Robert Culp makes his first of three performances as the gas murderer in the series and is the owner of a private detective agency, deterring wife (Patricia Crowley) from a rich, highly influential businessman (what played very sympathetically by Ray Milland) after falsifying a report. , after discovering, she had a relationship. The woman later rebel against the extortion scheme, but is killed. <br /> <br /> A very satisfying episode in many ways, especially since the plot is so strong and then developed and also because of the rare Columbo component that crime is an unforeseen death. The whole thing is further enhanced when the widow spouse uses the killer to help Columbo in his investigations: a feature that facilitates many good quality scenes, especially in the first order when the three central characters meet and Columbo's extremely deceptive features are wonderful. <br /> <br /> Directed with flair by Bernard L. Kowalski and acting at an appropriately high level, it really did show off the whole series (since "Murder By the Book" dropped by a weak end) . The writings of Columbo creators Richard Levinson and William Link are precise, well-structured and well thought-out and supported by a steady, productive pace and meaningful sequences that truly display the unpredictability of the story. Ultimately, the final suits Columbo has always been one step ahead of the killer. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a very fine piece of detective for Columbo and strongly suggests that the production team worked positively. and constructive to deliver a polished Columbo story.
