Don't take what I should say lightly now. I have seen many, many movies, and have a lot of them, in print. So when I tell you that this movie has some funniest scene I've ever seen in a movie, you might want to listen to me. There are many divergent opinions on what makes this indescribable silly movie as funny as it is. And for those who just didn't get it, well, I can't blame them too much. The scene I'm talking about is about the 30-minute point and involves a dead conviction to John Candy. Until then, I got the movie stupid, confusing and it started to lose me. When this scene came up, I laughed so loudly, I put on my pants. No movie ever did it to me. When the project started, "Going Berserk" was supposed to be the SCTV movie. I remember it being announced. As time went on, the movie was thrown to John Candy, Joe Flaherty & Eugene Levy. There should also have been a regime change at Universal, while it was shot, because on release it was shown in almost ZERO theaters. When I watched it a second time, I listened to the theme song (which actually reflects the incomprehensible drawings in the lyrics), relaxes my logical nerve and figured out what's going on. Aside from the said routine, Going Berserk has many other hilarious scenes to recommend. It's almost 3 Stooges movie, except it's very funny. Director David Steinberg has sharp timing, and he had to laugh at this laugh. As for Candy, who is basically in control here, he has never been harder. With all the plot devices and explanatory scenes thrown out of the window, he runs absolutely wild. Flaherty and Levy follow him effortlessly. There's a plot, but it's a plot like 'Animal House' had a plot, and yes, the font is uneven, and a bit slow to start. Once you know it, you can appreciate the full SCTV style craziness. It's stupid, but it's foolish for the purpose, and you should remember when you see it. DO see it, and discover for yourself whether it has the funniest scene of all time in it.
