"Pecker" is a young, unknown photographer from Baltimore who becomes a big star in the public, media and local art center with his photographs showing the dirty reality of everyday life, like dirty underwear or human feces. It is a typical topic of John Waters, Baltimore's independent comedies, to show the strange sides of the American way of life between political corrective mode and conservative setback by examining the background of the middle class fellowship of his hometown. <br /> <br /> Edward Furlong of the "Terminator 2" lady plays Pecker, supported by Christina Ricchi, photographer Cindy Sherman, legendary Patricia Hearst and Water's actress Mink Stole. Although placing the plot sometimes becomes a big mistake and can't compete with the fast and furious joke attacks of Water's brilliant "Serial Mom", it's still some good laughs and some unforgettable scenes like a former junkie girl who became a vegetarian by sniffing peas from a vegetable tile. 'Pecker' is a great comedy about the arrogance of the art zone, media hypers, middle-class sex anxiety and the strange ways of becoming a pop star without realizing it. Recommended!
