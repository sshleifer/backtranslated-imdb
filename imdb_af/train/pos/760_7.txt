I have not seen this movie since the late 80's and decide to pick up its VHS version. The plot is very slow, and the actors look almost robotic in this breakdance movie. The music, hip hop / freestyle artists and the breakdancing scenes are what make this movie special. The breakdancing is actually better in this movie than in "Breakin", but I have to say that "Breakin 1 & 2" makes the screen's energy and excitement much better. It's a movie I will keep in my library, but it's not a movie I can see over and over again, just once in a blue moon.
