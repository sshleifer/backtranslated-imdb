Despite its tough title, it's a light teenage drama. Unless you're an old friend, you'll probably find it. However, it is not so good to develop characters or situations at all. If you see it, you get the feeling that you are running back and forth to the kitchen, even if you're sleeping all the time. It's one of those movies that much of you looks like the characters, and they're attractive enough. Jennifer Connelly is the heart of many, I know, but I've always loved the dark Maddie Corman. The teens get most of the screen time without many intruders from the rude adults. Is it just me or did most of the young men look very awful?
