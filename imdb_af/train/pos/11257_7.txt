Erotic theater of the 1970s was tough compared to the three-year-old X romps of today, which is good. Because there is a good story around the nude rituals and sex scenes. Of course I wish they had some vampire effects that they had at the time and the sex got a bit in the way of the story. Plus some of the accents were difficult to understand at times, but it's worth looking at the unedited version, then the updated version that is titled DEVIL'S PLAYTHING. But if you don't mind the dead of naked women dancing and having sex, it's not the movie for you. But I enjoyed it and I give it ... 7 stars.
