There is an inexhaustible hunger for "basic training" movies, so it's surprising that this one has been noticed as little as the first time it was released. It will probably have a well-deserved second life on DVD / VHS. <br /> <br /> Tigerland is not that big, there are some terribly cleaved characters (especially the portrayal of the NCOs, make you long for the return of Lee 'Full Metal Jacket' Sleeveless), but the main achievement by Colin Farrell are the things of direct stars. Charisma to burn and a role any actor would kill to get.
