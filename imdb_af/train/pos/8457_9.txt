Gundam Wing after me happens a good anime. A little slow moving (especially in the middle of the range), but everywhere nice. Now before anyone jumps to my case and calls me a "wing", I will admit that I've watched the original Gundam, Gundam 0080 and 0083, the 08th MS team and Gundam SEED. <br /> <br /> I will admit that there were some issues with the storytelling and some characters may look like rip-offs (that is, Zechs Marquise after the original Gundam's Char), but it's " an alternative universal show based on the original series, as it is SEED. <br /> <br /> If you want to see this series, make sure you first watch the original Gundam, and then you know about an AU series.
