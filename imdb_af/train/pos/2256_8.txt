Didn't know what to expect from Van Damme's partner and friend / coach and his fighting choir for most of his films. It was nice to see him as 'TONG PO' in Kickboxer and other Van Damme's movies. Now he's on his own. He and his wife make a good team. In this one, Qissi is the action director and he leads bad guys and he's his wife was the writer, manufacturer and director of most screens that didn't need action. She also did the work to edit the movie. Together they did a good job. well-adjusted, the leaders were real fighters and looked good together - the story came together well, and if you can experience it ... no bad language, no sex, just action. A new one on me.
