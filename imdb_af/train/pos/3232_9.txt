Gone to see this Finnish movie and I have to say this is one of the better movies I've seen this year. The intrigues consist of 5-6 different stories, all of which take place the same day in a small Finnish town. The stories come together very nicely, and may remind you of the way Tarantino's films are made. Most of the actors performed very well, which is definitely needed in realistic plays of this kind. I especially enjoyed the play by Sanna Hietala, the main actress and Juha Kukkonen. I noticed that the IMDB got wrong information about Sanna. Her name, as you may have seen in my review, is NOT Heikkil√§, but Hietala.
