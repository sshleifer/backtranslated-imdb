I loved this show so much and I'm so sad that it was canceled. I thought it would come back, but only two stupid weeks. It's awful. I hate how we never find out how everyone ends up. it sucks. Bring it back! ABC has stupid shows like Supernanny and what, but doesn't give time for good people like Six Degrees. If they complain about ratings, it was probably because they had a bad lock because it was really a good show, something I could relate to and expect. JJ Abrams delivered, he is wonderful, I wish ABC could just trust him to complete the story. I also loved the whole role. I couldn't wait to see everyone meet one day. Everybody's story is now incomplete, now I will never know if Steven and Whitney get together, or Carlos and Mae. I wanted to see what would happen to Laura or Damien and everyone else. It's really such a downer.
