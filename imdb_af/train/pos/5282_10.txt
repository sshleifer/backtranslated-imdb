I don't know ... Maybe it's just because it's an impressive tribute to some Muslim religious action (hajj), but I just felt the movie was so underestimated. I just can't believe the movie has just been voted by 223 people so far, as the movie was produced in 2004 and has won many awards since then. About the movie ... it's one of those benevolent sweet Reda, a French teenager due to a Baccalaureate, being asked by his dedicated elderly father to take him to Mecca. Strange as it may seem (if one doesn't know much about Islam) the father wants his son to drive them. from their home in France to Saudia Arabia on a religious pilgrimage once in a lifetime. The gender gap between the father and the son is based on simple enough terms ('you may know how to read and write, but you know nothing about life, the name of the father of his son), but a kind of bromidic generation gap literature is avoided. Some of them are loving in their frustrations. The father never speaks in French, although Reda understands Arabic, but it can only look in French. Although they meet many people on the road: "There is the poverty old woman picking them up in the Bosnian border on their way to Belgrade, and the talkative Mustafa (Jacky Nercessian), helping them at the border of Turkey, the reticent and shy women who carry burqas on their way to Damascus. "The focus is always on the mismatching father and son. There's not much of a conversation in the movie that makes it enjoyable for you. You see beautiful views in every city they go. The director even shows you the Blue Mosque and the Hagia Sophia, although the film is not relatively long. <br /> <br /> Generally, I don't like movies that don't have enough dialog boxes and use their power of camera subtleties, but this one was really great. Despite unanswered details (such as Reda's invisible French girl), the film calls for senses. Great artwork and remember this movie is Ishmael Ferroukhi's debut.
