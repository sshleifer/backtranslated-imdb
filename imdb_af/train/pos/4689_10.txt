I totally agree with the comments so far. I remember this documentary as one of the most wonderful and informative I have ever seen. As mentioned earlier, I remember starting to look, thinking it was just another nature study - interesting, not necessarily special, but I was so wrong. Not only was the story of the colony incredible, but I remember the music being so much part of its appeal. If I remember correctly, it was native pipe (similar to the music at the end of One Flew Over the Cookoo's Nest). I was also looking for a copy. It should be required to look for someone, but especially the schools. It must be released again.
