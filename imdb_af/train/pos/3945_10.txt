The rating is just a 5 because it was a movie that could use better acting and direction (or at least music!). For the achievements of Walt Whitman, however, it deserves a 10. A previous poster calls the movie, but I think it's a simple case not to see the forest for the trees. The filmmakers were apparently more interested in the story out there than having a Hollywood shining movie. And for this, I applaud them - the fact that it is non-mainstream also reflects Whitman's life. This film is more documentary than for the sake of acting. To be fascinated with a story like this, if you rarely hear of these types of stories that present the present-day mental health, is the most important thing. I found it a very pleasing look at history.
