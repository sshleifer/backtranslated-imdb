From the Philadelphia suburbs and very interested in local history, this film offers an excellent view of Philadelphia in the 1940s. There are scenes from the center, a train station that no longer exists, 30th Street Station - which still exists, as well as scenes from the northeastern part of the city. Good shots of the old row houses as they appeared. The movie sometimes becomes a bit "chattering", which causes the viewer to lose interest briefly ... but the overall storyline is solid and moving a lot. Anyone who enjoys this movie should also try to watch the movie "Bright Victory", including local footage from the Valley Forge Army Hospital in Phoenixville, PA and Phoenixville Center scenes. The military hospital has since become a university campus. None of these movies are in any format and I can't imagine why. I have them both at VHS of home recording, as shown on TCM in the past year. I recommend them to any other history buffs out there from my neighborhood!
