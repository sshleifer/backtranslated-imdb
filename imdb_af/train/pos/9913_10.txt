In addition to a very fun movie, I might add that the costumes and scenery were wonderful. This kind of love woman had a lot of money. Unfortunately, she also had two greedy daughters who were anxious to get their hands on her money. This woman was lonely since the death of her husband. He introduced her to a theater that would be demolished. To prevent this, she bought it. Her daughters were scared that she would throw their "money" and decided to act. The character factors in this film were also a good plus. I will give almost anything to have a copy of this movie in my video library, but from now on it has never been released. Heart broken.
