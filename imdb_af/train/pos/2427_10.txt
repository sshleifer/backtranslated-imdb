It's really a great unknown movie. Perfect dialogue without the typical clich√©s.The movie is based on the actor's talent and it is subtracted. It even had a comedy in it, but it wasn't overdoing it. Only in life is what a crime drama is supposed to be, not the typical special effects of garbage with sex being thrown into it. I especially knew the interracial aspects of everything. <br /> <br /> Now on the actors themselves. Laurence Fishburne was great at playing a career. It is a pity that he may only show his talent in his own movie. Titus Welliver was fabulous as Fishburne's junky half-brother. Eamonn Walker added flavor to the already perfectly seasoned film. Paul Calderon was perfect as a fat monkey / drug host. I loved his performance since King of New York. But the best play in this movie is from Gregory Hines and Michael Paul Chan, who are perfectly matched to two of Calderon's henchmen. <br /> <br /> Once in a lifetime, it's a custodian. **** 1/2 * from *****.
