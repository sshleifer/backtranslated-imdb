As a big fan of Japanese singers Gackt and Hyde, I was very excited when I realized that they had made a movie and made it my mission to see it. I was not disappointed. In fact, this movie far exceeded my expectations. Knowing that both Gackt and Hyde are singers rather than actors, I was willing to be brave, but not really those fulfilling performances, but I am happy to say that they both managed to enchant me and the story to believe as it goes on. Moon Child has just the right amount of humor, action, romance and serious, heartbreaking moments. I can't say I ever cried out on a movie and these more mere moments are admirably performed by the couple, in my opinion, definitely proving their skills as actors. The battle scenes are absolutely stunning and although there are a few moments of uncertainty to start with, you are quickly in the movie and start to tie with the characters. I highly recommend this movie to everyone, especially those who are Gackt and Hyde.
