It was very nice! I never read the Chester-Gould cartoons, but I don't need to know them. Maybe there were jokes inside that I didn't find out, but what the eye does not see cannot be sad. It's such an ironic, colorful film and the actors are all good-natured. The setting is similar to that in Batman movies, but not as dark and gray. Okay, the story is not so original, but there is a plot (which is not self-evident) and a more or less surprising end. <br /> <br /> With this movie you can play an interesting game if you watch it with friends. Don't even look at the credits and then see who is the fastest to find out who the famous actors are among their make-up!
