It's almost a perfect movie. The ideas will be repeated by Mamet, but never said so briefly. It's really about the failure of trust, the human condition. The film weaves the idea that we are all criminals, no one is innocent. Is there anyone today who hasn't seen each day in our own society? The film is very structured like a Hitchcock thriller. Besides, there are no more innocent characters. The world is now completely polluted, devastated and everyone takes part in the concept. Can anything be more true? <br /> <br /> Don't miss the soundtrack. It is wonderful.
