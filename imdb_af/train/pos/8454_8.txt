The second alternative Gundam universe story (G-Gundam the first), Gundam wing, is another view in the Gundam verse. The well-known elements are found, but Gundam Wing is actually different from its peers. The biggest of the Gundams is nothing more than terrorists fighting a single organization. In fact, the series is not really a representation of war until episode 7, but in reality the real conflict, the Eve Wars, does not happen until the later episodes. <br /> <br /> The biggest positive of this series is its characters. All the main characters run through the 49 episode and you can really sympathize with each of the roles they bring. Another big plus is the fantastic character and mecha design of the series. The designs shame some of his other Gundam counterparts. <br /> <br /> One of the biggest criticisms of this series is how much the hard UC fans demand from the original UC saga. Why Gundam Wing gets this rap when the more apparent UC clone of Gundam Seed is out there is outside of me. True, many moments have been lifted, but they have been told in new ways and there are also clear differences. <br /> <br /> For example, take the usual comparison of Zechs Merquise and UC Icon Char Aznable. During the series, Zechs is more extinct in the Alliance and in other ways OZ, while the Red Comet is a symbol of Zeon. Another big difference is that Zechs loses many soldiers under his command and thus the other nickname he gave in the early episodes: "Killer of his own husbands." Char is not given this label. <br /> <br /> The problems with this series are not mumbo jumbo's philosophy, but two problems. The first is the reused animated footage of the Gundams attacks. Certainly, it's hard to see the heaviest attacks, MS, and airplanes. But on the fourth reuse scene like this one gets old. <br /> <br /> The second problem is that the whole series is supposed to take place throughout the year. If you really think of all the events going on in the series, it happens in just one year. <br /> <br /> But I think you can easily dismiss this fact when you ignore the intro's first lines so often. As it is, it is probably the best of the Alternative Universe Gundam stories and a good introduction to the Gundam world. It was the very first Gundam anime to fly into American television.
