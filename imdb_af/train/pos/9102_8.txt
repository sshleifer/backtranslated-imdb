I watched this movie at the 18th Haifa Film Festival, and this is one of the best I've seen this year. To see it on a big screen (and I mean LARGE, not one of the TV screens that most theaters have) with an excellent sound system, always enhances the movie experience, as the movie takes your eyes and ears And you in the story suck the picture. <br /> <br /> The movie presents a set of characters that are connected to each other. Their stories cross at certain points, and the multitude of story lines reminded me of the great Robert Altman and his beautiful films. But the real hero of the movie is of course the city of Madrid, which provides the backdrop for the whole movie. It houses the characters, contains the pavements and paths they run, and sets the backdrop for all the events, all in beautifully filmed scenes. <br /> <br /> Time and again, the movie returns to certain themes (shoes, for example), and essentially Salazar makes its metaphors more and more understandable to the viewer as the film progresses. He combines the view of the city with the shots of the characters and adjusts the feel of the scene in the background. A set of talented actors help him to portray a wide variety of characters. An excellent example is the scene in which Juaquin first takes Anita over the road. It may not work on a small screen, but it has easily licked me on a big screen. Many of the movie's messages are very positive, so the movie is sometimes light and funny. The music next to the movie is usually pop, with some instrumental pieces (I hope to put my hand on the soundtrack one day, though I seriously doubt I will do it). <br /> <br /> Along with this I have a sensational feeling from this movie, and I'm not easily impressed (you have to take my word for it). For this and more, I give this movie a solid 8/10.
