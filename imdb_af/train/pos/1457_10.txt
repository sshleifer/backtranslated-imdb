I watched this documentary twice - and although I am a big movie woman, most of the documentaries keep my attention. However, this film was fascinating. Almost every shot is perfect - say so much more than a sound account (which does not have this documentary). <br /> <br /> The concept of this movie is great, I can't afford it enough. Mardi Gras beads - who would have thought ?? <br /> <br /> Wonderful and great choices of interviews - film of a factory in China - the movie makes you feel like you're there. <br /> <br /> I'm politically aware - and I read several books on globalization, so there was nothing in this movie that was a surprise to me. But that made me think so much. <br /> <br /> I wish so much that this world was a better place. <br /> <br /> a million kudos to the filmmaker - and thanks for making this movie. <br /> <br /> I wish everyone could see it.
