For me, the last scene in which Harris responds to the press corps is worth viewing this intelligent and timeless piece of politics (especially the campaign phase). If only the "real" pulse would respond to the intelligent, articulate way as with Mr. Harris, then the arrogant, self-service staff might think twice before getting irrelevant, confrontational "garbage" that has absolutely nothing to do with a candidate's ability to effectively deal with the challenges faced by the office he / she is working for.
