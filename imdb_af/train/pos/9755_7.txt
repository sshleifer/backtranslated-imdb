The last time I saw the movie, I was about seven years old, so my opinions can be over the years. Then I enjoyed the filming that switched between cartoons and live action. Then I felt sad for the blue camel and his sad life. I also felt delighted when Captain Contagious kidnapped the heroines (a princess or toy shepherd), the tables he turned on. Unfortunately, the producers never decided to transfer this movie to VHS, so all I have is twenty years old memories. I'm sure if I saw the movie again, I'd consider it chewy and juicy, but I really enjoyed it.
