Well, it's an Ivan Reitman movie. With the exceptional exception, Ivan likes to entertain. His films are generally not "deep", but they are often entertaining enough. My Super Ex girlfriend surprised me by laughing more than I thought I would. Uma Thurman is just as big, and I love her portrayals. I also like Luke Wilson, and Rainn Wilson was a straight guy. Never take himself seriously, the movie is on top and yet it is not very unique, nor is it where no one has been before. It's a nice rental and probably an OK date movie, especially if you're a headache and don't want to deliver your brain. It's fun and there's nothing wrong with it. When you get rid of the "super-girl" stuff, you're left with a story about relationships, and relationships are bad. It's a boy meeting girl, boy late girl thing. And in the end, the characters are looking for love. Not all of them are "dumped" as well as they can ... a cut of life with a twist.
