In 'Anne of Green Gables' (1934), Marilla Cuthbert (Helen Westley) and Matthew Cuthbert (OP Heggie), middle-aged brothers and sisters living at Green Gables, a farm in Avonlea, on Prince Edward Island, decides' A boy from far away to help on their farm. But the orphan who was sent to them is a preliminary girl of 14 named Anne Shirley (Dawn Evelyn Paris - a veteran of Disney's series of Alice shorts who will later adopt her character's name). <br /> <br /> Anne was only 11 in Lucy Maude's Montgomery's source novel, but the same actress couldn't be credible from 11 to college in the course of the story. The film suffers a bit from this concession, as many of Anne's responses and much of what she says is more entertained by an 11-year-old teenager. As in the book, Anne is bright and fast, happy to be happy, but unhappy with her name, her build, her freckles and her long red hair. However, as a child of imagination, Anne is very happy in life, and quickly adapts to her new family and area around Prince Edward Island. <br /> <br /> In fact, Anne is the original "Teenage Drama Queen" and the film's screenwriter chose to focus on this aspect of her character. That has transformed the basic genre from the rather amusing family drama to comedy. A change that welcomes audiences and continues to frustrate readers purists. <br /> <br /> As the comedy is very much in the spirit of the Montgomery's story, I can't see any reason to tackle the changes, but it serves as an honest warning to anyone who is a true believer. adjustment expected. The comedy element is the strength of the movie, as it is one of the earliest self-reflective parodies of Hollywood conventions. Actress Anne Shirley was one of Hollywood's everyday beauties and the movie is black and white. So much of the entertainment is to see the title character's endless witches contradicting her appearance and hair color contradicted by what appears on the screen. Anne regularly arranges her regular rural companions with melodramatic lines such as: "If you refuse, it will be a lifelong pain to me". Perhaps the funniest moment is when she corrects the spelling of her name on the classroom board. <br /> <br /> Tom Brown does a good job as Anne's love interest. Gilbert Blythe and Sara Haden steal all the screens in which she appears as the Cuthbert's pumpy neighbor. <br /> <br /> Then again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
