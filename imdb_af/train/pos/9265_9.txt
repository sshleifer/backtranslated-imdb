Different film directors from different countries have contributed a great deal to their film media. As a result, we experienced different genres when the medium is involved. Jafar Panahi, unlike J. L. Godard or F. Truffault, believes in simple storytelling; Schematic narratives are one of the most important features of his legal practice. He relies on the automatic as well as critical intelligence of the viewer; He does not need to go for alienation or such things to reach the viewers. He is equally effective despite being conventional. Offside (2006) is another schematic creation of him, where Middle East Asian subordination gradually becomes clear to everyone as the simple but catchy story of the movie. Like days, when we all call on the issue of women's rights, this movie moves very calmly into our minds and eventually becomes a heap of our critical intelligence by sending the message that the authenticity of human rights is nothing else. an illusory good, a utopia. Fatherhood will never allow women to be empowered. An important football game where the nation participates, a teenage girl who understands the game, loves her nation, does not have the right to enter the stadium to encourage her country. She was only allowed to listen to the live comments. Her alias couldn't work for her. As a result, she had to undergo various humiliating situations. From the beginning her worried father ran here and there for her daughter. At the end of the day, the celebration came when the nation won the match that the girl could not see, as she was held outside the stadium during the match period. But the celebration cannot suppress the issue of women's rights that are different in different parts of the world. Jafar Panahi best used this problem of sex abuse in the framework of conventional film making and patriarchy. A global tragedy is comfortable and sometimes treated with humor, which in turn plagues our being.
