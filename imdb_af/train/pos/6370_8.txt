To my surprise, I really enjoyed Disney's latest animation installment. The movie had its lows, but overall I felt the story was strong and the characters were easy to relate to. It was also nice to see an Animated Disney movie that was not a musical. I was pushed across the border with Tarzan. Fortunately, they gave the music case a rest. Another nice feature of the film is that the comedy is not completely obscured (a la Hercules), rather subtle, so the children are still laughing while they are not the adults, or just stupid. <br /> <br /> One disappointment was the animation. With all the great animated movies taking place outside Disney studios, you'd think they'd move and catch up. There is something to say about tradition, but think of the possibilities of the story of Atlantis! Overall the film was entertaining, and definitely worth a trip to the plywood. <br /> <br />
