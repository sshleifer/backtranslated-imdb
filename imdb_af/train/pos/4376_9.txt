Liam Neeson depicts Scottish legend Robert Roy Macgregor from the early 18th century. He is a true actor. He captivates the audience with his charisma as he does in all his roles. Jessica Lange is excellent like his wife, Mary. Maria is such a beautiful woman. It's her love that Rob Roy makes the legend, but it's his passion that makes her love miserable. They need each other. Tim Roth like the evil Cunningham is perfect; Somehow, if you watch the movie, you'll find Cunningham disgusting. The Scottish scenery is beautiful. The environment and circumstances of the times are portrayed fairly well. If you love history, romance, passion and love, you'll enjoy Rob Roy. There is violence and blood, but it is inevitable to tell this story as it should be told; no gratuitous violence. And you should listen carefully if you are not accustomed to a Scottish accent. One important point that makes this movie so good is that no one is acting as an actor or actress; they get dirty and actually look unattractive in different scenes. This is their skill as actors who dress you up, they do not rely on market entry, popularity or gender-based appeal. It's something special.
