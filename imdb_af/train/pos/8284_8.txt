It's one of those unique horror movies that requires a much more mature understanding of the word 'horror' so it can be appreciated. The most important thing people cannot realize is that this story is being told by a little boy, and as with most younger children, he is easily frightened. Mainly because he simply doesn't understand things, as his father is almost never there for him. From watching the movie you can see how the man with his wife fights the balance between work time and family time and you can easily understand it but do the boy. Also, imagine that the boy is scared of the forest, as it is found early in the film, that the family is out of town. Also, in the beginning when the family travels to the house, they become a deer, then they are stopped, then argue with the residents about it, and the little boy certainly did not find this introduction to the forest pleasant. <br /> <br /> Finally, the "Wendigo" is what makes its young innocent minds to explain it all. There is the American Indian legend, but when you look at the scene where the young boy hears about it, it is explained to him as blunt and simplistic. Not because that's what Wendigo really is, but because it understands it. Watching this movie really appreciates it. It was clear that it was low-budget and cheaply shot, but the jumping montages, the use of light and general honesty are more than just doing it. And the last question the film asks is: is it all in your head, or is it really out there? 8/10 <br /> Valued R: Curse, Violence and a Sex Scene
