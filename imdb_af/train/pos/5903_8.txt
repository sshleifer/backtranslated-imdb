I like this movie kind remind me of my marriage. It's very clean, you can see it with family. Well done. Songs are also good. I think the writer director is wonderful. The film shows how marriages progress through time. They have couples at different stages of life and relationships in their lives. The movie depicts beautifully several phases in parallel in the same story. Some of the windows are pretty good. The movie shows complex human emotions very nicely with more dramatization. Show also perfect is not so perfect. Shows the dynamics of regular marriage when it's new. The movie is very well written and directed.
