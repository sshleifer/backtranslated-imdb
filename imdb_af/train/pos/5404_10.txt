Who says pokemon is stupid can die. This movie is superlative. I even tore a tear when Celebei died. I DO NOT GET LOT! This movie is a fun animated thriller. <br /> <br /> In this fourth installment of Pokemon, Ash and Friends must stop the bad thing to make Celebei the ultimate evil weapon with his dark ball. In time, Sam and Celebei travel through time and are constantly hunted by hunters. I like the part with the dual battle, and Sam has the apricot football (if you played pokemon gold, silver or crystal, you know what it is.) <br /> <br /> I also enjoyed controlling miramax to have. instead of Warner Brothers. At the end of the mini movie was a good idea. The pokemon in this movie comes to life more than ever before.
