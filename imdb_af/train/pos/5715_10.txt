Karen goes to a Japanese home as a substitute nurse to Emma, ​​a strange woman sleeping at night and waking up at night. Karen goes upstairs and hears sounds when she meets a frightening ghost. She will teach the house's secret. <br /> <br /> It's very scary! The screens are shocking and frightening! The characters are good. The settings are creepy. I love the whole plot! The end was shocking! I watched a scene where the boy waited so hard for the man to find his sister on top and I was shocked. This is the scariest movie I watched. I didn't see the Japanese version. I recommend it to horror fans. 10/10 and 5 stars!
