Rupert Friend gives a performance, such as Prince Albert, who lifts "The Young Victoria" at unexpected levels. He is wonderful. As we know, Queen Victoria fell into a dark, deep depression after Prince Albert's death and looked at Ruper Friend's eyes I understood. The film does not take us to his death, but to an incident that could cost his life very well. An act of love. I believed it or I had to tell him. I believed what he felt was real. Nothing or anyone comes anywhere near the delicacy and thoroughness of Friend's characterization. Emily Blunt is good, but I didn't believe she was Victoria for a moment. No real sense of time. It may not have been her fault, but her prince earned the crown.
