One of my favorite shows again in the 70's. As I recall, it flew on the Nine Network (?) On Friday (or possibly Saturday) night in Australia. Darren McGavin and Simon Oakland were great together. <br /> <br /> Every episode usually peaked with Kolchack to join hands with a kind of supernatural opponent. For their credit, the authors made a joint effort to get as many of the regular round vampires and ghosts as possible. <br /> <br /> I remember one episode in which the adversary was the spirit of an old Indian chief who "came back" as a massive electric current that started killing people in a city hospital. The final confrontation tried Kolchack to shorten the 'power' short in the midst of an explosion of sparks and undulating flames. Oh yes ... you had to be there at the time, but it was an interesting idea. <br /> <br /> McGavin always put a lot of energy and enthusiasm into his roles and that was one of his best. br /> <br /> Definitely deserve a place in TV's "Hall of Fame". To quote Tony Vincenzo .... "Kolchack, you're on it" ... Or, in the case of the Hall of Fame, "IN"!
