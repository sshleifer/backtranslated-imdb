Back in the day when Marion Davies had her drunkards and not only listened to William Randolph Hearst, she would have done more films like Show People and be much happier. In fact, if you see her, getting her first big break in two role-comedies, she would have liked to do so in her career instead of such episodes as When Knightood Was In Flower and Janice Meredith. <br /> <br /> What you see at all accounts in Show People is the real Davies, a gifted comedy, an excellent mime and a generous kind-hearted person. She can really identify with the character of Peggy Pepper aka Patricia Prepoire. She placed her prediction in her Hollywood star. <br /> <br /> If the Show People plot is set to the legal stage, you would call it a background story. I think it's one of the first movies about the movies you can call it behind the camera story. Marion is eager, hopeful, arriving in Hollywood like many others, looking for that great break. She wants drama, but her introduction to the movies is like the foil for the burlesque comics. She faces her part of the pie and seltzer, but learns her trade. And also win the heart of young comic actor William Haines. <br /> <br /> She gets her first big break, but it doesn't come for Haines either, and Marion gets legitimate drama with actor Paul Ralli, plays Andre Telfair, a handicap not a count Count of Avignon. Someone here took a shot at actor Lou Tellegen, lover and husband of Sarah Bernhardt and Geraldine Farrar and others, and to tell it, one of the most despicable people in the theater. <br /> <br /> Show People were one of the first movies to have the unfair cameo appearance of stars than themselves. You'll find people like Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, Mae Murray, John Gilbert, Eleanor Boardman, and more. See, just in and around the film colony. That in itself makes people worth a movie to save. <br /> <br /> Show people also made good use of standard Tin Pan Alley songs like, Is not We Got Fun, I'm sitting on top of the world, You'll be surprised, California, here I come. As the film came out, a song called Crossroads was launched. It's not a bad number, but the boy and girl don't get credit in the soundtrack. I think since they are not seen, it felt like no bill was needed. However, I would like to know and I'm sure you would like to see Show People. <br /> <br /> It is easy to see why Marion Davies liked this movie as a personal favorite. She looks so at home in this movie and her real life lacks pretense in her performance that makes it a real surprise to the audience.
