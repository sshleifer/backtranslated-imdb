Fragglerock is excellent in the way Schindler's List was excellent. A great look for kids and adults of all generations. Big noses can be seen as a hint in the case of phallic symbols, in the same way that H.R. Puff N Stuff for famine smoked. Your kids will love this movie. I really enjoyed it as a child. My dad showed me this movie as a kid. He also enjoyed it and pointed out that the exaggerated noses were phallic symbols. Although I had no idea at the time about what it was. The movie is comedy and adventure. The storyline is wacky and cheerful. You and I will enjoy it together.
