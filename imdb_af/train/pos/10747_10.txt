GÃ©deon and Jules Naudet wanted to fire a documentary about New York City firefighters. What they got was the only film material in the World Trade Center on September 11. <br /> <br /> After working with James Hanlon's learning company, Jules went with the captain to inspect and repair a gas leak while God stayed. at the firehouse in the case of something interesting. An airplane flying low over the city diverted Jules, and he showed the camera, seconds before the plane crashed into Tower One. <br /> <br /> Jules asked the captain to follow him in the Towers. The first thing he saw was two people on fire, something he refused to film. He stayed on site for the next few hours, filming firefighters and others there. <br /> <br /> The Naudet brothers care about making the movie not too violent, grizzly and gory. But the firefighters' language is a bit rough, and CBS showed many balls that had it uncensored. The Naudet brothers mixed footage filmed them with one-on-one interviews so firefighters could explain their thoughts and emotions during specific moments of the crisis. <br /> <br /> Unlike a feature film, most of the money goes from DVD sales to 9/11 related charities. Well done, emotionally, moving, and completely without political propaganda, is the best documentary of that kind to date.
