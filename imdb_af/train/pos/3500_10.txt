This movie works because it feels so sincere. The story is simple and realistic, which perfectly captures the joys and anxieties of adolescent love and sexuality that most of us experienced during our teens. <br /> <br /> The actors are as natural as figures in a documentary, but are as convincing and as charismatic as seasoned artists. The dialogue is fresh and honest ... and fortunately it is not filled with the edge of a pop pop culture reference. The cinematography is also eager and beautiful, bringing the Lower East Side environment to life in a very tangible way. <br /> <br /> At artistic level, I love this movie because it reminds me of Italian neo-realm movies like The Bicycle Thief and La Strada. Movies rarely feel like "real" as it ... or if Bicycle thief did. And the only other film I've seen that deals with teen sexuality with the same level of seriousness is Elia Kazan's Splendor in the Grass. Author / director Peter Sollett deserves great praise. This movie is quite an achievement. <br /> <br /> On a personal level, I'm always happy to see a movie that covers members of ethnic America with love and respect. As an Italian-American, I hate the way my own people come into the theater (such as racist, women, criminal geniuses in annoying popular epics) and my aggravation on this score makes me acutely sensitive to other groups and their terrible silver screen. In particular, Hispanics and Asians seem cursed to play villains in Western and action flags. (Good thing Gong Li didn't try to get known in America!) <br /> <br /> Of course, thank you for the rise of indie photos, and the influence of Miramax, we still see some more photos ethnic characters here and there ... but increasing Victor Vargas is easily one of the best. While I really like My Big Fat Greek Wedding, it is a refreshing change that Raising Victor Vargas is playing straight (with less exaggerated and wide tractors) while still being very funny in his own right. Finally! Latino characters worthy of note. I have a feeling that this is a movie that will be remembered. <br /> <br /> Of course, now that he has made this wonderful picture of a family from the Dominican Republic, I hope Peter Sollett will come around for a film about the Italians soon! :) - Marc DiPaolo
