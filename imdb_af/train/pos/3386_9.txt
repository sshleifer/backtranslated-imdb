Is this the future that awaits us? An overcrowded, unforgiving desert with a hellish, unwanted existence? This movie is a problem we still bother, doubles, because the film was released in 1973. Let us hope that the world will not end this way. <br /> <br /> Soylent Green is a wild movie I really enjoyed. It has beloved characters, a semi-apocalyptic setting, a compelling and formidable story, and the macho-est-macho man out there: Charleton Heston. Richard Fleischer gave the movie a very unpleasant, dirty feeling. You are almost choked by the stench of the city and its dirty inhabitants. <br /> <br /> The characters are wonderful. Charleton Heston, who became one of my favorite actors, IS Thorn. The man created this role of a bad but sweet naughty man. I could definitely sit in Thorn's shoes. He sees that something is not right, but everyone around him does not listen anymore (no more paying to listen) or wants to kill him. Edward G. Robinson (in his last film, R.I.P.) plays the lovely old Sol, who had enough of this nasty place. Everyone else is wonderful, especially Leigh Taylor-Young as Shirl, a piece of furniture that is at the apartment she lives in. <br /> <br /> The special effects are fantastic, even for 1973. The Soylent Green factory, the futuristic apartments, and especially the "scoops" (bulldozers who get rid of people) were excellent. The polluted outside air looks disgusting and very dirty. The empty city streets filled with the deceitful people are very disturbing. <br /> <br /> One final note is the end, which still shocked me. It's cruel, but thinking about it is a good idea. <br /> <br /> The bottom line: <br /> <br /> An excellent 70's Science Fiction movie that reminds and leaves you feeling very uncomfortable.
