Shirley MacLaine in another custom-made role. As the single-mom aunt in a Chicago Chicago area in 1962, veteran-character actress gets a different job than a brave woman who will not allow any setbacks to defeat her spirit of success. The kids, a pre-teen boy and girl, are drawn to their gracious aunt Zoe, although the many magic and practical jokes of her are taught and applied at all wrong times, eventually they get out of school. <br /> <The plot is cleverly enveloped in the Cuban missile crisis, with all the social implications. Men build bomb shelters, people watch news shows that seem to be the only TV set, at a dinner, and a general fog of anxiety and fear in the air. However, when a "harmless" miracle is blown out of proportions, climate end times make the viewer good. Yes, Virginia, the sun will come up tomorrow! It is obviously a small budget production, it is still a lovely little movie, filled with the magic that Sunday experts were made. With some choice, "Oldies" thrown into an effective Sound Track, the whole family is sure to enjoy this one. ****
