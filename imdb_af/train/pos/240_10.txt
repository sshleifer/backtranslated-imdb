Fantastic movie. One to excite all 5 senses. Is not a true historical report and not all information should be taken as factual information. True Hollywood conventions used, such as a list and many attractive actors as the 'heroes', such as Naomi Watts (Julia Cook - Ned Kelly's lover), Heath Ledger (Ned) and Orlando Bloom (Joe Byrne - Ned's right hand ) and unattractive (sorry Geoffrey Rush) actors play the drunk and corrupt Victorian Police Force. It also creates a very unreliable love story in the mix between Ned (Ledger) and Julia Cook (Watts) to attract all the romantics, of which women are particularly vulnerable. Even from the first scene, when Ned drowns the fat youth of drowning and his father, he calls "sunshine" and has a "glint in his eye as he looks at me, his hand on my shoulder". It's very romantic and convinces viewers with Ned Kelly, the underdog. Besides, aren't all Aussies holding an underdog?
