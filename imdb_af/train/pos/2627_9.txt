Finally, Timon and Pumbaa in their own movie ... <br /> <br /> "The Lion King 1 1/2: Hakuna Matata" is a relentless new application of a classic story. What classic story, you ask? Why, "The Lion King" of course! <br /> <br /> Yes, if there's one thing that Disney never lacks, it's narcissism. <br /> <br /> But that doesn't mean it's not a good movie. It's basically the events of 'The Lion King' as told from Timon and Pumba's perspective. And that's why you have to know the story of 'The Lion King' wholeheartedly to see where they come from. <br /> <br /> Anyway, on one level I watched it and thought "Oh my god, it's so lame ..." and on another level I had a ball. Much of the humor is predictable. I mean, when Pumbaa makes two beds, a big one for himself and a small one for Timon, we all know in the first nanosecond that Timon is going to take the big one. But it doesn't stop being hilarious, what, IMO, is 'Hakuna Matata' in a nutshell. That's not what happens, that's how. <br /> <br /> And a warning: there are also some jokes. Seriously, did you expect anything else in a movie where Pumbaa takes the middle stage? But as fiery jokes go, it's especially good, and even the most particular expert needs to be satisfied. <br /> <br /> The returning voice talent is wonderful. I'm a little surprised that some of the actors were willing to return, with only two or three of them (if happy). Whoopi Goldberg is most welcome. <br /> <br /> The music is also wonderful. From 'Digga Tunnah' at the beginning of 'This is all I need', an adaptation of 'Warthog Rhapsody' (a song cut from 'The Lion King' and likely to be greatly improved in this incarnation), the music leaves me nothing to complain about whatsoever. <br /> <br /> In the end, Timon and Pumbaa are wonderful characters, and while it is argued that 'Hakuna Matata' is merely an excuse to see them in different fun and different compromise situations, so. It's hard to find characters you just want to spend time on. <br /> <br /> Am I sounding creepy? <br /> <br /> Anyway, "The Lion King 1 1/2" is great if you've seen too many times "The Lion King". Especially when you think, "Don't be stupid, there's nothing like seeing the Lion King too many times!"
