I enjoyed this movie much more than I expected to expect; From reading other comments here, I suspect it is very beneficial to be seen on a full screen in the theater, in the company of a cheerful and enthusiastic audience. I was fortunate to have that experience, which arose on the wrinkles of laughter from all over, and had a very good time with this unrelenting comedy. <br /> <br /> It is like a comedy that shines, if it doesn't seem to be. The music is nothing special - in fact, I didn't realize it * was * a musical, and was very surprised when the compound ancestors burst into half-talked lyrics - but I have to admit that the half-act, half promise of 'O, what I will do ... 'proved far more catchy than it ever seemed, because it still turns around in my head! <br /> <br /> The plot, as it is, revolves around the past history of the eponymous Francesca, a sixteenth-century portrait wearing a distinct anachronistic hairstyle and fur coat. Her idea of ​​the holiness of marriage does not quite coincide with that of her distant descendants, Countess Angelina, and one can almost hear the storyline on the seams under the pressure of the Production Code to ensure that the heroine unclaimed in her very delayed marriage bed with the right man ... <br /> <br /> The romance is hardly earth-spreading, and the first few scenes actually played very well straight, on the boring side. But where the text and film really come to life, is in the struggle of the generations that follow. The indignation of Douglas Fairbanks Jr.'s court replacement of Betty Grable's married Angelina is only characterized by Betty-Grable-as-Francesca's pursuit of him, which culminates in a complete roll-over in the hilarious fantasy sequence she literally wiping his feet It is probably the comic climax of the plot, although the effects of the colonel's understandable confusion with a smart touch in the remaining two "acts" of the operetta structure are worked out, and the spectacle of Fairbanks's happy, upset awakening is more <br /> <br /> Grable is quite convincing to establish her two contrasting characters. It is wise to get almost all the (limited) singing opportunities and share the honors where the circles of quotation dialogue in the different verbal duels. But in the field of unspoken reaction, she is really classified by her male supporting leaders. Fairbanks in particular is an absolute surprise in a number of wordless rows whose setup and humor are worthy of silence. <br /> <br /> This movie is too uneven in style to be a classic, changing sparkling repartee. to hackneyed tedium. But at best it is very funny indeed and has a round of spontaneous applause and laughter over the auditorium at the end when the lights go up. Over the course of his time, it has failed to draw contemporary audiences - but on this show it really did not deserve to be rejected by both Grable and Preminger, the (unreasonable) director. It's not a masterpiece, but a thoroughly entertaining minor job, and I grabbed my whole house in my mind.
