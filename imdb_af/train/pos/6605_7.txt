2054. Paris is an Escher drawing with people and vehicles emerging at various levels, in an obvious tribute to the Metropolis of Fritz Lang. Paris is both ultra-modern and crumbling in decline. And in the pinch of supervisors, a pretty young medical researcher is kidnapped just after she left her sister in a swallow nightclub. A hard police captain was investigating. Being sharply black and white, with the bleak corridors, shaded streets and single source lighting characteristic of the hardest boiled of film noir, comparisons with Sin City are inevitable. But the story owes more to Masamune Shirow and William Gibson than to Frank Miller. As high-tech observation, near-invisible stealth packages and relentless super corporations are so much part of the landscape as guns and cars. The movie never creates the damned atmosphere of Gibson's cyberpunk vision, with its technically heavy characters contrasted with industrial types of corporations who all have their own Ministry of Fear, but the viewer certainly gets the feeling that Paris's future is. no utopia and future science are less than goodwill. And as the police procedure plot line unfolds, we are taken in the dark statements of individual ambition under the shining veneer of Avalon Corporation's cultured PR image. The motion recording process used here makes a glance between B & W comic books and the next generation of rotoscope, and is either captivating or intrusive, depending on your taste. Nonetheless, there is a great visual sense on the screen, and future Paris is filled in to the small details, giving the picture a unique look that varies in both Spartan and Baroque turns. A look was made.
