It's not bad, but with Sanders, Barrie, Hale, Cowen, Hamilton, Gargan, Fitzgerald and even Willie Best, we can also be with Charlie Chan, Moto, the Falcon, Blackie, Holmes or the Saint. In other words, you get the chance to spend another hour in the company of some old friends, from plain to cross, murder and murder - always a pleasure in my book. <br /> <br /> Barrie is a hard-boiled lady to revenge and cleans her skeleton and dead father, a police detective, and plans to plan and execute a series of underworld murders with her coterie. What would have been the opposite effect! Sanders joins the fun by just dancing in the right club in the right place in the right city, with the right lighting falling on him as well as the first killer (at the right time!) And killing him. <Br /> <br /> The story and acting is OK, the only grip I have is near the end with the hasty and almost laughable discovery of the evil genius (Waldeman) - they almost forgot about his relevance in the plot? That said, a solid entry into the series.
