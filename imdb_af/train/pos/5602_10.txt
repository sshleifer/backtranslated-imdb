Roman Polanski plays Trelkovsky renting an apartment in France. The previous tenant is after a suicide attempt in a hospital. He will see her there where he also meets Stella (Isabelle Adjani), Simone's friend. He and Stella are getting pretty close. Later, Simone died. Trelkovsky starts thinking the landlord and the neighbors try to change him in Simone so that he can eventually jump out of the window. Lea Locataire (The Tenant) from 1976 is the last film of Polanski's apartment trilogy. The previous one was Repulsion and Rosemary's Baby. Roman Polanski does not only do good work, as the director but his play is also excellent. Isabelle Adjani with her big glasses is wonderful. The landlord, Monsieur Zy, is played by the great Melvyn Douglas. Jo Van Fleet plays Madame Dioz. The fantastic Shelley Winters is the Concierge. The tenant is something very scary from time to time. It gives a lot of that psychological scare. This movie is not the easiest to understand or explain. Make it so fascinating.
