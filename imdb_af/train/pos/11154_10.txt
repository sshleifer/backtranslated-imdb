It is, in my opinion, one of the greatest films ever made in America and it earns every prize it has won and it is on the AFI Top 100 list (although it is scarcely too low on the IMDB Top 250 list, on only 183 as of this writing). If you are of the highest caliber (Voight and Hoffman are an excellent match), well-drawn characteristics and ingenious direction, editing and filmmaking, you will love it just as much as I did. Schlesinger paints a vibrant, ever-credible picture of the late seventies New York City scene, and many victims are struggling to overcome personal demons and amid the amorality, poverty and hopelessness of 42nd Street, New York City . <br /> <br /> The movie techniques used here brilliantly absorb the feel of the underground New York movie movement (and of the city) and are nothing short of brilliant. I saw many ideas (including the quick fire editing, handling the voice-over flashbacks, the drug / travel order and the cartoon-oriented face in a murder scene to convey anxiety and terror) stolen by other filmmakers . <br /> <br /> The relationship between Joe and Ratso is handled in such a way that it is considered an extraordinarily strong friendship, or it is homosexual. I think the director has dealt with it in a subtle way not to talk about the censorship of times, but to concentrate his energy on the importance of a strong human connection in life, whether sexual or not no. <br /> <MIDNIGHT COWBOY is a brave, moving film of size, influence and importance that has lost nothing of its impact over the years. If you haven't seen it, you really miss a real American classic. I recommend this movie to everyone. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10.
