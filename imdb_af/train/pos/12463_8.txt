Nora is a single mother of two who still wants to live the life of a young artist in the 1970s, just like her friends, a group of writers, singers and actors. The "free love" philosophy is not entirely out of the system? and Nora didn't believe they fell in love, especially with a junkie. Hazlehurst has won her first two AFI awards over four years for her wonderful portrayal of Nora, who makes sure she does the right thing about her children, but at the same time falls in love with junkie Javo (Friels). Yarns ?? who would cost later in movies such as LOVE AND OTHER CASTLE AND STRANGE PLANET? was well cast as Nora's pre-pubescent daughter, and Caton (perhaps ready for his role as host for the 2000 HOT PROPERTY lifestyle program) appeared as a bearded painter. Early attempt by director Cameron is a winner; He continued to make the award-winning miniseries MY BROTHER JACK among his later projects. But this is the incredible delivery by Hazlehurst that brings the intelligent search engine up, based on Helen Garner's award-winning novel.
