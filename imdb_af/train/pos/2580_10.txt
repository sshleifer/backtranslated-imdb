I say the domino principle is a very undiluted movie. someone who took the time to investigate our current history of conspiracies; jfk, rfk, mlk, g.wallace and actually many others can only conclude that the writer of the domino principle really knew what he was talking about. How can he be, or he has a few. The conspiracy situation involving spies, big business and political murder is not really a fiction, but an ominous part of our intricate existential history. God helps us, but the domino principle is more than fantasy. If it causes a little sleep loss, it may need to be. Don't use my word for it. , examine yourself.
