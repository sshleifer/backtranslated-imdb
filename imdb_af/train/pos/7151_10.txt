I read Holes in the 5th grade, when I heard they did a movie, I was ecstatic! Of course, when I was my busy self, I didn't get the chance to see the movie in theaters. Holes was just outside town, but unfortunately we were just too busy. I was surprised to hear that all my friends saw it and none of them invited me! They all said it's good, but I read good books that made crappy movies, so I was definitely worried. <br /> <br /> Suddenly the perfect opportunity to see it. It was out that week and my parents went on a cruise and I was left after babysitting. My sister, who is 9, and I watched it and absolutely loved it! I then took it to the other people I was home to, and their children, 9 and 4, also liked it. Even my parents loved it and they are fine film critics. Overall, I recommend this movie is for anyone who understands family morality and loves a hilarious cast! This movie must be on your top 5 "list" !!
