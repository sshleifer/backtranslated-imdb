I watched this movie I was expecting: good sci-fi cowboy stuff. What really surprised me was that Kurt Russell did such a good job with a very limited role. Imagine trying to deal with these two limitations: you have scarce dialogue and because you're playing a hardass, military robot, you shouldn't show emotions with facial expressions! Howzat? Often you want to ask a diva to do a great aria while gagged and duct-taped. Despite being verbally and explicitly intrigued, Russell has an incredible characterization. His robot becomes man, despite the limitations. Great work! As usual, Jason Isaacs assures that he will go in history as a great portrayal of the complete villain - the one you liked and saw. Connie Nielsen was sweet, gentle, motherly and beautiful. I'm not sure how much of my impression is based on her acting and how much of her physical beauty, but it was difficult to take her eyes off her. Unfortunately, Gary Busey's role was too small and limited. <br /> <br /> Much of the plot is fairly standard, with a fair number of weaknesses, but as it does have a sci-fi comic book, I don't see what's wrong with some weaknesses . By the end of the story, the good guy wins, and the appreciative audience receives a lot of emotional satisfaction. Yes! <br /> <br /> The kind of feeb that Russell didn't do a good job of acting is the same kind of feeb that missed the whole point.
