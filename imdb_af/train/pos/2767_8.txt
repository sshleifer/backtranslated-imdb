Gregory Peck gives a brilliant performance in this movie. The last 15 minutes (or beyond) is wonderful and Peck is an absolute joy to watch. However, the same cannot be said for the rest of the film. It's not terrible and I'm sure it's made with good intentions, but the only real reason (if I was honest) to see it is Peck. For the rest, it is better to read the Old Testament only.
