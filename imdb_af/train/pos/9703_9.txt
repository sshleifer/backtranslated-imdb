One of the best comedy shows ever comes from Britain. Mark Gatiss, Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton are wonderful actors and artists who look at home with drama as they are with comedy. Perhaps supported by their writing partner Jeremy Dyson, they continued the series with the most memorable characters of the past year. Great Britain strikes in insignificance as a poor imitation of their ideas. Consistently original and groundbreaking. I'm sure so many people hate this series as a love for them, but I'm just as sure no one could have any opinion on LOG. I've seen the movie of the feature for a long time, but I've heard good things and bad things, so I'll judge the judgment. The original radio series from which LOG came was as innovative as the TV series became. I don't know if the TV series made it to the US, but I would be fascinated to see American audiences find the strange English language of humor
