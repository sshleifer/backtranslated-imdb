Twisted, bizarre, enchanting and hilarious! I couldn't stop laughing at watching this movie. Darren Stein presents the movies he made on the family video camera that grew up in Southern California in the 1980s. It's an interesting look at a budding movie maker and his motivation and ability to manipulate the camera. Manipulation is a strong word, but don't we all look at movies that have to be manipulated in some way? <br /> <br /> From the beginning, I was amused by the fact that the boys appeared in the movies when it seemed possible to look like hell. Later, Darren tells about his emerging homosexuality, and you can see it from the tips (great tips!) At an early age. Maybe it was just the hot southern California weather, who knows? As a gay man who also grew up in a caring environment, it's great to see his parents support and love him and that his friends were apparently behind the lens with his nascent talent. <br /> <br /> "Put the camera on me" looks back to the 80s untouched by commercialism. You will remember the hair, the music and the fashions. I'm the same age as Mr. Stein, so the journey back to memory lane was welcome. His solo lip synchronizing dance number is invaluable, enhanced by the Frankie Goes To Hollywood t-shirt. <br /> <br /> The movies deal with dark themes on time. Child abuse, the Holocaust, nuclear war, sexual fantasy and social dysfunction. No childhood is completely carefree, and the way Stein deals with these subjects is interesting to see the least and hilaries. <br /> <br /> Watch your earliest convenience!
