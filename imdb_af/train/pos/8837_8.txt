My personal feeling is that you can't separate this movie from its political / historical base as so many (American) judges tend to do. It's not about growing up on Main Street, USA. It's about growing up in Yugoslavia at a time when it was torn between the East and the West. Just like the guys between Esther and everyone else are torn, and Esther is torn between the "Tovarish Joe" and the guys. There is shame in some situations that are lost on an audience that has never lived under Tito. I feel the movie is underestimated and it's too bad that we've lost the director. Movies like this make freedom feel more important. It's not just another Eastern European comedy movie ... it's a sensitive portrayal of teens following a fine line that can eventually lead to true freedom.
