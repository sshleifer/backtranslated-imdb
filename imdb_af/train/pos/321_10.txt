I don't know how or why this movie has a meager rating on IMDb. This movie, accompanied by "I'm Curious: Blue" is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The only thing that will let you down in this movie is if you don't like the movie process, don't expect psychology or if you expect hard pornography. <br /> <br /> It's not a movie you'll want to watch to relax; It's a movie you want to see like any other masterpiece, with time, attention and care. <br /> <br /> ****** SUMMARY, MAY A SPOILER OR TWO ******* <br /> <br /> The main thing about this movie is that it mixes the whole movie, within a movie, but it does so so you sometimes forget that the fictions aren't really. <br /> <br /> The movie is like many movies in one: <br /> <br /> 1. A political documentary, about the social system in Sweden at that time. Which in many ways is still relevant to today. Interviewed by a young woman named Lena. <br /> <br /> 2. A story about a filmmaker, Vilgot Sjoman, makes a movie ... he's about a relationship with his star in the movie and how he never got involved with people he should not work. <br /> <br /> 3. The movie that makes Vilgot. It's about a young woman named Lena (IE # 2), who is young and very politically active, she makes a documentary (IE. # 1). She is also a lifetime and in her sexuality, and its freedom. <br /> <br /> The wonderful and sheer shine of "I'm Curious: Yellow / Blue" is how these three elements are cut together. At one moment you look at an interview about politics, and the next thing you look at what the interviewer is doing behind the scenes, but do it so well that you sometimes forget that it is the narrative. <br /> <br /> Another thing is the dynamics between "Yellow" and "Blue", which if you see one, you should see the other. "Blue" is not a successor at all. I will try to explain what I can best because I know that no other movie has done it, though it is a good technique. <br /> <br /> Think of "Yellow" as a living thing, real events in 14 scenes. A complete story. <br /> <br /> Think of "Blue" as all the things in between the 14 scenes in "Yellow" that you haven't seen, it's a complete story on its own. <br /> <br /> Essentially, they are parallel movies ... the same story, in two different ways. <br /> <br /> It was only when I saw the first 30 minutes of Blue that I fully understood. Yellow "<br /> <br /> I hope it was helpful for people who were discouraged by various influences, because this movie changed the way I watched film. <br /> <br /> Thanks for you time.
