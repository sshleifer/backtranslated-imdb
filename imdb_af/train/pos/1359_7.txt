I work in a library and expect to keep this movie when it came out 5 years ago. Well, I loved Parker Posey very much (she's a great actress) and Omar Townsend was really cute like her boyfriend (he can't act but if you look like he cares?) But the movie is bad. It wasn't funny or cute or much of anything. Posey kept the movie with her energy. But did she teach the Dewey Decimal system EVER night and then leave tons of books to the beat of music? ??? Come on! I also had a problem with the way she looked when she became a full-fledged librarian - hair in a bun, glasses, no sense of humor - can we please let the stereotype go? For Posey and Townsend it's worth seeing, but it's about it. The TV series was much better.
