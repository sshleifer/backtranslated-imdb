And a TV movie too, this movie was good. the acting in it and the plot was just as great. This one of the only movies I saw was thinking to me because I saw it because I was afraid of Reaper killing me through my computer screen. There were just a few little things wrong with this movie, but it is very easy to watch. <br /> <br /> Antonio Sabbato Jr. has an excellent role in this movie with Janine Turner and Robert Wagner. This movie has so much tension and it made me want more because I never thought a low-budget TV movie might be so powerful. After watching it, I read the novel on which this movie is based (four times) and it was also well kicked. If you ever see this movie come on TV, I'll see it. The effects in this movie were pretty well done, I honestly don't know what a living calcifying person would look like, but with the way the FX team did this movie, I was impressed and everything it shows is that these bad for TV movies were made. Outside with low budgets shouldn't suck so badly. <br /> <br /> watch it. It's really good, no, it's really!
