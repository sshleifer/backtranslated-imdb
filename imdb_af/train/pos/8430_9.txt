It's always nice to see Angela Bassett play a role in really sinking her teeth. She is sometimes intense, funny and even sexy in her role as Lena, a "colored" woman who was forced to make a house on a deserted mud bank just outside Cape Town, South Africa. Danny Glover is also good at a not quite sympathetic role as her partner, Bushman. Willie Jonah gives a fine nuanced performance as the stranger who discovers Boesman and Lena's new living space. It's not often you get a chance to see an intelligent movie dealing with adult themes. Although based on a play, later director John Berry (who also addressed Claudine) opened the material by having the movie in the widescreen Cinemascope format. He also keeps things interesting visually through the creative blocking of actors and by showing us things just mentioned in the drama. Like Diahann Carroll in Claudine, John Berry may have named Angela Bassett in an Oscar nomination. It's definitely a movie you're looking for.
