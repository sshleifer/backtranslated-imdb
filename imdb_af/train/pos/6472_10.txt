One of the best pieces of television drama of the past decade. During the five hours, perceptions and sympathy are constantly challenged, as they explore many facets of contemporary British society. David Morrisey is as usual brilliant. Initially it turns out to be a heavy-handed buyer in conflict with the heroine, but then it turns out to be intelligent and caring, as he works with her to discover the truth. I have never seen Surrane Jones. I believe she comes from the world of television soap. Her performance was wonderful, as she kept her humor and calm as she tried to balance the demands of the matter and the tension of her caring for her mother. I can go on and talk about every member of the cast that contributes to this wonderful drama, but their efforts would mean little without such an absorbing writing that constantly challenges your assumptions about any of the characters. These are programs like this that restore one's belief in television drama, while at the same time making it impossible to fill most rubbish.
