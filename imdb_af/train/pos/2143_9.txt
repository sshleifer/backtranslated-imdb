It's not the same as the other movies about dancing. A few ordinary people found themselves dancing. Unlike the dance films in Hollywood, the characters in this movie are not attractive or hot young people. They are someone you can see in your offices every day. They are a little depressed about their lives and finally find themselves and their dreams of dancing. It touches me very deeply.
