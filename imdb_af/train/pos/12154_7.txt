Yes, a tap dance horror thriller ........ with Shelley and Debbie! Goody Goody. It is demented and fun and part of the 60's guignol cycle leaked in the 70's. Released as a dual feature with the Burt Reynolds comedy FUZZ, these madmen are so frightened that it is very entertaining. Like a mix of DAY OF LOCUST, THE OTHER and BABY JANE, I suggest any prospective viewer accepts the idea that it is almost meant to be skewed and to sit with someone with whom you can scare and elbow. Actually getting drunk while watching it .... on cheap champagne. Again, with many 30-year-old movie ideas, it is also about disorder; the struggle of time for a better life that is bitter and distorted by emotional madness falling into murder. But this one is just crazy. It also reminds me a lot of BLOODY MAMA to the De Niro - Winters shlock party that looks this movie positively glorious.
