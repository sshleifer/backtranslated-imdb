I was also in the movie, but I don't know if they work this scene. On our way back from a school trip (in 2005) we stopped at a service station while they did the movie, and we were asked (we all) to jump in and scream! Free Bird! We were about 10 years old, can tell anyone who saw the movie, whether that part was actually held in the movie, it would be good to know! I remember thinking the movie never came out because it was two and a half years before it was released. All your comments seem to be good, so I guess it's quite a successful movie, I can buy it, but first I want to know if I'm in it! : D Thank you
