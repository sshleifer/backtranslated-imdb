A movie should be seen with great dialogues, good music, great acting and a beautiful atmosphere. <br /> <br /> In the film, 8 people are following in the city of Antwerp for one day. They are all individuals and sometimes weird (that's how I love them!). <br /> <br /> I'm not going to say anything else, just go and see and enjoy it.
