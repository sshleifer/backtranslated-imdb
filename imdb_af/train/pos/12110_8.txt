For those of you who think anime, just think about giant reptiles raping schoolgirls again. There is a totally different side to Japanese animation. Yakitate! Japan is one of those shows. It's a lovely story of a young boy with the gift of making bread. His universe is about creating a Japanese bread that can match the well-known European bread. The show is as slender as they come and I'm sure non-Japanese viewer will miss many of the jokes. But it's still very nice to watch because of the full innocent atmosphere of the show. <br /> <br /> In the world of Yakitate! It is not uncommon for people to appear to have had an orgasm after eating bread. The bread is hallucinating and can give the consumer a wide variety of superpowers, from spending time to swimming like a fish. The odd aspect makes it one of the least predictable and funniest shows I've been watching for a while.
