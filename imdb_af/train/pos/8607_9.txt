Never understood why the MacDonald-Eddy swan song was always so ruthlessly baked - not just by their opponents, but by almost everyone. For me, "I married an angel" is more lively and imaginative than any of the duo's more celebrated outings. The sets and costumes are as lazy as any one found in a MGM musical. The script is by trusted Anita Loos ("The San Francisco," The Women, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, etc.), The Rodgers and Heart songs (although a little changed by MacDonald-Eddy chiefs Bob Wright and Chet Forrest ) is handled by Hebert Stothart (Oscar Winner of "The Wizard of Oz"). And best of all, the song loves in their contemporary clothes and apparently have fun with the bizarre proceedings. Try to show "Rose Marie" or "Sweethearts" to the unknown today, and they will be very difficult to keep quiet, but have to entertain this fantastic, fast-paced fantasy.
