It was a typical Grade B movie in the 1940s Hollywood and yet it went a long way. Why? It has a wonderful plot and is by Nina Foch, George MacReady and Dame May Witty, like a female villain, of all people. When a young woman answers an ad for a secretary, she definitely gets more than what she has negotiated. The only talent her employers seek is those that will lead to her downfall. Looks like Witty and MacReady want to accompany her as their daughter-in-law and wife respectively. MacReady killed his real wife and also wants to do Foch so well that a body can be claimed. <br /> <br /> The film is about how Foch is trying to get townspeople to believe her and how it is practiced in practice. everything she does. Why don't people believe her?
