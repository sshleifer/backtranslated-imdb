"Men of Honor" - true story of a proud and sustained black naval diver (fabulous Cuba Gooding Jr.) is definitely a good movie that both touches and entertaines and is part of the absolute cream of the new millennium theater . Wonderful acting is the main reason for making this movie a truly special and enjoyable, wonderful experience. Charismatic Robert De Niro is wonderful as a rough, fiery and unrelenting head, Billy Sunday role is practically written to him. This movie with a fantastic "15 Minutes" (2001) is two of the latest evidence that he is still one of the best players of our time. On the other hand, "Men of Honor" includes a good performance by Cuba Gooding Jr., who has been since the youngest young black actors since "Boyz n the hood". "Men of Honor" go straight into the company of "Jerry Maguire", "So good as it gets" and "Instinct". Cuba Gooding Jr. is a skilled and fantastic actor and I am willing to get much more fantastic movies from him. "Men of Honor" also have an excellent storyline and probably the most exciting dive series of film history. It's a fantastic, fascinating movie and I can only recommend it.
