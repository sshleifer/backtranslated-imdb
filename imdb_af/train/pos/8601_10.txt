My observations: Vamp outfit at the end is wonderful and wonderful, exotic and fantastic. Jeanette behaved well and even had naive Nelson. Boat crashing into his balcony put him right. Costume outfits from his female mafia are surprisingly well designed, especially according to today's standards. 1942 costume designer did good work. Main song theme just beautiful. <br /> <br /> Note negative posters: 1942 was time of WWII; Pearl Harbor happened the previous year. USA just comes from Great Depression; needed to reach out and spend that hard earned money on the distraction of singing, dancing and yes, fantastic fantasy. Despotic dictators have tried to rule in RL, sniffing freedoms. Thanks, the public had this fantastic plot line movie to attend. Going movie was a privileged surprise, in those depressing times. When you become negative posters, actors or even movie stars, you have room to speak and criticize. Jeanette and Nelson's movies are the test of time. <br /> <br /> Angel wings wonderful, right angel. RL wings at costume party are not so hot, but big on Jeanette considering the SL. <br /> <br /> Beautiful song by Jeanette and Nelson, as always. Jeanette dance was a pure delight. <br /> <br /> 15/10
