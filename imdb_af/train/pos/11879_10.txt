This is one of my all-time favorites. <br /> <br /> If the movie has a mistake, it's like an angry bull. It does not affect the viewer so much to attack him. '' Scarface '' is as fiery and unmoving a production as Tony Montana himself. Nothing is left to the viewer's imagination. <br /> <br /> Moroder's smart tin doll fits the action on a tea. Like the chorus in a Greek tragedy, it sneaks and gnashes, pants and tugs, a constant reminder of Tony's relentless fate. <br /> <br /> Not so much a story of caution as a disaster in progress, "Scarface" rips across the screen with the unstoppable power of a runaway train.
