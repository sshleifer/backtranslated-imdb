As an otaku since Robotech's days, I can still say that Gunbuster is one of my favorite animations of all time. Considering when it's made, the animation is of outstanding quality. There are no loops and rows in which art reduces quality. Although the final episode is in black and white, it doesn't spoil the enjoyment of watching the movie. Although described as "juicy", it should be borne in mind that women do not respond in the same way as men. Since the main character is a woman, it should be obvious that she should not necessarily use the "macho man" tactic to gain the respect of her peers. The seiryuu for Noriko also plays akane in Ranma 1/2. Noriko can be a 3-dimensional cartoon; her personality captures the essence of a passionate girl who first seems to be completely helpless, but eventually succeeds in the power of her will. The only complaint I have is that the mecha looks a bit like teddy bears. Even the Gunbuster uses a rather dubious "Homing Laser" and "Buster Shield" (it's nothing more than making the machine a huge velvety cloak to have it in true Dracula style). I doubt the scene was funny, but it crashed me. Still, I would arrange Gunbuster in the top 20 anime of all time.
