The legend of Zu, as I saw it, was a very interesting story. I think many of the people who didn't like it didn't see the underlying mythology behind the film. They expected them to be similar to Star Wars, and it wasn't. Joseph Campbell, I believe, would like this movie. There were a number of metaphors and hidden meanings that an average viewer might have overlooked. We all have a mountain of swords in us. We must all enter our own cave in our lives. One day we have to face our own insomnia. Granted some of the story was a bit confusing, and some of the action sometimes had a little hokey, but I think other parts of the movie made it easy. I'll see it again. <br /> <br /> I don't know if there is a difference between The Legend of Zu (which I saw in Mandarin with English subtitles) and Zu Warriors (The Baptized US version.) It might have plunged into American be. audiences, who really would detract from this movie.
