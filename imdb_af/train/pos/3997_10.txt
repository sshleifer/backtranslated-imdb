What a moving movie. I have a dearest friend who is in her sixties and over the past 15 years told me that people don't see her anymore and she longs for company. Being in my late 40s, I start to see what she complained about. You are no longer youthful, beautiful or adaptable. When May says "... this bud of a body ..." wow. How our bodies change and how we tell them is no longer beautiful. I love when she starts to change what she's wearing ... the colorful scarf ... no longer the frumpy woman. <br /> <br /> It's a sad and wonderful picture at the same time. Sadness in that May betrays her daughter's trust ... beautifully by finding herself through the trouble of the matter and choosing to continue and eventually have her own life. I love the character's risk of even starting the love affair. <br /> <br /> Usually, I like the movie, because ultimately it's a picture that shows the intricate nature of relationships, whether it's family or not. We see Paula's vulnerability, but she'll have everything she wants ... (when she tells her mother she'll have a baby for Darren, whether he wants it or not, after her mother asks if Darren even has a child want). The movie hits the point of how relationships can change, and reveals what has been long ago, dormant. May stimulated her own creativity to set up a family. A family she didn't really want, but was "something you just did when she was young". I love the scene when Darren calls her an old tart, and she smiles and says, "I was never mentioned before." It really was a jewel of a movie. <br /> <br /> And Daniel Craig. Well, I just love him. I was pleasantly surprised. He's not just looking good, he's a real talent. What a neat role. He is much more than any 007 sure and I look forward to seeing him in more roles of this nature. The scene where he is amusing, and the look he gives her, is a bit of a wonder that he has so much control over this woman, and also a pleasure to give it to her. He really enjoys her enjoyment. A wonderful scene. The contrast is the love picture with Bruce. Bruce is completely absorbed with his own pleasure ... two completely different men. <br /> <br /> Oh, I wonder where's my Darren?
