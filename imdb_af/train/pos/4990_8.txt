As other reviewers have noted, this is an unfairly neglected Depression era film. Directed by Frank Borzage (two Oscars) and written by Jo Swerling (Let her go to Heaven, Western, Lifeboat, etc.), this is a difficult, well-structured and realized move over the residents of a New York City shantytown . They are lovers, beggars and women who are forced into prostitution, but they are a community of people who are good and bad, with loyalty as complicated as any group says. <br /> <br /> Perhaps primarily under this film's many admirable features is the contrast between Spencer Tracy's character, Bill, and Loretta Young's Trina. He is stubborn, physically aggressive, and apparently fearless - but Bill is not the character that this film gives his stupid sense of survival. While blustering, Trina actually hangs tough (if the term can be applied to a character so ugly). Her dedication to him is obvious and complete. When she gets pregnant, she says she'll contract herself if he wants to get away, or "I'll even stop the kid if you just want to be happy." So is the dignity of Loretta Young's performance (at the age of 20) as a very simple character, that she does not look weak or dependent, but rather a woman who recognizes happiness when she finds it and wants nothing more .
