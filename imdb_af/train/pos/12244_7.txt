As winter approaches, our state-owned broadcaster, the ABC, has for some reason decided to have a partial Jane Austen festival on Sunday evenings. It started with a twelve-year film length version of Emma last Sunday; more recent versions of three other novels, "Persuasion", "Northanger Abbey" and "Mansfield Park" come. <br /> <br /> The curious version of this production by A & E Television Networks, trusted Andrew Davies, is that it has appeared almost simultaneously with two much larger budget versions, one with Gwyneth Paltrow and Clueless, a modernized version. with Alicia Silverstone, who transported the plot to Beverly Hills. Perhaps as a result, even with Kate Beckinsale in the lead, this production sank without trace. <br /> <br /> As a general rule, much is lost when novels are shrunk to fit movie length. The adjustments one tends to enjoy and remember are those that have enough space to develop both story and characters. An excellent example is "Brideshead Revisited" which had an episode of 13 50 minutes in 1982. Just compare the very ordinary movie length version of "Pride and Prejudice" in 2005 to the brilliant 1995 six-TV mini series. It's not that a novel should be filmed per page, and some novels (often not very good) fit great to film ("Reconciliation" is a recent example), but novels of the Jane Austen type have time and space to exercise their full charm. <br /> <br /> Given the shortcomings of this type of adjustment, this production is right. Kate Beckinsale gives Emma the right mix of self-confidence and vulnerability, and Mark Strong is a righteous man. Knightly (he reminded me that Jane was inclined to retrieve characters. Knightly is a more articulate version of the moody Darcy of P & P). Samantha Morton was a pretty quiet Harriet, but did Prunella Scales have the blabbermouth Miss Bates perfect? Sybil Fawlty at speed. Bernard Hepton as Emma's poor father was also excellent. We saw the damp countryside, the mud and the poverty as well as the beautiful interiors, if anyone thought it was a particularly idyllic age for everyone. <br /> <br /> Although it was a shortened adjustment, was it strangely slow in places ?? some of the conversations were rather stylized, even for the formalities of the times. I'll probably have to watch the movie again, but it may be due to the interruption of reaction shots. <br /> <br /> If you like filmed periods, this is a great example and compares well to the Paltrow version. Anyway, there's more to come!
