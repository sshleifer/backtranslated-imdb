Three scumbags get their deserts only after they have wasted their lives in greed, drugs, ego and bad attitudes. Interesting and well done; This style of film always makes me wonder where reality leaves and imagination takes over. Although these people were the abyss of the earth, I was still privileged. They never really stood a lot of chance.
