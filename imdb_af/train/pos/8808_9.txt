First, I must give it to the people who have this thing together. 9/11 is such a sensitive issue that creating a movie that dares to be controversial, it takes a lot of bother. It is a pity, although not surprising, that the movie is banned in the US. <br /> <br /> It's said I think the movie is great with a few weak moments. The film begins with the Iranian segment, which seems to be somewhat reminiscent of Majid Majidi's work (the absolutely beautiful "heavenly children" and "the color of paradise"). Like these 2 films, the clip shows the innocent eyes of a class Afgan refugee in Iran. Absolutely beautiful clip. The same goes for Sean Penn's excellent clip. But just as some of the tracks are beautiful, others are absolutely brutal. Alejandro Gonzáles Iñárritu does the Mexican clip and just like his gut-wrenching "Amores Perros" makes him as cruel as he can. Most of the clip is a black screen with several sounds playing in the background. The noises are from the reporters and their shock as the second plane crashes, those who called home at the burning towers and left messages for their families, those who were angry ... and he combines it with flashes of people from the towers jump. . A very hard clip to watch and one that you won't forget. <br /> <br /> Some cuts may seem very difficult to watch for Americans, as some of the tracks can be interpreted as "you're not the only one suffering". In particular, the Egyptian and British cuts not only say it, but turn the tables and say how much suffering the US caused to other people. <br /> <br /> I will also make a special mention of the cuts from Bosnia-Herzegovina, France, India and Japan (although this latter may seem terribly inappropriate, it really isn't). <br /> <br /> But not all the cuts are good and I make a special mention on the clip from Israel, which in my opinion is extremely poor. While the idea was good (a reporter is on the scene of a terrorist attack in Tel Aviv, but his story is being stalled because of what happened in New York, something many of us are in countries in the war living, relating to) the realization is terrible. The clip ends up as just an entertainment reporter trying to get some airtime, a man who says he is a witness and hopes he can go on TV, and soldiers and paramedics just shouting "because". The clip fails to capture any of the drama of such a situation. <br /> <br /> If you get the chance to see it, you should do it unless you're a conservative, in which case you'd stay out as you might be offended. But if you are not, you can learn how many of us lived outside the US by 9/11.
