Soap Opera about a small town married woman (Kay Francis) who works at the local kiosk, plays as a leading lady in her local playhouse, but dreams of becoming a star on Broadway. When a well-known actor who has a ham, a wagon and a finger to boot into the village, she visits him in his room with dreams from him giving her tips to the stars - he pretends to be a fall his manager is cheating her, she has everything it needs, but "experience" to become a big star. Her husband found the man dead and pushed the result of the unexpected death of the actor. This leads to a murder trial and even more unexpected: a lifelong prison sentence for hubby. Next thing you know she joined a Burlesque show in the hope of someday making it to Broadway and making enough money to get her husband's freedom. All the time her baby was sleeping in a suitcase! <br /> <br /> This movie has a pretty interesting plot, but maybe a little conquered, but very melodramatic (with tons of melodramatic music to make sure you get it) - all * strong * enhanced by the Strong, emotional performance by Kay Francis - she just made this movie. Here too, the good things that Minna Gombell plays in her role as a "close to forty" older lady who works the burlesque and Kay befriends. Mostly watch, especially for Kay Francis fans.
