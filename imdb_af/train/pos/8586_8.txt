Welcome back Kiefer Sutherland. It was too long since you appeared in a movie. And what a movie it was, it was 24 no, but very interesting, especially with a forerunner like Michael Douglas in the lead as the mysterious service agent. Kiefer's character is the one that Michael Douglas chases the whole movie, "Kiefer's partner," is Eva Longoria, the Desperate housewife. wow she can actually act except flirt all day and look good ,, i wish Kim Bassinger had a bigger role, but otherwise, i really think the whole movie was a blast from start to finish. This movie is what I consider a political excitement, everyone has played their part. There's nothing like this in the movie, to guess at all times. and I really think that Kiefer had a lot of work here in this movie, but I think Michael Douglas had the performances of the day, 'thumbs up'.
