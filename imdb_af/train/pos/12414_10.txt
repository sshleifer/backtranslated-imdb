Renny Harlin's first American film was one of the best of a series of prison-based horror movies in the late 80's (such as "Death House" or "The Chair"). Lane Smith wrongly executed a convicted man. Now he is the head of the newly-opened jail, and the man's ghost is back for bloody revenge. This atmospheric and very moody film has many horrific gore and violence. Viggo Mortensen, Tiny Lister, Tom Everett and Kane Hodder are on hand for the entertaining massacre.
