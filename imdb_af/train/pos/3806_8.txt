This movie drove me away for a few moments, I just loved it! <br /> <br /> I admit that the character dialog and storyline could be a bit better, but hey, it's just a simple (short) story of some guys trying to kill a dragon. There is nothing left. <br /> <br /> The overall design, atmosphere, beautiful landscapes ... it's all just magic! <br /> <br /> They've put a lot of love into this movie. Character designs were great and funny. A little Tim Burton-ish if you like. I can recommend this movie to anyone interested in a good design, displayed in a simple, small but fun story.
