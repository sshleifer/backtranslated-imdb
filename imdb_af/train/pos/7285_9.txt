This movie got me scared when I was just a kid. It's not Citizen Kane, but it has moments. The poor ripping scene is good. The plot is good, even if the characters are - can do something with the acting. Put some top names in the roles and then see what you get. It was one of those shooters, modifying (which was little there) and spreading kind of films over a few months. This is classic low budget sci-fi and just deserves it. I rated it a 9-based other movie of this genre and age.
