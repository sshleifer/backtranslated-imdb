A masterful treat of James Caine's "The Postman Always Rings Twice" as Luchino Visconti's first film shot mainly around Ferrara in an ominous, torn Italy. The original negative was thought to be destroyed, but Visconti rescued and fortunately we can see this early neo-realistic work today. A generous, handsome Massimo Girotti and Clara Calamai (who recently unveiled her breasts in La Cena delle beffe) (1941) died as the sensual-charged and weak love killing the man's death. Unusual end in which, although crime does not pay, one pays in a way that is not directly related to the crime. Excellent direction, essay, play and cinematography. Reporting is not as good as the French Le Dernier tournament (1939), but probably better than the American version) with Lana Turner and John Garfield in the lead. Highly recommended.
