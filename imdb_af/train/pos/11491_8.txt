The Unborn is a very, very different film. James Karen & Brooke Adams are in the movie and they did pretty well. this film is solid build up and it keeps you going. Although I think you should be a horror fan to see it because of the screens and the plot. There is one short sex scene without nudity that could be left out and for some people this scene may disappoint someone like Me in the movie and think things are ruining a good movie, but that's what it is. There's a scene where Adams's character goes nuts and kills a cat, but you can't really tell it. The music is very different, but very good. The unborn in my opinion is a very rude film that is wonderfully unpredictable and it is quite strange! I recommend all horror fans to this movie!
