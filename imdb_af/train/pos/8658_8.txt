It's a road movie, with a murderer on board. Brian Kessler (David Duchovny), a sophisticated local writer, wants to do field research on American serial killers. But he or his girlfriend, Carrie (Michelle Forbes), does not have the money for a round trip tour, so they advertise someone to share travel expenses. Whoever ends up is a young couple, Early Grayce (Brad Pitt) and his girlfriend, Adele (Juliette Lewis), two better examples of a poor white trash that you will never find in all theater. <br /> <br /> Indeed, Early and Adele are what make this movie so entertaining, as they chatter, cackle, confide, muse, speculate, drool and behave differently in ways I haven't seen since the rest of the Beverly Hillbillies. Early California's idea: "People think out there faster, because of all the hot weather, cold weather makes people dumb." It's enough to convince Adele: "I think it explains why there are so many stupid people here." To which early responds proudly: "It sure does." Early Adele stays on California: "You never have to buy fruit because it's all on the trees ... and they have no speed limits, and I hear your first month's rent is free, constitutional law" <br /> <br /> But early in the early days, some have mental problems, which are becoming increasingly obvious to Brian and Carrie, as the four travelers are traveling across the US. As they enter the desert southwest, with its beautiful rocky landscape, "California" begins to look more and more like "The Hitcher" (1986), and early more and more like John Ryder, everyone's manic hitchhiker, whose terror is so unstoppable was. <br /> <br /> In "California", the acting is uneven. Duchovny's performance is flat. Brad Pitt is surprisingly effective, despite his excessive impact. Michelle Forbes is great as the avant-garde, photographic artist. But my choice for the best performance goes to Juliette Lewis. With her nasal voice and heavy southern accent, she is stunning, like the naive, highly animated, childlike Adele. <br /> <br /> By the end, the movie takes a Twilight Zone on it, as our travelers enter a Nevada core test spot with a dilapidated old mannequin home. Rather, the plot was disgusting to unnecessary and turbulent violence, an end that was somewhat disappointing. <br /> <br /> Overall "California" is an entertaining movie, thanks to a clever concept, wonderful scenery, especially in the second half, good cinematography, great dialogue, and great performances by Juliette Lewis.
