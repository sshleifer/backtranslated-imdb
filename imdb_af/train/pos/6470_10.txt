This is one of the all-time great "Our Gang" shorts. Spanky is by his very cutest and funniest, and the babies he gets are remnant after babysitting. Tiny Spanky is forced by the gang to watch all their little brothers and sisters. The opening shot of all of them in baby babies, entertained by various things hung at the gang of fishing poles, is a beautiful gag. <br /> <br /> Spanky's appearance carries his big toy knife when asked to babysit by the older fellows is invaluable, just as she replies: "Hey, where do you get that stuff - I don't care for babies! " The little fellow says "remarkably" throughout the film, all the beautiful facials, and Spanky tells the babies "all about Tarzan" to make this one of the best "Our Gang" you will ever see.
