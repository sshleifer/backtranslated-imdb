This movie is great. If you take it too seriously, you will of course hate it; However, this is the amount of "dudes" and "rights we" bring to laughter and dull memories of about 15 years ago. I like his ability to expose me to the obvious jokes and clumsiness, and his ability to show me wants to see his forerunner, Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, (1989). If you are looking for a movie full of jokes, and completely mature humor, don't look; However, if you want a movie that is humorous and stupid, yet intelligent and engaging, you'll enjoy it. Actually, I wish more of this kind of photo that appeared in today's theaters. And hey, this is Keanu Reeves who fixes the way everyone is acting as a acting act ... doesn't get much better than that :)
