Of all the football movies I watched, this is one of the 2 best. The other is chorus height. But Hero is about the biggest World Cup ever and therefore probably also the biggest player ever to play in a World Cup, Diego Maradona. This story is mainly centered around him, but also revolves around the other giants of the game right now. <br /> <br /> The musical score is tempting and the images are powerful. The narrative by Michael Caine is appropriately biased and also calmly dramatic. This story is not about the individual games of the World Cup; rather, it is about the emotions of the players and the beauty of the event itself. <br /> <br /> Exciting games like France to Brazil (one of the biggest games of all time) are covered in the same action. The final Argentina-W Germany was also in the same year. highly recommended. A classic world football. To be watched over and over, especially if you are a Maradona fan.
