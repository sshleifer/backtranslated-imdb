When I first watched this anime, I never thought anything about bread making could actually be interesting, but thankfully I was wrong. From the moment I started watching it, Anime just went into the world of bread making. I was addicted. <br /> <br /> The greatest advantage of this anime is its humor, which is very intelligent and very funny, with some repetitive gags. But the animation, soundtrack and character development are below average, while these disadvantages are not seen so much in the first episodes, because of the great work on this anime, it is really shown in the last 20 episodes when the responses and repetitive gags become just old and not as funny as before. <br /> <br /> As far as I am concerned, this anime would have ended with episode 52, I would have given it a 9, but the last episodes just left a bitter aftertaste, which unfortunately did not get rid of by the immense 50 episodes can be. <br /> <br /> 7/10
