This is the magnum opus of the Swedish king of shit, Mats-Helge Olsson. Seldsaam has been made a movie of this size in Sweden and it is actually one of the most wonderful achievements in the Swedish film to date. Who pays for these things? <br /> <br /> The Russian nuclear scientist Markov wants to refuse to Sweden. But his plans were destroyed by the Russian military kidnapping him and telling him he had arrived in Sweden. This trick is their way of seeing Markov continue his work in nuclear physics that will revive the energy supply for the whole planet. However, the CIA is bent on getting Markov to the west and sending their ninja to free him. <br /> <br /> The practice of Swedish actors speaking English is something that Mats-Helge has perfected in his later works. The cheap b-movie it creates is probably unmatched for performance. But besides this? Well, the action is standard direct-to-video style. Machine guns that smoke big clouds. Thousands of Russians die. People walking around in black ninja packs, trying to hide in the snow. <br /> <br /> However, what is really striking is the poor poor way of fighting the fighting tones. When they say "Ninja" in the title I expect of martial arts, I expect near fighting. But there may be two or three scenes of real martial arts in this movie. And they are hilarious. It's so bad I didn't have the words to describe it. As the ninja moves slower, they will stop heartily. And of course, the whole movie ends in a button that contains a special effect budget consisting of four foods and a McDonald's voucher. <br /> <br /> So, what's the verdict? Kits classic of course. Never before has a movie been made that is supposed to be consumed with large amounts of alcohol. This is the ultimate party movie. Add in the video and laugh. You just have to realize that movies like this are no longer made. This is film history. <br /> <br /> The score is therefore 8/10 for entertainment, 1/10 for quality and 10/10 for accent.
