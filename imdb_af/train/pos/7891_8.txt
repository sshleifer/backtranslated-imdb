Now all the kids and teens of Springwood, Ohio, all dead, expect one teenager (Shon Greenblatt) to live. Freddy (Robert Englund) leaves him and the teenager doesn't have much memory when he arrives in a new town. When a tough female psychologist (Lisa Zane) tries to break the new patient. She finds out where he comes from. She brought him to Springwood to spark some memories, but three teenagers (Lezlie Deane, Breckin Meyer and Ricky Dean Logan), who came unexpectedly for the ride. Once they arrived in Springwood, the psychologist had some reminder that she had previously lived as a child in that village. While Freddy knows the true secret of her true identity. <br /> <br /> Directed by Rachel Talalay (Ghost in the Machine, Tank Girl) made a grim but somewhat oddly different sequel with some visual style and funny moments for this horror / fantasy / thriller. Yaphet Kotto (Alien) has a supporting role as a psychologist on dreams. It has some ingenious visual effects (Not everyone will love the climax, especially in 3-D) and good storytelling style. DVD has a strong anamorphic widescreen (1.85: 1) transmission (also in Pan & Scan) and a strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround sound. DVD has the original theater trailer, Jump to a nightmare opinion and Cast & Crew information. The "Elm Street" Series Box Set, the eighth disc has interviewed the cast & crew of this sixth movie. The sixth film is also in 3-D for the movie climax, but you can also watch it at 2-D. This is the last of the Elm Street movies until West Craven Freddy resurrected in a different, darker style in the "New Nightmare", and the silly but surprisingly enjoyable spin motion movie "Freddy Vs Jason". Look for Robert Shaye (co-owner and co-CEO of New Line Cinema), Roseanne Barr, Tom Arnold, Johnny Depp and Alice Cooper in amusing cameos. Written by Michael De Luca (John Carpenter's In the Mouth of Madness). From a story by the director. (*** Â½ / *****).
