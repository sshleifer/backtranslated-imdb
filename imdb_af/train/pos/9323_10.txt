For me, this movie was powerful. I don't want to be a forerunner, but I had a friend years ago; We were like brothers. This movie brought back some bright memories. <br /> <br /> For some reason I couldn't vote for this movie. I got a message like "No votes have been placed ..." And yet I saw in the statistics that there was. Will try again tomorrow (Monday). <br /> <br /> Minor mistakes I overlooked. These were the relationships between the characters who got me. Beautifully executed and real-life situations. I was in some of them. <br /> <br /> A little jewel of a movie. Just like "Spring Forward" is another overlooked gem. I'm very happy to watch movies as it is still made; about relationships between people, well-written, sensitively unfolded with first-class acting and direction. After all, it's not what it's about?
