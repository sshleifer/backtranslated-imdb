Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron is an overall wonderful movie. Mixing animation types is unique, the storyline is great, and the music is great. <br /> <br /> The drawn animation is a special thing about many animations. How they expressed the characters, especially the horses, by their animation is particularly spectacular. While the way in which horses communicate through body language is easy to understand, many young children and people who have not studied horses can understand. Without words, I would think it would be challenging to express them through the features. That is why I understand the "eyebrow" they have added to the horses (while real horses do not have such thick lines). One of the few things I noticed about horse habits that may have been strangely portrayed is that Spirit leads his mother's flock. In wild herds, the main stallions usually chase the young boyfriends. <br /> <br /> Also, while some may think the white army officers portray as the "bad guys," stereotyping, think of all the movies depicted in Native Americans as such. Sometimes then; They treated very poorly. For example, in true history, the Appaloosa race is almost wiped out by the army officers. Imagine what would happen to one of the world's best-loved ryrasse if the Native Americans did not save them. <br /> <br /> I think it's great how realism wasn't pulled down by talking the horses to each other. . Spirit's feelings are expressed by a little narrative, but mostly by music (by Bryan Adams). The songs speak the story very well, and Hans Zimmer and Bryan Adams told the story through melodies and lyrics. <br /> <br /> The emotion I got when I watched the movie, either the first or the twentieth (Yes, I watched so much), you won't believe. Some of the screens take your breath away, while others force tears into your eyes. The opening sequence, which shows Spirit's homeland, immediately makes you right in the spectacular action. <br /> <br /> I don't understand why some people are so hateful about this brilliant movie. Overall, I rate it a 10/10 - a must watch.
