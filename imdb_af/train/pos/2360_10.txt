Feeling it was very balanced to show what Jehovah's Witnesses did in protecting American freedoms. It also showed the strong faith of two families who were the first generation of witnesses. I also appreciated how it turned out to be a Jehovah's Witness, becoming non-testimony family members and how difficult it is for them to assume they are not celebrating holidays. The sad part is that non-witness families do not think about family testimonies for family meals / visits or give them gifts at any other time, but for holidays or birthdays. As far as medical care is concerned, the witnesses want a high standard of medical care, and what people forget is that blood transfusions provide messy medical care and operations, while bloodless treatments cause the medical team to be highly educated and trained. to treat your loved ones? I recommend this video!
