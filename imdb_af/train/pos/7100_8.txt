I saw his film in Dallas, Texas when it came out in 1986. I remember giving out prizes to see the movie. After watching the movie, I can see why. The movie wasn't bad, and it wasn't nice either. The problem with this movie was that it was trying to tell a side story. They created a new story, new characters and tried to pack it for the Master's Saga. My biggest complaint is that the plot is about a second wave of Robotech masters attacking the Earth. They even used the same scenes of the Master's Saga, but with different dialogues. As a child I loved the movie. But unfortunately I didn't see it as an adult and can't give a better review. Looking back, I was disappointed, but now I would like to see the movie and reconsider my attitude. If that is said, would someone please release this movie to the whole world for judgment? I love Robotech and can't wait for The Shadows Chronicles.
