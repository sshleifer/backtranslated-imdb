Four teenage girls in a suburb of Los Angeles have all sorts of problems: parties, drugs, police, mixed parents, older boyfriends. Jodie Foster, kind of the mother-chicken of the pack, tries to keep everyone together like a family (like the family unit she has never had) and the heartbreaking thing about the movie is what she can't do . Slowly everyone grows up and goes away. THIS exact plot point, though underlined throughout, is unfortunately tampered with. Did we really need a long drive with Scott Baio radiating a car full of boefies on his skateboard? Or an even longer sequence - also with Baio - where Foster has a strange soliloquy about the "pain of illusion". Some of the dialogue is actually neat, and I didn't care much for a late-film editing, coming from death to a wedding. But it's nitpicks in what is basically a very sensitive story about losing a tight band. And Jodie's face at the end speaks volumes. If viewers end up choking, the movie deserved it. It doesn't blow tears or ask for sympathy. It shows us an example of friendship and hope we understand. *** of ****
