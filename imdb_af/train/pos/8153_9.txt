It's a very funny movie, especially the second, third and fourth times you see it. It's a nice short movie, and I definitely recommend watching it more than once, you'll get it a second time. <br /> <br /> It's like spinal tap but the rap version. It has a lot of attitude in it, which can be a negative thing in movies, but it is just a total p ** s take and is not a problem because of the irony it creates. <br /> <br /> Lots of excerpts, one of those types of movies, you'll find yourself with lines with your friends, and it'll laugh. <br /> <br /> My personal favorite part is the "guerrilla in the middle" article. Great video, fantastic!
