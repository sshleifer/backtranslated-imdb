Mirage (1990) is a very rare 1990 horror / chiller, presented here in the UK on the "New World Video" label. <br /> <br /> It's a desert-based horror movie about a group of young friends celebrating Festivals for the weekend, just to kill one by one by an unknown force driving a threatening black truck! !! This movie has some creepy scenes, and a few gore here and there, but I have to say that the act was so lame even by low budget standards! But the movie was strangely addictive and I like it, and I never fell asleep or switched off, which is always a good sign! I almost gave this movie 6/10, but since it built steam along the way, I had some good moments of gore and tension, a little good nudity, and the fact that the blonde was in the main female role was also a hottie! I'll give it 7/10.
