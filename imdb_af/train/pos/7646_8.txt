This movie is one of my favorites because it reminds me of all the choices I made and how my life would change if my choices were different. It plays right in the "Multiple Universe" theory. <br /> <br /> The only thing that isn't true is how Larry Burrows (James Belushi) is so hard to understand what's going on, everything has changed. <br /> <br />
