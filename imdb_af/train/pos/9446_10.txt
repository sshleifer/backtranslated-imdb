James Dickey is a wonderful descriptive writer. When one reads "liberation", one immediately goes into the lush backwood of the deep south. Looking at John Boorman's film version of the book, he only realizes how accurately he captures the essence of the book. The camera is as descriptive as the narrative. The characters are fully realized, and the portrayal is fantastic. I only saw this movie in 1992, after my first year school. I was in a phase where I watch movies released in a few years of my birth in 1973. Among them were Patton, Papillon and All the President's Men; fine movies, all of them. This one was easily the class of the group. It says a lot.
