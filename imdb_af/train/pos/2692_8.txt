I really enjoyed this movie. It has a good direction, by the well-known Bigas Luna, born in Spain. And it is exactly in Spain that the movie takes place, in Catalu√±a, to be more accurate. <br /> <br /> Luna is once again examining the theme of an obsession, in this case the presentation of a young boy to the women's milk. There are some psychological concepts in this story, such as the rejection complex that the older son feels with the birth of his brother. In the film, it leads to the young boy's task of suddenly seeing all his mothers' milk after the newborn son. So he starts trying to find a breast that can feed him. He finds it in a woman who recently arrived. From here, the film is around here. <br /> <br /> This movie is very much on display, more than the story itself, the spectator captures certain moments (memorable moments) and certain symbols (the movie deserves a thorough analysis on almost everything that happens because it usually does something mean ...). The environment, the landscapes, typical of the region, as well as the surrealistic behavior of the characters, also symbolic, and the excellent ambiguous soundtrack by Nicola Piovani transport us to a different dimension, not parallel to the real world, but it cuts from time to time. to times ... Wishing to live in this world is worth watching this movie, although we can eventually get tired and sick with the excessive recitation that may go beyond the borders. <br /> <br /> I also enjoyed the presentation of the protagonist ... 8/10
