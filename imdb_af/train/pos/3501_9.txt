One of the best movies I've seen in the last five years! The cast is universally spectacular in a story of young love and bravado on the Lower East Side of New York City with the two main roles being superstars in the making. Funny, charming, sad and inspiring, it's a totally refreshing attack on urban youth that often puts Larry Clark's unpleasant gutter in the trough where it belongs ... although I have to admit Bully was a cut above his normal price. Increasing Victor Vargas is one movie you will kick yourself to miss ... so don't miss it!
