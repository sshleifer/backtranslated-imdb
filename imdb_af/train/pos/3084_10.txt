Oh man, why? "Six Degrees" is a show on this so-called theory that we are all linked by someone. Focusing on the lives of a group of people and the consequences of their actions. <br /> <br /> When I first heard of this show, it didn't get my attention at all. It was actually too ordinary. Then I saw a few episodes and loved it! First of all, the characters. They are all well written and different from each other. There is an alcohol addict, a woman whose fianc√©e is cheating on her, a woman who has just lost her husband, a driver who has a troubled brother ... So unlike what we are used to, the most characters with each other in casualties, as in our daily routines. Great! My favorites are Mae, Carlos and Whitney. <br /> <br /> Then the cast. They are all great. Jay Hernandez, of "Hostel", here shows his acting features in a more 3d character than his previous work as Paxton. The other also gives good performances, especially Campbell Scott, who plays Steven and Bridget Moynahan, who plays Whitney. <br /> <br /> Well, when I came to IMDb after looking at some episodes, I couldn't believe it was canceled. Seriously, I can't understand the low ratings. <br /> <br /> It's too bad it didn't have more than one season. It will really be a good show to follow!
