New York, I Love You is a joint work of eleven short films, with each segment lasting about 10 minutes. The shorts are not exactly related, but they all have something in common, love. Every brief is about finding love, whether it's about a few or just two strangers doing the squatter camp. The movie stars are an ensemble role, including Shia LaBeouf, Natalie Portman, Hayden Christensen, Orlando Bloom, Chris Cooper, Andy Garcia, Christina Ricci, Irrfan Khan, Robin Wright Penn, Julie Christie, Ethan Hawke, Bradley Cooper, Rachel Bilson , and Anton Yelchin. With such a star cast and such an interesting performance, I expected a tremendous movie; The problem is New York, I love you. It remains the sum of its parts. Some of the segments are funny, original and interesting, but others are so meaningless (Orlando Bloom / Christina Ricci and Ethan Hawke / Maggie Q segments) that it's terrible. The film is definitely uneven and has a very experimental tone. Storytelling looks like something a few film students can put together. In addition, the film also has some good moments. One of the best is the segment on an old couple, played by Eli Wallach and Cloris Leachman, who are going on their 67th wedding anniversary in Brooklyn. And these are moments like this, which made me a viewer, wish the movie is more consistent, because there is a lot of potential here. But, as unsatisfactory as the overall story eventually comes, cinematography and soundtrack saved me the whole thing. The editing was perfect, the way the movie was shot was very impressive and the ethereal soundtrack could no longer be appropriate. In the end, New York I Love You feels like an experimental movie, and as in most experiences there are highs and lows. This is how one looks at the film as a whole that will determine whether he enjoys it or not. It may be worth it for some time for others. <br /> <br /> 7/10
