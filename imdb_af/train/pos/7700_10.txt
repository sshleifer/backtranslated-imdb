Not only are the effects extraordinary, vs. shit like "earth against flying saucers" --- the true "killer" is the "universality of plot" --- everything depends on two principles --- the ancient concept of a hidden shaky father's desire for his daughter and the idea of ​​what would happen if a world 's technology reached the point where all citizens' desires became visible. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, if anyone we want to die is killed, not much, if anything is left --- and it has become the fate of the "banned" planet's population - - rather modern, actually. Unfortunately, the "rat" of "The Krell", who remained by ignorance and "Morpheus", the bloody father, knows how to access such technology. antique plot, beautifully rendered. <br /> <br /> And in the light of his age, it remains a beautiful tension, action, human emotion classic --- and visually very modern --- don't pass this one - - It endures all modern scientific fiction --- and its psychological content elevates it, beyond any genre --- a timeless work --- <br /> <br /> and the soundtrack! you will see and hear no pure "synth" and perfectly sawn Moog wallpaper --- a "don't miss" ---
