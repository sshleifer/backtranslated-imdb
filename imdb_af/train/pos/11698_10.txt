I'll say it's time, this movie was wonderful ... and yes if you don't want to become a Christian, why not bother it. I saw this movie after I was already saved and found it moving a lot. I now see that they have taken this movie to another level and created the Left Behind series. They run a close comparison and are definitely more modern to reach people. I think to evaluate this movie, you should see it. There are 3 or 4 of them in the series if I'm not wrong. Don't use our comments to judge, see the movie itself! ! God will bless you if that is why you see them.
