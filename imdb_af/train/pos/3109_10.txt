The third and final film of this trilogy is ultimately crystal clear. This is a political film more than a simple entertainment. Jason Bourne will eventually know who he was and he will discover and remember the tortures he has submitted to remembering his old identity: he really killed someone she had become. But the film is ultimately revealing that it is all organized by the CIA and is planned within a Blackfriars program that is also unmistakably revealed in the film, thus eliminating all US citizens who have tried to control the whole society occur by an established and limited group of people. Who was an essential CIA officer until 1980 when he became deputy chairman? It goes with what is said on the internet. Then the truth comes through Jason Bourne himself, but the most important person who can bring that truth to the public and the only authority that can make a decision on the CIA is a woman and the woman gets the Senate from a general involved. investigation. A woman and the Senate; read my lips. In the US politics in the media is fought and two media are essential for any presidential campaign: it is music and the theater. At present, Hollywood and more than the intelligentsia use the academy and intellectuals in general, and especially this film to build the public idea that salvation will come from a woman and from the Senate. So look at the movie. It is quite entertaining and it has the sweet smell of the end of a period and some of the people and others expect some change but nobody can pretend it won't. The only point is to know how deep and serious it will be. <br /> <br /> Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Paris Dauphine University, Paris University 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & Versailles University Saint Quentin and Yvelines
