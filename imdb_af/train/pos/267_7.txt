It all starts with a series of thefts of seemingly unrelated objects in a student residence at Hickory Road, London. Worried about her sister, what is the housekeeper there, ask Miss. Lemon Hercule Poirot to look at the matter. He agrees, but soon the game gets higher when a girl who has allowed her to be responsible for most (not all) of the theft is killed. <br /> <br /> "Hickory Dickory Dock" is a solid brain exercise, without being as complicated as "One, Two, Spy My Shoe". Murder, theft and diamond smuggling are the crimes involved, and the last strife that links everything together is only revealed in the last 2 minutes! The characters are interesting, especially psychologist Colin McNabb and the mysterious American girl Sally Finch, inspector Japp has his funny moments (perhaps the closest this series came to "toilet humor") and Miss Lemon gets a more integral part to the story as usual (***)
