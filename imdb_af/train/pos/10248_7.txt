I first heard of this movie after buying the 1976 movie "Snuff". I was told that Devil's Experiment was much better, so of course I continued and ordered the Guinea Pig Box. I was really interested to hear that Charlie Sheen retired to try and ban this movie or second, so my interest is high. <br /> <br /> Devil's Experiment is a short movie without story, no character development. . Only 3 men who tortured a woman for about 45 minutes. They torture her in various ways like hitting her, turning her in circles over and over and then forcing her to drink alcohol, forcing her to listen to loud noise for 24 hours, her hand with a hammer hitting the burns, throwing at her and finally throwing a sharp needle through her eye. <br /> <br /> I have to say that many of this movie were fake, like the clopton keys. But then it was actually done well as far as you pulled out. The screens in which the woman jumps in circles make me dizzy to see it. Whether the scene in which she has to listen to sharp noise for 24 hours is painful to think about. The worst is the eye scene. I did not close when I looked at it, but just thought, "Damn, it looks pretty good for such a low budget film." I enjoyed the movie, but I don't know if I can really recommend it unless you've seen most of what the horror genre has seen. 10/07
