Like his previous film, "In a Glass Cage", Agust√≠ Villaronga achieves an intense and highly poetic canvas that is visually more refined than its predecessor. It is one of the most visually crafted and haunting photos one could ever see. The increased drama, intensity and undertone of violence threaten the melodramatic or pharynic, but never steps. In this way, it achieves an almost impossible performance: being so top-down, yet so painfully limiting, so charged and under-estimated, and even the explosive finals are virtuosic feasts of the eye. Unabashed, beautiful, and highly tense ... this movie is simply fantastic!
