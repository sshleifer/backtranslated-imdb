I haven't seen it for more than 20 years, but I still remember things about it. <br /> <br /> This movie can NOT be made in color. The hard gray is what makes it, and was life really that simple in the 1950s ?? What most stands out in my memory is that Perry Smith goes to the gallows. His breathing under the hood just before they jumped off. I don't think I can see it again ... once is enough. It's like the nameless man at the beginning of the "Papillon" who is frightened by the guillotine. The man who said it watched it on a double account with Dead Man Walking, and had to add the last 10 minutes of "I Want To Live" as well. Some of my ancestors were "aristos" after the guillotine in 1794-95, so my feelings about the death penalty are quite intense.
