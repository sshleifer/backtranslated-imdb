I've never heard of this movie before I saw the rental DVD, but I'm skeptical. In the past, there have been many films with good ensemble castings that cannot make a bad screenplay, and in some cases it does not seem to care. <br /> <br /> Well, just to see it, there was no reason not to give this movie a theater release, it's good. The story like most in this genre can sometimes seem temporary, but there also seems to be a good amount of realism here that can carry the momentum. I was pleasantly surprised at how well a job Justin Timberlake is doing here with such an important role. Okay, he's not an Oscar yet, but he'll learn with every role and he has a lot of promise for the future here. Dylan McDermott was also incredibly good in his unexpected nasty role and is definitely the cream of the crop in this movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, just give it a spin. You won't be disappointed, you won't be bored. In fact, I think you'll be more than happy with the end result.
