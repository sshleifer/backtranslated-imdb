This movie has changed everything for me ... I've heard of breakdancing and hip hop, but have never done it professionally (hey, I was an 11 year old from Holland!) When I watched this movie, it all changed . I became actively involved in the hip hop movement in our city, started dancing and writing lyrics. <br /> <br /> To this day, I still regard this movie as a personal favorite. Certainly, the filming and cinematographic interest may not be so important. But who cares if the wide shot is badly filmed or if you can see a microphone hanging over someone? This is what it personally does to you that counts ...
