With Oliver Hardy bedeviled by the sound of horns, bells, phones and trombones, his doctor Finlayson recommends peace and quiet and a diet of goat's milk. Partner Stan Laurel comes up with a good solution, living on a docked boat, so the salt sea air can help Ollie get all the rest he needs. This is a good starting point for all the crazy trailers to follow, as the boat is being chased by the hungry goat, and an escaped culprit (Richard Cramer) pushes for the ride. <br /> <br /> I got a kick from all the gags in the movie, starting with the sign in the horn test factory - 'Silence While Men Are Working'. The early story at the boys' apartment has a number of mixed clearances for plumbing and appliances. Stan made a banana in a banana bit. Laurel had a few big lines in the picture, like "We had to be disconnected", but the one that rolled me off was his reaction to the crew on board the ship. "Self-preservation is the last law of means" exactly! <br /> <br /> I'm not so much a student of Laurel and Hardy's films so much on this board. All I know is that I enjoyed them as a child and found them so entertained today as they were in my youth. On that score, "Saps At Sea" offers a decent hour of hornophobic fun, well on the way to making hornomania.
