There is so much value in this movie that it is difficult to know where to start with praise. Let me start with my admiration for a perfect portrayal of Reese Witherspoon. That her performance stands out in the excellent role is indeed praise. Robert Mulligan seldom disappointed with those who admired his work. Every framework of The Man in the Moon is proof of film production at its best.
