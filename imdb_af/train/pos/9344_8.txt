I must admit, this movie has me to the extent that I burst into tears. However, I always think twice about things, and instead of writing a promise that defines the film as flawless and impeccable, I prefer the emphasis on risk. <br /> <br /> Firstly, first: The movie has an unmistakable impact on the viewer simply because it starts and continues as a slow movie that doesn't try to blow you away with the real scenes from 9/11 . Thumbs up for this battle of genius, because unlike Stone's WORLD TRADE CENTER, this movie does not focus on the attack itself, but on the downfall, which is similar to the outbreak of a nuclear explosion, yet dangerous. and devastating. The psychological impact, the mere devastation caused by 9/11 and the devastation it caused on the American people is almost striking in this movie. I think Binder has a clear perception of the US Post 9/11 community and, in my opinion, Sandler has grown the air from an average comedy actor to a real talent deserving an Oscar performance. <br /> <br /> But: In the movie BLOOD DIAMOND the Di Caprio says character and I quote: "Oh, these Americans. Always want to take their feelings." Now I don't want to belittle their sufferings, but I would like to make a comparison. Since 9/11, the whole world has been confronted with 9/11 memories, memorials and memorials. The Hollywood industry and writers like Safran Foer have more than 9/11 in their works. Now, this huge amount of cultural products, dealing with 9/11, kills 3,000 people in the greatest tragedy of this young age. The number of books written on the subject and the number of films targeted on this subject, and I say it with all due respect, blows the importance of this horrific crime slightly out of proportion. <br /> <br /> Fact is: People die every day due to unfair acts and terrible crimes committed by bad or just lost people. We have a war in Iraq, in Afghanistan, in Burma and in many other countries. We forget the poverty that the Afrikaners suffer daily and we tend to empathize with them to a lesser extent than with the American victims of 9/11, simply because they are black and because their lives are not much in common with our Western lives. . Africa does not have the money or the potential to commemorate their national tragedies like America can. So, what I say is this: The reason we feel more about the 3,000 victims of 9/11 and their families is because we are constantly reminded of 9/11. Not a day goes by without a newspaper article, a movie or a book discussing 9/11. <br /> <br /> Finally: I appointed Charlie Fineman, but I wasn't sure I had the right to feel more for him than for a Hutu who lost his entire family in the Rwandan civil war. <br /> <br /> You catch my thrift?
