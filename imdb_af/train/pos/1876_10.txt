An adaptation of the book Fish Finding. This story is about an upset young sailor Antwone Fisher (Derek Luke) who tells the painful story of his past to a psychiatrist Jerome Davenport (Denzel Washington). A brilliant debut performance by Derek Luke and a superbly beautiful performance by Denzel Washington. <br /> <br /> This movie was incredible at so many levels and I was disappointed it didn't win an Oscar, I think it was because it was released at a bad time, so it was overlooked . I recommend this movie to everyone, you will be touched by his story and it makes the audience empathetic with this young man who is Antwone Fisher. <br /> <br /> If you want inspiring real stories, look Antwone Fisher. <br /> <br /> Thank you
