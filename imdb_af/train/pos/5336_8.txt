I really like this movie because in Australia, Chinese movies like this have never been shown for the first time. I have to say this is one of the best serious movies ever, describing the difference between the Hong Kong people and the Chinese mainland. It really shows that there is discomfort between the two, but can only get better as HK learns Mandarin. It also showed me how in the mainland of China the indie rock scene exists, and that Chinese people know how to strum the guitar and make the house work! Who said China is not ready for rock music? Daniel Wu is absolutely wonderful, with his clean and sharp voice, honest acting, and a total chick magnet. I recommend this movie to those who don't know much about Asian people to cleanse themselves of the typical Western stereotypes, and people who just love Chinese / Asian cinema like me. Look at it!
