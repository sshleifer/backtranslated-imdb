Back in 2004, I saw 'True', Tom Tykwer's contribution to Paris Je'aime. When I saw it, I loved it and got excited. It became my favorite short film and appreciated so much. Of course I wanted to see the whole movie, and I'll even make sure who was attached, etc. <br /> <br /> Yesterday I finally saw it, courtesy of the internet. <br /> <br /> First of all I have to say, it looks AWESOME. Photography is BEAUTIFUL in every short and shot, at the worst nothing special - but still brilliant and clear. Later I read the trivia here, and maybe that's how scanning in 6K gives more justice to all the DP's work. My special favorites are the first scene of the Quais de Seine (that sunlight!), The Sin City-esquire (but better for me) Quartier de la Madeleine, and "14th arrondissement" - but you know what the hell I Like them all : "True" or "Faubourg Saint-Denis" I still feel nervous about those brilliant colors (my eyes, they tremble) and "Quartier Latin" are gold held on silver. Beautiful. <br /> <br /> Yes, these are some BEAUTIFUL short films. <br /> <br /> Let's get the content now. I am a lot (and I mean a lot) like eclecticism that felt so successful. You never have the same themes or treatment between two shorts, and I think the formula is restrictive enough to explore all these artists in the shorts. I loved coming from a simple love story in a crazy Chinese musical-in-Paris-with-Barbet-Schroeder in a social commentary in a terrorist comedy in a humble monologue. I love surprises! And this movie has them! It's great that they have had the opportunity to leave all the directors' flesh out of things that aren't usually in the mainstream theater (which I despise too much). It's not very experimental, but I can breathe the breathing space these people have. <br /> <br /> I love the little time and I love the acting. I love the simplicity and I love love. I like the simple feelings and the beauty and eclecticism and in general it is a movie that is very, very nice to watch, alone or with someone. Just to feel. It felt very good to me. <br /> <br /> There's something about the gravity in it ... it's so honest ... <br /> <br /> What I didn't like? Well, for me there are two shorts that aren't exactly the best - Quais de Seine (which is good, of course, and maybe even needed, but feels too much like a commercial?) And 'PÃ¨re-Lachaise' Although I like holding the acting, I felt it was forced to themes. But of course it's just me. "Tour Eiffel" I also didn't love, but I think it's probably due to my very different sensitivity to that of Sylvain Chomet? I don't know if this movie has special interest for people who already know the actors and directors, and so they can surprise their interaction, in the surprises (watch out for Alexander Payne in a funny role) and basically in what Will this director do this? "big question. I really enjoyed it that way. <br /> <br /> I repeat now: Most shorts I loved and all together make a beautiful and energetic blend. I definitely recommend it. !!! So, watch it if you want Eclectic Beautiful Love!
