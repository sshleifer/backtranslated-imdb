The night listener kept my attention, while Robin Williams shines as a New York City radio host, enchanted by a 14-year-old son (Rory Culkin) who is very ill. Williams never met the boy personally, as they were only in contact with the phone. Williams's ex-boyfriend (good work by Bobby Cannavale), however, doubts the boy, who Williams asks to meet him personally. What follows is making Williams a permanent impact in a way he doesn't expect. I'll leave it with that. Toni Collette also has stars. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this movie, with Toni Collette giving an unforgettable depiction of Culkin's adoptive mother. Sandra O also dies as Williams's friend. The night listener is inspired by the real events, and it has a bleak, almost creepy silence throughout. Sometimes it's predictable, no, thanks to some of the reviews I've read before I saw the movie and just because of logic, but I kept it smooth. I enjoy Williams in roles like this, more than his comic characters, so that was an extra bonus for me. Recommended. 8/10
