The one and only was a good movie. I just watched it on EncoreW on DirecTV. I'm an independent professional wrestler, and I thought it was a good portrayal of how life is like a professional wrestler. Now this movie was made 4 years before I was born, but I don't think the trouble of professional wrestling has changed that much. Sad, funny, and everything around GREAT !!! **** 10+
