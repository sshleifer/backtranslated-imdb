Modern viewers know this small movie mainly as the remake model, "The Money Pit." Older viewers see it today with nostalgia: Cary Grant, Myrna Loy and Melvyn Douglas were all 'superstars' in an easier, less complicated era. Or was it? Of course, time has a way to change perspectives. With so many movies today probably with social and political comments, there is a natural curiosity to wonder about controversy in older, seemingly less challenging films. So in "Mr Blandings build his dream home", there may be more than audiences sought in 1948. However, there are political comments, but subtle. Finding a house in the late 40's was a truly surprising experience, just gently softened by the advent of Levittowns and the like. Politics in the movie? The Mixture children always seem to talk about progressive ideas that they are taught in school (which will actually accuse teachers of communism). In real life, Myrna Loy was also a housing activist, a democratic and a feminist. Melvyn Douglas was no longer a democratic fire brigade: he was married to Congresswoman Helen Gahagan Douglas, who had accused young Richard Nixon of being gentle on communism (and devastating her). Jason Robards, Sr., played a small role in the film, but his political activism was no less noticeable. More importantly, his son, Jason Robards, Jr., would have been a very active liberal democrat for many years. Almost the odd co-out was Cary Grant, whose strong conservatism reflected a majority of political sentiment in Hollywood that is already slipping. But it was 1948: Communism was a real perceptible threat and the blacklist was just around the corner. It would be another decade before political activism would re-appear in mainstream films, and not so subtly.
