Although there were some rough spots and a few lines that were not really true, it was Classic H: LOTS. The characters, outside Mike Giardello (Giancarlo Esposito), were true to form, and the Pembleton (Andre Braugher) and Bayliss (Kyle Secor) reunion screens were so deep and well-behaved as anything ever to commemorate the small screen. /> "Homicide: The Movie" aka "Life Everlasting" is a fan flick, but is on its own as well as any 2-hour episode of the series. Fontana, Overmeyer and Yoshimura have done a wonderful job of joining loose ends of 7 seasons and every major role player of the best damn show on television for the series final that NBC never bothered. True to the form of "murder" there were no happy ends, so is life. This is what has always set this display apart from the incessant cookie cutter policemen left on television. Kudos for the authors and the cast for creating something about the team of the series and in the film that television viewers and producers have challenged. <br /> <br /> ** I call myself a "Homicidal Maniac" as for no other reason than keeping my co-workers in a cooperative mood. **
