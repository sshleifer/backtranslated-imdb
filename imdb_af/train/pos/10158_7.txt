Johnny and June Carter Cash funded this film, which is a traditional version of the gospel stories. The music is wonderful, you get a real sense of how the world of Jesus looked (I was there too), and June comes with a passion in the section of Mary Magdalene. Cash's narration is also good. <br /> <br /> But .... <br /> <br /> 1. The actor who played Jesus was ignored. 2. There is no talk of the story, as Cash puts in some of his faith-based music. 3. Because it is indescribable, I doubt we will ever see it widespread again. <br /> <br /> I want to buy the CD. <br /> <br /> Tom Paine Texas, USA
