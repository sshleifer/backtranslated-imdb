I really enjoyed this movie. I am a single father with a 17-year-old daughter who is smart, athletic and talented. I wish my girlfriend used herself so well to solve crimes and help others! So for me, maybe it's PG-level Fantasyland. I read a lot of Nancy Drew books in my teens long ago. Certainly this character was barely played by Emma Roberts, but didn't look like Nancy Drew, but I remember from the books. That's because of the script, not the acting. <br /> <br /> Emma is a pleasant teenager who plays confident, experienced and proud character with good manners and good taste. She is not trapped in the trendy competitiveness around her. There are some weaknesses in the plot, apart from the Nancy Drew of the Books, and trying to figure out which decade we are. (Like, what is the CAR, anyway?) <br /> <br /> I read the IMDb review before I watched the movie, while exploring Rachael Leigh Cook from other movies. This is not one of her best roles, but I will continue to search for more of her films. Rachael was too old to play this lead, but did a good job as the great orphan central to the mystery. <br /> <br /> I'm very disappointed in other reviews written here. Some expect perfect connection with the books, some expect more credible situations or adult action movies. I have what I expected! Good entertainment well aimed at young teenage girls, and their fathers who want good kids with high standards of behavior and performance. It's a Teen PG Movie, not James Bond! What do you want for a role model for your teenage daughter?
