Everyone knows about this "Zero Day" event. What I think this movie did, didn't make them show us how these guys were. They showed their lives for about a year. Throughout the movie we love to laugh with them, even though we know exactly what they are going to do. And it gives me the cold fever. Because I felt guilty of being cheered by their comments, and I thought Cal was a lovely man. Even though I knew what was going to happen, you know? Even at the end of the movie when they wanted to commit suicide and just decided they did it on the score of 3 or 4, I thought it was funny, but I was still shocked to see how their heads were shot. Of course I was. I had to keep them. They might be angry, but I felt they were really ordinary guys, they didn't really realize it. But I knew they were. <br /> <br /> It's, IMO, the main force of this movie. It makes us realize that our friends, or family members, or anyone, are planning something, and we won't even see it. This movie, as good as it was, made me feel bad. And so I can't sleep now. There is still this little feeling in my stomach. Butterflies.
