It was a good movie! Even though there were only 15 people who included myself, it was wonderful! My friend and I laughed a lot. My mom even enjoyed it. There were two middle-aged women there and a middle 20-year-old there and they enjoyed it. I love the part where Corky and Ned look like Nancy and it's fun. And when she got her roadster and Ned was there. Yes, it was a good movie, even though people underestimated it. Go See It, I'll bet you'll enjoy it !! I really enjoyed it and so did my friend. <br /> <br /> People were so tough on this movie and they didn't even see it. I bet next time they'll give the movie and actress a chance. In my opinion, they have done a good job. But if you have young children, it's still appropriate. I'll probably take my 7-year-old cousin to see it too.
