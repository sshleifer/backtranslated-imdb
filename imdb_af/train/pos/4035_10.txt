In a word ... incredible. <br /> <br /> Initially I wasn't too keen to see Pinjar, as I thought it would be another movie that complained about the partition and would show prejudice to India and Pakistan. I was so wrong. Pinjar is a heartbreaking, emotional and intelligent film without any visible defects. I was chased after watching it. It had been so long thought; The themes, the pain, the loss, the emotion, everything was so real. <br /> <br /> It is truly a masterpiece that one seldom sees in Bollywood today. It has no prejudice or prejudice and has given the partition a human story. No country is portrayed as well or badly here. There are evil Indians, evil Pakistanis and good Indians and Pakistani's. The cinematography is excellent and the music is melodic, meaningful (thanks to Gulzar sahib) and spooky. Everything about the movie was incredible ... and the play took my breath away. Everyone was thrown perfectly. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in watching an intellectual and truly wonderful movie, look no further. This movie gives it all. I recommend it with my whole heart. AMAZING can't describe how excellent it is.
