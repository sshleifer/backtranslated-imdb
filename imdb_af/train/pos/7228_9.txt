The undoubted highlight of this movie is Peter O'Toole's performance. In turn, it is very funny and terribly tragic. Does anyone do it better than O'Toole? I do not think so. What a wonderful face that man has! <br /> <br /> The story is alien and very disturbing and emotionally intense in parts (especially at the end), but it is also weird and successful on many levels. However, I felt that the movie was basically about Peter O'Toole's light performance and I'm sure I wouldn't enjoy it as much as half if he wasn't in it.
