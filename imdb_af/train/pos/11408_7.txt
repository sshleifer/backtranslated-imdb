Etienne Girardot is just a character - the kind of person who would never know people by name. However, he plays the eclipse again - one of the only actors in the Philo Vance films that has played his role more than once. I saw him twice and loved him every time because he was so funny and fresh. This movie is also nice to watch, as there are, besides Girardot, many other great character characters along with Grant Mitchell, Gene Lockhart, Henry Walthal, Kent Smith, H.B. Warner and Nat Pendleton. This is quite an impressive role, and they made the job easier for leading husband and wife Edmund Lowe and Virginia Bruce. <br /> <br /> These great character actors are one of the major reasons I like these old B movies. While the riddle itself is rarely so wonderful, the movies are really satisfying, due to the turbulent writing and acting. Regarding this film, Vance is played wonderfully by Lowe, but as I said, the riddle itself is just an afterthought - with a stupid plan that includes hypnosis and suicide. Unfortunately, you can't hypnotize anyone to do something like that - I have been trained in clinical hypnosis and if I could do something the evil man in the movie could do, I'd do it! Used car sellers and some of my old bosses were obvious! <br /> <br /> Overall, though not the best Philo Vance movie, it was very good and it's a shame that Lowe once played this role. In fact, besides William Powell (who played five times in Vance), the series was hindered by a long, long sequence of actors such as Basil Rathbone, Wilfred Hyde-White and Warren William (and many others) playing Vance. This is a similar problem that has also plagued the Bulldog Drummond series - just too many different actors playing the leading man. <br /> <br /> Worth seeing and exciting - but also impossible.
