It is nice to look back at Suraj Barjatya to what he is best at. A story woven around a marriage. It feels nice to have a movie in which there is not a single scene you could see with your family. Although the story is simple and does not contain any new elements, you still love the movie, because of the presentation, performances, and actually the entire treatment. Hats off to Suraj .. The movie is about involvement leading to love. The portrayal of the changes in thinking, acting as soon as you become engaged, is excellent. Director definitely thought it a lot and actress did it perfectly. Although the movie is slow, you don't mind, because you're so much involved in the story that you just want to keep an eye on the joy of this latest fianc√© couple. As a typical RajShree stuff, it has many sentimental scenes that most likely burst the viewer into tears (especially ladies). But if you come out of the cinema, you're very happy and feel the ticket was worth it :-).
