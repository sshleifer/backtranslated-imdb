I must be honest. I watched and enjoyed this show because it was gross, offensive, hilarious and racial. Yes, there is a lot of humor for every taste. If you are in the kind of humor that deals with the fun of people falling from skateboards, for example, then you will have a good time for it. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy people with extreme stunting, it's bad, you'll have a good time as well. And if you enjoy skatological humor and extreme situations, you'll enjoy the show. <br /> <br /> I enjoy all three kinds of humor that "Dirty SÃ nchez" offers. I like a hard laugh with the situation of the show. "Jackass" is like a walk in the park compared to this one. So if you are tired of the typical American stupidity of Jackass, try to make English extreme stupidity on this show. With all due respect. <br /> <br /> It's a show with little taste or class. It is not recommended for those who are easily offended or expelled. <br /> <br /> Now these guys need to see a psychologist. Especially the Paco character.
