Viewing "Impulse" is a very satisfying experience. Unpredictable movies are such a rarity, when one comes like 'Impulse', it's something to embrace. The writing is logical and extremely creative. Meg Tilly, Tim Matheson, Hume Cronyn, and Bill Paxton give credible performances. It may have played like a zombie movie, but "Impulse" is much better than any boring "zombie-fist", and originality shines in virtually every scene. You get the feeling that something could have happened, even though the writing is pure fiction. From the "grabber" opening to the credits role, you will be fascinated. Very entertaining and definitely recommended. - NOTE
