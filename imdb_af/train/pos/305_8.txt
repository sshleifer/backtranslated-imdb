Screwball comedy about romantic mismatches in New York City. Peter Bogdanovich is apparently in love with all the women in his picture - he respects them - yet Audrey Hepburn (of course) is a notch above the others, because she was probably in love with the Bogdanovich at the movies 30 years ago. He shoots her in close-ups, holds straight into the sheets between her and a wonderfully cooked / boiled Ben Gazzara, and makes her room translucent. The love links made during the film are fast and amusing, but I had John Ritter's TV style clutchiness. Colleen Camp, Dorothy Stratten, and the well-grounded sensual Patti Hansen are all thrilling to watch. But it's really Hepburn's valentine and she's absolutely glowing. *** of ****
