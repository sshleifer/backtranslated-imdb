A Kafkaesque thriller of alienation and paranoia. Very well done and Polanski performs well as the diffident introverts hardly trying to adapt to his beautiful Paris lodgings and his fellow residents. Very early because of the seemingly common and self-obsessed fellow tenants and later terrible because he developed his defense that would eventually be his withdrawal. Personally, I could have done without the cross decorating element, but I accept the nod to Psycho and the fact that it has some logic, taking into account the storyline. Nevertheless, it could have worked without the light theater element, but then it was possible because the courtyard would definitely look like a theater at the end. I can't help feeling that there are more than a few of the director's own feelings not to be a 'real' French and Jewish. Yet there is plenty to enjoy here, including a great show of beautiful views of Isabelle Adjani and good old Shelly Winters as reliable as ever.
