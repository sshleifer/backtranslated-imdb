It's an entertaining gem with lots of pizazz and some surprising surprises. Outstanding funny scenes include a hilarious shoot (and shoot back) of a WW1 digging scene with Australian comedian Clyde Cook as an optimistic non-com and the fearless McDoakes as a Boyer / Colman messenger ?? all under the glance of Ralph Sanford's beautifully insatiable Anguish; led a lost McDoakes and again led by boring Jack Carson; assistant director Chandler remains in a McDoakes shipping opportunity: "I'm going to be a director!" <br /> <br /> Ace comic O'Hanlon has a dual role, playing McDoakes and himself as McDoakes! Strangely enough, Richard L. Bare, who plays in one or more other entries in the series, reversed the event. In real life, Bare is a young, six-foot Rock Hudson lookalike, but here he is introduced by veteran actor (over 500 movies!) Jack Mower.
