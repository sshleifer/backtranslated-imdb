At the time, I remember being shocked and amused by this movie. I mentioned it as the most important film I've seen in ten years, and I beat myself in people who said similar things. <br /> <br /> Bernhard has an unusual perceptive behavioral note. And she formed the bitter adolescent personality we all had in a corrosive, mature world view. The two together offer a spectacular mix that can be edgy for some viewers. (Hi Skip. I wish you weren't my brother, so I could!) <br /> <br /> Bernhards was looking for herself after returning to LA from New York. This results in a profound test of several personas (poorly fit) entertaining us, but enough of them involve the impact of a "black imperative" value system that is the right barometer of her or black culture. Nina Simone has a while. And she has an impressive, solid building, black lover in the movie. A pretty black girl attends the shows, shining Sandra's faux-blackness, but eventually rejects her. <br /> <br /> Just as Catholics find themselves happy to suffer for Christ, Sandra shows herself suffering from a black culture in which she desires a place; as if she cherished her dignity and her rejection. This is the only value system that is placed in the film world, beyond Bernhard's confusion. <br /> <br /> For a nation whose main issues are racism and money, it is refreshing to be one of the two topics in an atypical way.
