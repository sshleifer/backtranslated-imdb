Class Reunion is a very moderate comedy gem. It is 1982 and the 1972 class of Lizzie Borden High. There are 10 years of reunion, including the usual stereotypes, the hunger, the baby, the fat and the nerd. But the ex-students are in a bumpy night, one of their classmates is Walter Baloer, the class pimp who was subjected to a comedy talk at the rest of the class and since then has been in a spiritual home, Walter escapes and plans now To avenge his humiliation ,,, <br /> <br /> Despite the dark point of departure, it's really just an excuse for many very funny gags and sets. To say too much, the movie will spoil, but if you enjoy the Naked Gun & Airplane movies, you will love it, and what other movie offers a music at Chuck Berry? A good comedy that deserves a wider audience.
