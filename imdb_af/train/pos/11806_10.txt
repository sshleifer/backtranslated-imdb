Everything was better in the past. Even children's television. And Fraggle Rock proves my point very easily. While writing this comment, I'm fourteen years old, but even in my teens, I can't resist the charm of Fraggle Rock. For those of you who have actually lived under a rock (haha!), Fraggle Rock is a horde of playful and good-natured creatures called Fraggles who remain in a rock wonderfully. But they are not the only creatures. The rock is inhabited by many other species such as the hard-working Doozers and numerous living plants. Outside the rock on the one hand, inventory scientist Doc and his dog Sprocket (later befriended with Gobo Fraggle), on the other hand, are a family of Gorgs-supposed rulers of the Universe. The five main Fraggles Gobo (fearless leader), Mokey (arty and peaceful), Wembley (undecided and a friend to Gobo), Boober (a pessimistic domestic god) and Red (love anything with sports and general frivolity) Doing so is caught up in some strange situations every episode, while at the same time singing and dancing their cares. <br /> <br /> Fraggle Rock is definitely a family program. The plots can have intricate details that children can't follow well, but the song and dance routines will keep their attention. The characters are strong and nice, their conflicts are credible and their adventures are exciting. The Gorgs are frightening, Doc and Sprocket illuminating, Uncle Traveling Matt hilarious (the postcard segments are very 80s!) And the last episode, Address Change, really touches. Let's go back to Fraggle Rock!
