I managed to get rid of it from my satellite, but I'd like to get an original version in a format we can use here in the states. Eddie is truly glorious in this show from San Francisco. I don't remember laughing so hard at a rising routine. My wife and I both enjoyed this band and his work on Glorious. I just wish I could buy a copy and financially support Eddie through my purchase. We need more of his shows.
