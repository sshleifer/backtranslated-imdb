To see this movie from start to finish without bursting into laughter, virtually requires an act of faith, as one must say, "it's old", "it's a classic", "be friendly" , not because the movie is so bad, but because it's at its best. This is a dated movie. It is also a classic, as a withered one. However, I do not tend to laugh at people in principle, and I get irritated more than a little when others do. Making fun of The Informer in my mind is a bit like an idiot savant, dribbling his orange juice over the tablecloth. Yes, one says to himself, he is an idiot, and when he is on top of his game, he is also a true savant. The same goes for The Informer, which is indeed terrifying, yet it boasts wonderful photography, fine acting, a wonderful score and a good, decent, simple story. In the end, which I will not throw away, politics, religion and psychology come together, in a church, in such a way that the scene looks corny and on top, and yet it is sometimes life. Uneducated people of simple faith behave differently from our (presumably brilliant) modern people, and the scene is not so incredible (I buy it, but I know the Irish) as embarrassing. Yet people do such things, they say things like that. Not everyone is hip, and it may not even be desirable for everyone to be hip. Are people today so much better than seventy or eighty years ago? And in what way? I do not think so. We are just different. Now look at the movie.
