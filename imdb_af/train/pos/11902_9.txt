This movie chronicles the life and times of William Castle. In the 1950s and 1960s, he made a series of low budget horror films that he sold with gimmicks. In "13 Ghosts" you need viewers to see the ghosts (they were in color, the movie was in b & w). "The Tingler" has theater seats equipped with a sinner who chased the audience when a monster escapes into a cinema. "Marabre" has issued a life insurance policy to all members if they were terrified! The movies themselves were pretty bad, but the gimmicks rushed to see them. In this document, there are interviews with directors inspired by Castle, actors in his movies and his daughter. It also comes in his domestic life and the kind of man he was (he was a good guy in all respects). The documentary is loving, very funny and absolutely sound. It is very short (under 90 minutes) and there is never a dull moment. A must have for Castle fans and horror movie fans. My one complaint - there were very few rows shown from his photos. Besides, it's just fantastic.
