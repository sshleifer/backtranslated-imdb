I have to say, I thought I saw everything. I'm an extremely dressed film buff. This movie didn't shock me. I'm beyond that point. But it took me to some emotional places, but I didn't know I could go. I had no idea that I could ever find the idea of ​​beestiality erotic. Never never ever. Ever. Ever. But there you go. He did it. I need to give the director credit. He pulled it off. <br /> <br /> For the first 40 minutes, this movie is a TOTAL drill. We start with some very explicit footage of two horses that have sex. After five minutes of this I began to wonder if buying this movie was not a mistake. Then an old guy in a wheelchair speaks to another old guy about two people who are getting married. Then a nerve shaves. Then we (briefly) see a hot chick with a butler (but very short). At this stage I swore the movie out loud while I was awake. In fact, I fell asleep over the 40-minute point and forced me to finish it the next night. <br /> <br /> Eventually we get the good stuff when a girl (who knows who she is or who anyone is) in this movie) has a dream about a Victorian era gall coming through an animal in the forest is destroyed. The scene has been around for quite some time and is really the heh-heh of the entire deal. It is beautifully shot, excellently edited, and does not deliver the goods. They try to turn the plot to the end and it makes sense, but not. Oh good. I definitely recommend this movie. The first 40 minutes made me shoot (and my TV), but the last 50 minutes completely let it down.
