Youth, sexuality and French countryside - one of the more unique movies you'll ever see. If you can see it, it's not a good thing to look at how difficult it is to find copies of it (a combination of scarcity and censorship.) It is sometimes erotic, sometimes disgusting and sometimes funny. A bit boring also in the middle, but you can't call yourself an aficionado of bizarre film until you have seen this one at least once.
