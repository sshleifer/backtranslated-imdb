This movie brought tears to my eyes; John Roberts really knew how to get to the viewers' hearts, directing this wonderful picture where life is viewed by Paulie's mind and heart. We discover from time to time, using sensitive and talented directors like John, that even small creatures like Paulie have a heart. I couldn't stop my tears, though the movie has a happy ending. It's wonderful, after thousands of movies I've seen through my life, Paulie has deeply touched me. That is, after the "Ugly Duckling", the second photo that really turned me upside down.
