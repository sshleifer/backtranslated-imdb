It surprised. . the impact and resolution this movie has in my automatic way to be reactive to people and situations. The most vibrant was the stir of emotion anger. Much like the way a spoiled child would be when they respond to not getting their way. . .Andemper tantrum if you like. Thinking that I was hiding this wrath from others was the most ridiculous farce of all. What does it cost me? Soooo much love. . So many blessings. Now I am present at how incredibly humbled I feel myself and with an ongoing attitude of gratitude for life. . Because what happens right now, without my wild expectations for life to be a particular way, the way I think life or people should be ". This film has contributed to the freedom I now feel about connecting with others, without boundaries and expectations. . And to connect with true love. . . without fear of loss. . . First, love and accept what love is given.
