Valued PG-13 for violence, short sexual humor and drug content. Quebec Rating: 13+ (should be G) Canadian Home Video Rating: 14A <br /> I saw Police Story several times. According to me, Police Story Chan's best movie from the 80's is. He had originally made it because he didn't have the other cop film he had to die in what the Protector was. I didn't see the protector, so I can't compare. The play is not bad and the plot is pretty good. I'm not doing 'I can't remember the plot well, because I've seen this movie back for a while, but what I remember is this movie has great action, stunts and comedy that just needs a good Chan movie has. If you can find Police Story and you are Chan fan then buy this movie! <br /> <br /> Roundtime: 106min <br /> <br /> 9/10
