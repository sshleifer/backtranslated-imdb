This movie has everything a fantasy movie should have, romance, clever witticisms, great acting and a fair dose of magic. <br /> <br /> I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and signed on its original plot (based on the Neil Gaiman novel I want to read now) and colorful characters. <br /> <br /> One of the most striking things to me was how confident the story is. Unlike so many scientific fantasy movies out there that open now, and so it was a pure fairy tale that in itself was satisfactory without the need for a successor. <br /> <br /> Original. Fun. Feel-Good Fantasy.
