Playwright Sidney Bruhl (a wonderful over the top Michael Caine) would kill for a hit. Give a young miracle child (a solid Reeve) who just wrote such a play. Weave in this Bruhl's excessive hysterical wife (excellently played by Cannon) and a German psychic (a lot of funny Irene Worth) and you have a wonderful ghost. <br /> <br /> While not "Sleuth" Standards, "Deathtrap" is nevertheless a very capable, winding comic suspense ride based on a terrific play by Ira Levin. The artists, of course, have a field day with the material, especially Caine delivering top gusto lines. <br /> <br /> The movie loses some steam halfway and the end is far less satisfying than the hilarious one in the original play, but overall "Deathtrap" is solid, well-behaved and exciting fun.
