People are getting too hard on the movie. Sometimes we just have to sit back and enjoy the story without trying to review it. <br /> <br /> The whole thing comes together when Hackman decides not to pull the trigger, but his target still goes down. Then the pleasure begins with the fact that everyone is also going over him. <br /> <br /> Just think of JFK and all the people who are in any way associated with its assassination, whose lives ended in a sudden and dubious manner and you would appreciate what is implied in this movie. <br /> <br /> I think it's an excellent interpretation of what may have happened. Although the EXACT story line has failed me (afterwards, after reading Jim Maars "Crossfire"), this is what it implies to be important. <br /> <br /> I'd like a copy of it to review it again. In light of what is known today, the Domino principle is right.
