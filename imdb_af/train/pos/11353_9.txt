This movie was excellent. It describes the struggle between a dedicated detective against the dedicated ignorance of the corrupt communist regime in Russia during the 80s. I give this movie high marks because it is non-disturbed look at the birth and development of forensic investigation in a worldwide isolated (thanks to the "Regime") community. It's a graphic movie. It offers an irreconcilable picture of violence and it is tragic remnants. Nothing is "candy" with exaggerated blood or gore to separate us from the cruel reality on the screen. This movie is based on Russian serial killer Andrei Chikatilo. I'm familiar enough with the true story of having a very deep appreciation for how really they liked the movie. It's not a comedy, but for those who appreciate dry and dark humor, this movie is a must-see.
