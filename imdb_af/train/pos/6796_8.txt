Zodiac Killer (2005) was an interesting film by German-born director Ulli Lommel. He leads, manufactures and co-stars in this latest production. He can't just make an interesting movie on the cheap. But he reaches a new layer when Herr Lommel keeps a close eye on his entire movie catalog. I saw movies of Boogeyman I and II, War Bats, Tenderness of the Wolf, Brain Waves and Cocaine Cowboys (even Andy Warhol makes a cameo from outside the grave courting this movie). Although he uses many old footage, he works well (and I can add very creatively). <br /> <br /> The movie follows a young man who copies the original Zodiac Killer. He also agrees with a writer (Ulli Lommel) who originally wrote about the serial killer in the late sixties and early seventies. The author's friend (David Hess) helps him find this wodabe Zodiac. Can this killer be stopped? Will the writer gather two and two and reclaim some of his old glory? Is David Hess still the man? You have to find out for yourself and look at the Zodiac Killer. <br /> <br /> This movie is not about the original Zodiac killer. I also heard people hear about this movie being shot on video. Approximately. The director's old school artist hides the fact that it was shot on video. My only complaint was over-utilizing stockpiles of Herr Lommel's previous films (but I understand why "wink" wink.) Don't believe the hype. It's an avid and street-level horror movie. Like the disclaimer in the early states, this movie does not kill. You must keep that statement. <br /> <br /> Highly recommend to Ulli Lommel fans.
