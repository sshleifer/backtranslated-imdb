It's a very difficult movie, and it's almost impossible to get a handle on what's going on. Initially, it seems to be a rather pedestrian movie about a man (Trelkovsky) who needs an apartment and rather rather invite himself when the current tenant commits suicide. Then the turns and turns start. Are the neighbors trying to kill him? And why do the dead tenant's clothes come up in the apartment? One wonders if Trelkovksy is the previous tenant. <br /> <br /> SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER <br /> <br /> One of the tricks Polanski draws on us is to lie to us. We assume when we see things from the point of view of a character we see things like the character and that there may be confusion of reality. We assume that the camera shows us things from its ubiquitous point of view that we see reality - but Polanski laid the camera for us.
