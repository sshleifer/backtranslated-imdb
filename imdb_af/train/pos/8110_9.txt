Amazing effects for a movie of this time. A primer of the futility of war and how war becomes a carer of himself. <br /> <br /> A wonderful thing about this movie is that it is now a public domain and available on archive.org. No cost, no signup required. Keep it in one seat and you'll be driven. <br /> <br /> I am planning to share this movie with as many people as possible, as I've never heard of it and I'm a hard core sci fi fan. <br /> <br /> I want to see others respond to this movie. <br /> <br /> See it. <br /> <br /> Upgrade it. <br /> <br /> Tell us what you think.
