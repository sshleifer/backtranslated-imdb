In fact, this movie has foolish moments, both in the clay part and in the Joe Pesci and children, and it's much worse than other MJ movies like "The Wiz", "Captain Eo" and "Ghosts". But as a hard Michael Jackson fan for almost eleven years, (Yes, it's half my life, guys!), I can't complain too much about it. Just to see this sweet man and hear his wonderful music is a journey to Heaven for me. But as a movie it is not good at all, and I'm afraid it will get me much lower if my darling Mike wasn't the one who played the lead in it. But since no one but Mike is the moonwalker, it must get a 7 out of 10 of me.
