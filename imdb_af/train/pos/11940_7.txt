If a baseball dies, this movie goes against what I expect in a sports movie: authentic sports activities, credible characters and an original story line. While "Angels abroad" fail in the first category, they succeed in the latter two. "Angels" weaves the story of Roger and J.P., two Anaheim foster children in love with baseball, but is looking for a family, with those of the living-Angels franchise, struggling to attract fans and win games. Due to his deadly father's promise that they would only be a family if the angels win the winners, Roger asks for some heavenly help and gets it in the shape of a diamond house spirit that suggests the downward spiral of the franchise reversed. And when the short-curved driver, George Knox (expressed by Danny Glover) began to believe in what Roger saw, the team suddenly hoped to turn their season around. Roger and JP find something to believe. Glover gives a nice performance, and Tony Danza, who can play a sink, is also doing well, despite the fact that ZERO has an idea of ​​how to get out of the wind!
