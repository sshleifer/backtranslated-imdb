In the reflection of this movie I can think of two others to put it in perspective. One relatively forgotten but covering the same geography is Coup de Torchon, the other thousands miles away and much larger range is the unforgettable Indochine. Claire Denis produced a movie that has some of the great foundations of Indochine, the complex and unspoken relationship between France and its colonial subjects. <br /> <br /> I was struck by the dignity of Potee, with his struggle to maintain his dignity among his peers and with his white bosses. I was also struck with the love / hate relationship between him and Aimee. It is the latter that gives the film its driving force, which is the last to link this movie to Indochine. <br /> <br /> One is never sure what motivates everyone, although some characters are needed to remind colonialism. It is this cynical side of the story that links it to Coup de Torchon. They are the more scandalous story, perhaps even more interesting in a depraved way, but Denis reminds us how it was with all the tension and unsolved relationships. <br /> <br /> The American black growing up gives France a ride in the beginning and end of the movie yet another interesting side to the confusion we have in the Western world when we look at Africa. He said when he came, he wanted to call every brother. He came home, but they just thought he should be a little thing. France, the character and the girl, grew up in Cameroon, but did not fully understand what it was, although they could remember what it was. <br /> <br />
