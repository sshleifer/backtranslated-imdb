Reese Witherspoon plays Dani, a young country girl who falls in love with the new 17-year-old neighbor, Court, played by Jason London. Court is trying its best to make Dani realize that the difference in their ages will make a love affair unlikely. Soon the noble charm of Dani will begin over the court's will. Next is the encounter of Dani's older sister, played by Emily Warfield, and the start of a brief love / jealousy problem. <br /> <br /> Tess Harper and Sam Waterston make the cast. It is a fresh, generous; but heartbreaking drama that gets deep. Feel free to cry.
