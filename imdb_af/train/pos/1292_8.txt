Preston Waters, an 11-year-old boy, has problems with his parents and brothers, especially because of money issues. He loves to have his own house and his own rules, as his brothers have always stolen his saved money and neglected his parents' wishes. An awful day, Preston is riding his bike; It was the same day that the villain of the story, Quigley, tried to get rid of the police and accidentally ran the car over Preston's bike. Quigley must get away from the police in a hurry, a check to cover Preston's bicycle damage. The problem was: It was an empty check! Preston is a smart boy and decides to have a high price on the check: $ 1 million! All the money gives Preston things he always wanted, like a house with pool, lots of toys, and even a limousine! The problems begin when the FBI and Quigley want to know where the money is, Preston in a difficult situation and with many problems. <br /> <br /> This movie was one of my favorites during my childhood. :)
