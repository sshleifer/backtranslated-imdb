Well done ghost story that gives you the creeps and some nice screams along the way. The story unfolds slowly, building atmosphere all the way until you are ready to see the woman in black. You won't forget her once you've seen her. No gore, no knives, no hockey masks - just a well-built story that is best seen in the evening with the lights out.
