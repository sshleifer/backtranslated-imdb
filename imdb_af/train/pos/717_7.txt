great Ramones fan. I do like the ramons, and I suppose if you hate them, then, besides an avid Bush supporter, you can't like these classics. <br /> <br /> It's much better than the juicy John Hughes teenage films and the 80's. infinitely better than the American Pie that plagues us. <br /> <br /> There are other great high school movies: Switchblade Sisters, Fast Times ..., Class of '84, Three O'Clock High, and the cheesy but grabbing (doesn't seem possible) River's Edge. But RnRHS will always be my favorite as it is the funniest and fun, plus you can get up and dance. <br /> <br /> I love you, Riff Randell. <br /> <br /> 10/10
