This work is less about Steve Martin's character Davis, as it is about Kline (Mack) and Glover (Simon), and Kline and McDonnell (Claire), but the dialogue inserted via Davis considers contemplative, post-poetic existentialism at its best. He is spiritual, intelligent and considerate in both dialogue and content. The authors deserve an Oscar. <br /> <br /> The performances are easy, relaxed and natural; just what you would expect from a list actor. Martin carries the show that leads to his more recent Shop Girl, who leads you through life, love and the pursuit of wisdom, if not happiness. Kline is the straight - the pack - the concept of the movie, and so his performance is sharp and refreshing. <br /> <br /> This work is about life in every way. It gives a real emotional investment in his characters, and makes you feel hopeful that mankind is not doomed, after all, no matter what you believe, deep. <br /> <br /> All in all? It's great, with a keen moment or two, and an easy-to-use natural dialogue that works and helps your audience to enjoy this work. It is definitely worth your time, but it may not be everybody's best choice when entertaining on Friday / Saturday night. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the intelligence it exhibited. It's not typical, and was an unexpected surprise. Another wonderful surprise was the honesty displayed here. The couples and friends have detailed conversations that feel and sound completely honest and (again) of course. I was very impressed with this work and will soon add it to the DVD collection. <br /> <br /> It awards a 9.1 / 10 of ... <br /> <br /> The Enemy :.
