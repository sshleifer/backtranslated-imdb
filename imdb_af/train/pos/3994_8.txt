I just went to this movie because I was towed there and I would have run away immediately because the audience consisted mainly of older people and I felt out of place. However, the film was quite fascinating and far from targeting old people. The characters were all very real and credible and I discussed myself the hours later behind the film, the characters and the storyline. There are some impressive screens there, but they are needed and help you understand the situation much better. All in all, it's a good and valuable movie - slightly out of the mainstream, but that doesn't mean that this movie can't be enjoyed by people who prefer it. It's an exciting and interesting movie experience.
