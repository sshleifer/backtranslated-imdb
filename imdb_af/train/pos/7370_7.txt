Some have compared this movie to Salvation. I believe that mice and men are more appropriate. Our leading man, Heaton, is definitely fond of Spike. It is irrelevant and unimportant whether it is a sexual love. That's why Heaton doesn't leave Spike. He needs him. They need each other. As brothers, as family, as their only connection with humanity. The setting, scenario, minimal cast all adds up to a fine movie. Frankly, I don't care what happened to the characters. But, I care what the filmmaker did to them. He did well with them. For a long time I spent how the end would look like Van Muise and Mans. The soundtrack and cinematography were compelling and intriguing.
