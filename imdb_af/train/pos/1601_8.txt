It is quite a simple, not very active but very sweet movie. There were moments where I could see why Cher won the Oscar for Best Actress, but there were times when I wondered why Glenn Close didn't win for Deadly Attraction. In any case, Oscar and Golden Globe win, and BAFTA nominated Cher plays Loretta Castorini, a simple low-wage woman who only works by Mr. Johnny Cammareri (Danny Aiello) was asked to marry him. He promised her that he would be back in a month, as his mother was sick, so he had to get so much of his family to attend the wedding. The only problem is that when they find Johnny's one-handed brother Ronny (Golden Globe nominated Nicolas Cage), they start having a relationship, and love continues on the moon scene (where the title comes from). Oscar also nominated the Oscar as Cosmo Castorini, Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe who won Olympia Dukakis as Rose Castorini and John Mahoney as Perry. It ended with no wedding for Johnny and Loretta, but she and Ronny were happy together. It wrote the Oscar for best writing, script, won directly for the screen. It was nominated for Best Director of Norman Jewison (In the Heat of the Night) and Best Picture. It was nominated for the best score for Dick Hyman and Best. Original screenplay, and this is the Golden Globes nominated for the best film - Comedy / Musical and Best Screenplay. It was number 96 on 100 years, 100 quotes ("Snap out!"), It was number 17 on 100 years, 100 passions, and it was number 41 on 100 years, 100 Laughs. Very good!
