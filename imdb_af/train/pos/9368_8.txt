I returned from a screening a few hours ago, and I was very happy with the movie when I left it. It's very intense, and I've been crying in a movie for quite some time. It is an incentive for Adam Sandler, who at many levels produces a beautiful show, and who probably earns an Oscar for it, did not come out so early in the year. Don Cheadle gives his usual beautiful performance that the straight man plays to Adam's store. <br /> <br /> There is some humor, but most are just funny compared to the reverberation moments, as Adam handles his loss and Don struggles to help him. Adam plays two levels very well ... when he is spiritually stable, he is funny and nice, but when he is, well, less stable, he is powerful and dark. <br /> <br /> I recommend it to anyone who is intensely engaged in spiritual drama about difficult friendship and loss.
