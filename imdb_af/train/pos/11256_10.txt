Without a doubt, the best of John Le Carre's novels has been transformed into a classic movie. Performances by Peter Egan (Magnus Pym, The Perfect Spy), Rudiger Weigang (Axel, real name Alexander Hampel, Magnus's Czech Intelligence controller), Ray McAnally (Magnus's royal father) and Alan Howard (Jack Brotherhood, Magnus's mentor, believer and British controller, along with the rest of the characters, is so perfect and of course, the person responsible for the casting of them must receive an award. Even the small parts, like Major Membury, are perfectly executed. It speaks highly of the power of the performances and the strength of the characters in the novel, which, despite the double Magnus, cannot help but closer to Magnus and Axel than to Jack Brotherhood and the clever Grant Leader of American intelligence. I read the book at least a dozen times, and I watched the movie almost as many times, and remain fascinated by both. If I had one book to record a desert island, a perfect spy would be the choice above all others.
