This is a movie I can see and never get tired of, it has a lot of laughter, guns, action, crime, good one linen and a decent plot, with a top, Donald Sutherland in a rather comical role as Assasain. Tia Carerra looks as hot as she ever did and can also act. Thomas Ian Griffin is great in this as the main character "Max" a DEA agent. Diane is the FBI agent, played by Carerra, and John Lithgow of Frazier on TV. the bad guy, "Livingston". The plot centers on Max and Diane, who catch Livingston while fighting and arguing about who gets the money for the respective agencies, throwing in the Assassain Sutherland, which has pretty much all the good one liners, that's the perfect crime hijacker , there is the usual love story, but played much differently than Carerra and Griffith would think. You have also thrown the Russian mafia, Italian Mafia and Chinese Mafia into the mix, the movie was shot in Boston, where you have some good shots, and locals, fantastic photography and music in this movie, this movie is just the chapter of a crime comedy, it has everything one can ever have. Look out of Sutherland's toilet in a particular scene, very unusual. This movie is a riot and will make you work hard. 10 plus for me.
