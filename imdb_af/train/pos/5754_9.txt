I remember seeing this one when I was seven or eight. I had to find the characters, because they left an impression in my mind that lasted long after the end of the movie. And the end, now it's sad, well ... for a 7-8 year old child. <br /> <br /> I had the opportunity to see this movie again recently, and found that the plot was too simple, the character, two-dimensional ... I think it's the kind of movie you just got with the innocence of a young child can ... Fear ... <br /> <br /> I recommend this one to all your parents with small children ... (I saw it in its original French version, so I can't tell you if the translation is good or not.)
