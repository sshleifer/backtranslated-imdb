From the beginning I was so excited to see this movie. The poster might be the funniest thing I've ever seen for a movie. I immediately bought one for my dorm in September. <br /> <br /> Every element came together so beautifully in this movie. It's not often you see a movie with so many penis, gay and racial jokes praised by critics. Carell and the rest of the film sensationally deliver every racial joke. Carell stays sweet throughout the movie by the end of the movie that he carries to him to succeed in his relationship more than you have to lie to him. The supporting role is brutal, each one has problems with the ladies themselves. <br /> <br /> One of the things about this movie is the abundance of memorable scenes we've given. It makes a movie easy to remember fondly. This movie is often raised when the words "breastwashing" and "condoms" are mentioned. <br /> <br /> Look at the theater. I was amazed at how many older people there were to see it. I saw a group of four mid-60's coming in. Despite an older audience, this movie still filled the entire theater with laughter. <br /> <br /> I think the people who like this are the supporters of the office and Steve Carell. Many of the jokes remind me of the kind of jokes you want to see at Family Guy. The film is level enough for adolescent boys and still sweet and smart enough for middle-aged women. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend going to this movie if you are not a fan of curse or if you are easily offended. But if you're in the movie, just remember this movie is all in good humor. The jokes aren't "gay jokes," they're just jokes. And they are funny.
