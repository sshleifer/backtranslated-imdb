If it is action and adventure you want in a movie, you would be best advised to look elsewhere. On the other hand, if it's a lazy day and you want a good movie to go with that mood, check out 'The Straight Story.' <br /> <br /> Richard Farnsworth puts a compelling performance as the soft and gentle Alvin Straight, in this true story of Alvin's journey on a rowing car over three states to see. <br /> <br /> Farnsworth is perfect in this role, as he travels his long and winding road, makes friends of strangers and slumber many grandfather-type advice on family along the way. The story moves as slowly as the riding car driver, but somehow manages to watch the viewer and wait for the next lesson that Alvin will present. <br /> <br /> Stretch out on the couch, relax and enjoy. This is the only way to watch this very good movie, which is a 7/10 in my book.
