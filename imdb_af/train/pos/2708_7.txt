After not being arrested for more than 10 or more than 40 years of drug trafficking and refusing to give her action, Jackie (Erica Gavin of Russ Meyer's "Vixen" and "Beyond the Valley of the Dolls" in her Last film role should become accustomed to life, or at least try, in this early movie by Jonathan Demme in the big pop house. Because of his folly and mere visibility, I would also be one of his best films, right under the "Silence of the Lambs" and "Stop Making Sense", but so far above any of his other films. These underage classics are just campy, sloppy and fun enough to be an incredibly good culprit, and luckily you'll never be overboard after the Women In Prison genre parody. It wiped out the extremely bad taste of the ridiculously beautiful "Philidelphia" from my mouth. However, the film is not without apostasy (the 'un'talent show is a BIG task to go through and goes on for too long, Barbera Steele is sadly wasted, among other things, small things) But don't let that stop you no. <br /> <br /> My Degree: B- <br /> <br /> DVD Extras: 5 Minutes Roger Corman Maintenance; Cast & crew Bios; Original Trailer; and "Candy Stripe Nurses" Trailers (with Nudity), "Big Bad Mama 2", "Big Doll House" (with Nudity), & "Crazy Mama" <br /> <br /> Eye Cake: Juanita Brown, Cheryl " Rainbeaux "Smith, Erica Gavin, Roberta Collins, Ella Reid, Lynda Gold, and some others all show skin.
