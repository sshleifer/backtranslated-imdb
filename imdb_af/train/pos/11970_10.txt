Full House came to me when I was about 9. I remember seeing the return of America's finest home videos with Bob Saget, and one day my mom told me he was also in a show called Full House. One day I was lucky to catch an episode while visiting family. It didn't seem to be too interesting, but as I had been watching more and more, I had a night out at 9:00. It will really be you want to be there. <br /> <br /> yourself, hang out with the girls, go with them, and maybe even their little family "sing-alongs". <br /> <br /> The thing I like most about Full House is that it's a great show for kids and adults of all ages. There will be some areas that are more for adults than for kids, so the whole family will enjoy it. No matter how cute it may be, it's still a good show, and I definitely recommend it to anyone. <br /> <br /> 10/10
