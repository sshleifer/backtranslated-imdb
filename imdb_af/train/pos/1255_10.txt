It's a very good movie. Do you want to know the real reasons why so much here beats this movie? I'll tell you. In this movie you have a black criminal who stands out from a white professor. A black police spokesman telling the white professor is wrong to defend the black criminal and the black policeman looks right. ?? The white professor looks dumb. It always comes down to race. This is an excellent movie. Don't pay attention to the racist. If you can get over it, there are characters played by blacks in this movie, which makes the white characters separate, so you have no problem with this movie. I recommended that everyone watch this movie.
