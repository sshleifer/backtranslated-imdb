I just watched this beautiful Japanese feature film at the 5th annual Roger Ebert judged film festival at the historic Virginia theater in Champaign, Illinois. Although this film, English subtitles, has ballroom dance as its heart, The film actually shows the world outside of Japan, how the rigid structures of family, employment (salaried) and recreation still exist in contemporary Japan. <br /> <br /> Author / director Suo Masauki [I follow the Japanese custom to present the family name (name) first and given name (last)] use the not so popular theme of ballroom dance to the society structure of Show Japan. <br /> <br /> [Also, I won't use the movie characters when world readers are not familiar with Japanese formal names that may be confused. I will refer to the <br /> <br /> actors by their professional acting name as listed in the Internet Data Movie Base.] <br /> <br /> He supports the help of his real wife, professional ballet dancer Kusakari Tamiyo in her first and so far only movie. She is a dance teacher at her father's dance studio. Yet her true ambition is to compete again in an International Dance Competition of which she has been disqualified from the past. No, I won't say why. See the movie. <br /> <br /> Salaryman Yakusyo Koji is the star of the movie. A veteran of about 25 movies since 1979, he has a good performance from a 40-year-old company <br /> <br /> who has a lovely wife, teenage daughter and just his house <br /> < br /> desire. <br /> <br /> Yet, something of his own inner happiness is lacking. Watch this movie to learn how to "get involved" with ballroom dancing and go secretly to <br /> <br /> lessons. Most dancing characters are freed from the traditional <br /> <br /> Japanese social structure hierarchy. They are friendly and warm and inviting. This is, of course, in stark contrast to how Japanese society is structured with its philosophy for everyone and everyone. <br /> <br /> The movie has so many funny moments. The nearly 1,500 theater goers spontaneously laughed at many of the comic moments. It proves <br /> <br /> that the comedy has no foreign language. <br /> <br /> Veteran actor Takenaka Naoto is funny and brilliant as well as Watanabe Eriko. They are two funny characters. <br /> <br /> One can buy or read a college textbook on the structure of life in Japan, or you can see this fine movie and begin to understand how the <br /> <br /> people of Japan grow in a fairly rigid society structure. Watch the movie "Will we dance?" is a quick immersion in further study and looks at other <br /> <br /> Japanese movies. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to everyone. It's funny, it's charming, it'll make you cry a little, and it'll warm your heart. <br /> <br />
