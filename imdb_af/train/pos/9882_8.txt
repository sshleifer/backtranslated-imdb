Currently on METOO's new schedule at 4pm on weekdays, just after "Maverick" and right before Wild, Wild West (followed by Star Trek). <br /> <br /> Don't know if I actually saw I saw an episode when it was originally, but I'm really fascinating about it. Convincing, unusual, surreal stories found in mythical west. And the gas stars are there: Dan Duryea, Lyle Bettger, Brian Donlevy, MacDonald Carey, Rick Jason (a treacherous Mexican), a young Dick Van Patten, Jack Lord, Noah Berry, Jr. (Like a colorful Mexican), Martha Hyer, Marguerite Chapman, even Ann Robinson ("World War"), Gloria Talbott ("I got a monster from outer space") /> <br /> It has for eight seasons, more than 200 episodes, from January 1959 to December 1965. <br /> <br /> Eric Fleming is quite remarkable as route boss Gil Favor, the most solid man who ever lived, with the honorary code of a Samurai, and just the right balance between toughness and openness. I will vote for president every day. (PS He had a very interesting biography: http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0281661/) <br /> <br /> And a young Clint Eastwood is very striking as his impulsive right hand, "Rowdy "Yates. Also, veteran Western actor and country music figure (the immortal "One-eyed, one-horned, Flying Purple People Eater"). Sheb Wooley is there as a seasoned exploration of Pete Nolan. And Paul Brinegar makes the most cantanker-like character of a cook you can call 'Wishbone'. <br /> <br /> And then there's that great theme song performed by the immortal Frankie Laine. (Between that and the "Maverick" theme, I have the Western theme songs all day running through my head.) <br /> <br /> I look forward to each episode; I am collecting the whole set. A good time (not to mention a bustling experience) is always guaranteed, as one waits to see if the boys have settled their problems before the commercial. <br /> <br /> "Rollin ', rollin' rollin '..."
