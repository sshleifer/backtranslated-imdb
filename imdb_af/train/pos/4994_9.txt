Man's Castle is a wonderful example of a pre-code movie. It involves realistic events with truly pleasant and imperfect characters. Spencer Tracy plays Bill, a free soul without a dime in his pocket. He makes some strange jobs and travels to a new city when he is surprised by his environment. One night he meets Trina, a beauty of any standards that is cold and alone. She refused to address prostitution so she did not eat for a few days, but the two were very good at each other and formed a relationship. His free spirit urged him to leave her, so life was rocky, but there was a real spark between the two, even though they lived in a cage near the river. <br /> <br /> Tracy is one of the big actors of the silver screen. His characters are incredible and related. We can see his thoughts on his face, so he can easily identify himself, even if we believe he is acting poorly. Young is great in pre-code movies. Her character is very sweet, but far from perfect, makes her more enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Pre-code elements include lean dip, pregnancy before marriage and crime.
