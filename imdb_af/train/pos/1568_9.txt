Catscratch is the best thing to come from Nickeloden, including Wayne Knight. This show not only appeals to Maoris and PI's. Some people like it, and they're all aussies. At first glance, I admit it looks a bit rough, but it is growing enormously on you. Also, to fix something that one of the other critics said In_Correct (Tv.com) says "Does that mean you're gay now?" He says, "Does that mean you're gay, oh?" This is his phrase in the show. Mr. Look, I think, is the funniest of all like Peww-Weww's Playhouse <br /> <br /> First, I'll admit that the early episode was a little good. But after a while the episodes grew! And just when the series found it to be surreal, whacky ... Nickelodeon cancels it! <br /> <br /> I know Nick is meant for kids, but every time a brilliant show appears to be enjoyed by teenagers. and adults. These performances include Mr. Bean the Animated Series, Charlie Brown, Pelswick, Rocko's Modern Life (by times), and Invader Zim. All these things had to be considered too good, with the exception of CatDog, because Nick had the need to cancel them. <br /> <br /> What I like about the famous final episode, where Gordon fights a duck. /> <br /> I would also like to see a DVD, with many sound comments and behind the scenes, and the final episode. <br /> <br /> But of course, what I 'definitely like to see, the show comes back in the air. Wake up NICK! <br /> <br /> I wish there was a list on the internet somewhere with all the closing awards. It will be great.
