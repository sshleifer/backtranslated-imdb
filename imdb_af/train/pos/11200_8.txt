This early film has its flaws - a predictable plot and a few overhanging screens of dubious relevance - but it clearly shows Hitchcock's mastery of editing and the use of powerful images. It is also stylistically among the most expressionistic of its films; Notice, for the examples, the strange distortions he used during the party sequence and the regular echoes of both title and plot in the images. <br /> <br /> However, the core remains the final match, which remains among the more exciting examples of filmmaking. Although you know that the hero must win, it becomes very credible that he will lose and the movement of his wife from the champion's corner to her, which motivates the final plot write-off, is very much in line with the progress of the game. The stopwatch inserts do exactly what they should; you can almost hear the ticking (though it is a silent movie, the footage often has a surprising auditory feeling to them). The pacing is surprisingly fast and the viewer is sucked into the excitement and brutality of both the game and the sexual jealousy that underlies it. <br /> <br /> The only DVD release I'm familiar with is Laserlight, a public domain company. As with every Hitchcock silent they released, they attached several musical choices, mostly orchestra, to the action. The sound editing is often sloppy, and the sound quality varies a lot, but a few genuine care looks to most of the real choices, and the music that accompanies the final game works very well; It is unlikely that this order will ever be better than it is here. <br /> <br /> This is a very impressive movie that would present the darkness. It deserves an honorable place in both the Hitchcock canon and the sleek list of valuable boxing films.
