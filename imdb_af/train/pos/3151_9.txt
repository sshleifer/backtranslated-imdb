I saw this show about 3-4 years ago. It was damn funny! When I first saw it played on ETV (Estonian Television). And I started enjoying it. It's a pity that the show is bad for me. Hyde is like a cool guy who wants to sing Frank Sinatra! And he comes up with stupid ideas. He has these glasses that are brown. I like that . And there is FeZ. The group Pervert. We all know what he does if he is alone. He wants to lie down badly. He even had it with his boss in one episode. He's from India. And there is Michael, The stupid guy on the whole group, probably stupid in town and she's a policeman! He's so stupid that I remember following: Hyde says: Did you call police? - No Michael comes in and says. Does anyone know how to turn off siren? He's a town playboy. Then comes Jackie, who is Michael's former friend and then she's Hyde's girlfriend. Then Eric Who's son is a cranky war veteran and son of Kitty, the housewife. She's a big vagina. But he loves Donna, his girlfriend with whom they plan for their marriage. Donna is a hot girl. Hmm what i forget? ah Hyde lives in a basement.
