It is very rare for a film to be used for viewers of all ages - for children for a delicate story and a wonderful, colorful production, and for adults for a literate screenplay, good production values, good casting / acting along with ' a good Rozsa score. Two roughly contemporary films reach it - "Thief of Baghdad" (1940) and "The Adventures of Robin Hood" (1938). The story of this production is fascinating. This production, which began in England in the summer of 1939, moved to Hollywood, proving British intelligence efforts! The producer, Alexander Korda, was harassed later in 1942. Here's a unique case of crossing art, commerce and politics! Anyway, secure a good CD of this movie for your library!
