hi, im scott (A.K.A woody7739) I love the movie Twisted Desire, And I like to watch Melissa Joan Hart on the way I think she is good. I'm also a true fan of Sabrina's teenage witch, so it helped me look at it (don't ask). I love the way Nicole plans to kill her parents because she makes sure someone else puts the trigger and practices on the bottles, so she won't give her fingerprints (a very well-planned idea) everyone has returned to Nicole when she was trapped. Her old boyfriend comes along and puts a hidden camera under his shirt. I give this movie a nine out of ten, and put it in MY top 10 movie list. And last but not least if anyone sees this movie in the stores please tell me if I saw it on TV and didn't record it. bye
