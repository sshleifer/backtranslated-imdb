Kurt Russell's chameleon-like performance, along with John Carpenter's flawless filmmaking, makes this one one of the best boob-tube bios ever to be broadcast. It also holds: the emotional foundation is strong enough that it will never age; Carpenter retained the power and ultimate poignancy of the life of the only King of Rock and Roll. (I was the biggest Elvis fan for me, but it was only when I saw this sensible moving movie. I looked at the image myself. It was quite a revelation.) ELVIS remains one of the top ten -Video films of all time.
