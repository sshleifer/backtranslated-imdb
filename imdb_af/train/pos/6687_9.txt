Although I can't claim a comic book fanatic, I read my part, so I think I'm part of the audience of this movie, and I wasn't disappointed. It's almost at the end of the steam, it's almost full of ideas, and Lena Olin, one of my favorite actresses, seems to have been left on the cutter floor. Also, a bit of Hank Azaria's Blue Raja can go a long way. Yet it is easy to forgive all these mistakes when you have a movie that is so much fun. All the actors seem to have an explosion with their roles, especially William H. Macy as the straight-arrow Shoveler, and Janeane Garofalo as The Bowler. And unlike some, I found the city's design to make the joke even more beautiful. I also liked how disco was the music of the bad guys; somehow, it seems appropriate.
