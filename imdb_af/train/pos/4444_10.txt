Most Italian horror lovers seem to hate this movie because it's not related to the first two Demons movies. And with the "Demone III" in the title, one would assume it. The problem is that this movie was never meant to be part of the Demons series. The distributors only have a "Demons III" above their original title "The Ogre" to cash in on the other films' popularity. The new American DVD edition of this photo has the title "Demons III: The Ogre" on the boxing art, but the film itself just says "The Ogre". I don't know if previous issues had the title "Demons III" on the actual movie itself, but this new version just looks like a little white lie. If you can get the "Demons III" in the title, you can get some pleasure in "The Ogre". It starts with a crawling intro, and stays right through. There are no gore and movie movies slow, but I still dug it. Don't just expect it to be like the other Demons movies. I give "The Ogre" 7 out of 10. Italian fans have to try it.
