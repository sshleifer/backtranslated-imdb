One of the best parts of Sundance is to watch movies you would otherwise miss. Unless you are a real artisan delegate, you probably won't get many documentaries. Only a handful gets any recognizable distribution. Fortunately, Sundance has increased its commitment to documentaries over the past year. <br /> <br /> Shakespeare Behind Bars is a powerful documentary about a dramatic production group in the Luther Luckett Correctional Complex in LaGrange, Kentucky. Each year, a group of prisoners offer a Shakespeare game. Director Hank Rogerson and his crew follow the troop as roles self-elected, interpreted, rehearsed and eventually performed. <br /> <br /> The movie is filled with fascinating revelations for those not exposed to prison environments. . Despite the labels we know by (conviction, criminal, killer, etc.), we began to appreciate and respect these men to think about people. Serendipitously, the play of the year of filming, was The Tempest, with its in-depth focus on forgiveness and redemption. The actors all struggle with the relevance of the game to their lives, find patterns and parallels with their characters and the meaning of the play. <br /> <br /> For a documentary film, like a book, the best thing can be We hope we experience something that changes our lives. Shakespeare Back Bars was a personal revelation to me. "O courageous new world, it has such beings in it."
