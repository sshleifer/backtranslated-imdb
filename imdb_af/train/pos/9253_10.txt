Well, the movie isn't exactly "funny." <br /> <br /> Well, I admit, there are a few HUMOROUS lines, but definitely nothing laughing out loud. For example: Just before a steamy sex scene between Eleniak and one of her male costumes, Sh is handcuffed to bed and he can't remove her shirt. Before leaving the room to get the key, he said to her, "Okay, go nowhere." <br /> <br /> See, humorous, but not funny. <br /> <br /> The plot and acting are pretty good. <br /> <br /> But Erika Eleniak definitely steals the show. She is hot and sexy and there is a very steamy scene with her that can't help but play. Repeat as well. There are other very sexy scenes with her and she has many challenging lines. <br /> <br /> Overall, 5 stars. I'll only give it three if it's not for Erika Eleniak.
