This is one of the most wonderful stories I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> If this movie is directed by Larry Clark, this story about a school shooting would probably have been shown by the murderer and whatever made the person in the first place mad. </ br> <br /> Instead, the plot focuses mainly on the aftermath of a school shooting and how it accomplished the survivors. <br /> <br /> I've seen Busy Phillips in other movies before, but her performance in this movie is by far her best. The only other movie I have seen with Erika Christensen is "Swim Fan" which makes me almost not want to see this movie, but she has made a very good performance for herself. <br /> <br /> It's one of the few movies I've seen, was actually able to make me cry. Trust me when I tell you, it doesn't happen very often. <br /> <br /> Home Room is a beautiful movie, and that's all there is ...
