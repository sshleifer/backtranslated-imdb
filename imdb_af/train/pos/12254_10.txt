I watched this movie after watching Paltrow's version. I found that one very well, and I thought it wouldn't be that good ... but I went wrong: the British version was much better and enjoyable! I found Jeremy Northam more "enjoyable" than Mark Strong, but I can say that Strong catches much better than Austen's Knightley. Anyway, both versions are good, but anyone who loves Austen's books should see this movie. I agree with * caalling *: Andrew Davies has changed a few things, but remains true to the original. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 <br /> <br /> My 2 cents!
