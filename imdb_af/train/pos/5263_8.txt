Netflix needs to mention this short feature on the information for Silk Stockings. Better in every way after that over-produced fluff. It had much better Cole Porter songs and much more energy. Silk stockings seem to be a great disappointment. Fred was too old for this kind of thing, although the dances and Cyd are beautiful. I will be looking for the Garbo - Melvyn Douglas version of Ninotchka. Was Peter Lorre sick while making Silk Stockings - he looks very passive in the more active numbers and with fewer lines? Pleased that I accidentally ran through Paree - Paree. Made the whole experience much more enjoyable. Bob Hope, as a simple "song and dancer" is pure joy.
