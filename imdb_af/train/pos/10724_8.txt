It's one of those that feels good, Saturday afternoon movies. It's right there with other retro flicks like Flight of the Navigator. Just a cute movie with a subtle comedy to lift things up. And it's fun to see how 20 years the stars like Kelly Preston and Lea Thompson have changed. Not to mention Joquin Phoenix. <br /> <br /> From time to time I like movies very much. Nothing too deep or too scary. Just a nice story line. And I would never have mr. Phoenix if I didn't read the credits recently. He was just a baby when he made this movie. <br /> <br /> Kelly Preston was also the young emerging actress. She and Lea did a wonderful job in this movie. I agree that this is not an Oscar caliber movie. But many are worth watching. Especially if you have children, we say, 8 to 11 years old. Or those interested in the space program.
