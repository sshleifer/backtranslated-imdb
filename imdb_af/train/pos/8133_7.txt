Well, I don't personally like rap, but I still found fear of a black hat hilarious. I'm sure I didn't get into jokes, but I knew some, and it was funny enough to make me laugh just after I stopped laughing. I'm a big fan of spinal tap, so of course I had to look it out. It was derived from This Is Spinal Tap, sometimes blatantly, but this film still stands on its own as an original, intelligent and funny satire. My personal favorite: "At the time of slaves they did not have to protect them from the sun, so by the end of the day they were too tired to rebel. Now we have to beware."
