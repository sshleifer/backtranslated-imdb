When a small hobbit named Frodo Baggins inherits a magical ring from his uncle, the wizard investigates Gandalf and discovers that the ring is an ancient creation of an evil, black gentleman. When the ring returns in his hands, he will regain his power and destroy the Middle Earth. Frodo and his loyal friends made an attempt to destroy the ring with a group of warriors. This is an underestimated adaptation of the classic novels, as it covers only the first half of the story. Regardless, this is an epic and wonderfully animated movie. <br /> <br /> The animation has been done wonderfully with rotoscope, which traces live action recordings. Ralph Bakshi worked well with the low budget he gave. The film also boasts a great music score by Leonard Rosenman who suits every scene. There are a few plot holes with the script, but it has to be excused, as the original deal was to make the storyline in two movies. Many had to be packed in the first one. My biggest grip is some of the character design, Samwise was a bit too goofy, while the other hobbits are quite normal. The other characters are actually well written for the screen, and the voice actors do a good job, I was glad Legolas actually did a little more with the plot. The rotoscoped orcs are more comical than frightening, while the ringwraiths are terrible and nightmare. <br /> <br /> Another problem is that evil wizard Saruman, thanks to the authors, is called Aruman. Overall, I think a little more money and better writers would have done a lot of justice, but there is something nice about it. Ralph Bakshi made a brave effort to make screen customization of these classic stories. The movie is terribly over-shadowed by the live action movies, but it's still a great movie for animation lovers of all ages.
