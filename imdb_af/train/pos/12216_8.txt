The movie first appeared in Indonesia this year (2007), two years after it was officially released, and after many illegal DVDs found their way to the public. Apparently, the popularity of the illegal DVDs has led to the release in the theaters, after which the public still looks. <br /> <br /> The movie is a great epic, which brings Japanese culture to your home in an exciting way. In a sometimes humorous way, the story is told of a theater writer who writes a story for his theater, as the regular Kabuki play is something he finds boring. <br /> <br /> Initially, the audience may be a little confused about what story we follow, but when the story unfolds, we see that the love between a male and a female demon is a good story for resulting in a new Kabuki theater play. <br /> <br /> The audience is left in the dark if it's a story that's supposed to really happen in Japanese traditions and mythology, but it doesn't matter. <br /> <br /> The way the story is told with a love of theater, expression, vibrant colors, humor and tragedy makes it a great ride on the roller coaster of Japanese theater and theater. Let yourself go completely if you watch this movie, try to see it. in a theater instead of on your television at home. <br /> <br /> One critical point though: the soundtrack is sometimes a bit annoying. Although most of them are good music, there are a few moments in the movie that I think they should have chosen more dramatic music. But perhaps the story contains humorous moments, the director also chooses for lighter moments in music.
