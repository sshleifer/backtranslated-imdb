I lost the count of how many times I saw this movie - I probably know the whole dialogue backwards - but I get it regularly again. <br /> <br /> In Hungary, a young Jimmy Stewart plays the qualifying bachelor "Kralik" who becomes the secret admirer of Margaret Sullavan's innocent "Klara". Kralik becomes the secret of Klara's pen friend, and at work Klara trusts in Kralik about the contents of his (Kralik's) letters. Kralik is clearly busy with Klara, but cannot make his feelings known while in competition with the "pen friend". Confused? Well, you won't be - this story has a sweet, almost pure ending - but we all know it's the end we all want. <br /> <br /> Other significant characters are Frank Morgan, who plays his regular role, this time as the shop's owner "Hugo Matuschek", Felix Bressart as "Pirovitch", Kralik's confidant. Joseph Schildkraut as the female arrogant Vadas - played so well that you can't help him but hate from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Finally, William Tracy succeeded in getting himself all of us with his excess start-up of a junior store "Pepi Katona". <br /> <br /> Recently restored as "You've Got Mail" with Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan. For me, it's not as good as the original - although I suspect younger audiences wouldn't agree. <br /> <br /> If this movie is about your Christmas, I suggest you throw a nice glass of wine, set a match and fire a box of Kleenex.
