Again Stacy is Peralta, first to the people who lived the story. By telling those involved in the emergence of big waves, we tell their stories, how they felt and what they thought, you get the feeling to be there. The film brings you from the fifties to the near presence by focusing on three primary architects that contribute to the development and development of the sport. Candidates "home movies" like videos of themselves and their contemporaries take you further into their world. The low music, culture, technical information, a pure image of the participant's athletics, and fantastic grandiose images get a full perspective on this aspect of surfing. <br /> <br /> Worth watching.
