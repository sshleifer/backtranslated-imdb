I really enjoyed recording the Dick Tracy persona. It is a well-done product that uses modern technology to produce an image-crafted comic era story. If you're a fan or recently watched some of the old Dick Tracy b & w movies, you're sure to get a kick out of this version. The pastel colors and larger than life characters rendered in a painfully authentic take on an era are entertained as it is meant to be. I personally find Madonna's musical element an important part of this movie. The CD that contains her music from this movie is one I've heard over the years. It was just as well done and musically performed and adapted to that era. In my mind, Madonna's best moment, both on the screen, but especially musical. It is certain that you bring the "child" into you.
