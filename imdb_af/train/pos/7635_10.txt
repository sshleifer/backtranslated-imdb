I've seen this movie many times and I have to tell you, I've enjoyed it every time. This is Belushi's top film in my opinion. Belushi and Lovitz are so nice and identifiable with the ordinary man you can't help but get involved as soon as you start watching. The movie has a wonderful movie of stars, some were already big, and others just started. It's billed as a good movie, and that's exactly what it is. This movie teaches you that life is not always so bad. Sometimes you just have to look at things in a different perspective to fully appreciate what you already have. When you're done watching, you'll appreciate the things you have a lot more and you'll also smile. You can't ask much more from a movie in my opinion, not to speak, it's a hilarious movie and you'll never lose interest. Many many underestimated people here. <br /> <br /> Rating of me: 10 I'm out !!!
