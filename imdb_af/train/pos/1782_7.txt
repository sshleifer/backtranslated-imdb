I watched this movie three times. The last time I went on confusing scenes to find resolution for the plot. Perhaps the plot is not meant to hang logically together. Or perhaps these rough spots are in the plot, because Ann's recall of distant events is pretty wrong. <br /> <br /> Take the young Ann Grant (Claire Danes). Here is a young woman who attended an unnamed college with the scions of a wealthy family. She needed help to afford this very expensive education, but not at all family ties. She never seems to have any relatives she can turn to when the consequences of one of her disastrous decisions come into effect. Ann shares a passion with her great love Harris Arden (Patrick Wilson). Then, when Harris Lila comforts after the tragic death of her brother Buddy, Ann suddenly finds himself disturbing and frightened of her own behavior. I must have missed something meaningful here. Ann's behavior seems completely inexplicable. Ann leaves her relationship with Harris and eventually marries one of the groomsmen at Lila's wedding. Despite Ann's rejection of Harris, she still keeps deep feelings for him on her deathbed. <br /> <br /> It was clear from his actions that Harris was deeply beaten with Ann and wanted to marry her. A scene showing their accidental year after Lila's wedding showed that Harris still had deep feelings for Ann. <br /> <br /> The movie showed a pattern for Ann's romantic relationships. She always fell out with her husbands and she rejected them. This pattern holds for Harris and two men. In contrast, Lila married a man she didn't love and she stayed with her husband until he died. Perhaps Lila was able to build a relationship because she refused to let her marriage fail. <br /> <br /> Then came the easy revival of Lila Ross at Ann's bed. Apparently Ann's nurse was able to extract enough information from Ann's last few bright moments to identify and contact Lila. None of this communication appeared on the movie. <br /> <br /> I wondered about the house in which Ann lived in her last days. How did she afford to buy such a home on the low earnings of her singing career? Ann always looked ahead of the financial disaster while raising her two daughters. <br /> <br /> On another level, I really enjoyed the movie's environment and music. The sea house was just as heartbreakingly beautiful. Claire Danes was lighter than the young Ann Grant. She is really a talented singer. I prefer her natural brunette very much to the blonde look she had in the movie extras. If only those leftover CGI fireflies were to break away, I could raise the movie a whole point in my voice!
