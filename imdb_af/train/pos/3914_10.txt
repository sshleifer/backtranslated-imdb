Personally, I think the film was done very professionally, I loved the choreography and acting. The plot is also tempting and mysterious. The movie itself is very emotional, and what I like about it is that it reminds you. Antonio Gades lived his role to the end, and I have to say this is one of my favorite photos and Saura is a wonderful director.
