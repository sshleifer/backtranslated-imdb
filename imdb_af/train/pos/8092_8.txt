I happened on this movie as an 8-10 year old man on a cold, dark November afternoon. I was out all day, freezing, and when I arrived at 4pm, I put a cup of hot cocoa and sat down with a blanket in front of the TV. I was surprised to see a cartoon that wasn't all happy and stupid - and was actually dark and moral. It caught my imagination. I'm sure it misses the text, and is abbreviated in all the wrong places for the Tolkien purist. But it still captures the spirit of the story, the choice to carry the good of others, the consequences of selfish, rash decisions, and so on. The quality of the animation leaves room for complaints. But the one place where this movie clearly rises above the new movies is the voice characteristics. John Hurt is great in this. If you don't like how the character is drawn, look away and just listen to him. His voice is extraordinary. I've seen it many times, and it always brings me back as a child, thirsty for a magical adventure. It is for this reason that I say 'happy', the film is nostalgic to me, so I overlook the shortcomings. But between John Hurt and Tolkien's fantasy, it still reached me and still.
