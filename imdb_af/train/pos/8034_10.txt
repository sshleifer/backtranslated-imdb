There are few movies that are both enterntainment and realism. If you've ever wondered about the role of snipers in the modern war, look at this one. <br /> <br /> I just loved the scene where one hundred soldiers shot at the jungle, no one is sure where the shot came. <br /> <br /> And they got one scene to save Private Ryan. So it should have some earnings in the scene. <br /> <br />
