What does the Marquis de Sade have to do with Egyptian archeology and mermaid worshiping cults? Tobe Hooper tries to answer that question in one strange film. <br /> <br /> Genie is a young girl visiting her northern archeology father in Alexandria, Egypt. Genius is caught with a mysterious hooker (and blatant lesbian) who serves couples on the side. Dad is sent back to the site, where he discovers a tomb with what a mermaid seems to be. Genie meets a descendant of the Marquis de Sade, and falls to a base of Egyptian (offering the movie's hottest scenes). Eventually, Genie finds out she must be a sacrifice and the prolonged and bloody climax is going on. Wrapped around this story, footage of the Marquis de Sade is in jail, and speaks to a portrait of what looks like Genie. <br /> <br /> Robert Englund is wonderful as both the Marquis and his descendant. His acting abilities are always separated by his makeup requirements, so that he can shine here. His best performance is still in "Killer Tongue", if you haven't seen it yet. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie, including Young Genie, is beautiful and average. However, the writing is problematic. You will quickly learn that the Marquis scenes are completely unnecessary, except perhaps the movie makers had access to the cool set. The mermaid cult that eventually saves Genie makes no sense. Whoever is the mermaid is never explained, and his connection to Christianity (obstructed by the whole film) is nothing. The film is very anti-Christian, as the archaeologist is a Bible-emerging father, but likes to be tied up by the local prostitute. There are many scenes of depravity and violence, but Hooper probably has little idea of ​​what the scriptwriters are trying to say. I know I have no idea. <br /> <br /> Why do I recommend this movie? It's weird. There is an extended sex scene. For the ladies, the Egyptian hunt drives a horse completely naked. Englund is wonderful. Do you like snakes? This movie is full of them. It's like Roger Corman with a bigger budget. Knowledge of Hooper came in one way or another with "Crocodile" after it was rather sad. "Nightmare" is not perfect, but definitely worth a wink, insignificant look. <br /> <br /> It is judged (R) for physical violence, sexual violence, gore, curse, female nudity, male nudity, sexual content, sexual references, and drug abuse. <br /> <br />
