A woman brought a boy to this world and was alone. They were both alone because a boy had a gift and a curse in one suit - he could withdraw sword from his arm. There was always a wound on his wrist in the cause of this "gift" - the wound of the deadliest weapon in his body. First, he kills his constantly drunk stepfather who hurts his mother every time. Then he grows up and decides to find his real father. Just as simple as ever for a superhero - he reaches justice .... but society decides this justice is not necessary and dangerous. It is indeed right, because it is not like Hollywood movies that do not try to kill someone - Sasha (he is the main hero acted by Artem Tkachenko) as the person who in his opinion deserves to die, but blame of authorities and runs. In such a runaway government and Mafia he meets a girl (acted by Chulpan Hamatova) and falls in love with her. All the others should be looked at ... not tell. Be aware that this film is more about feelings and emotions, but not about actions. This film is full of pain from the main character full of him and his vision of life.
