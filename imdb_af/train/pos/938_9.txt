Although George C. Scott is the only actor in this version of ACC without a British accent, he does it more with his over-the-top and greater-than-life interpretation of Ebenezer Scrooge. <br /> <br /> Particularly effective is confronting Bob Cratchit in his office at the movie's end. While Scott was standing in front of a large window, sunlight threw a glowing cloak over him; All you can see is his silhouette. Strengthened by Scott's voice, a peculiar growl, the effect is galvanized ... much like Marlon Brando's first scene in APOCALYPSE NOW. "The Horror," indeed! <br /> <br /> But as they say, the thing that works for you can work against you as well. Since Scott shows such lasting anger in the movie, it seems to be contagious. To put it differently, the "before" Scrooge is almost as charismatic as the "after", though he really shouldn't be. This is what you can call the "Doctor Smith" effect, as Jonathan Harris used a very similar approach to using that role and many other heavy tracks (stage and screen). <br /> <br /> Actually, I myself do not consider Scott's glib rage a liability. But other "Christmas Carol" purists power. See the movie and judge for yourself.
