It's a very dense, gloomy and intricate film that unfolds quite slowly, revealing exciting detail, such as the attention given to a novel, and watching this movie "IS" like seeing a novel unfold. While I didn't care about the narrator, as I felt, he wasn't in balance with the rest of the shows, this movie has some of the best ensemble plays I've ever seen, and starring, Summer Phoenix , is fantastic. Her innocence and naive might be indisputable, like a cross between Cinderella and Alice in Wonderland. I can buy that criticism, but she is still fabulous, partly because she is different from what I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> This movie is incredibly beautiful, filmed by Eric Gautier and part of what is so unique about this movie is how it never shows what you would expect. It's always surprising, and yet the movie is never known anymore as it needs. At 163 minutes it is extremely concise, an error I want to say, which is one of the wonders of this movie. It's filled with short moments that are just stunning, the best you'll probably see all year long, and all these moments eventually add to an extraordinary movie experience. The family moments are unique, Ian Holm is brilliant, and what this movie is about to say is not seen in movies since Cassavete's "Opening Night" or maybe Chaplin's "Limelight." But, believe it or not, this movie is much "less" conventional. I never knew where this movie was going, and now, seeing it, has several possibilities. It's a powerful, incredibly challenging movie.
