It is not so bad that it is good, it is pure good! For those who do not understand why, you have the mind of a four year old (in response to a certain comment ...) Anyways, Killer Tomatoes Eat France is a parody of himself, a parody of yours and a parody of mine. This is the most brilliant text in film history. I did it and the three prequels sat next to my DVD rack next to Herzog and Kurosawa. It embodies the recognition of absurdity and undermines everything you or I call standard. I write scripts and this movie once opened a genre of comedy for me, as we have never seen before. It can only be taken in portions ... its kind of operators ... now I'm just trying to take the ten line minimum. My comments ended a while. Hopefully it works when I submit it now.
