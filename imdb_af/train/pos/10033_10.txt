The movie Titanic makes it much more than just a "night to remember." This again writes a tragic history event that is always spoken and will never be forgotten. Why so criticized? I have no idea. Can / will they ever make a movie like Titanic that moves and touches every time you see it. They could ever replace such an epic masterpiece. It will be almost impossible. <br /> <br /> The director undoubtedly had the biggest impact on the film. A simple disaster movie (boring to watch) transforms into incredible romance. Yes, I'm not the type of romance either, but it shouldn't bother you, because you'll never see such a romance. Guaranteed! Everything for the great effects, for the music, for the sublime acting. <br /> <br /> The movie creates a wonderful visual and wonderful feeling. Everything really looks and lives. The legend itself "TITANIC" is brilliantly displayed in all classes, to look, also to stay. The acting was the real effect. Dicaprio and Winslet are simply the best to play roles there. No one could have done better. They are partly the reason why the film is so big. <br /> <br /> I don't think it's too much to talk about. The plot is simple. The acting is brilliant, based on a true story. Probably more than half of the consumers watching the movie will share tears, thanks to an unknown end that can never be forgotten. Well, if you haven't seen this movie, you miss out on something Hesteries, and a movie to idolize Hollywood. Can it get better? No at all. The most moving movie of all time, does not listen to people, see for yourself then you will understand. A landmark. (Don't be surprised if you cry too)
