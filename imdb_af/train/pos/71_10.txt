I couldn't believe the comments made about the movie. <br /> <br /> While reading the horrible opinions about the movie, I actually wondered if you actually saw the same movie I did. <br /> <br /> What I saw was incredible! I think the actresses and directors did a fantastic job in the movie. <br /> <br /> I didn't have the pleasure of seeing actress before, and I could no longer be held back by the incredible work I had to say to the most credible movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> What I don't see is why everyone has such a problem with Deanna's choice of drug in the suicide scene. From the comments you made sure it was the actress's choice and her stupid choice. That I do not understand is a movie written by someone else and arranged by someone else, so it can be the actress mistake I don't see. I think it was a truly credible movie I would see and recommend again. Opinions are what they are and it's so bad that so many are so close. I hope to see one of the actors soon. I think everyone played big roles. Busy Philipps will one day be the highest paid actress and I hope she can laugh in the face of anyone who has criticized her! You Go Girl!
