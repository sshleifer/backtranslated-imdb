Mardi Gras: Made in China offers a wonderful, intricate connection between popular culture, nudity and globalization by making and throwing beads. I watched this film at the Boston International Film Festival and expect a dry introduction to globalization, but what I got was a resounding visual display of shocking footage from both China and the United States. The eye-opening movie is humorous, in-depth, serious, non-patronizing, and it wants you more than the credit role. It is worth comparing with Murderball - it's simply done so well. The young women workers in China have different views, and the owner is incredibly open about the discipline. The revealers at Carnival are the highlight, but just because this excellent film is in depth in the factory in China without telling. Bravo to the movie maker to enter and finish the movie! I would never have thought about the relationship between beads, China and New Orleans; Now I think of the human connection between almost every object, but also the role of globalization, inequality and fun. More importantly, I can make these connections without feeling a sense of guilt after watching this movie, unlike other movies about globalization that I have seen.
