Full points for Pacino's delivery of the speech about the child's coffin; Shakespeare's Mark Antony will be ashamed! <br /> <br /> Was it Paul Schrader or was it Ken Lipper to be complimented on the remarkable dialogues? They are rich and intelligent and are worth your time if you like movies with good scripts. I found the storytelling to be quite well developed up to the voice-over inscription. <br /> <br /> There is nothing else to talk about this movie; even John Cusack did better than this one. Interestingly, the film is very masculine-oriented - the women are mere additions.
