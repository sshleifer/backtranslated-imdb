Okay, so I'm now far from Houston, but if I see this movie, I'm taken back to a little cowgirl's dream of someday driving the bull to Gilley. (It burned down before I was old.) <br /> <br /> Growing up in East Texas, you know this movie is an accurate portrayal of contemporary life. If you didn't trust me and watch the movie. Or you will be with the many who love it (and at the same time weirdly), or at least you can enjoy the redheads. (There is enough material to make fun.) This movie does not try P.C. don't be. (what was it in the 80's) or hide the white trash element and it's fair to time and place. <br /> <br /> Must be a 10 for me!
