Most horror movies are actually horrible movies. They become the same ol. The same goes every minute with some cheap excitement (usually 'flatter') and nowadays they can pack up with special special effects every second. One of the goals of a very good horror movie is to suspend the feeling of disbelief from the audience. For example, I have both seen the recent Mummy movies and have received exceptional thousands of special effects each time. It probably costs a million dollars a second to make those movies and my sense of unbelief has never been suspended, it has become roots. <br /> <br /> Subtlety can be more scary. Less is more. <br /> <br /> I first saw 'The Woman in Black' on the A&E channel. After I flung through the ordinary 987 channels of very bad television, I stopped watching it. This movie has almost the feel of a 'masterpiece' production. It was good with me, but I always preferred British television and movies. <br /> <br /> Most viewers will find it too slow. But the slow stimulation helps to give the story credibility. The special effects are few, which lets the viewer think that this movie is set in the real world, which makes us more uncomfortable. The makeup and costume for the ghost is kept simple and credible. Hollywood would make her look like a devil from hell with glowing eyes-claws, etc. Hollywood made a leftover and made this idea mediocre. <br /> <br /> The movie only makes five appearances. Most of them are where they are in the distance and it even creates a fright. If she appeared too often, it could have made the state of mind cheaper. However, this film was made so well that many of the film led us to make sense that she was there all the time, but not visible. The scene where she visits Arthur Kidd late at night and we only see her a little too close is a horror masterpiece. <br /> <br /> It's just an extraordinary movie I think should be considered one of the best. horror movies ever made. I have a copy of 'The Haunting', 'The Changling' and a Million more. I didn't see anything tops 'The Woman in Black', though I still watch. This movie is so well-made that it even gives the hardest skepticism (like me), where I had almost second thoughts about the non-existence of ghosts. I joke to people that I sometimes fear that she might be standing in the middle of the road or seeing my staring through my window. Maybe she could be in the mall at the mall looking at hate. That's how a huge horror movie should be. Like a LaFanu novel, the woman in black pulls you in very slowly and turns her around your neck and before you realize it, she expresses life and it is too late. <br /> <br /> The closest thing I'm criticizing is that it's made for the small screen ... and it's a terrible shame that it's out of print. I paid just over $ 40 for my second copy of this movie. It's a big prize in my collection. Now I'm looking for an even better horror movie that not only gives the cold fever but also qualifies a good drama.
