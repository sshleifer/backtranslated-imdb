This movie caught my heart from the start when I heard Quincy Jones' first notes or the wonderful color purple of the flowers in the meadow. It's really a movie to cry and die for ...! The whole movie gives the best performance in a movie I've seen for years and Spielberg really surprised himself! Whoppi Goldberg, Margaret Avery, Oprah Winfrey (oh sir!), Danny Glover, and others, give us their best and you can feel it - almost touch it! Goldberg IS Celie, she gives her the insecurity and sense of inferiority needed for the character, and we grow with her, we grow strong with her throughout the movie and we triumph with her. Margaret Avery is wonderful as Shug Avery, even though she is at her most arrogant, and shows us that "sinners" indeed have souls as well. The always sympathetic, charming Danny Glover makes a great job of making people hate and the wonderful music of (I want to say, sir). Quincy Jones adds even more beauty to this beautiful movie! Photography, music, director and music make this beautiful, soulful movie an experience of life. You don't want to miss it! "Sista" ... remember my name ... "
