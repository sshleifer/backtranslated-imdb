A well-crafted and imaginative production, refreshingly free of clich√©, tells this somewhat spicy affair a story of a close friendship that develops between a man and a boy under less than ideal conditions: the man who is an escaped offender who kidnapped the youth for his child value as a hostage. Alan Gibson, featured by Alan Gibson, offers a fine feel for balanced story movement, offering writer Martin Steckert (Richard Harris) freshness in every scene. He believes his rejection of parole was particularly undeserved. It is a complicated but ultimately successful escape plan, after which its spontaneous nature emerges as it flies to the jungle of its childhood. Often the song or dance bursts a few steps, the naughty Steckert gets the confidence and compassion of his prisoner gradually, and if the police approach for an inevitable revelation, the fastened pair is seen as a big part in their response to forms of rejection, as described by a psychiatrist (Lindsay Wagner) dedicated to helping an avid police lieutenant (James Coburn) in charge of Steckert's man and his "prisoner". This is an exciting story worth mentioning, a fast and new adventure that gains from Harris's main achievement, fine-grained Wagner, Coburn and Karen Black, along with Justin Henry as the cut boy, contributed by Wilfred Josephs, and top-notch cinematography by Frank Watts, shot all footage in a beautiful autumn Ontario province.
