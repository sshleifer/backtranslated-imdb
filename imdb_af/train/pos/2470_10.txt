After the initial shock of the realization of Mr. Branagh to film this, I literally shook with the excitement of having this epic just in front of me. I was not disappointed. So true to Shakespeare and yet so accessible. It blew my mind. I always enjoy it, or rather listen to Branagh and it made me wonder ... was this movie bought in other countries? It will be like a mustache on the Mona Lisa painter.
