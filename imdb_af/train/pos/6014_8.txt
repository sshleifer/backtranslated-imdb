All the reviews about how much ZP is missing, the play is wood, the orgy scene doesn't make sense, etc. Everyone misses the main point. <br /> <br /> Let's be honest. It is a movie that was made in the late 1960s and early 1970s Los Angeles. It's a movie that is meant to be watched while you're H-I-G-H on a certain psychedelic substance. <br /> <br /> Find a little button and smoke, or get a gentle mourning of acid. Seriously, these straight and sober reviews of ZP miss the point. You can't get anything from this movie in a straight mind. <br /> <br /> Until you watched this movie on the big screen (which I was lucky to do three times in the 1990s when ZP was pretty scarce). You have no idea what this movie is about. <br /> <br /> If you insist on not seeing it drunk, you can at least appreciate the shit at the Soundtrack of Pink Floyd's wonderful reworking of "Careful With That Ax, Eugene," " Come in number 51, your time is up. "
