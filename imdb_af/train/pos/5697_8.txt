May 2004, Wonderland is fairly new in the UK. Brilliant movie of a brutal true story. If you know LA from the early 80's, you will appreciate how well it is caught. Using the elements that make up its eager film style is original, enriches the experience and brings the viewer very close to being there. Using a subdued 'Pulp Fiction' style timeline explores the uncertainty about what really happened, while the cast's direction and actions pay attention, especially Val Kilmer and John Holmes; An Oscar for sure if I hand them out.
