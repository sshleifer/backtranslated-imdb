I watched it a few years ago. I remembered it as many mysterious situations, and a mixture of melancholy things, such as the fate of Dorothy and the personal future of Bogdanovich. <br /> <br /> I turn to look at my VHS copy and then I reviewed it and more. Today I'm waiting for the DVD version, at any price! <br /> <br /> The country and easy listening music are very well chosen from the first second, a little blue, but also happy. /> <br /> All the characters are good to me, with funny situations, great acting and lots of dialogues that make me a cult movie and many people I've met on the internet or theater clubs. It should not be casualties. <br /> <br /> I think the title is a hope of life! You must be happy and laugh as much as possible. <br /> <br /> I know it may be a particular comment for the movie, but the fact is, I love it a lot, I think that movie has marked me and I will never forget it.
