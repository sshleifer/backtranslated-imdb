Barbara Stanwyck plays Lily Powers. She is a waitress for her father's speakeasy in a little cramped mining town. He also sells her to men. She escaped to New York and literally sleeps her way to the top. <br /> <br /> Originally, I only saw the 71-minute version, but it's pretty extreme - for its time. These days it's pretty easy. The movie moves very fast and has many sexual insinuations - some of it come out pretty foolish (but fun) today. It moves so fast, you can easily ignore that most of it can never happen - even in 1933. There's nothing classical or monumental about this - it's just a quick, nice dirty little movie that's fun. It just fell apart at the end with a little "moral" end that the censorship demanded. It comes across as incredible and stupid (I saw it in a theater and the audience laughed there - one man eventually said, "No way"). I just saw the rough 75 minute version ending another, somewhat tragic and much better. This version is thought to have been lost until 2004 when it was accidentally discovered! I believe it is the only one in release - but be aware. <br /> <br /> The play is good - Stanwyck is in her role and plays it WAY on top. She lets you believe she is being cruel and sleeping. There are also strong supporting performances by attractive Donald Cook and George Brent. Also, look for a forester, John Wayne, in a hilarious bit as a gentle and gentle office worker! Fun, dirty and fast. I give it a 9.
