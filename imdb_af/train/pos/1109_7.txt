Once I saw two of his photos, I agreed with Altman. However, before I always called his film-making style "boring". You just have to be in the right mind to appreciate his mad genius. <br /> <br /> "HealtH" is fairly underestimated and very doubtful of pressure. In fact, I don't think it's ever been issued to VHS. Why is it? When all these crappy movies get DVD releases daily, is this one left for no good reason? Honestly, I didn't have any real problems with this movie. For the most part, it was constantly amusing and funny. Almost all of the scenes are, for some reason, mysteriously interesting, whether it's the wonderful dialogue or the subtle performances. There is real skill here. <br /> <br /> And Paul Dooley's stint at the bottom of the pool halfway through is fascinating. <br /> <br /> If you can, try to find a copy of this forgotten bit. gem. It's not perfect, but it's much better than most of the sludge out there to get DVD releases. Hell, I'll be happy with a good VHS copy of this thing. <br /> <br /> It's often on the Fox Movie Channel, so watch out.
