The widower family Dan Burns (Steve Carell) writes the column "Dan in Real Life" giving advice to New Jersey Standard families and raising his three daughters alone. Jane (Allison Pill), the parent, just got her driver's license, but Dan doesn't allow her to drive; Cara (Brittany Robertson) has a loved one at his high school partner Marty; and the young Lily (Marlene Lawston) misses her mother. When Dan and his daughters travel to Rhode Island for a family reunion, he meets Marie (Juliette Binoche) in a bookshop and spends hours spending with each other. They feel attracted to each other, but Marie receives a call and leaves Dan, giving her phone number first. Then immediately falls in love with Marie, but when he returns to his home, he finds that Marie is the friend of his wolf brother Mitch Burns (Dane Cook), who is also in love with her. Along with the weekend, the attraction between clumsy Dan and Marie increases and they have to make a decision. <br /> <br /> "Then in Real Life" is a great surprise and a wonderful movie with comedy, romance and drama. . The chemistry of the beautiful Juliette Binoche and Steve Carell is wonderful and it's very easy to know why everyone loves Marie. Trio Allison Pill, Brittany Robertson and Marlene Lawston are fantastic and their characters are responsible for some of the best moments of this story. The screenplay is wonderful and the performances of talented actors and actresses are beautiful, with a realistic family meeting performance. Follow the advice of Dan's column and plan to be surprised at the reunification of the Burns family. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Eu, Meu Irm√£o e Nossa Namorada" ("Me, My Brother and Our Girlfriend")
