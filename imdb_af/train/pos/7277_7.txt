It is a strange film about an archaeologist studying the culture of ancient Hohokam Indians. She takes a (perhaps false) mummy from a cemetery and brings it home to study it. Well, now she barely starts talking and talking to this mummy. And shortly thereafter, her son was possessed by the spirit of the mummy. Even stranger events occur when the spirit then tries to destroy the woman's family. It's actually VERY ONLY, and it'll drop you the first few times, which you're trying to see. But if you stay with it, you can just make it to the end. <br /> <br /> Ahah! What is the secret of the mummy? Is the mummy's spirit angry that it has been removed from the cave? You may not be able to determine what the spirit of motivation is, but if you want ghostly shenanigans on a low budget (and 70's hairstyles!) It will have a reassuring appeal. <br /> <br /> The way I described the story is much clearer than the mean, boring way the movie highlights the story. Can a boring movie be really fascinating? Well, this one reaches it. Perhaps it is a good movie of heart, but performed uncomfortably. I do not know. What I do know is that I enjoyed it very much, despite its dimness. <br /> <br /> Fans of "Spider Baby" will be interested to know that some of the modes of that movie are used in this one. (including an instrumental version of the theme song). <br /> <br /> With a frightening and fairly well done sequence in which rocks and rocks revolve around which roll themselves around and attack some people in a camper. Other scenes in the movie are just creepy or peculiar; but this one scene is actually pretty scary. <br /> <br /> See it! It's strange and it's worth your time. You might even want one on your shelf.
