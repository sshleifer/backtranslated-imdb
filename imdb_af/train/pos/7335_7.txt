With Ralph Bakshi, most of his films are like double-edged swords. You will get something wonderful out there, but only if you sit with the stupid and unnecessary cheezy. The Lord of the Rings was a great adaptation of the story that may not always appear in the animation section. <br /> <br /> Fire and ice are a wonderful achievement from Bakshi from an animated point of view. The roto purchase is much more detailed and the animation has a lively look. You still get some of the dull still cells and slightly vague background paintings, but on the overall look it has certainly improved since Bakshi's last fantasy epic. The animation has virtually a realistic-naturalistic style to it, and unlike LOTR where this style often violates the real content, it enhances the unique atmosphere of the movie. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the movie does not create a meaningful story from its simple setting and most of the characters' motivation is actually vague. Lorn and Tigra are easy cases, but even the biggest villain Necron was difficult to follow to name the Guy with Furry Face Mask (also known as Just That Guy). Although most of the voice actors were appropriate, there were some strange works in the sound section, and Tigra also sounded very awful when she screamed. <br /> <br /> However, I believe the movie's inherent entertainment value is heavier than it is unnecessary. silly execution of the plot line. The smaller clothes of the characters are something you will never overcome, but it helps you to remind yourself that this movie is not even taken seriously. It's still a hella cool and really funny.
