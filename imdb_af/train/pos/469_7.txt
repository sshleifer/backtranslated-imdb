The story line was quite interesting, but the characters were pretty flat and sometimes too extreme in their minds / behaviors. More extreme than needed. Also, I think something went wrong in the casting. John Turtorro doesn't really satisfy me on a semi-autistic chess player, not to speak to the Italian player. Motives are also not very detailed. <br /> <br />
