As an amateur historian of World War II / Nazi Germany, I couldn't wait for it to come on DVD. I missed it when it was the first time in 2003. I do not want to repeat what has already been said in the previous 8 pages about historical inaccuracies. A better job could be done to portray the "beautiful" Hitler. I also had a small problem with some of the decisive choices, not so much for their acting, but for their appearance. Peter Stormare doesn't look much like Rohm, why didn't they make Babson if Hess wears a wig? And my biggest complaint. So much has always been made of Hitler's blue eyes. Why don't they wear Carlyle blue contacts? On the positive side, I thought the actors who played Goring and Drexler looked pretty good. Again, as long as people see it, it understands that it must be entertaining. 1st, History 2nd I don't think much damage will be done.
