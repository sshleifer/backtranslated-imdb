The secret of Kells is one of the most unique, beautiful and obvious animated movies I've ever seen. Before I watched this movie, I was convinced that nothing could make a run for his money and that it was a shoo-in to win in this category, but I found a serious contender in Kells. <br /> <br /> Secret of Kells tells the story of a young orphan, Brendan, who lives with his uncle, the Abt of Kell. The Abbot is a loving guardian, but perhaps a little too strict and much more concerned with strengthening the wall around the city from an upcoming attack by the Vikings than to nurture the boy's imagination. When the legendary brother Aidan (who looks surprisingly like Willie Nelson) arrives and takes the boy under his wing, Brendan travels in the woods and meets a beautiful bush nest called Aisling, who loves him (and saves his life more than once) . With Aisling's help, he tries to save the town and helps brother Aidan darken the mystical book that has the legend. <br /> <br /> See my full review of The Secret of Kells at: http://theoscarsblog.blogspot.com/2010/02/movie-review-secret-of-kells.html
