In the same tune as his Americana Drums next to the Mohawk, John Ford captures American history in a way that is fictional but very credible. Henry Fonda has made three consecutive films during this time with Ford and all three are in a certain time and place with the emphasis on the environment and the cultural environment. In Mohawk, pioneer America is in full bloom with Americans enforcing themselves against Indians and other powers. Here Ford shows our 19th-century America; a time when the invention began to flourish and creativity and this nation really grew. It was, among other things, a long, ugly, young lawyer from Illinois, named Abe Lincoln, and this film fictionalized his life as a lawyer, predicting the greatness he would later reach. <br /> <br /> Fonda is wonderful in this movie, capturing the essence of what is considered Lincoln's persona, though no one knows exactly what he was. The sets and supporting casting work well together and give a unique balance in Ford's painting of the American dream and its many forms. It is not a film that is literally taken, but rather symbolic, and shows that Lincoln is indeed warming up for the events of his life that would create his legacy. We even get screens between him and a young Mary Todd; and it's hard to see how they landed together, but that's not the point. I believe it's just a tribute to the greatness of Lincoln, which is widely regarded as the greatest US president. His quiet and straight display was barely then and would be today. Indeed, our government certainly needs more men like him.
