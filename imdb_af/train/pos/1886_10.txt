I loved this movie since the debut in 1981! I lost track of how many times I saw it! It fails me to make me laugh or refurbish me when I feel. The three clues are fantastic and the writing is valuable, plus how do you not hear the theme song nostalgically? I think I call this movie without realizing it. Basically, I know the whole writing, so when someone looks at it for the first time, I have to hold back and say something about how funny the next line is. I can't even narrow it down, although Sir John's character is probably the most memorable one. The well-known "I will warn the media" when Arthur announces that he intends to take a bath is still invaluable, but the list is truly infinite. The scene at Arthur is to be his fiance's father's home, a scream, especially his interaction with the moose. Do yourself a favor and see this movie!
