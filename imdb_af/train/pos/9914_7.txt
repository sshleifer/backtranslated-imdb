On September 9, 2006 at the Isabel Bader Theater at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF), it was reviewed at the World Premiere Show. <br /> <br /> It had an interesting prospect, but it was too long with too many shots of eWaste (recycled computers, keyboards, cables, etc.) shipped to China, and then sorted and bought back into new products to sell back) and other destruction. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers have been trying to get more people interviewing to strengthen the human element, but are frequently prevented from doing so because of Chinese censorship. Still, what was interesting was interesting. The bits of a high-rise estate agent in Shanghai, spreading around with her luxury home and gardens, made the scenes of other people in medieval conditions especially noticeable. The 480m opening floor of a factory floor was also quite a bit. Areas of activity at the Three Gorges Dam project also complemented the Jia Khang movies at TIFF (the Still Life / Sanxia Haoren & the documentary Dong) feature also built on the subject. <br /> <br /> Director Jennifer Baichwal, producer Nick de Pencier, film maker Peter Mettler and subject Edward Burtynsky were all on stage for a Q&A to the world prize. Producer Noah Weinzweig was introduced to the audience and resigned as the most important person who helped with land access in China itself.
