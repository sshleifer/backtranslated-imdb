Tiempo de Valientes fits well into the friendship-active movie genre, but exceeds its roots thanks to excellent decisions, a tremendous report between its clues and excellent photography. Diego Peretti stars as dr. Silverstein, a contraction dedicated to running shotgun with detective Diaz (Luis Luque). He was assigned to investigate the murder of two minor hoods that appeared to be involved in the merger of arms smuggling. Diaz is out of service, but he is the best man for the job and needs professional psychiatric help to be restored. Silverstein and Diaz soon find themselves in conspiracy with Argentina's intelligence community and some uranium, and the film separates them to a critical point that enables Silverstein to develop impressive key features of its own. Peretti and Luque are great together and remind me of screenplay Terence Hill and Bud Spencer, although Peretti is not as classic as Hill. Remarkably, Tiempo de Valientes even welcomes almost two hours. Indeed, writer-director Damian Szifron proposes a potential sequel to the movie's beautiful coda. All in all, a wonderful and very entertaining action comedy that doesn't lead to the lowest common denominator, doesn't even insult your intelligence.
