Another review compares these troops to a cross between Monty Python and Twin Peaks, too. Another review outlining the differences between the comedy we enjoy from non-critical and black comedy is also worthwhile. <br /> <br /> Look at the whole thing, all three series. In the end, all the characters are tied up and the puzzle pieces fall just as well as a Douglas Adams novel. The detail and complexities are staggering. Thoroughly postmodern. Evil funny, and exciting tragic. Not for children. Not for those with thin skins or objectivity. Provoking. At once literally, figuratively, and surreal in disturbances. The blackest comedy I can remember. <br /> <br /> And probably the most wonderful thing I will ever see.
