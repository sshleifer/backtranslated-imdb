Everyone who meets us influences our thinking, changes our ways, some of that person rubs on us. "The Eighth Day" takes up this theme (compare "Rainmaker"). In this film, Harry (Daniel Auteuil) meets a business expert in sales psychology with Georges (Pascal Duquenne), a Down Syndrome child in progress. Winning performances by both of these actors give this film its main force. The opening sequence is excellent where Georges connects his theory on the creation of the world and in the final scene we discover what God created on the eighth day. There are a few moments in the story that is very frustrating to Harry. For example, Georges who is completely unobstructed requires some expensive shoes and does not have enough money. It's the kind of scene where you laugh through your tears. I love the scene where the Down's Syndrome group escapes on the art gallery on a bus and gateway to the Paradis amusement park. The most humorous of all the embarrassment is the scene where Harry and Georges pass a raft on the highway and Georges gives the driver a rude greeting. But there are also soft scenes, especially the impressive use of hands. Hands feel the sun, wind and rain, hands coming up, stretching hands and climbing in love and friendship. It's a real cinema that touches the heart. There are many moving scenes where Georges Nathalie suggests, where Georges embraces Harry's head in his arms, where Georges lives for his dear mom, where Georges Harry learns to laugh. I felt there was a deep message in the movie that life is beautiful - the presence of grass (Did you know it cries when you cut it?), The trees overhead, the song of birds, the little insects - all nature's miraculous creatures. They are all there to enjoy when we lie back (like Harry and Georges) to watch us and listen ...... A beautiful movie.
