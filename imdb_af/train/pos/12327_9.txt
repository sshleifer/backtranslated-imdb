By 1987, Hong Kong gave the films like Sammo Hung's "Spooky Child Meetings" Chow Yun Fat in John Woo's iconic "Better Tomorrow", "Zu Warriors" and the classic "Mr Vampire". Jackie Chan had international success on video, but it was with a Chinese Spirit story that HK theater had its first true crossover theater hit in the West for many years. <br /> <br /> Western filmmakers have never seen anything. like it. It was a film that used several ingredients that HK cinema has been using for years (flying swordsman, choreographed martial arts and the supernatural) and blends them into creating a film that was unique in its look, feel and performance. Forget the poor and unnecessary persecution it has created, it's the original and the best. <br /> <br /> Director Siu-Tung Ching (still known as an action choreographer on films like Woo's' A Better Tomorrow 2 'The Killer') has a masterpiece under the watchful eye of legendary producer Tsui Hark of Fantasy / Horror cinema created. And with such an expert crew at his disposal (no less than 6 forty co-ordinators), the chances of the film being nothing but wonderful are unthinkable. <br /> <br /> Editing by the incredibly productive David Wu (who wrote / directed The Bride With White Hair 2 and edits such classic titles as "A better Tomorrow 1/2/3", "Hardboiled") 'And the cult' The Club 'is simply a work of genius. His craft of the perfect choreographic high flying trees on the mountaineering sword makes them the best HK theater ever created. Quickly moving, weird, but never confusing, they are even the highlight of their art. <br /> <br /> The crew of movies also did miracles. This is a movie where every shot is a skillfully crafted painting. Where the wonderful blue tide ranges, wrapped in an ever-haunting fog, unfold the breathtaking platform for our story. It is a film where everything is used to weave a dream-like beauty. Even the silk clothes and dresses worn by Hsiao Tsing become living parts of the movie, whether in romantic rows or battle scenes the current silver over the screen. Even a simple scene where Hsiao Tsing changes clothes, turns into a thing of fluttering beauty, as each skill combines to create a most memorable scene from such a simple action. The sets are also wonderful, giving another worldly sense to the forests, and the temple and hardness of the scorched, flag-free land of hell for the wonderful finale. The production designed by Zhongwen Xi deserves the highest praise. <br /> <br /> Another important factor for the success of the movies is the music of Romeo Diaz and James Wong. Hong Kong movies have given us great music and songs that add so much to the success of a series, but on a Chinese Ghost Story, the music is simple. From the opening song, the music becomes as important as the characters. <br /> <br /> The score is a perfect blend of modern and traditional instruments. Drums, bells and guitars move over the action ranges to great effect, but it's in the slower, painful romantic pieces that come in its own. here; whistles, strings and female choir create effects that may be the best pieces of music heard in a HK movie. Add to that the female vocals, beautifully beautiful song that make about Tsau-shen and Hsiao Tsing's love (nothing is ever seen, but the effect is wonderful. It is lovingly innocent movie romance) and you have a shining example of the power. have a movie's music. <br /> <br /> And of course we have the acting talent. Leslie Cheung (better tomorrow 1 & 2 'and a very popular singer) is outstanding as the innocent tax collector. His work in the (thankful) comic rows is never over, and his plays with Joey Wang are played with just the right amount of passion and innocence. <br /> <br /> Joey Wang (who will later be mostly robbed To support roles in movies like the Chow Yun Fat / Andy Lau classic "God of Gamblers") has never looked radiant as she does here no. She is the epitome of ethereal beauty. Her portrayal of the tragic Hsiao Tsing is amazing. She shows her characters sadly about what she has become and what she is made to do, but also delivers a subtle eroticism in the scenes where she lures the men to their atrocities. Veteran actor Wu Ma ("Vampire", "Swordsman") is very fun as the wise, brave, but ever so grumpy, Yen. He treads a fine line between the eccentric and the annoying with ease. And what could easily be a character that could damage the movie is actually wonderfully entertaining and memorable. <br /> <br /> What about the monsters and beasts? I hear you cry. Well, they range from the rather rough but fun stop-motion / animatronic zombies that live in the temple. This leads to a huge running gag with continually weakened efforts to smash on the amusingly unsuspecting Tsau-shen, to the rather cute but surprisingly effective Lord Black. Complete with an arsenal of evil flying heads, and quite excellent wire work. Most of them have never been covered to this day. <br /> <br /> But the most outstanding effect and creation is the evil spirit's killer language. We first encounter this thing with an 'Evil Dead' style rushing camera effect, as it repels the victims' throat to deliver a deadly French kiss that changes the victims into zombie-born corks. But later it is shown in all its crazy glory. It can get so big and long that it shoots into the prey through the forest, trees fall apart, turn around the buildings, and it rolls worse on people before picking them up and throwing them against tree trunks! It can even be split up to reveal a full mouth! It is an outrageous idea that the deep romantic main plot should not work. But it does, to a fantastic and memorable effect. <br /> <br /> So, all that adds to this is a classic example of Hong Kong filmmaking. A real team effort that gave us a real groundbreaking film. It's a movie full of white, invention, action, monsters, martial arts, ghosts, fantastic ideas, luxury visual art, beautiful music, and most importantly, it's enduring charm, one of the most moving romance.
