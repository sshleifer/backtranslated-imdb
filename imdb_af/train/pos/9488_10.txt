Highly memorable, intelligent and exciting film from one of the French films' true geniuses, the formidable Henri Verneuil. The plot is an exact parallel of the JFK murder, and takes place in a non-descriptive, fictional country. The film, both visually and plotted, is razor-sharp. Shot with precise precision, it follows Henry Volnay, the Attorney who assumes himself to unravel the coup. In many ways, this is a very disturbing movie, not least for the cold and analytical accuracy of its commentary on the so-called modern state's inner work. The atmosphere and characters are all completely credible, and Verneuil has not let anything down. On another level, this relatively little-known movie only started a 15-year-old on Oliver Stone, which was filmed for the JFK movie, an inferior film in many areas, the least of which is not credibility. </ br /> <br /> This is a masterpiece, any theater lover should see it, preferably in his original French version with subs.
