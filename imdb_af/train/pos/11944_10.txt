I'm going to give it an 8, but since you've made 6.5 out of much better voices, I had to add my contribution. The river Styx was pure genius. Sure, Woody was his perennial, but his role was at least appropriate. The first half hour was really hilaries, and then the rest of the movie was easy to watch. The dialogue was clever enough, and Woody's card sticks at the parties, along with the reaction of the upper crust, were nice to watch. It was much better than the newspaper critics seem to be. And a plus, a little wizard's pupil to go with it. And of course, did you notice that Johansen became a little frumpy? Charles Dance is always entertaining, just like Hugh Jackman.
