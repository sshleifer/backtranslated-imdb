I am a fan of both actors / singers especially Gackt and if I first discover this movie and see the trailer, I think it's just a fool. After a long wait I finally watched it and here is my comment. <br /> <br /> I think everyone knows the storyline and won't talk about it, instead, my first applause goes to acting. In general, Japanese movies did not have brilliant and acting. You have in MoonChild's entire cast is just wonderful and have succeeded, especially Gackt reflecting his characters' emotions and changing pretty well. I like many of his plays, both dramatic and humorous, as for the HIDE part, his acting is good, but he deliberately holds back in the background as an actor, respectively, as his character does throughout the film. I didn't like some cinematography, especially lighting and some colors, but due to small budget, it still has brilliant moments, but the real jewel of the movie is story. It has a few weird moments, but it is good for me, and the friendship theme of the movie is very well developed and sometimes the story is pointing to a cruel world that nobody's life guaranteed and with " some unforgettable deaths of the scene, it is the theme of the footage. An interesting note aside, this movie is similar to an excellent vampire movie Interwiew with the Vampire which is also played by the most beautiful (not beautiful, beautiful) actors of American cinema, actually Moon Child is somehow like a brother with Interwiew, but originally on its own. Just a problem that MoonChild is, it's a little slow sometimes, I'm a Japanese movie lover, and I used to it, but it's not changed. MoonChild has some useless scenes or characters. But everything, this movie is very good and very emotional, as for actors / singers duo I hope to see their other movies in the future, and I recommend it to anyone who likes vampire action sci-fiction and romance movies . 8/10
