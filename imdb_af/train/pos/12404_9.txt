I was Rawlins when this movie was made and I was lucky to be able to work on it. Both as an extra and with Eddie Surkin on special effects. It was nice to see all the behind the scenes, from the Barbedwire coming alive to the electric chair, through the office of the officers. It was also fun to meet all the actors, from Viggo to Tiny. Also, the gate cut in jail for the movie was and is still called by the local people "Disney Gate". If anyone is interested and ever in Rawlins, most of the movies are still in place and can be seen during the self-guided tour. It was great fun with and with R. Harlin and wanted me to have the chance to do it again.
