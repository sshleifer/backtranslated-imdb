The story of a woman from nowhere is fairly straightforward and straightforward, right out of an Eastwood Spaghetti Western: A mysterious stranger arrives in a lawless village run by a royal pin and begins to sprout the place. Even the opening credits and music have that spaghetti feeling: Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone will be proud. The very interesting twist is that the stranger is a beautiful woman (!), Saki (Ryoko Yonekura) on a Harley, and the place is somewhere in Japan in a town. <br /> <br /> In this action there is a considerable amount of gunplay, some of it good, some predictable, and other places somewhat hokey, but it's great fun. Ryoko handles her guns with credibility and aplomb and owes the thugs. It wasn't much of an acting challenge for her, as it was a physical challenge, but she handled very well. She shows her acting skills much more than Otsu in the NHK drama, Musashi. <br /> <br /> I would highly recommend movie if you are a Ryoko Yonekura fan (who I adore) and / or a "girls with rifle" movie fan and it sticks to repeated views. For me, there is something that is actually and inexplicably attractive to "girls with guns", such as "La Femme Nikita" and "The Long Kiss Goodnight". And to have a beautiful gall, like Ryoko, who also sits in the bag, is just cookies icing on the cake.
