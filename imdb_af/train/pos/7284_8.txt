When I was young, I saw very little movies. My parents hired this one in all their wisdom. I was very careful about what the movie was about, in fact I was not even allowed to see it. Of course my brother and sister came and it made me very angry. So what did I do? Late at night I messed up the VCR! Kick in the screen of the TV and call the police and reported vandals. Of course I was arrested, I couldn't get my foot out of the TV before police arrived. I just played a gate and sent home. Of course, my parents founded me and made my work payable for the TV and video. It tore me apart, slavery really battles me, but I had to do it. Cloths across the house. What finally happened? We have a big screen TV, DVD player and a surround sound system for my work. How did I get the money? Easily I made my own movies and sold to Disney! Do you remember Finding Neno? Well, I wrote that movie and filmed my goldfish in their fish tanks! Of course, they rewrote the plot and did it in CGI because they couldn't afford to make it a real action picture as I did! In the end I never saw the movie. The head that didn't kill and the rating I gave is my life rating! It does pretty well!
