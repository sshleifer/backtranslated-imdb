The Journey of Hope (1990) is about a trek that makes many nomadic and poor Turks so that they can live the good life in Switzerland. These people are so desperate to live like Westerners that they will stop their lives and live in an attempt to reach the promised land. So many of them are swam by greedy crooks who leave their lives to charge huge fees for desperate people who are in a no-win situation. One family braves the cold, the treacherous mountain range and the criminal offenders to discover that there is not always a bright white light at the end of the tunnel. This problem exists worldwide, not just in America. Some people tend to forget about it. A breakthrough of a movie that will make you wonder why at the end. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
