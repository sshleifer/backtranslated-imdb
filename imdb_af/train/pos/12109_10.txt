Yaitate !! Japan is a very fun show and I really like it! It was in our country every 5:30 just recently in Hero TV and ABS-CBN. It's about Azuma Kazuma who is trying to fulfill his dream of making Japanese bread that will represent his country. He works in the Southern Toyo branch of Pantasia and also helps his friend (Tsukino Azusagawa) with other bakers (such as Kawachi Kyousuke and Kanmuri Shigeru) to st. Pierre to control and take control of Pantasia. They fight other skilled bakers from many other countries and not only learn to make different kinds of bread, but also to cook other foods. It's a very funny and unique anime, as they also mimic characters from other anime (like Naruto, Detective Conan and One Piece) and famous real-life people. This is one of the best works by Takashi Haschiguchi and is really a must see for people of different ages.
