In this issue of horror movies, 50's Cold War Paranoia, Reagan-era America and high school films, Adam Arkin plays Tony, the star quarterback of Full Moon High in the 1950s. He and his father (Ed McMahon) traveled to communist Romania and, while one night lost in the streets, he was bitten by a werewolf. When he returns, he cannot control his zoologist urgently and enters a deadly spree. Frustrated, he flees town. Decades later, the immortal Tony returns to the town and writes again in high school. He still can't control his transformations, and the townspeople and his friends realize he's not quite human. It all culminates in the school's big soccer game. <br /> <br /> I expected it to be one of the bad ones, it's good movies from the early 80's. But I was surprised that the movie was actually just right. The movie, including Kenneth Mars as a fiery coach, Roz Kelly as Tony's cheerful former flame, Demond Wilson as a bus driver, and Alan Arkin as an oddball doctor, all go out with hilarious results. <br /> <br /> While watching this movie, I was struck by how similar writing and humor were to Family Guy. "Full Moon High" has the same attitude and never takes itself seriously.
