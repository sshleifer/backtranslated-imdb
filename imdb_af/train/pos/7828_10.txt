I show this film to college students in the speech and media law because their lessons are timeless. Why speaking out of iniquity is important and can bring about the changes sought by the oppressed. Why freedom of the press and freedom of speech are essential for democracy. This is a surprising story of how apartheid was brought to the attention of the world by Steven Biko's activism and the journalism of Donald Woods. It also gives an important lesson of freedom of speech: "You can blow out a candle, but you can't blow out a fire. As soon as the flame starts to catch, the wind will blow it higher." (From Biko by Peter Gabriel, on the Tree Shaking).
