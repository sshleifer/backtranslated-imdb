When I first read the story of Armistead Maupins, I was taken in by the human drama shown by Gabriel. Nobody and those he cares and loves. It is said that we have now received the movie version of an excellent story and are expected to pass the glory of Hollywood ... <br /> <br /> Writer Armistead Maupin and director Patrick Stettner have really succeeded! <br /> <br /> With just the right amount of restraint, Robin Williams captures Gabriel's fragile essence and lets us see his struggle with confidence in his staff life (Jess) and the world around him (Donna). <br /> <br /> As we are introduced to the players in this play, we are reminded that nothing is as it seems and that the smallest event can change our lives irrevocably. The request to revise a book written by a young man becomes a life-changing event that helps Gabriel find the power within himself to move forward and forward. <br /> <br /> It is bad that most people will avoid this movie. I just say this because the average American probably thinks "Robin Williams is in a serious role? It hasn't worked before!" Please give this movie a chance! Robin Williams touches the darkness we all have to find and go into ourselves to be better people. Like his movie One Hour Photo, he rose as an actor and made another quality artwork. <br /> <br /> Oh, and before I forget, I believe Bobby Cannavale, as Jess steals every scene he is in. He watched the 1940s leading man and screen presence. It is this statement that he can carry his own movie! <br /> <br /> S ~
