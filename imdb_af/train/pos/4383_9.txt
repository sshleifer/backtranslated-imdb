** Attention Spoilers ** <br /> <br /> First of all, let me say that Rob Roy is one of the 90's best movies. It was a wonderful achievement for everyone involved, especially the plays of Liam Neeson, Jessica Lange, John Hurt, Brian Cox and Tim Roth. Michael Canton Jones painted a wonderful portrait of the honor and dishonesty that men can represent in themselves. But unfortunately ... <br /> <br /> it is constantly getting unfair compared to "Braveheart". These are two completely different films, probably similar to the fact that they are both about Scots in historic Scotland. Yet this comparison often crushes me because it is almost assumed that "Braveheart" is a better movie than Rob Roy. I like Braveheart a lot, but the idea of ​​comparing it to Rob Roy is a bit offensive to me. To put it simply, I love "Braveheart", but it's a light shadow of how much I like Rob Roy. Here are my specific reasons ... <br /> <br /> - "Rob Roy" is about real people. <br /> <br /> Let's see it, the William Wallace in "Braveheart" is not a real person. . He is a legend, a martyr, a greater than a figure of life. As a result of this depiction, he is also a perfect person who never does wrong and basically shows his fellow countrymen to the promised land. When he eventually fails, it's not his fault. Like Jesus, he is betrayed by the people he most trusted. He even goes through the worst kind of torture because he wants so much freedom. <br /> <br /> The portrayal of Wallace is very well done and effective. But it doesn't really inspire or intrigue me. I find human ambiguity far more fascinating than human perfection. Therefore, "The Last Temptation of Christ" is a better movie than "King of Kings", and that is also one of the reasons I think "Rob Roy" is better than "Braveheart". Rob Roy can be heroic and brave, but he is far from perfect. He makes several mistakes that affect the lives of many of his loved ones. It is certainly not a false claim against the Duke of Argyll, but an act of nobility and courage, but it was also an act of selfishness and self-centeredness. Let us not forget that the family he claimed to have protected at the end of the film became homeless because of this act. But Rob did the best he could, and that was all you could ask for. <br /> <br /> Rob's wife Maria is also a normal, ambitious person. Let's start with how she looks at this movie. Sure, she's beautiful, but she doesn't wear makeup and she allows her natural beauty to show. Compare it to the two love (or one, depending on your point of view) of William Wallace in "Braveheart". Now these two ladies are warm, but hardly indicative of how women watched at the time (especially the laymen). Maybe it's not a fair comparison, but just another example of how Rob Roy's accuracy efforts are far more effective. <br /> <br /> In the course of Rob Roy, Mary, with her foul rape, must live by the careless car, Cunningham. She felt compelled to tell Rob about her fight, but not because she knew Rob had to take revenge for her rape. Such revenge will surely mean Rob's death, and Mary is not prepared to do such a sacrifice. <br /> <br /> The villains in "Rob Roy" are just as compelling. Although the enemies in "Braveheart" are well written, they are hardly original. Robert the Bruce, a man who is brave and cowardly, is plagued by moral decisions that are all in the fictional kingdom. Should he accept his claim as the king of Scotland, or should he betray Wallace to ensure the safety of his family name? Bruce is the most ambitious character in "Braveheart", but from Brutus in "Julius Ceasar" to Fredo in "The Godfather Part II", these types of characters are hardly original. Longshanks, though a compelling villain in its own right, is very one-dimensional. He is the evil epidemic and his tyrannical ways are in direct contrast to Wallace's heroism. <br /> <br /> "Rob Roy" has three villains who are great in their chicanery. First of all, start with the Marquis of Montrose. He is a man who is so obsessed with his self-esteem that he is prepared to suffer an innocent person through it. "Don't be mocked" are his favorite words for his "factor". He is a man possessed with power, and is upset that a man of great nobility, such as the Duke of Argyll, can be considered of greater supply than he. He is scandalous self-obsession and uncertain. He is an evil aristocrat, but in ways that make him unique. <br /> <br /> Cunningham and Callarn are Rob Roy's conspirators and also Roy's direct attackers. Callarn is so clever in his coward that he is almost comical. He will do anything to maintain the good will of the Marquis, which includes backlash and trickery. Cunningham is a compelling character in that he appears to be excited to do what he can to gain Marquis status and love. He needs a father, little does he know the Marquis is his real father. Therefore, when the opportunity to acquire wealth comes from Callarn, he grabs it without even questioning it. He is much like the evil of modern man, so self-centered and in vain that he does not care about the consequences of his actions towards others. <br /> <br /> Many have criticized Tim Roth's performance in this film. Hogwash I say. Clearly, Cunningham is not only angry, but also psychopath throughout the film. In a world where a man and his stepson can go to shoot random people for entertainment, is Cunningham too much of an incredible character? We live in a society where people have lowered the value of human life. "Rob Roy" simply teaches us that only the circumstances of this diminished value have changed. It is a problem through human history that the vanity of the human heart will not allow compassion. Rob Roy and Maria give us the hope that goodness will prevail, but snakes will always exist in our world. <br /> <br /> Another character I find fascinating is the Duke of Argyll. He is a true nobleman, and his values ​​of honesty and courtesy are in direct contrast to the Marquis. He appreciates Rob Roy and Maria's bravery, and has a direct confusion for Marquis and his factor. He gives the world hope for the people of power. Hopefully people like the Marquis are the exception and not the rule. <br /> <br /> - The final duel in Rob Roy is more exciting than 10 of the fighting scenes in Braveheart. <br /> One thing I get tired of is people who tell me that "Braveheart" is a better movie because of the fighting tones. First of all, battle scenes are hardly original. From "Spartacus" to "Gladiator", Hollywood has a long tradition of historic European combat scenes. "Braveheart" has some of the best fighting scenes ever put on film, but they are suffering from one major problem. These fighting scenes have no context except for the struggle for freedom. <br /> <br /> Now, don't get me wrong, twins are also scarce original. In fact, there are probably 10 times as many movies with duels as there are with combat tones. But the context of the duel between Cunningham and Rob Roy is a beauty to see. This is one of the greatest scenes in film history. Let me explain why ... <br /> <br /> First of all, the style of battle and the wearing of the two characters in this two-part description perfectly describe the characters. Cunningham is smooth and dangerous, Rob Roy is strong and courageous. Cunningham uses a shielding sword while Rob uses a verbal sword. Cunningham fights with fast-paced moves, while Roy's fighting style is more obvious. <br /> <br /> The entire movie, from the deliberate slow first half to the exciting second half, leads to this moment. These are powerful things, and it is clear that Rob must eradicate this threatening evil that has plagued his entire world. When Rob finally gets the upper hand (literally and figuratively), it is one of the greatest moments in film history. Rob wins because he has more to live, and his honor is stronger than 10 Cunningham's. The use of music is absolutely cooling in this scene. Good rule against a real evil is more powerful to me than to see a man, so that he cannot shout for freedom. But hey, maybe it's just me. <br /> <br /> - "Rob Roy" is more realistic than "Braveheart" <br /> <br /> I don't know that people in the aristocracy or Scottish people were talking like the people in "Rob Roy", but I feel that this is clearly an attempt to capture their speech patterns. I feel that many people are bored by "Rob Roy" because they cannot understand what the characters are saying. If so, read a few Shakesphere or insert the caption. "Rob Roy" is actually one of the greatest written films of the 90's. Much of the dialogue in this movie is clever, but maybe you should watch the movie a few times to understand it. <br /> <br /> Conversely, the dialogue in Braveheart is hardly interesting. Of course, what do you expect when the main character is a Scottish player played by an Australian? It is a legend, and there was clearly no attempt to capture the speech of the times. This movie takes place several centuries before "Rob Roy", and yet they speak like the people today. So why many people find it better. Audiences today have become increasingly lazy, and they do not want to take the time or patience to understand things that are complex. Therefore, as with many epic movies, they expect the Villiers to see a recognizable English accent, while the heroes speak in a national language, not too far from our American language. Sure, it is clear that the Wallace is shot, but unlike the likes of Scott T from Star Trek and a few "Aye" for recognition, the Scots fit into the Hollywood tradition of how we believe Scots should sound . br /> <br /> So, these descriptions show that "Rob Roy" is a better movie than "Braveheart"? Rare. But if it proves one thing, it seems that it's generally known that Braveheart is a better movie than Rob Roy. To put it simply, "Rob Roy" is a film that contains themes that fit a lot into today's world. "Braveheart" is a film about a legend that is inspiring but almost realistic. You can make a decision on what you think is better ... <br /> <br /> Grade - a score - 9
