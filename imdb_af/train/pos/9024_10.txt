Five years of the Tenko survivors returning home, and of Marion's two-edged "Well, that's it". <br /> <br /> It is now 1950: reunion time. The gang is all here: Marion, Bea, Ulrica, Kate, Dorothy, Christina, Dominica, and latecomers Maggie and Alice. The story that unfolds is a beauty: so perfectly written and performed, and as thoughts and moves, as the original series. <br /> <br /> All the questions left behind at the end of the series are answered neatly. . From Marion's family to Joss's health center, everything changed in five years, and everything hasn't changed. <br /> <br /> An excursion to Dominica's plantation brings lots of shocks and a bit of one-of-a-kind stress. There is a real sense of tragedy and disaster, as the fate takes over and the women struggle for their lives. Dominica finally shows her true colors, and there are some screaming-on-the-count moments of drama. <br /> <br /> Lush location filming in Singapore, and an opportunity to catch up with a group of women who feel like they have become friends. It's so sad that it's really the end. I could see it all again. Perfection.
