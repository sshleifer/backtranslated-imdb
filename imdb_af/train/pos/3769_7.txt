Oh, come on, learn to have some fun. When I was a child, oh, this movie was Oscar-worthy to me. I thought it was completely hysterical. One of the best movies I've seen. <br /> <br /> Now it's a bit stupid, but come on. Enjoying "Excellent Adventure" will probably have fun with "Bogus Journey". It was the movie for "Dude, where's my car?". Only this one is actually funny. As I said, it's just a good time. It should not be taken seriously and if you enjoy the first one, you need to keep "Bogus Journey". It's just a funny movie with a few memorable characters. For your enjoyment alone, watch it, let go and remember it's a stupid comedy. That's all. <br /> <br /> 7/10
