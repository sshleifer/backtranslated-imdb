I can't see the point of burying a movie like this in sulfuric sarcasm, if it is by no means more than a vehicle to entertain children and prepare them for the next line of goods to be angry . /> <br /> It's a fun movie. My children sat quietly through the whole thing and loved it every minute. Granted, the villain is a little over with his silly costume and maniacal laugher, but it's much easier to take than the dark, gloomy, and very morbid Pokemon 3. <br /> <br /> My kids have Pokemon has been watching since it started and they will soon be in the ages where they will turn off childish things and go to others. I'm glad we enjoyed it together.
