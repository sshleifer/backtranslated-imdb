In the aftermath of Watergate, a number of conspiracy films appeared, like this one, written by the late Adam Kennedy (based on his novel). <br /> <br /> Gene Hackman plays former Vietnam veteran 'Roy Tucker', a liquidated liquidator. He receives visits from Marvin Tagge (Richard Widmark), claiming to represent an organization designed to help the wrongdoer. They offer him freedom, and despite the troubled Tagge, he accepts. But he brings a fellow comrade with the name Spiventa (Mickey Rooney). Exactly why is it hard to see because Spiventa is an annoying little man who drives Tucker angry with persistent sexual conversations, not what you want to hear when you are behind bars. <br /> <br /> Tagge's benefactors murder Spiventa before Tucker's stunned eyes. Reunite with wife Ellie (Candice Bergen), and give a new identity (strange, he doesn't try to change his appearance. Sharp of that cheesy mustache would have been a start), he sat down, but found there n catch. wants to do Tucker to kill the president of the United States. He refuses, so Tagge kidnapped Ellie ... <br /> <br /> I'm leaving the synopsis here, but I'm sure you can guess the rest for yourself. The writing has enough plot holes to let you read the book (neat trick!). The people who represent Tagge are never revealed. The removal of J.F.K. Their murder is unmistakable. Despite the findings of the Warren commission, the doubt remains as to whether Lee Harvey Oswald had been upheld until today. <br /> <br /> It was Stanley Kramer's first movie in years, and while it's not turkey, he has the grip of John Frankenheimer's' The Manchurian Candidate 'or Alan J.Pakula's' The Parallax View . As a left-wing conspiracy movie, it tends to skirt over its subject instead of grabbing it. I prefer right-wing people themselves - they are more beautiful! 'Domino' has the look and feel of a made-for-T.V. film, and boasts what the easiest prison escape in film history should be not to mention an end to the Michael Caine classic 'Get Carter'. <br /> <br /> What makes it lookable is Gene Hackman and Richard Widmark. The latter, who died earlier this year, is wonderful as the mysterious Tagge, who initially remains behind the operation until he is ruthlessly eliminated. He began with a chain of deaths designed to trace all traces of evidence as one by one the perpetrators of this evil plot - just like dominoes. Like Tucker, the innocent pawn, Hackman is wonderful. You have to wonder why he chose to hide in such an obvious place. In his shoes I would have fled to the other side of the world, everywhere to get away from these fanatics. Hackman's love scenes with Bergen slow down the plot, and it's almost a relief when she is cut. Presumably, the producers have also thought that explains why it starts with a bizarre prologue, outlining the entire film's presentation - voiced by British actor Patrick Allen - warns the audience that they are out there and that they 'is to get us. Comedian Les Dawson later made this opening in his B.B.C. show 'The Dawson Watch'. <br /> <br /> Earlier, Mickey Rooney worked with Kramer on 'It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World'. His "dead" scene looks like an issue of the picture, with the actor appearing as if he was shot dead rather than dead. <br /> <br /> Konspiracy movies are first made by the left. But now the law also gets the right. Last year, 'Liberty', an absurd merger of lies and half-truths about Tony Blair's government, became Britain's answer to 'Reefer Madness'. At least Domino had a beautiful Candice Mountains. The best Chris Atkins movie can offer Anne Widdecombe! <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, 'The Domino Principle' is made by Sir Lew Grade, the legendary British television behind 'The Saint', 'Jesus Of Nazareth' and 'The Muppet Show'. He again worked with Adam Kennedy in 1980 on 'Raise The Titanic!', Whose failure was so great, Grad's ambitions to be the new Louis B. Meyer sank. To be somewhat frank, I will not exclude the possibility of a conspiracy.
