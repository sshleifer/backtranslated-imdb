Man, some of your people should relax. This movie was artistic genius. Instead of looking for reasoning or messages to justify it in your reality, why can't you understand it's a fiction work? N story. Entertainment, for the sake of God (no pun intended). It seems to me that too many of the people here are trying to be film critics - and they are not doing well. I am so impressed with the film and Bill Paxton's work to direct that I will personally contact him to tell him. You know, if you're not trying to analyze the possibility of the storyline, just enjoy the movie. All my friends and I did!
