There are very few artists today who can keep me through a whole movie just by their presence. One of the few is Judy Davis, who has built a successful career to create characters that are mainly in attitude but very vulnerable to heart. She takes roles that most other artists will treat melodramatically and adds a fiery, deeply emotional intensity that draws attention away from everything else on the screen. <br /> <br /> Her skills are well displayed in "High Tide", a movie It fits her a second time with director Gillian Armstrong, who gave Davis her first big success with "My Brilliant Career". In that film, Davis played a young woman determined to make it into the world, despite the choking she felt about her community and education. However, in "High Tide" Davis's character, Lillie, is the opposite: she gave hope for her future when she was young, and after giving birth to a child, ending her responsibilities and living without direction or meaning. When she met her daughter years later, the thought of caring for her child was astonished; She knows it's her chance to reconcile for her failures, but how can she be honest with her daughter and still get her respect? <br /> <br /> Gillian Armstrong's films usually hold stories about characters who want to communicate desperately with each other, but face stumbling blocks by their own personal habits and addictions. "Oscar and Lucinda," for example, were about a man and a woman who desperately needed each other's love, but always by their craving for coincidence, represented by their gambling addiction. Here we are immersed in the world of a family torn apart by the mother's inability to commit to an established life and her struggle to save herself, despite being fully convinced that it is too late to change. It is not just a movie with an excellent performance in its medium, but also a rare achievement: a fully convincing story of salvation.
