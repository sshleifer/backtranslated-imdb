I gave this movie 8 out of 10, and got 10 for for example Amadeus, and 9 for Slumdog Millionaire recently reserved. This film is near Slumdog, but it is difficult to judge on such a film without understanding the Balkans' life, mentality and soul that Kusturica masterfully offers. To understand this, you really have to be one of the Balkans. It's an amazing movie, much better and more contemporary of its previous movies, which is boring at this time, I think Kusturica is moving forward with this movie. I like humor (Balkan humor), photography is an art itself, every scene is artistic to the limit. Plot is probably a fairy tale, don't remember it now, but remember to read to my daughter to sleep a similar story.
