Anyone who has experienced the horrors of divorce will join this indie movie's main character, a scared little boy who believes a zombie is hiding in his closet. Is Jake (a mesmerizing Anthony DeMarco) simply "transmitting" the trauma of two bickering parents to an understandable image? Or can the creature really be? Author / director Shelli Ryan just balances two possibilities and guesses the audience. Her choice to use one institution - a suburban home - adds to the feeling of despair and claustrophobia. <br /> <br /> Brooke Bloom and Peter Sean Bridgers are very convincing as the evil but loving parents. But these are the creepy minor characters, Mrs. Bender (Barbara Gruen), an uncontrolled babysitter and Sam Stone (Ben Bode), a thin estate agent who keeps in mind. Jake's Closet is a dark-inspired portrait of childhood as a special kind of hell.
