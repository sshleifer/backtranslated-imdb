This is a military drama that I love very much! Tom Berenger plays military killer Thomas Beckett. This Marine is non-nonsense, in your face, and no questions asked kind of person who gets the job. There you have Billy Zane ('The Phantom' and others) playing Richard Miller, a former SWAT form D.C., working for the government and only taking orders from them. Who needs a civil servant? I don't! When these two are mated, sparks must fly. And how. However, Beckett teaches the young bureaucrat how it works. When the other sniper hits, it's wits vs wits, cat vs mouse, gunman vs gunman. And when the seasoned sniper is caught, it is Miller aside to set aside politics and save him. Who needs politics when you are a pro like Beckett, has taken no-one orders except himself, plays according to the rules and not the book, and mutual respect is spurred out in politics. The movie was a direct hit. Beware. Rating 4 out of 5 stars.
