When my sister said this movie was going to be good, I had second thoughts, but I watched it and it was really funny. basically the movie was made of a strange girl going to a small town where nobody likes her and she just wants to go there and get the reading of her aunts won't go that way. but it's not that easy. In this movie you come across hilarious humor, a witch, a book of proverbs / repetitions, a mentally challenged uncle and a dog. You will understand the meaning of the word freak, and I hope you run straight and try to find this really old movie. hope you will have it totally, I'll give it a 0 .... no, I'm totally joking, sick, give it a 9 hope you understand you'll laugh, you'll shout and you may just offended. <br /> <br /> Love yours: Dakota you can email me at dakota_loves_it @ hot mail.com if you want
