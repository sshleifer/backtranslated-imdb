This movie is one of Tom Cruise's best films. He captures the audiences' imagination with his role of David Aames. His character can somehow relate to us. The story line is very clever and keeps the audience through the whole movie at the edge. I have never seen so many Cruise films, but after seeing it, it shows me its true talent. My favorite part in the movie is the end where it all comes to a great conclusion and he finds out the truth. If you haven't seen it yet, you should definitely try it. It's one of those movies you've ever seen, you just watched to the end, or it'll make you think and you'll regret it. My opinion is that you just have to buy it and it must be a risk, that's what I did and it has become one of my favorite movies of all time. It is A * 10/10 I promise as soon as you see it, it will stay with you and you will keep it forever.
