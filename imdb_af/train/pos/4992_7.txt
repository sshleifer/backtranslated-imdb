I find Loretta Young generally difficult to take, too worried about her appearance and too ugly in all the wrong ways. But in this lyrical Frank Borzage romance, and even though she's playing a low-self-patsy that sets up with far too much bully of paramur Spencer Tracy, she's straight and honest and irresistible. It's a strange little movie, mostly played in a one-room chef in a Hooverville, extraordinarily in front of the Depression, yet romantic and idealized. Tracy, playing a turbulent, stubborn "ordinary man" who will be a terrible chauvinist and bully according to today's standards, softens his character's hard edge and makes him almost tempting. There is good supporting work by Marjorie Rambeau and Glenda Farrell (who have never come that far) and Jo Swerling's script is modest and effective. But the real heroes are Borzage, who always wanted to dramatize the true love in Lyrian close-up and Young. Your kind wants to slap her and show her character, she's too good for this guy, but she's so tough and persuasive, you look at their story satisfactorily and play a satisfying conclusion.
