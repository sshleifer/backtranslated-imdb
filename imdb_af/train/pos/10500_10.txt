Although Super Mario 64 is not like the rest of the games in the series, it's still a classic and it's just as good as the old games. Games with this great repetition value are few and far between. Plus, this game has so much variety. There are 15 levels each with different tasks that you can do, and many other hidden tasks. The game is not very challenging, but its lack of challenge does not go away at all. Once you have beaten it, you will want to erase and restart your game. And it's just as much fun the second time, or the third time, or two hundredth time. A must have for any Nintendo 64 owner, and is a reason in itself to own a Nintendo 64.
