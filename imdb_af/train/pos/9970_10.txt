Brilliant use of over-emphasized technololor illustrates the optimistic extremes of contemporary Christmas ceremonies. The voyeuristic element of the scenes (Santa & Pedro summarizes society's behavior that is moving through a telescope) is unique (and of course Jean-Luc Godard, though subtle, has this theme in his film "Pierrot le -fold "stolen". Highly recommended!
