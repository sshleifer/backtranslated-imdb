Julie Waters is excellent and Adrian Pasdar is a revelation in a very hot, very real and extremely entertaining look at the complications caused by sexual dysfunction and transvestism in a young CEO's life. At the heart of this movie is the real truth that you have to accept yourself before you can hope that others will accept you.
