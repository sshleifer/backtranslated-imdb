This 2004 Oscar nominee is a very short b / w film in Spanish. A young woman goes to a cafe, gets a coffee, and watches some musicians standing still with their instruments. All the customers are motionless, like mannequins. However, one man is jolly jolly and breaks into a song about what happens at 7:35 in the morning. There is a surprising moment to the other until the end, which is quite surprising. The people, the place, everything looks pretty normal. And like the music piece "Bolero" the thing remains to the climax. With its structure, theme, movement and white, it's an 8 minute masterpiece.
