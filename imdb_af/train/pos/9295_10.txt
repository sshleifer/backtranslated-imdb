It was hard for me to believe all the negative comments about this all-star flick. I laughed all over the picture, just like my whole family. The film clearly defined him as an old gangster comedy - the players were hysterical - I would make sure they had a good old age while making it. Of course, Goldblum and Dreyfuss were wonderful - and how about the Everly sisters, each of the two Falco's, and the divine music throughout. Rob Reiner made a nice limo driver, and Gabriel Byrne is a laughable neurotic. Not to mention Gregory Hines, Burt Reynolds, the Sleepy Joe character and the whole mortuary and digger digger references. Paul Anka was his usual entertaining self, with the particular attraction of running, after Byrne decided to make a duet of his "My Way" home for Vick. <br /> <br /> I think this movie was a comical tribute to Frank Sinatra and friends; Dreyfuss imitated him well. I'm also of the opinion that no-one, of any age, would even think of imitating the actions taken in this movie - it's a joke - not a scary "gangsta" movie. The cars and clothes were impressive, just like the decorative, Vic's Place. <br /> <br /> Truly, I think of Mad Dog Time as a musical comedy, less harmful than many cartoons, TV crime drama, and talk shows. I would recommend the video for a family entertainment evening.
