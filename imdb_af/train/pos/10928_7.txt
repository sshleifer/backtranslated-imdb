A dying Kung Fu master sends out his last student to find out what happened to the previous five students who were a member of the banned gif clan. He is to see if they act well and if not he stops them. Master also wants the student to find another member of the clan who ran away with the money that the master wants to use for good. The former students were all taught in a different style, snake, millipede, scorpion, lizard, frog, while the last student was taught a little in every style. All the students end up in one town, looking for the old man with all the money, and soon everyone struggles to get the money. <br /> <br /> Classic martial arts films have a title that even many non-fans know. I spoke to some casual fans and it seems to be the one movie that sticks in their heads. It's a very good movie, although I'm not really sure why this movie is staying with people, if for my money other movies are better than the Shaw studio (for example, an armed Swordman or the Brave Archer series) . It's not about selling the movie short, as the movie is structured like a mystery, our hero has no idea who anyone is and the Venoms themselves know best who two of the others are. We have the identity of four, but we still have to work out who the fifth really is. The film is also strange that a martial arts film, apart from a training series at the beginning and killing the old man and his family for the money, is really no action for about 40 or 45 minutes. It's a risky step to do this, but it pays off as the plot and performances keep your attention. (The film is also strange because it is the first martial arts movie I think I've ever seen where there are no women. I don't think one has a voice role and I'm pretty sure no one is in the background. at nothing, it's just something that hit me.) It's a good solid little movie that may not stay in the circle's reputation, but is still a very good movie to draw on your couch. br /> <br /> About 7 out of 10.
