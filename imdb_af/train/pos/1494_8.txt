A classic presentation by Amicus, producer Milton Subotsky and director Peter Duffell ('The Far Pavillions' etc.) Become a classic, intelligent 'four-handed' with a strong cast (Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, Jon Pertwee, Ingrid Pitt , etc.) Although giving an attractive performance, despite a low budget which leads to some 'special effects'. The best contribution, however, is that of 7-year-old Chloe Franks who changes into a chillingly effective version of her part, which makes the blood of his blood cool. Just spoiled by the lurking title desired by its distributors on the film, this underwritten release, a cut above the 'blood' guts' shock movie, is for those who appreciate a bit of their horror. .
