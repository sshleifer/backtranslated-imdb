Most movies over, or in New Orleans, seem to be smiling badly, and legally inaccurate (investigate: remember "The Savage Bees"? But I'm making an exception to "Tightrope," which almost did). <br /> <br /> Here's one that doesn't inevitably go wrong. The accent is not bad (yes, the "yat" accent here is much more Brooklyn than the south), the city of 1950 shows how it is / was, without the obligatory "tourists" shots, and they understand " a good drama without all making a "strange southern man". <br /> <br /> One of the few films to do this city right, and a good movie to start.
