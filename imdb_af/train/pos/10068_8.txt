This movie was excellent. A sad truth about how culture tends to clash with the sexes. It's just one big hot fuzzy type of movie. You have the master who is in tradition and kind heart in his own way, Doggie, despite being a girl thing to win his passions and you put it off with one cute monkey with a thousand facial expressions. It's like the big happy movie in the end. This movie does a great job of showing how traditional one can be, so plunge into being willing to die without sharing their secrets. You see sides to a culture that has never been seen, which helps improve the drama unfolding near the end of the picture. The cinema photography is excellent, especially the opening paradise sequence with all the kickers. Come to be in Oscar's claim for the best foreign film.
