This is a great example of a very simple Film Noir story that is extremely well handled - thanks to the excellent direction of Otto Preminger as well as some great performances. Dana Andrews stars as a detective who often uses his fists instead of his brain. Shortly after the film begins, Andrews is reprimanded and warned that if it continues, he will be in power. A little later, while investigating a crime, he is attacked by a suspect and Andrews is being forced to fight to protect himself. This time he does NOT use excessive force, but the attacker is killed. Andrews panic and assumes they won't believe him because he's trying to cover death. Instead, an innocent man is eventually found guilty of the crime. <br /> <br /> There is much more to the film than that - including a plot involving a clever villain (Gary Merrill) and a love interest for Andrews (Gene Tierney). All in all, this is one of the better examples of the genre - with a great gritty dialogue, excellent lighting and a simple but very effective story. So Noir is meant to be.
