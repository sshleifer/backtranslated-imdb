La Teta I la Luna (The Breast and the Moon) describes the life of a 9-10-year-old boy named Tete, who is obsessed with breasts growing up in Catalunya. I love this movie because the characters are very honest and very human, like all the characters in Bigas Luna's movies (also director of Jamon, Jamon). Tete reminds me of how intriguing and exciting life can be at that age. Catalunya (north-eastern Spain) also brought many memories into my mind. This movie shows how beautiful Catalunya is, nice people, nice life and specially many non-withdrawal people.
