Another channel 4 big canned long before it's time. Silly by Phil Davis and the rest of the cast. Sexy, intelligent and funny. I remember watching it at the moment and even when I was moving around, nobody really heard it. But finding someone who can recall it is even harder. Maybe Channel 4 can't do their job well enough to double the enthusiasm needed. Either that or the general public is also interested in the TV riot, this is Big Brother. I suspect the latter. Downloading Garth Merengie's Dark Place asked Channel 4 to release a DVD of the series. Let's hope the same can happen to North Square.
