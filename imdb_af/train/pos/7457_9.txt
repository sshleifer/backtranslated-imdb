This is one of the best band games I've ever played because: <br /> <br /> The missions are great to play, they have a lot of action in them. They can be very difficult, sometimes making it even more fun. weapons you use are really good. The cars in this game are really good. The management assignments are fun to do. This James Bond game has a good story about it. The voice about actors in this game is really good and it is cool that pierce brosnan is in this game and the way the characters look is really good because they look like they are in real life, which is really cool. Also the graphics in this game are pretty good. <br /> <br /> Overall score ********* from **********
