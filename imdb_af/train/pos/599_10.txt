I thoroughly enjoyed this movie because there was a sincere sincerity in the play. The writing was on top. James Arness is a good actor and he showed it here. Brian Keith was too old to be Davy Crockett, and can anyone really play Davy but Fess Parker? <br /> <br /> Another great actor in this move was Raul Julia, who gave depth to Santa Anna, a vain and complex person. which led Mexico through turbulent times. <br /> <br /> While some may think the movie is slow, it caught the battle as it unfolded, a lot of tedium followed by a few hours of terrifying terror. <br /> <br /> What impressed me most about this movie is that it reminds you of a cause and how some people are willing to die for what they believe. On this day and age where no-one is advocating, I found it refreshing to think that there was a time when people died for freedom, no matter how you feel about politics of the time.
