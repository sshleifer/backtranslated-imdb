It was a bit bizarre and angry and I really enjoyed it, the characters in the show were also good and complemented each other well. I was sorry to see it cut off. I'd love to see where it could have been. You found yourself leaning on Lucas. Buck the sheriff who had more secrets than anyone. Lucas was scary and tempting. And I would have liked to see him more and how his character became. However, I will buy the show just to enjoy, it was great to do something else on TV. And Paige Turrco, who was Caleb's cousin, she was a great secret about where and what she meant to Lucas. It's a pity it hasn't been around yet. Or never finished, I would like to see what would have happened.
