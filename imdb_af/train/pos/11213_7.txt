This second movie is just as interesting as the previous one, except that there is no tension. We know what he is going to do and what will happen before it even appears on the screen. Then the pleasure comes only from the way the different tricks happen and its succession. We know there will be dynamics in the car, that he will lose a wheel, that the car will have an accident, just to talk about the car. And that's what happens. Now the details and details are for you to discover in the movie. The fact that he is being chased by a dumb woman is clear and must come, but we know that he has already seen her and knows that he is being dragged into a trap. Now, how will he get out of it? You must discover this yourself. And don't worry about getting the main dealership, but how about a different story. A speedboat does not match our busy beaver on the river. We also know when he will be wounded. They didn't know what bullet-proof jackets were in those days. It is true recently that it has been discovered that some CIs did not have the kind of equipment in Iraq. But what is the meaning of such a movie? This insistence on the hunters of the merchants and this blindness who do not see that is the ban that creates the problem. But the film is a constant and perfect illustration that there is no value that can ever stand in the way of this moralistic crusade against the forces of evil. Why not justify these goods so they can be properly observed and supervised? If something is not illegal or pushed out of the way, it is less fun to use it to do so.

It is the forbidden or limited that is attractive. <br /> <br />
