Unfortunately not available on DVD, but worth pursuing on TCM or VHS. A secretary thinks her boss is mistakenly accused of murder, and takes courageous characters to find the truth. A movie with lots of twists and dark corridors, of which I will not mention anything! The jazz series in which our heroine seeks information on the killer is one of the most erotic scenes in Hollywood history, despite being on a very low budget and during World War II in black and white. Despite the low budget - Long Island looks somewhat mountainous - it's a movie of original style and outstanding vision. Ella Raines was a great actress discovered by Howard Hawks. He knew many of these things. They stole the funniest women - Joanne Dru, Hepburn, Angie Dickinson, Lauren Bacall, Ann Sheridan - from their era. Robert Siodmak was one of several German, Hungarian and Czech filmmakers - Sirk, Wilder, Zinnemann, Lubitsch, Curtiz, Lang, etc. - who moved emigras to Hollywood and brought a very original fresh vision. Unfortunately, Ella Raines has never been given such a large share, and eventually it ends up in poorly-produced westerners.
