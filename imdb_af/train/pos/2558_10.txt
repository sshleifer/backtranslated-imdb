Maybe it's love? <br /> <br /> Brando did his usual good job. Garner did a better job than he usually does. He is good, but it showed how good he can be. Umecki-chan had a helluva debut here and while I think she deserved her statue, she didn't really stretch. It was a role that no one who was not overseas would have acknowledged and the latest was the cork. <br /> <br /> The right playmaker was Red Buttons. Red was the best thing in this movie. Bank on it. And the Japanese lifestyle was also in an admirable light. <br /> <br /> A classic.
