I'm glad that users (from this date) who keep this movie are coming forward now. I don't understand the people who don't like this movie - they seem to expect a serious (?!?!?) Treatment! How can you take the prospect of a killer snowman seriously? The filmmakers knew it was a stupid condition and they did not deny it. The straight look of scenes really makes it fun! Yes, there are times when the low budget shows (like that explosion scene), but I think an expensive look would have taken away from the fun of the movie! So, if you like B-movies, and the goofy look addresses you, you'll definitely love "Jack Frost".
