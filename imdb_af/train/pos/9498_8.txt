"See painting, then you remember better than you saw." So says Dick Heldar (Ronald Colman), the painter in The Light That Failed. The movie is in the big old Hollywood style, with Ronald Colman and a bravura supporting role that Ida Lupino includes in her first major role, reliable character actor Dudley Digges (who was also condemned with Colman.), And a solid performance by wonderful actor Walter Huston. <br /> <br /> The title and the sequel of the movie almost gives Dick the face. He is blinded by gun powder discharge, as he and the child's sweet Maisie (Muriel Angelus) play with a gun. Later a wound while fighting in the Sudan is the catalyst for his blindness. He becomes a well-known painter, but he is already blinded by ambition and does not reach his full potential to the point that his face leaves him. Enter bad girl Bessie (Ida Lupino), and his self-destruction is being implemented. Lupino is very strong in this role and plays very well from Colman. Her evil tart reminds me of Bette Davis in human bondage. <br /> <br /> Well behaved and well directed, this is one of my favorite Colman melodramas.
