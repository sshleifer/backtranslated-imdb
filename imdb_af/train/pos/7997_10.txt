It is by far one of the better-made movies and has not disappointed me at all. The soundtrack along with fine-kicked hand-camera work was beautiful. It is always possible that a movie will not just hold such a belief, but I have felt the rhythm of this picture and the timing was excellent. Dakota Fanning quickly becomes a staple in film that a child needs with an old soul personality and she never disappointed me with her talent. What Mr. Washington and, of course, Christopher Walken, both overcame the challenge of making the darkest sides of mankind look like light.
