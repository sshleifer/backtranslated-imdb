While driving a few years ago from Skagway, Alaska to Dawson City, Yukon and impressed me with the scenery, I can't help but this picture, even though it has beautiful color and scenic views, in the real place shot. Jasper in the Canadian Rockies is a great place, but still not the place where the movie takes place. When the story moves to Dawson, it's as if I could have used Anthony Mann, who used the outdoor areas as well as he did, if he had filmed in the real place. James Stewart here is another man fighting in himself, one side of him does not want to get involved and helps people who stand in the way of earning money and the other cannot look away from people being murdered. Ruth Roman is the ambitious woman who doesn't care who she is treading, Corinne Calvet is the beautiful girl. Mann is excellent with the shooting, but the highlight of the film is how good he is in the outdoor scene. He uses the outdoors as much as he can, and he is helped by the winter painting, the dominant white, as it was with the vegetables in "The Naked Spur" and the brown in "The Man From Laramie". Like all the Mann Stewards, it's a traditional western, with a difference in the effect of Stewart's more complex character.
