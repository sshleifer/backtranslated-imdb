I'm a fan of animal movies. If you can take a plot and place animals as lead players, you will usually win me. Homeward Bound has just this. They took a plot that was as old as time and made a new twist on it. It was a complete success. It's a very archetypal movie. You have the obi-van of the group (shadow) that is wise and logical, you have the loving but turbulent and restless chance, and the spicy princess who thinks she must be tamed and praised. These three personalities jump very well apart. I also like how they made Chance and Sassy so dynamic characters, and they didn't make it in arrears. Most people say it can't be good, because it's too much of a children's movie. However, what they forget is that it is supposed to be a children's movie, and it still doesn't take away from the movie. It's a good movie to watch when you're bored and you just want to watch a movie. It's a Disney movie without the cartoons, a better-plot aerial movie. I will definitely advise you to see it.
