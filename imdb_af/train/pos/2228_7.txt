The biggest problem I see with this movie is its score, screaming with every note, "This is a cheap-ass movie." There is not much more to say here. The second point, which I see very seriously, as well as the finishing of the plot near the end of the film (one of the money shots, if you will), is the dialogue between Martha (Adrienne Barbeau) and the sunflower (Richard Ziman) , in which Martha is revealed as the leader of the experiment. The viewer at all times during this dialogue is very aware that he / she is listening to a movie dialogue. In other words, the suspension of unbelief breaks down here. The integrity of a credible dialogue between two people is being offered for a refugee of information that the filmmakers want to share with the audience. <br /> <br /> The third problem was Adrienne Barbeau's decision. While I honestly believe her to be a great actress in her oeuvre, I feel this part could be too much of a piece. The main point of her performance, which did not seem to be the gauze, was the spectrum that the character moved through the film from a loving mother of a troubled family to an almost Rambo-like woman on a mission. Of course, this aspect of the screenplay would have been great for any actress, so you can't blame Barbeau for too much. To the extent that she acted properly on her part, I would call it a moderately serious problem on the film as a whole. <br /> <br /> Finally, the film made a wonderful work in the first half building a crawling factor, especially during his horror flashes. I feel the movie would have benefited from more of a commitment to this flash as a mechanism to prevent a fizzling of the creep factor in the second half of the film. <br /> <br /> So what's my holistic rating of this piece? I give it a solid C + to B - depending on how much credit you tend to give the makers to produce this movie on a limited budget. Even with two serious and two moderately serious problems, the film is depicted on the solid plot of the Jungian side of Nazi mysticism. I see no problems with plot development or coherence; The dialogue, with the exception mentioned above, is strikingly brilliant in places, especially the key key scene between mother and daughter at the beginning of the movie; As already mentioned, the creep factor was well manufactured, if it was a little fizzly in the second half; and Nicholas Brendan, who also produced, made a wonderful show. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie is definitely worth it. --- See it with a Nazi lover. :)
