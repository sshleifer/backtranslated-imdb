Now the two climbers and pilots are forced to play a deadly game. While Quaien was trying to find the millions of dollars, he kidnapped Tucker to find the money. After Tucker got the money, Tucker would be dead. Against explosive fires, bitterly cold and dark heights. Walker must survive Quaien for survival. <br /> <br /> Directed by Renny Harlin (Driven, Mindhunters, A Nightmare at 4 Elm Street: The Dream Master) made an entertaining, non-stop action photo. This film is a spectacular, exciting, visually exciting action photo with very dark humor. It was one of the biggest hits of 1993. It is one of Harlin's best films. Lithgow is a terribly entertaining villain. Stallone definitely made a short return from this sharp thriller. It's probably Harlin's best work as a movie maker. <br /> <br /> DVD has a sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35: 1) transmission and a fantastic Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has a running commentary by the director commenting on Stallone. DVD also has technical crew comments. DVD has behind the scenes featurette, two extracted scenes with introduction by the director and more. Don't miss this great action movie. Screen shot by Micheal France (Fantastic Four) and actor: Stallone (The Rocky Series). Based on a performance by John Long. Excellent cinematography by Alex Thomson, B.S.C. (AlienÂ³, Demolition Man, Legend). Oscar Nominate for Best Sound, Best Sound Editing and Best Visual Effects. Panavision. (**** / *****).
