As a lover of the surrealistic (in art and film) I was delighted to discover this movie on IFC. This is definitely a custodian. Most of the other reviews tell the general plot (not everything is right), so I won't bother to tolerate it. The most important thing is the alternative world concept brought by Ana's threatening disease, and the way she can liaise with someone else after being so "alone", and eventually with her family, which I believe is still a little upset. . It can only be called a horror movie as it has terrifying scenes, but it is a fantasy (with a small hint of "age" just because Ana is a pre-teen who "hates boys"). I highly recommend it to those who appreciate the imagination of their imagination.
