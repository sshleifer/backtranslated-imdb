Well, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It was funny and sad and yes, the old Andie MacDowell was completely out. Interesting, realistic characters and plots as well as beautiful scenery. I think my mom would like it. I still think they should be allowed to call it the Sad F ** candle club though ...
