Sidney Young (Pegg) moves from England to New York to work for Sharpe's popular magazine in a hope of living his dream style, but struggles to make a lasting impression. <br /> <br /> Based on Toby Young's book on survival in American business, these comedy dramas have received mixed views of criticism. Written as inconsistently funny, but with the charm of the actors, how to lose friends, seemed like the mill of the mill went. Pond fish make fun on another culture comedy, but it's not. <br /> <br /> This 2008 photo works based on its actors and the simple but sharp story. We start in the past, then in the present, and work our way forward to see how Young made his mark on one of America's top magazines. <br /> <br /> Pegg (Hot Fuzz) is too nice for words. Whether it's zombies with a cricket bat or his character play on the nature of the law, the English actor brings a charming and light heart to every scene. Here, when the mini-dissertation is good, but far from its own standards, it brings a lot of energy to the picture, and it alone is worth watching. His fianc√© with "Babe 3" is unforgivable, just breathtaking things like his overwhelming dance, but he does great work. <br /> <br /> Bridges and Anderson are good at portraying the stereotypical magazine bases where Dunst fits. beautiful to the confused love interest. Megan Fox, who stole Transformers, reminds everyone that she can act here with a funny hyperbola of a stereotypical movie star. The fact that her character, Sophie Myles, is starring in Mother Teresa's picture, is so laudable as her character's fraud in the pool. To emphasize the point, there is a dog, and Pegg rinsing it in the real Brit style comedy, with a big twist. <br /> <br /> Although a British movie, there is an adaptation of the American lifestyle to Young while trying to fit in and we can see the different approaches to storytelling. Young wants the right dirty as opposed to American professionalism. The inclusion of contemporary tabloid stars will soon make this movie dated, but the concept of exploitation of movie stars gives this edge. <br /> <br /> Meadow's first photo isn't perfect. There are dilapidated concentrations, as the plot becomes too soggy with an uncomfortable obvious twist and too many characters are needed. The physical comedy can also be redone. As a lace note, the bloopers on the DVD are some of the best you'll ever see, which is almost half an hour. <br /> <br /> This comedy drama once again shone on Simon Pegg and with the collective approach to storytelling and sharp comedy, it's worth watching.
