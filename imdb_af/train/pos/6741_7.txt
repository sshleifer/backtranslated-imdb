The title sequence shows the credits written on a rain-covered pavement while people trusted it; music is provided by someone whistling Alfred Newman's Street Scene. Then we meet Det. Sgt. Mark Dixon (Dana Andrews), who always wanted to be something his old man was not: a man on the right side of the law. But he's pretty angry with a good guy. After several complaints about his harsh people, she has boss, Insp. Nicholas Foley (Robert F. Simon) demonstrates him. Foley told him he was a good man, but had to get his head straight and more like Det. Lt. Thomas (Karl Malden), who just received a promotion. Meanwhile, Tommy Scalise (Gary Merrill, in a beautiful slimy show) has an illegal dice game and is going to make a sucker. from the rich Ted Morrison (Harry Von Zell), brought in by Ken Paine (Craig Stevens) and his beautiful wife Morgan (Gene Tierney). She figures too late her husband uses her as a trap and Paine hits her when she refuses to play together. The chivalry Morrison intervenes, but Paine knocks him out cold. It looks like the worst of it, but later the man seems dead; and Paine looks guilty. <br /> <br /> But it won't be Paine's story. Soon Dixon fell in love with Morgan ?? but not before he lost his temper again and committed a terrible act he was trying to cover. Morgan's father, a fairy tale taxi driver (Tom Tully), can take the rap for that. It is up to Dixon to try and fix the debt on Scalise. <br /> <br /> Otto Preminger writes a letter to Ben Hecht and three others from the novel "Night Cry" by William L. Stuart. It's a solid film noir with great performances and all the shadow photography and dark morality we expect from this genre. It keeps to the brightly lit end, which looks like something the studio filmed to saturate the sensors. Of course, the classic noir directed by Preminger and with Andrews and Tierney in the lead, is Laura. You will enjoy it, but you can't miss it.
