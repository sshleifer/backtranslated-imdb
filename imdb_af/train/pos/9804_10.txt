"Batman: The Mystery of the Batwoman" is about as entertaining as animated Batman movies. <br /> <br /> While still in the feel of the comic books, the animation is made with a lighter spirit than in the animated series. Bruce Wayne looks a lot like he used to, but now he looks rather less impressive. The Dick Grayson Robin was replaced by the less noble, more youthful Tim Drake Robin. <br /> <br /> As usual, Kevin Conroy calls Batman's voice better than most live action actors. <br /> <br /> Kelly Ripa did a lot more decent voice-acting than I expected. <br /> <br /> As in the live-action Batman movies, the movie lives or dies based on the quality of the villains. My all-time favorite, the Penguin, is here. Its design is slimmer than it previously appeared, and has heard more of the Burgess Meredith depiction of the '60s than the Danny DeVito depiction of Batman Returns. David Ogden Stiers is the perfect choice for the penguin's voice. The Penguin is eventually portrayed as a cunning sophistication, just as it appears most in the comics. Hector Elizondo's voice creates a track that is much more memorable than the forgotten version in "Batman & Robin." And finally, Batman has a descent mystery to solve, getting the "Detective" back in "Detective Comics" (that's what "DC" stands for.) The revolution to the mystery is a beautiful, clumsy turn. <Br /> <br /> The score adds to the mysterious atmosphere of the movie. It sounds like a mix between the score of "Poirot" and the score of "Mission: Impossible." All in all, it's more entertaining than your average cartoon.
