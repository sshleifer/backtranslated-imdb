I decided not to believe what well-known film critics say. Although this movie didn't get the best comment, this movie made my day. That thought me. What a false world it is. <br /> <br /> What do you do if your loved ones mislead you. It is said that it doesn't matter how often you feed milk to a snake, it can never be loyal and will bite when given a chance. Likewise, some people are such that they are never grateful. This movie is about how selfish people can be and how everyone ultimately thinks about yourself and works for yourself. <br /> <br /> A brother accidentally dies in the hands of a gunman. The surviving brother decides to take revenge. Through this process we learn about the futility of this world. Nothing is real and no one is faithful to anyone. <br /> <br /> Amitabh gave the performance of his life. The new actor Aryan performed well. The actress who played the wife of Amitabh stole the show. Her role was small, but she played her role so diligently that she was moving through her performance. Chawla had really good facial expressions, but her role was very limited and wasn't the chance to fully express herself. <br /> <br /> A great movie by Raj Kumar Santoshi. His movies always give a message to the audience. His films are like novels by Nanak Singh (a Punjabi novelist whose novels always had a purpose and targeted a social evil) because they have a real message to the audience. They are both entertaining and entertaining.
