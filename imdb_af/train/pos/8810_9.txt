I saw this movie for the first time when it aired a few years ago on the now-defrosted Trio channel and recently watched it - sans commercials - at Sundance. I was impressed for the first time, and even more applied to the second show. Yes, some of the segments are far from perfect - Amos Gitai's hysterical comment is like a sore thumb - but collectively, 11 09 01 is a complete success. Best of the Show: Shohei Imamura's Wonderful Final Segment, which is misleading contemporary critics such as the bold Mick LaSalle in some way as an attack on 'the terrorists', but is now revealed as a masterful anti-war polemic . Samira Makhmalbaf's opening piece that blends deep empathy with the victims of 9/11, with preliminary concern for the children of Afghanistan; and Idrissa Ouedraogo's amusing child crossing for Osama Bin Laden - a hunt so much serious and successful as the one for the real Osama. Youssef Chahine's segment is a noble or failed experiment that at least has the audacity to remind that Bin Laden and al'Qaeda are basically American foreign policy creations and the CIA. Although Sean Penn's character study is out of place, it's still an effective bittersweet piece of film. All in all, essential viewing, and a darn sight better than Oliver Stone's reactionary World Trade Center.
