Don't know if it contains spoilers or not, but I don't want the risk of being blacklisted by the year 3462. <br /> <br /> I totally disagree with the viewer's comments that described. * Guns, Germs and Steel * as "politically correct" and "neo-marxist." They didn't watch the same series I did. <br /> <br /> The series * I * depicted the history of European colonization in the Americas and Southern Africa without any specific inaccuracies. I have seen nothing in the series that Europeans portrayed as bad people who were happy, although Europeans were often * happy - and there is nothing wrong with happiness. I also did not see indigenous peoples portrayed as little small innocent things. As something, the Inca was rather arrogant. As you would expect any leader to be when dealing with foreigners, if his country was not captured by any other world power in memory. <br /> <br /> I have certainly seen nothing that can be considered Marxist or Neo-Marxist, except by the most incredible elasticity of imagination. <br /> Otherwise, many African peoples * have built-in immunity to malaria and other tropical diseases lacking Europeans. By the time they were aware of their successes, the Aztec, Maya and Inca civilizations were as advanced as any other in the world - and so rich; sometimes more so. Native American and Khoi-San populations * were denied by smallpox and other diseases introduced by Europeans; just as European colonists were rejected by tropical diseases such as malaria. (NOTE: The Khoi-San peoples are quite different from all other African Sahara tribes.) <br /> <br /> So, I don't see what some of the other commentators are complaining about. The only thing I can complain about is that the series doesn't tell me anything I didn't know when I finished the seventh grade. There is really nothing new in the way of historical information in this movie. However, it offers some good dramatizations of events, such as the conquest of the Incas; the production values ​​are very high; and it fills here and there a few holes that aren't in Mrs. Gruber's sixth-hour social studies class at Milan Middle School is covered. <br /> <br /> If you rent or buy it, as if you are a decent primary and / or secondary education, you will not learn anything new, but you will have a pleasant and entertaining time to review what you already have learned (or had learned) by the time you hit high school.
