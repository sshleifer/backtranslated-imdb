There is a good reason why Walter Pidgeon warns Leslie Nielson and his relief crew crew about things he doesn't dream about. <br /> <br /> As Dr. Edward Morbius, Pidgeon is the last survivor of an expedition that came to this planet 20 years earlier. Since then, he has married another expedition and has a daughter, Anne Francis. They are the only people left on this planet who once were home to an ancient civilization known as the Krell. <br /> <br /> The records deciphered by Pidgeon indicate that the Krell came to a disastrous end of unknown origin. The machinery they left behind is still functioning. <br /> <br /> Maybe it works too well if members of the relief party start dying and in a particularly gruesome way. <br /> <br /> I see all sorts of speculation about a remake and it's one movie not to fix, as it's as fresh as it was in 1956. The terms would change, we would now say welding speed instead of hypertension, taking into account the ongoing popularity of Star Trek. <br /> <br /> We may not see the men in the relief mission in a flying saucer like a spaceship. It may look more like the Starship Enterprise or the Ship from 2001 as a Space Odyssey. It is interesting to look at science fiction films of different generations and see how the concepts of the future change. <br /> <br /> The story behind Forbidden Planet is a timeless one about mortal beings that God is trying to play. /> <br /> You can't write about Forbidden Planet without commenting on Robby the Robot. This mechanical miracle, compiled by Pidgeon with the knowledge he had acquired to study the Krell, was quite the setback in the day. He got a new lease in the sixties with the character of the Lost In Space robot. His plays with Earl Holliman who plays the cook on the spaceship and his satisfaction with Earl's request for some home spirits is very funny. <br /> <br /> Robby and the other special effects were nominated for an Oscar, but lost to The Ten Commandments and the Separation of the Red Sea. Forbidden Planet's crash to erect a Hollywood founder such as Cecil B. DeMille. <br /> <br /> Classics among you will recognize the Forbidden Planet as a futuristic rework of The Tempest. Thinking about it, Shakespeare's could be one. venture into science fiction. <br /> <br /> My favorite under the film is Warren Stevens whose sacrifice makes it possible for Leslie Nielsen to learn exactly what he does. <br /> <br /> Never miss this one when broadcast.
