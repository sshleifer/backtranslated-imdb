"Written on the Wind" was a very successful universal picture. This can only be done by Douglas Sirk, a man who saw the possibilities in the material he was given. Based on a popular novel by Robert Wilder and an adaptation by George Zuckerman, it has all the elements that make an excellent melodrama: nimfomania, a great oil fortune, alcoholism, incest and a light touch of homosexuality. Mr. Sirk set out for what would follow in the soap opera genre, mainly Dallas and Dynasty. Just to name two. <br /> <br /> The fact is that this movie is completely shot inside a studio. Most of the d√©cor is ominous. Like many of the 1950s, "Written on the Wind" was shot entirely in a studio lot. Just look at the screens that have to happen in Manhattan, or Miami, or even the lake, to see how the landscape is a painted backdrop. Mr. Sirk couldn't give any less about realism, as long as he could tell the story his own way. <br /> <br /> We recently caught a show, part of a revival of Mr. Sirk's work, where people laugh at some of the most dramatic moments, especially during the scenes where Rock Hudson, who plays the good Mitch Wayne, appears. There is also something graphical in the way that both Robert Keith, who plays Patriarch Jasper Hadley, and later on his own daughter, the evil Marylee, adorn the oil bean stone that adorns the older man's desk, a kind of phallic object. <br /> <br /> Douglas Sirk probably wanted to give his best performance on the best performances, which makes sense in the way Dorothy Malone portrays the nymphomania Marylee, and to a certain extent Robert Stack, who is Kyle's accused heir the story. It will probably be the easy explanation of what comes across the screen. The only one that looks normal is Lauren Bacall, who is not asked to make her Lucy Moore look, but a good-natured person trapped with the wrong crowd. <br /> <br /> Along with his other Hollywood movies, "Written on the Wind" shows the genius of a talented director who just gave the public what they wanted to see: stories greater than life just on the big screen could be seen
