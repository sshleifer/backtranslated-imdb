A young woman comes to his husband's hometown after he died in an accident. She barely comes in this small town, but shortly afterwards she loses her son in a kidnapping and all her hopes ... It can lead to all kinds of plots in a normal movie: find a new partner and eventually; or depressed enough to struggle and eventually kill herself. She tried to kill herself, but not to a series of serious fights with God. She trusts in God, only to find that God forgives everyone, even the murderer. Well, I have to be careful about God, the movie doesn't mean anything against God. The way the film deals with the issue is very interesting: not in the woman's point of view or from God's perspective (in this way, there will be a lot of grass growing, clouds looking at it, I think). On the contrary, it is from a third party's eye, the film allows us to see and does not explain anything. <br /> <br /> The movie wouldn't be as interesting if there was only the woman. There is this man who is all around the woman and naturally falls in love with her, but in his own way. He's a funny man, like a clown I have to say, hanging around our heroine shamelessly. The combination of these two, the woman full of excitement, crying and always throwing, and the man smiling and talking dumb, ends in a good balance of emotions: nothing absurd or wrong to sow. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
