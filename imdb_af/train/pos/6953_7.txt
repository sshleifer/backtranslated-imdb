It's one of those movies that make better trailers than full-fledged feature films. The concept was really cool and different, the humor was unique, I just felt there were opportunities missed to put the "punch" in this movie. So many lines and gags were hung too long, with no definite end and really didn't make me laugh. Wilson, Wilson, Farris & Thurman were wonderful. Wanda Sykes was used in this film and needed more exposure, and more opportunities to turn her character into more screen time. 7 out of 10 for me, more for a DVD rental. I was also looking for some kind of good music video during the final credits, something that became a trademark for these romantic comedy films, a lazy something about Mary, met the parents, but again I was listening a bit to the the fact that it could have been a much better movie with a little more music and punchier punch lines. It feels like it's RUSHED in theaters.
