OK, I wouldn't normally watch a Farrelly brother's movie. I can't remember ever watching. I also don't remember a Jimmy Fallon movie. All right, I watched taxi, but I said I was guilty and forgiven. But this movie had Drew Barrymore and I just think she's the cutest thing. I don't know what it is about her, but I just smile all the time I see her. She didn't catch me like that. I mean, I even looked at Adam Sandler to see her just in 50 First Dates. How sad is that? It wasn't the biggest baseball movie - it wasn't supposed to be. It was a love story about a sad puppy hanging out to the only thing that never left him until he found something worth giving up. It had a predictable end but there was so much on the road that made it worth it.
