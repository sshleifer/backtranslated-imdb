Love the characters and the story line. Very funny with lots of action. Thomas Ian Griffith and Tia Carrer give good performances. I enjoyed the dynamic and comical interaction of Griffith and Career. Donald Southerland plays a very pleasant, and surprisingly sympathetic, burnt-out man. All three actors are one of my favorites and made them into this movie for a special entertainment. A great addition to my extensive DVD collection. I recommend this movie. If you want to ... Mr. And Mrs. Smith, The Replacement Murderers, L.A. Confidential, The Long Kiss Goodnight, The Abyss and, The Whole Nine Yards ... you will love this movie.
