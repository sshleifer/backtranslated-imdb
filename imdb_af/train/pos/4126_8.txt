What a night. Perry Mason then Gun, Will, followed by Gunsmoke (when it was half an hour) and finally at 10:30 came "Sea Hunt" with his wonderful opening theme music and Mike's boat sailing for a new adventure. Terrific. Regardless of the story, it was the main character (played by Lloyd Bridges), strong, honest, sincere. A Man's Man and a Son's Man. It brought an interest in boats that lasted for years. Why they don't show on the cable or make it available on video, no idea. Too bad.
