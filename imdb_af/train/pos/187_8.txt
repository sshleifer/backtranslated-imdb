Marion Davies stars in this remarkable comedy "Show People" released by MGM in 1928. Davies plays a hiccup from Savannah, Georgia, who arrives in Hollywood with her father (Dell Henderson). The jealousy that they enter is a snag - like Davies' outrageous southern costume. Davies lands a job in slapstick comedy, not what she wants, but it brings her success. She meets fellow sleeping sticker William Haines, who is immediately beaten to her. Well, Davies then gets a job at a more prestigious studio ("High Art Studios") and lands a work in stuffy pieces. A clean but fake actor (Andr√© Telefair) shows her the ropes of being the typical pretentious Hollywood star. Davies leaves her slapstick friend and father for the good life, but of course doesn't teach who she really is. Marion Davies is wonderful throughout, as she - exorbitantly - performs the magnitude of the emotions of a "serious" actress. William Haines is his usual wonderful comic self, and there are cameos by Charles Chaplin, John Gilbert, and other famous stars of the day, including the director of the film, King Vidor. It's a silent movie with a few "sound effects", as sound images come in their own. A treasure of a movie.
