If you played "Spider-Man" on the PS version, you saw it all. To really experience it, you need to get the DC version. Simply put, it's a very graphically better game; the textures are sharp, levels are easy to navigate, and it has much better sound, then it is PS cousin. I bought this game late in the 00's and it still holds to this day. Well, wonder: Ultimate Alliance is a much better and strategic game, but if you're a fan of 'Ol Web Head, then you owe it to yourself to pick it up for your gambling library. Swinging around the city as Spidey has never looked so good and deadly in a video game. If you have a Dreamcast, it is cheap for cheap. The DC version is simply incredible.
