one of the funniest Mario's I've ever played. The levels are creative, there is fluid control, and good graphics for his time. There is also a multitude of crazy bosses and enemies to fight. Sometimes the levels get frustrating, and if you leave some of the hard levels and still need to get more to fight a boss, it can be annoying. Another complaint is the camera angle. Although it works pretty well most of the time, it can be a pain in some situations. if you have a great time mario fan; this one for you. even if you are not a big fan of him, I would still recommend this one. It's a great game, and getting what you need can take a while, but it's very satisfying. good to play in short periods. It will almost certainly keep your interest; it certainly holds mine!
