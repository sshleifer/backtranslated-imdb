If you like CB4, you have no idea what you miss if you haven't seen this movie yet. This movie is crazy, hilarious and contains much more about the hip hop industry than any other parody movie. It is a pity that this movie was not released on DVD because it was one movie that everyone I ever watched loved and wanted a copy. If you really want a good laugh, and you like hip hop and a little familiar with some high school performers, rent this movie definitely. There aren't so many video rentals that have copies of them, but if you come across one, you won't be disappointed.
