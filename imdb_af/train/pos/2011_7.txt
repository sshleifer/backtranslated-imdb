If you've never seen this movie and like veteran actors, it's the movie for you. See Frank Sinatra when he was very young and extremely thin with the cheeks sinking and a wonderful voice that sang good old songs. Michele Morgan (Millie Pico) has an excellent performance with numerous dance and musical numbers. Leon Errol (Cyrus Drake) played a major supporting role with Victor Borge (Sir Victor Fitzroy Victor) who performed classical piano and no clapping stick comedy as he did in his career. It is not a great musical, but Frank Sinatra was a great joy to see in the beginning of his career in the 1940s.
