Intense actors such as Bruce Dern, Jason Patrick and Rachel Ward combine to make this contemporary film noir a winner. Of the three, I don't know who was most interesting, because everyone offers good performances and intriguing characters. <br /> <br /> Patric does the narrative in this noir, plays a former boxer and spiritual patient. Wow, it only makes for an interesting guy! He looks stupid, but he's not. Wyk is the slender, attractive, cynical, intelligent and compassionate fellow conspirator of a kidnapping plan. Bruce Dern is also in the mix and Dern never fails to fascinate any movie. <br /> <br /> The movie can be considered a kind of downer for the average viewer, but I found it fascinating .... and I don't like depressing movies normally. What I found was a kind of strange crime movie. Check out and see if you agree. It is a rather unfamiliar movie that does not have to have that status because it is just a good story and well done.
