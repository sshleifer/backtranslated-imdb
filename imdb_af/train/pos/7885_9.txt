First of all, I have to start this comment by saying I'm a great nightmare on Elm Street fan. I think this is the biggest horror series ever. For me, Freddy is the bowman! Of course, Freddy's Dead, who was later the last chapter, is a strange movie. It doesn't have the same atmosphere as the previous movies. Freddy has a lot of screen time. Some think it makes him less scary, which I disagree. And that is exactly the point. This film exists so we can know Freddy a little better, who he is, who he was, how he became the man who made our dreams come true. For some it is a bad thing, it is better if we never know, because it is scarce not to know why evil is angry. Obviously, people won't like Rob Zombie's Halloween remake. To really enjoy this one, you need to see things differently. It's not about a strange man hiding in the bush of your dreamland and waiting to scare hell out of you. It was the first one, and it was wonderful. As the years passed, Freddy killed more and more people, and no one could ever get rid of him. Now is the time to learn about the nature of this evil, the psychological aspects of Freddy's terrorism. Besides the story of Freddy's past, I also really enjoyed the atmosphere of the movie. No more kids in Springwood, just crazy adults. The nightmare scenes are all great. The soundtrack is great, especially the opening song called "I'm Awake Now" by Goo Goo Dolls. In my opinion, The Final Nightmare is a horror masterpiece and I can't believe it is so underestimated. Perhaps it is wrong to understand whether I have different tastes! Anyway, all Freddy fans should watch it. It has many scary moments, as well as funny moments, and a lot of cameos! Get ready for something else and you shouldn't be disappointed.
