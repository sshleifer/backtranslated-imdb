This is the kind of movie the US doesn't make. That's why people rent foreign films. It's a wonderful story about how one person, even if he is delayed, can find a person in an empty life. Everyone can learn from Georges. It also shows how people who are spiritually challenged live in their lives and show them in a very realistic way (I think). As its classic in foreign films, this movie has a bittersweet ending, but it just makes it a better movie.
