David Duchovney creates a role he has to repeat in California - the upset talent. And that is a role he plays well. <br /> <br /> This thriller starts with good speed and brings you to the end. Timothy Hutton plays a fine villain and Angelina Jolie pouts. The story of a shameful doctor who finds his way into a criminal world is well written. Drug addiction and a desire for the sultry Jolie mixes a greasy cocktail. Unfortunately, at the end, the story gets a little weaker and the relationships between villains and the FBI are astounded and rushed as if it were just created to develop the final scene. But, aside, a movie worth watching.
