This film does a great job of portraying the fate of an ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease) sufferer. The subject is done with compassion and humor. Helena Bonham Carter is as convincing as a person with ALS that I find it hard to believe she just acted. Kenneth Branagh, a wonderful actor, lives up to expectations as the peculiar artist abusing and forced to serve with Helena's character as part of his "community service", an alternative to prison. Looking at the development of the relationship between these two is a surprise from beginning to end. The fact that it is a fairy tale does not detract from the fantastic performances. One comes deeply to the two.
