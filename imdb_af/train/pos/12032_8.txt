The movie I am going to review is a small television movie made in 1996. Melissa Joan Hart and Daniel Baldwin starred. <br /> <br /> The main player / antagonist Jennifer Stanton (Hart) is a typical American teenager who feels the pressure to have such a controlling father (Baldwin). But if she meets Nick Ryan (Jeremy Jordan, "Never been kissed"), they immediately fall apart, but Jennifer has a different idea of ​​where to take their relationship. She manipulates him to kill her parents to protect their love, but she just used it to get rid of her parents so she can be with Brad. (David Lascher's future Sabrina partner for Hart). Melissa Joan Hart has really surprised me with her role as an evil manipulator and she's wearing the movie well by using her friends and Nick so she can literally get away with murder. The rest of the supporting casting works well and each one keeps their own when they have screen time. I also found it interesting that this film was made and released the same year, Hart, Teenage Hitch's Sabrina depicted, showing that she can act in my movie and television genres. <br /> <br /> Although the movie has a bit dated. It looks like her best work involving drama or thriller and I'm looking forward to 'Nine Dead' coming out in November because it shows she can be seen as other people who aren't called Clarissa Darling. or Sabrina Spellman "<br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of Melissa Joan Hart or Sabrina. You can watch it on the internet, so I suggest checking it out.
