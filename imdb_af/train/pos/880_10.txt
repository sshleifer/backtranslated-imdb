Probably the best movie of the year for me. These little French film centers are sitting at office secretary Carla (Emmanuelle Devos) who spends her days doing other men's work, unreasonably, and being the source of their mocking and lunch conversation. It's too obvious to her as if she were deaf, she was deaf reading lips. A change is being implemented when renting his new Easter, Paul (Vincent Cassel) as her assistant. The relationship between them is the centerpiece of the film. Mutual dependency, for many different reasons, binds them. Carla is attracted to Paul and to the fact that he makes her feel attractive, as it seems the first time. Paul does nothing to drive away her feelings because he needs her help. He owes money to a local gangster and plans to steal from him what Carlas's ability to read lips will involve. I think the main thing that pushes the film path above an average tension / drama is the wonderful chemistry between the two stars. Throughout the film, no matter what other characters on the screen, you can feel this incredible bond between Carla and Paul. I can't remember seeing such sexual chemistry between two actors. Emmanuell Devos gives a brilliant performance (she won the French emperor for the best actress). You never feel like you're watching a piece of acting, it's actually Carla. The chameleon like Vincent Cassel is also wonderful. He makes a somewhat unattractive character, both attractive and attractive. I loved this movie because of these two people, and both times when I finished it, I wanted to get back into the theater and get involved again.
