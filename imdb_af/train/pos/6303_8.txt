After hearing quite positive reviews and seeing the fan, I had to see this movie. With William H. Macy, Luis Guzman, Michael Jeter and Sam Rockwell present, it had to be good. And it did. Overall the movie is not cracked, you are funny, but there is one scene that really stands out and in my eyes is a classic. SPOILER At the end, breaking through the wall to get to the safe and seeing Rockwell and Washington staring at Jeter is just fantastic. It's just as good as the scene in The Big Lebowski where The Dude uses a chair to barricade his door, but forgets the door turns out! END SPOILER Just watch this movie, you won't be disappointed.
