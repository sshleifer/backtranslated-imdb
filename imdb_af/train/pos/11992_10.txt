Since I remember, I loved and flew aircraft. I am now in college with a private pilot license and would like to become a commercial. I could never remember why I was so obsessed with the subject before coming to my old Tail Spin tapes in my basement and it hit me, it was. My parents bought every loose band they had and that was the only show I would see as a kid. I memorized the theme when I grew up and I can still repeat it today. It's absolutely wonderful and I plan to buy the DVDs soon! It's really good for kids and adults and is absolutely timeless. I can't get enough of this show.
