Beautiful and memorable, beautifully atmospheric, and brilliantly performed by everyone. <br /> <br /> I really can't understand what kind of people burn this masterpiece and consider voting as 8 (and nine one!). <Br /> <br /> This, along with Grapes of Revenge, is John Ford's biggest movie. I would say that Long Voyage Home will be in line next time, but rather back. <br /> <br /> Rating: 10. It earns a 12.
