This interesting Giallo raises a typical but still exciting plot and a very sadistic killer who obviously likes to hunt down his victims before being abused. <br /> <br /> Directed by Emilio P. Miraglia who, one year earlier, also made the very interesting "La Notte che Evelyn Usci della Tomba" (see also my comment on the one). The movie starts a bit slow, but everything is not lost with unnecessary sub-graphs or rows. /> <br /> This film is a German-Italian co-production, but was first released in Germany on video, only in a 15-minute plot under the stupid title "Horror House". At least, the killing scenes that every gore dog will satisfy are completely intact, and the viewer still gets the killer's motive at the end. But the Italian version that contains all the footage is, of course, the one to watch. <br /> <br /> An overwhelming Giallo with mandatory twists and red herring, "La Dama Rossa Uccide Sette Volte", is highly recommended for Giallo fans and slightly better than Miraglia's other thriller mentioned above.
