I liked it very much. In fact, if I see it again (and I plan to do it), I can only love it. I will echo other reviewers by saying that this movie really grows on you as you watch. It starts slowly, but the way in the cover is very natural and has a mood. You just get in it. <br /> <br /> I really watched the movie in the summer and thought the movie was very enjoyable. The characters have a strong element of realism and the film slowly and softly plays a game if you get involved in the various interactions between them all and want to know how it will eventually run out and which paths the characters choose to take. <br /> <br /> I am very surprised that there are less than a dozen comments on this - there are obscure TV movies that have more comment than Rich In Love. <br /> <br /> One thing I will say I missed the end that makes me crazy and I have to see it again to see it. This is a movie that may not be for everyone, but what I feel is greatly underestimated (even some of my most film-filming purist friends who have seen almost every movie have not seen it) and it doesn't look very much. from a message board, but I really enjoyed it and to anyone who likes to enjoy family dramas that fit in with the scenery, atmosphere and an unpleasant speed, it must surely be looked at. Particularly worthy of note is that it's happening in South Carolina, so for those who like me, who love the south, and movies that take place there, it's a jewel. I will add my voice to the nasty few comments and recommend this little-known movie.
