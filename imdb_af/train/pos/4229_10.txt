Don't waste time reading my review. Go out and see this amazingly good episode, which may well be the best Columbo ever written! Ruth Gordon was thrown perfectly as the twilight, but charming secret writer who killed her son-in-law to avenge his daughter's murder. Columbo is his usual discolored, fatter and prudent than he himself, and this particular installment has fantastic chemistry between Gordon and Falk. Ironically, it is not written by heralded creators Levinson or Link, but is possibly the densest, most thorough original and twisted Columbo plot ever. Completely satisfactory in almost every department and overflow with droll and witty dialogue and thought. Actually unexpected and inventive climax tops all. 10/10 ... find this one on Netflix!
