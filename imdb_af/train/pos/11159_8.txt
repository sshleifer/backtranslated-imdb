It's a great movie ... First impressions of cynicism and crassness are soon disrupted by a fun show of how men and women's basics differ (Vive la differs!) <br /> <br /> You can love people despite and sometimes because of their weaknesses. People are a bit of garbage, but we have big hearts and we try our best, despite temptation. It is not our fault if sometimes temptation cannot resist, it is just who we are. <br /> <br /> There is a consistent style from start to finish; sharp photography and sharp composition, very enjoyable display when you add provocative content, appropriate music and aloud essay. <br /> <br /> Beware of the very young "lonely wise voice" ... brilliant; wisdom of innocence that balances the comedy of human condition.
