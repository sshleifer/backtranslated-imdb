I grew up with it as my all-time favorite movie. The special effects are incredible for the era, and won awards. I can remember the dialogue as if I heard it yesterday. It's just a great, timeless adventure. The music is by Miklos Rosza, the best in the history of cinema. Sabu is the thief. Conrad Veidt is the big villain. I got a copy within reach for the next trip to the memory avenue. Wiea there! Rex Ingram wants out of its genii bottle!
