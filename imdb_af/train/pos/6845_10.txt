"Dressed to Kill" is surely one of the best horror / thriller movies ever made. It's stiff, attractive and extremely tense mix of sex and violence. The acting is pretty good, the orchestra party by Pino Donaggio is unforgettable and there are many surprises. "Dressed to Kill" is a murder mystery that is a sexually frustrated housewife (Angie Dickinson), her teenage son (Keith Gordon), her psychic analyst (Michael Caine) and a high-priced call girl (Nancy Allen). The murderer in the film is a transsexual named Bobbi, who is also one of Caine's patients. The film is full of breathtaking moments: the notorious elevator scene is extremely stylish and beautiful.
