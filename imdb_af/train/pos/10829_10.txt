I watched the movie in a preview and I really loved it. The cast is excellent and the plot is sometimes completely hilarious. Another highlight of the movie is definitely the music, which will hopefully be released soon. I recommend it to anyone who loves British humor and especially all musicians. Go look. It's wonderful.
