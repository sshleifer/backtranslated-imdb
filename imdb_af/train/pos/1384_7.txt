Also known as "Water Lilies" this film tells the story of two girls as they struggle their way into the world of love and sex. This story is told at a slow pace and it works very well. It gives enough time and space to get to know the different characters and to grow them slightly. <br /> <br /> Using a small roll, puts some extra pressure on the people who play, as they all have more screen time. as normal but the people playing in this movie handle it well. Everyone is completely credible. Visual environment is great, especially the underwater shots in the pool add a good effect. <br /> <br /> However, many films have been made on the same subject and this one is not really above any of them. It draws a few "standard" printing methods from the high hat and works on it. It's not bad, but not so good, and I feel it could have done better if it took some of the less explored angles. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 synchronous swimmers
