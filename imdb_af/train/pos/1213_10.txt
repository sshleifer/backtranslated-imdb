This film contradicts the first one as far as the origin of the Care Bears and the Care Bear Cousins ​​goes. I won't deny it. However, if you look at 'Part II' as a separate movie, then this is a very good movie. I remember remembering it in the early 80's (and then adjusting to the targeted demographic audience) and it was much more fun than the first movie (not that I didn't enjoy that one, it's just that this one a bit extra ). Sure it's darker than the first one, but maybe that's why it's so good. And it is dark in deeper kind of subtle way (which children may not fully understand, but can still be a little scared because of the atmosphere it gives, and adults will surely get faster than I am now this movie looks again in the middle of the twenties where you basically have a young girl dealing with an evil spirit / devil in exchange for something else. Get the picture? But if you only consider it a child, it may be, as I have said, a little scary, but nothing traumatic. In fact, if it was something, it gave me another fantasy game that I could play when I was that age. I can't tell you how many times I've used to pretend that Dark Heart wanted to imprison me, help me catch the Care Bears, try to turn me to his dark side, and other things like that etc. . movie was also good for my imagination. And it also has a great emotional depth to it. I watched it at least once a week. <br /> <br /> Also Hadley Kay was the perfect choice for the voice of Dark Heart (I always thought so and I will always). <br /> <br /> Now it's just too bad that they never made a soundtrack available. Sometimes I just want to hear Growing Up without watching the movie so well. <br /> <br /> "What is good love and caring if it can't save her?"
