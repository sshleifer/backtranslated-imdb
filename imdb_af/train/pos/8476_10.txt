*** Spoilers * <br /> <br /> My dad signed this movie for me when I was 3. When I was 5, I watched it more than 400 times. I just watched and looked at it. And I'm still doing today! It has a rogue, a lamb's mother is killed by a wolf - a very emotional scene - and wants to become a wolf like him. After years of training, the lamb is made in a really really bad thing. He and the wolf travel to his old barn, but he can't kill the lambs, no matter how much he wants. He ends up killing the wolf, but is no longer seen as a lamb by his former friends, and cannot return to his former way of life. <br /> <br /> The art is beautiful, the songs are .. Well, okay, and the tuner is better than some things today. <br /> <br /> All in all, you just * have to see this movie, it's a great masterpiece. Although, it is very difficult to find today. <br /> <br />
