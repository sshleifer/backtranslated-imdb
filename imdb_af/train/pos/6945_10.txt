My favorite movie genre is western, it's really the only movie genre that is of American origin. And despite Sergio Leone, no one does them like Americans. <br /> <br /> Right at the top of my list of ten Western favorites is Winchester 73. It was the first few and only black and white film of the partnership of Anthony Anthony and actor James Stewart. It was also a landmark film in which Stewart chose for a percentage of the profit instead of a Universal salary. Many such transactions have followed players so they have become as rich as the magicians they employed. <br /> <br /> Anthony Mann up to this point has mostly done B-pictures, noir-type things with no real budgets. Just before Winchester, 73 Male has done a fine western with Robert Taylor, Devil's Doorway, who never gets enough praise. I'm sure James Stewart must have seen it and decide that Mann was the person with whom he decided to work together. <br /> <br /> In this film, Mann also developed a mini-stock company like John Ford was legendary. In addition to Stewart, others in the film such as Millard Mitchell, Steve Brodie, Dan Duryea, John McIntire, Jay C. Flippen and Rock Hudson will appear in future Mann movies. <br /> <br /> It's a simple plot, James Stewart is obsessed with finding a man named Dutch Henry Brown and killing him. Why don't I say, but to this point we have never seen such a cold rage from James Stewart on the screen. Anthony Mann came into Jimmy Stewart's soul and pulled out some demons. We are all scared. <br /> <br /> The hate is adjusted in a good moment until the start of the movie. After Stewart and sidekick Millard Mitchell are disarmed by Wyatt Earp played by Will Geer because guns are not carried in Earp's Dodge City. There is a shooting competition for a Winchester rifle in Dodge City and the betting favorite is Henry Brown, played by Stephen McNally. Stewart, Mitchell and Geer go into the salon and Stewart and McNally reach each other at the same moment and reach to sign for weapons that are not there. Look at the closeups of Stewart and McNally. They say more than 10 pages of the dialogue. <br /> <br /> Another character that Stewart is in the movie is Waco Johnny Dean, played by Dan Duryea, who almost steals the movie. It may have been Duryea's best moment on the screen. He is a psychopathic illegal killer who is deadly as a left-hand streak, though he sports two six guns. <br /> <br /> Another person who meets Stewart is Shelley Winters, whose fianc√©e was thrown into and killed by Duryea. Her best scenes are at Duryea, who made a fancy for her. She plays in time until she can safely get away from him. Guess who's finally thrilled? <br /> <br /> There are some great performances in a few minor roles, there is no acid note in the cast. John McIntire as a wise Indian trader, Jay C. Flippen as the grizzled army sergeant and Rock Hudson has his first true notice as a young Indian chief. Even John Alexander, known as 'Theodore Roosevelt' in Arsenic and Old Lace, has a short but impressive role as owner of a trading post where both McNally and Stewart stop at different times. <br /> <br /> Mann and Stewart have eight films, five of the westerners, and were ready to do a sixth western night pass when challenging and Mann left the set. The End of a Beautiful Partnership That Made Quality Films.
