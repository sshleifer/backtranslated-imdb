I don't think I'll ever understand the hate for Renny Harlin. "The Hard 2" was cool, and he ever gave the world 'Cliffhanger', one of the most wonderful action movies. That's right, your little puns, 'Cliffhanger' rules, and we all know it. <br /> <br /> Sly plays former ex-climber Gabe Walker who visits his old city when asked to help. A former friend, Hal Tucker (Michael Rooker), helps save on a mountain peak. Walker, of course, returned at a convenient time, because the stranded people are actually a sophisticated team of thieves, led by Eric Qualen (John Lithgow). Qualen & co. have lost a lot of money stolen somewhere in the Rocky Mountains and they really want to get it back. <br /> <br /> Essentially, "Cliffhanger" is another "Die Hard" clone. Only trading in the borders of Nakatomi Plaza to the open mountain ranges of the Rocky Mountains, complete with scenes created to point out the weaknesses of our hero and to kill him. Of course, the setup is completely torn to snap fast, as Stallone's character is very easily avoided with a large number of dots and is first hit in various rock levels without any side effects. Currently, it's not what stock movies are about? <br /> <br /> "Cliffhanger" is one of the most exciting action movies. An exhibition of great scenes and stunts. One of the early stunts is one of the best stunts I've ever seen in a movie, and while the rest of the movie doesn't get any better than it did at the start, it keeps its action. John Lithgow's main villain is entertaining, and one bad man. Certainly one of the coolest main corks ever. <br /> <br /> "Cliffhanger" is easily one of Stallone's best efforts, definitely Renny Harlin's best effort, and a very exciting action movie - 9/10
