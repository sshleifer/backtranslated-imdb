It's been about 50 years since a film about romance and mysticism has been made. The only two movies I can think of are "Enchanted April" (1992) and "The Enchanted Cottage" (1945). Both movies do not use great actors as stars. In both movies, all the actors gave their best romantic performances. <br /> <br /> "Enchanted April" is about four English women after World War II who are unhappy with their lives and find happiness in Italy while on vacation. It's wonderful "Enchanted April" was made in 1992. It comes out as a pleasant classic.
