Wow, this movie was absolutely brilliant. I really don't know why everyone says it has a slow pace. I thought the pass was perfect. The film is about Michael Sullivan being played by Tom Hanks with perfection. He's a hit / murderer who works for John Rooney (Paul Newman). He denies this job, but does so because Rooney pays for his home and helps him financially. He had nothing and Mr. Rooney gave him everything. But his children are not aware that this is his job, and when one testifies to his cold-blooded murder, he is placed in an awkward position. And when a cruelty takes place, he leaves with his son and is bent on revenge. They rob abanks and more and build a bond. They are the perfect team. Hanks do a good job as always, as well as Jude Law who plays his creepy role to perfection. This drama is highly recommended as it shows a beautiful story and shows how the 1930s were.
