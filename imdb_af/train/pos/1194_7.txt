The film focuses mainly on a bully Robert Taylor as a ruthless buffalo hunter and the people who have to get up with him. In the midst of a hunt for the reduction of buffalo, it is the end of a tragic era of senseless slaughter. It's full of drama and remorse for both the buffalo and the native Americans. Taylor is blinded by his hatred of Indians and his naivete that the buffalo cages will never disappear. In one scene he shoots animal after animal, while in others he eats a murder of Indians and then eats the food they cook on their fire. Among these ruthless outside lies an insecure person who is being reduced to beg his comrades (Stewart Granger, Lloyd Nolan and Russ Tamblyn) not to leave him. It is not the best of movies and is delivered by the drama it creates, leading to a bleak and very appropriate conclusion in a snow bath.
