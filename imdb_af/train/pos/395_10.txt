Visually astonishing and full of Eastern Philosophy, this wonderful martial arts fantasy is presented by master director Tsui Hark, the man behind some of the finest films in Hong Kong. The special effects are beautiful and imaginative. The plot is a bit on the cerebral side, but is a refreshing change from films that treat their audience as if it were morons. However, if it's not your forts, it may not be your movie. Perhaps you should see the latest of the Hollywood studio's no brain club, but if you're looking for something, it's where you'll find it.
