I will admit, I thought this movie wouldn't be good, but I quickly changed my mind. The movie keeps you guessing which direction it is going. Pierce Broson is wonderful in his role as a hit, suddenly burnt out and asks a man he met at a Mexican bar for help. Greg Kinnear is a wonderful straight man, as his role as a gentle Denver man, starting an innocent conversation with Pierce at a Mexican bar. The movie will make you laugh because Pierce delivers hilarious one liners (mostly about sex). The imagination in this movie is very well done, especially at the fighter scene and when Pierce sees himself trying to finish his last job.
