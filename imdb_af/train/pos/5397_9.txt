Tenchu ​​aka. Hitokiri directed by Hideo Gosha - starring Shintaro Katsu and Tetsuya NAkadei belong (along with Goyokin, HAra Kiri & Rebellion) to the best chambara movies. <br /> <br /> This is the story of Shintaro Katsu (who plays Okada Izo) working for Nakadei, who wants to become the daymother. Okada, the "cleaner" for Nakadei is treated like a dog - and after a while he realizes - what he really is about Nakadei. <br /> <br /> But there is so much more in this movie - every fan of the Japanese theater should have seen it !!!!!!! <br /> <br /> (Tenchu ​​means Heavens Punishment)
