This movie starts alive, has some slow moments in the middle, but usually moves well, has some very good moments, and then it is at the end of Act 3. I could see it in LA premieres 2 times. (with 2 different ends). Jason Lee is a star, but he is not tomorrow's leading man. He is humorous and keeps his own, but he is better served as a supporting actor. Julia Stiles does 'ok' in a comedy role, new to her, but she doesn't have to "this movie, like a star of her caliber. For an actress who has so much potential (10 things, save the last dance, O), it's hard to see how she continues to do so "average" roles and then not take her role and get away. Run with the movie (like Daniel Day-Lewis has in Gangs). Selma Blair is also a good young actress and does an 'ok' job. I didn't expect an academy to award her performance, and she didn't deliver one, but her performance was adequate. Chris Koch delivers another movie that is above average. Perhaps the problem lies in writing more than anything else. I had like this movie! But this is not a movie where you go and say ... "It was wonderful!" This story has been done so many times before and there was not much new here. The rehearsal dinner scene was probably the best in the movie, and Larry Miller gives an amazing performance in a supporting role (he may be the best surprise of the movie). If you want to see a movie that makes you laugh a couple of times and can have a pleasant evening, I can still recommend this movie, but unless they have changed the end ... again ... leave during the church scene, or you'll probably be disappointed.
