I didn't expect Val Kilmer to make a convincing John Holmes, but I found myself not the porn legend. In fact, the entire film has become incredible performances in this largely underrated movie. <br /> <br /> As some mentioned earlier, the two-disk kit searches and first looks at the "Wadd" documentary. This will give you a lot of background on the story that will be useful to appreciate the movie. <br /> <br /> Some people are unhappy about the LAPD crime scene video included on the DVD. There are a number of reasons why this could be included, one being the fact that John Holmes's trial for the killings was the first ever in the United States, where such footage was used by the prosecution. If you don't want to see it, it's easy to avoid; this is clearly identified as "LAPD Crime Scene Footage" on the menu!
