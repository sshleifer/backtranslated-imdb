The problem is that the film used the conspiracies of the 60s-created concept that cartoons can only be done as a "camp" (that is, the 60's Batman show) for TV and film. So you have battle order with subtitles (come on!), An unashamed unromantic Doc Savage (he was uncomfortable for women in the masses, not an idiot), Monk Mayfair in a nightmare (a scene your nightmares for) give a few nights), and the completely hokey ends with the secondary bad guy included in gold, such as a Herve Villechez who stands for an Oscar law. And if they don't excite Sousa marches, the dramatic dramatic dramatic dramatic dramatic dramatic dramatic dramatic drama is undermined. <br /> <br /> Even so, this movie is okay. It's fun, and when it's serious, it's a very accurate representation of the masses. Except for Monk, as mentioned before: he is very muscular, not obese. And Long Tom, who is supposed to be a light-hearted man with an attitude, isn't Paul Gleason with an (inexplicable) scarf. <br /> <br /> For example, the Green Death sequences are remarkable and not something 'Recommend to Children. But they are very close to the feeling of the masses. When the authors and producers get it right, they get it right. I'll give them that. <br /> <br /> But if the producers did Doc with the loving care and mini-dissertation, Reeves says first two Superman movies, think what we might have. I think the problem is the schizophrenic film. There is a definite sense to try to pay a 30-year-old tribute, but they also try to give the "heroes camp" attitude created by Batman. One gets the impression that there was a sober, pulp-style first concept and then someone came in and said, "Hey, let's make it funny - it worked with the Batman show 8 years ago!" <br /> <br /> But Doc continues, thanks to Earl MacRauch and Buckaroo Banzai. If MacRauch doesn't make a tribute to Doc Savage in that movie, the man is really demented. So, when the series actually comes on the TV (allegedly mid-season in '99 -00), Doc Savage, updated to the 90s, will once again live.
