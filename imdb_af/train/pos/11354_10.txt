CitizenX (1995) is the developing world's answer to the silence of the lambs. Where `Silence 'has satisfied our peace of mind,` `citizen' 'explodes and badly us instead. This dramatization of the Chikatilo case rather translates well, thanks to a Western friendship between two Rostov police who are equal. <br /> <br /> CitizenX can also oppose (!) The death penalty much better than Kevin Spacey's The Life of David Gayle (2002). <br /> <br /> People are Machiavellian mammals, including limbic brain (lizard logic). Why did two children, who knew better, killed a kid, kidnapped? Why do bloodthirsty women call "lilililililii" on acts of OBSCENE terrorism? My own term for this is 'limbic domination', the lizard-logical urge to dominate an 'enemy'. If you have the words "enemy" / "revenge" in your vocabulary, you are easily able to have "limbic domination". <br /> <br /> In World War II, Rostov (at the mouth of the Don River near the Black Sea) destroyed Andrei Chikatilo's urge to overpower "limbic domination" of his civilization. Chikatilo (Jeffrey DeMunn) 's easy victims were paupers, usually children, who drove the interurban train for fun, as they could afford nothing else. <br /> <br /> CitizenX reminds us that the denials of an overwhelming Soviet bureaucracy cost the lives of 52 such "lambs". Rostov's ceremony has been released for almost 7 years. After the police arrested him and let him go. <br /> <br /> Policing crime is everywhere harmful to the police. Although police often suffer from corruption, across the globe, politicians' voting chronic inter-agency games are being set up in the west, with a more coordinated response to crime. However, in the Soviet Union of CitizenX, Viktor Burakov (Stephen Rea )'s Killer Department had a repressive bureaucracy. <br /> <br /> Geoffrey DeMunn plays the psychologically inadequate chikatilo with flawless but underestimated authority - to the point of complete darkness. In real life, Chikatilo also had a lifetime's experience of interfering and evading the catch. <br /> <br /> His runner-up, on the other hand, stands out as a strange bird given irrevocable naive outbursts. Perhaps by design, Stephen Rea gives a very strange performance as forensic chief Burakov. Rea's Russian accent is impenetrable; and she's Burakov is humorous and dumb, contrary to everyone. <br /> <br /> It is Donald Sutherland who is leaving the picture. Sutherland's spot. Fetisov, Burakov's boss, and initially his only supporter, is an exaggerated, patient Military, whose dignified transport testifies to dozens of bureaucratic operations. His reassessment as a logic-driven but still passionate police spokesman becomes the film's cornerstone idealism. <br /> <br /> Joss Ackland makes another turn as a vicious apparatchik, Secretary of Communist Ideology Bondarchuk, who oversees the investigation. Of course, he concluded the arrest of the most likely suspect, a Communist, in 1984, a man carrying rope and a knife in his pocket, allegedly going home: Andrei Chikatilo. <br /> <br /> Soon he replaced Burakov with another Moscow apparatchik, detective Gorbunov (John Wood), and insists that the investigation now focuses on "famous gay people". The funniest scene of this sad, sad movie comes during Bondarchuk's and Gorbunov's institutionalized harassment: a stupidly cute report is serious: "If I suspect, comrade, it's fornication. I made some drawings. - Cue crying laughing. <br /> <br /> Five years after the bodies began to step up, in 1987 police finally tried to search for criminal profiles. The only cooperating Soviet psychiatrist was dr. Aleksandr Bukhanovsky (Max Von Sydow), who named the UNSUB `CitizenX '. He later also observed Fetisov & Burakov that "... together make a wonderful person. "We agree. <br /> <br /> The protracted pass, which has been distributed over a decade, absorbs the institutional inertia of Glasnost's openness - it wasn't. The contrast with Perestroika - "restructuring" - could not have been the case anymore. Although Chikatilo was still train stations, police plans were about to bear fruit. <br /> <br /> In 1990, Col.Fetisov was soon promoted to general. His nemesis Bondarchuk disappears from the scene so that the investigation can eventually proceed without political interference. Staff, communication, publicity - all were suddenly available. In just one night of phoning, Fetisov got his depressed forensic access to the FBI's Serial Murder Task Force at Quantico, where Fetisov discovered, staff are regularly turned down from serial murder cases to just reject such psychological damage to investigators. /> <br /> Fetisov commands his newly promoted forensic chief, now Colonel Burakov, of all these changes in an avalanche of confession which becomes the movie's water-power scene. Fetisov's is the most beautiful excuse I have ever seen on film: "Private, I offer my deepest excuse to you and your wife. I hope you can someday forgive my ignorance, "he almost whispered. <br /> <br /> An HBO production, CitizenX is a film of the highest quality. Not only do foreigners look dark (shoot exclusively in the most remote parts of otherwise spectacular Budapest), but Randy Edelman's rising soundtrack is quite overwhelming - and often our only postponement of the dark brutality. Those speaking Hungarian will recognize the many Hungarian accents and credits. <br /> < Chikatilo's real murders are portrayed as a dark, deviant behavior born of lack of character and ignorance in an equally dark world, leaving the murders out of place - but of course, like President Kennedy reminded us, "we all cherish the future of our children." <br /> <br /> CitizenX perfectly communicates that killing is much more creepy and obscene than any revenge fantasy can imply. s; serial killers murdered to dominate. So do some soldiers. Such "limbic dominators" make poor people. <br /> <br /> WARNING-SPOILER: ----------------------------- --------- --------- The true Andrei Chikatilo was the world's most productive known serial killer. He was questioned. He was executed in 1992 in the manner of all Soviet death sentences: one shot, at the back of the head. Foolish, such methods destroy any possibility of studying a deviant brain after death. <br /> <br /> Slot: ------------------------- --------------- -------------------- The best outcome is always the prevention of murders, not their persecution. Performances only guarantee society's failure to learn from the complex reality of the victims' death when we even send anecdotal evidence of HOW / WHY they are dead. The murderers also do not regret being killed. <br /> <br /> Revenge does not make victims unpleasant. Breaking the killer's blood does nothing better than counter-dominance - as soon as it's too late. <br /> <br /> Revenge on behalf of the grief is not justice for the deceased - it is the care of the living. / 10)
