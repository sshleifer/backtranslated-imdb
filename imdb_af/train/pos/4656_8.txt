A clever, unmistakable entertaining skirt that depicts Peter Ustinov as a career eclipse with his attractions in a US conglomerate in London. He was attacked by foxy (and deceptively sharp) Maggie Smith and threatened with exposure by jealous company Bob Newhart. It's a hoarse movie with lots of brains. Ustinov is exceptional as Smith and Newhart are pretty funny. The real surprise is Karl Malden, who is the "executive vice president" pill. Malden is rarely so loose. Cesar Romero and Robert Morley appear in some funny cameos. The excellent music score is by Laurie Johnson. Eric Till's direction is alive and the script by Ustinov and Ira Wallach is first and very clever. A swinging time!
