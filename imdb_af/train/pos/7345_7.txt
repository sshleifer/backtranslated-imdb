Picked up the movie on the flea market for $ 4, surely earned me money! Can't do anything less about the hot babes, but the animation just blew me away to a steady diet of Simpsons (Mr Groening). The best part, facial expressions. Recommend several views with some cool songs, good friends and some cold!
