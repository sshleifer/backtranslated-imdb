Pierce Brosnan will probably be the only one known in Richard Attenborough's new biopsy. The rest is new to international audiences: Canadian history and First Nations culture. <br /> <br /> "Gray Owl" is a light exploration of how a man in the Ojibway of Northern Ontario was adopted, to teach the environment and to preach decades before it became politically correct to do so. do. The film contains a love story, a moral message and a man tortured by his past. However, this torture is not always alive with the dramatic impact it may have. <br /> <br /> Yet, it's a movie that keeps its audience without any violence. It pays deep respect for Canada's first nations, and offers it in a dignified and non-stereotypical way. Brosnan's performance is somewhat stiff, but I guess that's just how Lord Attenborough wanted him. <br /> <br /> Thank you to a proud Canadian.
