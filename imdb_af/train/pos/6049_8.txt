Freebird is the perfect marriage of road travel comedy, gangster, stoner movie and a good British movie. <br /> <br /> These are the brilliant main characters that set this movie apart from other movies in this genre. Stars Phil Daniels, Gary Stretch and Geoff Bell have a good chemistry and make their characters extremely fun and realistic. The main story revolves around their road trip from London to Wales, and the adventures and accidents along the way. This small movie also has a good heart. It's not just for cyclists, as it includes the character's relationships with each other, including dreams and regrets, such as Gary Stretch's Fred who longs for the family he has left behind. The cinematography is also wonderful - a love letter for the Welsh countryside, as well as the determination of the London streets and typical pub life in the Welsh country villages. <br /> <br /> Stylish, smooth, fantastic soundtrack, fun characters and funny story - I'd recommend Freebird in a heartbeat!
