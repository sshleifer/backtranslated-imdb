Like all fans of this documentary, I want to know that Martin Torgoff is my uncle and I am so proud of him. This mini-series shown on VH1 over the past 30 years is a good look at the drug culture and my uncle worked it very hard. The amount of time and effort I watched him in this documentary version and the book that started it all was not much better to watch him on TV. I know he loves what he does and he does it well. His eloquence is shown in the interviews, which he himself did, and the wonderful additions he himself made to the comments. From the music to the videos and everything in-between, it's a great documentary that shows the experience of drug culture really through the eyes of someone who lived through it. I appreciate any comment on these of those who have (or have) enjoyed it and would like to hear from fans! Three cute for Uncle Martin !!!
