What can one say about a movie that has one of the blackest, most nihilistic and sometimes strangest? I won't say "sympathetic". I will say 'charismatic' villains in the history of the movie and the best sword fight since Flynn and Fairbanks were in their heights? It's an epic about stubborn, sometimes foolish, incredibly brave and honest men fighting for his honor and freedom against tyranny. I loved it. John Hurt and Tim Roth were great villains. Jessica Lange was very mobile, gentle and sensual.
