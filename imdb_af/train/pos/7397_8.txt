"Xizao" is the story of the clash of modern life and ancient traditions, and its impact on a family in China. Da Ming (Quanxiu Pu) is a businessman returning home after a letter from his brother Er Ming (Wu Jiang) believes his father, Liu (Xu Zhu), died. He finds that his father is still alive, as well as his old neighborhood and his old business, the public bathroom. <br /> <br /> The movie centered around Da Ming's family and how he saw the importance of his father's work, something he always considered an old tradition to soon die. The film also explores his relationship with Er Ming, who is spiritually challenged, and the problems of the small community and how the bathroom is a place that not only cleanses their bodies, but also their souls. <br /> <br /> The two main themes of the movie, the family and the difficulty of progress are incredibly well handled, and the movie never loses the point it is trying to make. Both themes are very well developed and we get a look at the Chinese society and habits. . <br /> <br /> The director, Yang Zhang, tells his story in a simple way so the characters can do characters. It's a very simple approach, but it fits in perfectly with the movie, and I doubt many other styles will fit the movie so well. Zhang has enormous potential, as he can tell a story without the help of visual flare or camera tricks. <br /> <br /> The play is outstanding in its naturalistic approach, all acting in a very natural way and it looks almost like they are real people being filmed. The three main characters give remarkable performances, and Wu Jiang as Er Ming surely sticks the shows. <br /> <br /> Even when the movie was a magical "old days, it brought much better", but it takes an attitude of equilibrium, such as saying that progress is good, and we must continue, but we should not forget where we came from, and keep a balance between modern life and the traditions of the old. <br /> <br /> A great and touching movie. 8/10
