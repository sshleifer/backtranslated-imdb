There are some wonderful things about this movie. Marion Davies can act, given the real property; she is wonderful in comedic roles. William Haines can act and you can see why he was one of the screen's most popular men. (Until a potential scandal forced him from the business.) <br /> <br /> The story is a bit sturdy, but so beautiful that you don't notice. King Vidor's direction is one of the main reasons for this. The producer? The boy genius, Irving Thalberg. <br /> <br /> It's about film making, and you see the process as it was done in 1928, the cameras, sets, director directors and actors who were emotional. You get (briefly) some of the most important stars of the day; Even Charlie Chaplin does a turn like himself, looking for a signature. You also get a look at Eleanor Boardman, Elinor Glyn, Claire Windsor, King Vidor, and many others who are just names and old photos. <br /> <br /> Even if you are not a fan of silence, take the time to catch this movie when you can. It's really a great trip back in time.
