I would recommend this movie to everyone. Not just for the fans of the lathe Luciano Ligabue, but for all movie buffs. Because it is sincere, moving, funny and true. Because Ligabue is a born storyteller and a movie lover, every frame of his film is made with love and care. Because his characters love and ask to love. Because most of the Italian debut films are common and this one, by an outsider, is a real joy to watch and listen. Because Stefano Accorsi is beautiful and reminds me of Andrea Pazienza, who, like Freccia, was beautiful and talented and good and lost his life due to heroin, the Ligabue shows how it is, ominous and ugly, without being in easy moralism . Because it is a movie that speaks to our heart, our ears, our souls. And because I lived the experience of the FM radios and that was exactly the same. Thanks, Luciano!
