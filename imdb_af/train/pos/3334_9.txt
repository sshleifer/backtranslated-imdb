I really like this movie because I have a man like the man in this movie. This movie is about Lindsey who meets Ben in the middle of winter when the baseball season is not in. She falls in love, but when spring comes, she gets the shock of her life when she is placed one step lower on her pedestal that Ben has taken on her. <br /> <br /> It's a funny movie with all the baseball obsession Ben has. He can't share what he loves most, it makes it so funny and why so many women are connected to Lindsey in real life. The people with whom he sits at the baseball games are just as obsessive as he is. <br /> <br /> It's a funny movie and you won't find out if you rent this one.
