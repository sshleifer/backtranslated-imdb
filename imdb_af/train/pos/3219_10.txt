It's a good movie. It has a fascinating story, an immense main character, very good acting and killer action. It mostly occurs in the year 2036, but shows scenes that have occurred in recent years to explain the story. <br /> <br /> The story is done very well and there are no holes. Kurt Russell is a solidarity called Todd who is trained to kill and, like all other soldiers, never had normal lives. Eventually, the army represents new, younger, faster and stronger soldiers. Jason Scott Lee is one of them. As a result, they don't need the old soldiers like Todd. They test the new soldiers by fighting them from the old soldiers. Russell is injured in the fight and declared dead. The army is shedding its body, as well as a few other people assuming they are all dead, but what they don't realize is that Russell is alive. <br /> <br /> Todd finds a camp full of civilization on this planet that the army has dumped him. He lives there for a while, but can't adjust to normal life. He seldom says a word and he is sometimes aggressive towards the other people. When they feel it is a danger to them. They sent him to the desert. <br /> <br /> Just as Russell's planet leaves, the new soldiers are being attacked. What the army forgot was to train the soldiers to be smart like Todd and the other old soldiers. So while these new soldiers are faster and stronger than Todd, Todd eases them easily. The army started to realize it and Todd killed only one of their men. That one is Jason Scott Lee and finally you see a classic fighting scene between Russell and Scott Lee. Russell comes out of course. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best action movies I've ever seen and I've seen a lot. It has everything you can ask in a movie, including some good lines. The author also did not forget that Russell had never seen a woman, because he even called women "sir". There are no holes in this movie, every minute has a purpose and it is very entertaining. <br /> <br /> A popular one-man army action movie for Rambo, Command and Missing In Action fans. It is highly recommended for all Kurt Russell fans and action / sci-fi fans.
