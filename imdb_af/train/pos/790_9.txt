Kenny Doughty as Jed Willis is a performer in this role as any male pornstar, even though he keeps his pants on. <br /> <br /> The movie reminds me of the intensity of the great explosive love of my life. I don't think I can think of another movie, except maybe Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet who capture that greedy joy so well. <br /> <br /> The other drawing of the movie is the many English eccentric characters who fervently enjoy the scandal. . In that sense, it is much the same appeal as Midsomer Murder or a Miss Marple secret, without the chaos. <br /> <br /> This is a great antidote to the cartoon that currently occurs in the US and any relationship between people of different ages.
