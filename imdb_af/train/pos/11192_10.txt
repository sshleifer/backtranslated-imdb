I've watched this movie several times here at college, and each time I show it, the number of people watching me grows exponentially ... in addition to the virgins, anyone I've ever shown it must see! It takes a while to get there, but the whole room screams, screams, screams, repeats screens repeatedly, repeats dialogue, and totally in the movie story that Pia Zadora in "The Lonely Lady"! Scene after stage after the scene of the most unreal filmed, poorly written, terribly acted. TRASH is thrown at you in an overall assault that is like the bravest thing I own (no small statement, friends). Nothing to me differs 2 You, Pia ... and I'm not supposed to be the only one who ever felt this way!
