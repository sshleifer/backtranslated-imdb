Jane Eyre has always been my favorite novel! When I stumbled on this movie version in the late 90's, I was ecstatic! This is the best and most complete version of the book on film! This version is a bit long to sit in one session, but it's worth it. Timothy Dalton is wonderful like Rochester. I was glad they were throwing a normal watch actress (Zelah Clark) as Jane and not a glamorous person. I love the sets and the place. For anyone who is a real Jane Eyre fan, this is the version to watch !!! For those interested, I just found this version on DVD. I watched my VHS copy almost break, so I was excited to find it on DVD.
