Life is escaped by her father (and the fairy-tale fraudster) who dies in an explosion. Lily Powers (Barbara Stanwyck, who is just advisable) thrust her through the branches in a banking business in the big city of Gotham. When a possessive lover is murder who has to be his next father-in-law (and Lily's new lover), the air is the limit for Lily, as she has written her various relationships in a diary and subtlety, it is known that the newspapers will If certain payments do not come into her hands. The newly appointed president of court, Courtland Trenholm (George Brent), sends Lily to Paris instead of forking over many doughs, but soon finds himself in love with various encounters with her in the City of Love. It makes Lily's mouth water because now she has reached the successful pedestal and gives a man of wealth and prestige that brings wealth to her path. Although circumstances arise that will bring her to a decision that threatens her successful way of achieving that wealth. Trenholm, now her husband, is definitely being charged in prison and lost the bank. He needs money that Lily now owns, or he will have absolutely nothing. <br /> <br /> Stanwyck is the whole movie despite the usual Warner Brothers Polish. To establish in the pre-code era, filmmakers give the opportunity to expand on taboo subjects such as a woman with sex to achieve success and how it can lead to a tragedy. Good direction from Alfred E Green shows through subtle tips in different ways and speech by acting well from Stanwyck's seductive show how to study something without actually showing the explicit act. Clearly, the film shows that money is not everything and that everything that jazz as love comes into the heart of Lily's dead heart. That which ends with Lily, has the miraculous metamorphosis in someone in love, didn't make me true. She has spent all the time just getting to the platform, and it just falls to a man who was actually different from the one she used in front of him.
