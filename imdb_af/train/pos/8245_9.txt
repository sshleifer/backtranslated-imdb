Even without speaking a word, Billy Connely is a wonderful zombie ... Carrie Ann Moss as "Mom", even better. Zombie girlfriends? <br /> <br /> "... My dad killed me to eat me. I never tried to eat Timmy." <br /> <br /> And I thought Dawn of the Dead was good. It's like Airplane met (meat?) Night of the living dead, sponsored by Zomcom. <br /> <br /> And don't forget my headbox <br /> <br /> And Fido in an Aloha shirt is just as cool! <br /> <br /> And yes, the social commentary is just too much to even begin to comment. <br /> <br /> Enjoy saying, it really works!
