TOM HULCE * turns into another Oscar-worthy show like Dominick Luciano, the brain-damaged garbage man who helps put his brother (Ray Liotta and Eugene) through the medical school. <br /> <br /> It's a must-see for all movie lovers and all lovers of life and people! <br /> <br /> ===========> * From the small supervisor to the erotic dance, to the repeated words "O, Jeez" If Nicky is in a band, the believer is of Tom's performance so excellent that you have to concentrate on remembering that it is an actor on the screen!
