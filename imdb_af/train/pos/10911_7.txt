Enjoy this 1936 movie with many veteran classic actors and especially William Powell (Dr. Lawrence Bradford), "Mister Roberts", who played the role of doctor and detective. Dr Bradford was once married to Jean Arthur (Paula Bradford), "Shane", and had a divorce and still managed to live with each other and to fight all the time. Paula wanted her husband to investigate a murder and did everything possible to convince him that it was very important. Jean Arthur plays a very tired type and there is a lot of 1936 Comedy and the method of murder is something you will never believe, especially with a jockey on a California Race Track. Robert Armstrong (Nick Martel) "King Kong" has given a great support role as a booklet with James Gleason, a detective who needs the help of Dr Bradford to solve this very strange murder mystery. If you see this movie, just remember it was manufactured and directed in 1936 and the people in the audience at the time thought it was wonderful entertainment and it was really in those days!
