This particular episode of Smallville is probably the best episode to air since reunion. That's for many reasons. For example, it takes the range back to some of its roots. It welcomes Lionel for a so-called long absence, with the Luthorcorp plaza office in Metropolis. This room has not been in smallville for a long time, and to see it again, brings back many memories from the Kleinville's past. Still, Lionel's conversations with Lex are always admirable. <br /> <br /> Another pleasant return is good, it's yesterday, Bart Allen (aka Impulse), AC (aka Aquaman) and Victor Stone (also known as Cyborg). Steven Deknight not only unites the former lawmakers, he blends in with the Smallville formula in such a unique way that it almost feels it is a distinctive movie. <br /> <br /> From there you get the basic story, Green Arrow forms the league, attempts to inflate 33.1, Bart is captured, Clark saves him, and the facility is blown to kingdom com. Everyone is good and graceful, with a good mix of stealth, action, pace and tension. Oh, and Cyborg has some new, new upgrades that are right for the targeted character :). <br /> <br /> The music is probably what this episode works so well. If you remember correctly, the first episode was Steven Deknight straight to Agless of Season 4. It was a mediocre episode, but something felt out of place. Perhaps it was the music, or the play, or the fact that Clark Sais ended. "We didn't find you, you found us." Types of people lose faith in the formula. But thankfully, Steve Deknight delivered himself in this episode of Justice. <br /> <br /> I had a few quarrels about Justice that dropped it. 10. First, the too-cute exit from the legal court of the Ridge facility exhibition. I mean it would have been so much cooler than saying Green Arrow and Cyborg took off on Oliver's bike (rememeber of the pillow division). Clark and Impulse had to walk naturally, and aquaman had to swim through another route. But it was so incredibly cheesy, it found 2 points to the full 10. <br /> <br /> Secondly, another nice moment, not as bad as the first, but when Green Arrow sows "let's save the world". It cut me. Overall, judging by the acting performances, music, direction and production value, the benefits outweigh the disadvantages, and it is still one of the best episodes in Smallville history, and perhaps the 2nd best episode in season 6. /> <br /> 7 out of 10 ...
