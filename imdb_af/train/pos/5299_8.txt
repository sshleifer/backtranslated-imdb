Once you get the title of the movie, Pecker is a great movie, perhaps one of John Waters' bests. A wonderful cast, led by strong performances by Edward Furlong and Christina Ricci, makes the story very funny and very real. There are some shocking scenes that are definitely not suitable for young children, but they are there for a purpose. Unfortunately, this movie is not massively produced, and most of the public will be denied the opportunity to see it. If the event beats, watch this movie.
