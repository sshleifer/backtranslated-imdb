Although this movie is at its best cheesiness, it is perfectly drawn. This movie has to be seen as a modern classic. There are basically two kinds of movies I want - movies with depth (chick flames, if you need to - I donate my wife for this) and sensible comedies where I can sit back and relax. This movie is a perfect example of the latter. <br /> <br /> A friend of mine tackled me shortly after the release of this movie. Considering me slightly level, he told me, "You should see this movie. It's just your kind of movie." Because of the insult I started to look. I know they called the Ramones a million times, but if you actually see them, I said, "Hey, these are the Ramones." My friend replied, "I don't know they were a real band." I had my moment of glory. <br /> <br /> This movie, although slightly dated, is a must for Ramones fans - or anyone else for that matter.
