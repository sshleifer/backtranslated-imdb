Just as the new SCR was not what fans of the original series had expected, Caprica might not deliver what the fans of the new SCR expected (usually). It is a very interesting, or not a self-involved show, or at least the pilot. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for the great CGI excitement of the (new) SCR, you'll be very disappointed. If you like the drama, you'll probably find something you want and maybe even identify. <br /> <br /> The storyline explores how the Cylons were developed, why Adama hated them and the origin of a monotheistic society. The authors also succeed in tackling people who play God (s) and the creation or re-creation of a human life. It will be interesting to see how it speaks. <br /> <br /> I found it to be in some parts and preachy in others, but everything was promising. A small part of my will (or hope) there may be a few small inclines from BSG there (apart from the back story I mentioned), but it will probably pass the story too much. Like BSG, I have to wait and see if Caprica is growing on me, but it's too early to tell. <br /> <br /> It would be very easy to criticize it as a failure if you compare it to the previous series, but I'm willing to give it a chance. Overall, I thought it was interesting enough to see how the real series is before throwing the (proverbial) towel.
