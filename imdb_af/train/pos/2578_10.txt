Superman and the Mole Men are probably Superman's most difficult adventures ever. <br /> <br /> Lois Lane and Clark Kent are sent to Silsby, home to the world's deepest oil well. While there, a few radioactive moles come through the oil well and explore the town. Jeff Corey and many other townspeople are trying to dispose of the intruders. Can Superman change people's ways in time to save the mole men? Can Superman warn people in time about the radioactive danger that the mole men bring? <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Superman and the Mole Men are a very intelligent, well-written and well-directed film. Although we first fly a short summary of Superman, it still makes a good Superman adventure. A must be for anyone. <br /> <br /> 10/10 stars
