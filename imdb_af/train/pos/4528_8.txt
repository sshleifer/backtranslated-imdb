Although the movie is clearly dated, audiences can still easily be identified with the troubled Buster's trouble in this timeless and very funny storytelling story. Buster fights at unprecedented odds in three different ages: the Stone Age, the Roman Period and the Age, almost play the same character with just a change of scenery to help us identify the different "ages". In this movie we see one of the earliest comedic depictions of the "caveman" stereotype, which does not win its love through novels, but through brute force, as well as a funny twist on Roman gladiatorial battle, two comic sketches long before such spoofs occur Mel Brooks' "History of the world: Part I". The underlying theme of the movie is simple but convincing. Although these times may have changed, we are still facing the same struggle that we fought in prehistoric times to win the girl "(remember, this is the theme of 1923 America, a time when chauvinism still exists). It was interesting to watch this movie more than eighty years later, and consider how dramatically things have changed from this movie's modern era.
