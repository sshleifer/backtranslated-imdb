Once again, a good season episode is 1. The reincarnation bit is, in my opinion, cool. The more I see it, the more I like it, but it will never come to me more than "Very Good". Although not very memorable, I will always remember it as the reincarnation episode. Anyway, now I will say what is good and bad about this episode, <br /> <br /> The Good: Oragami. Oh yes! <br /> <br /> The fish tank was nice. =] <br /> <br /> Throw out a window. Very stylish. x] <br /> <br /> The bad: marry your best friend's wife! O_O <br /> <br /> What is a random choice to reincarnate. <br /> <br /> Why didn't the man who died with his scarf get caught, trying to pull out his scarf? <Br /> <br /> Conclusion: Okay episode, not very memorable. 10/07
