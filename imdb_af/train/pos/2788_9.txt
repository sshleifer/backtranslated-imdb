It's a so-called feel-good movie, but it made me sad. Why? Because I had the talent, but my parents did not allow me to study at the sports academy, as well as the fact that at the age of 12 I decided to stop football. <br /> <br /> Football is the red line in this movie. Along with the struggle, young people have the expectations parents have. An English-Indian girl and her parents, with their traditions and strong family ties, and on the other hand the English family with a daugter who dress like a boy playing soccer ... a combination that worries her mother! This film also shows the lives of ordinary people as well as the Indian community in England. It's about faith in your dreams and living your life (where we heard before). <br /> <br /> Paraminder Nagra (a beautiful woman!) Play Yasminda, a girl who is not interested in boys, new clothes, makeup and the typical 17-year-old girl stuff. Unlike her sister Pinky, complete the opposite of Yasminda. <br /> <br /> It is a real must see how a young beautiful girl struggles with the traditions of their parents and eventually finds her happiness. With good music from Blondie, Curtis Mayfield, Texas, Melanie C as well as Indian hit songs. <br /> <br /> Nice to look at, but if you've ever played football and never made it above, then this movie will make you melachonic.
