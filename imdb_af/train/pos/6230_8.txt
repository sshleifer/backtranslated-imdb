1936 was the most productive year for Astaire and Rogers. Their second movie for RKO that year is the third film in this collection ?? Mark Sandrich's "Follow the Fleet." This time, Astaire is painfully uncomfortable like Bake Baker, a layman bumping into the cunning waterfront cafe, where Sherry Martin (Rogers) 'Yes, you guessed it ?? they are warm to each other again. Only this time, Connie (Harriet Hillard )'s sister, Connie (Harriet Hillard) threatens the entire romance by falling for Bake's robust seafaring friend, Bilge Smith (Randolph Scott); a kind of use to throw out, and so force Sherry to reconsider her opinion of all sailors in general. Irving Berlin offers an immeasurable class of events with its classic, classic score, including the standards 'Let yourself go', 'I put all my eggs in one basket' and 'Let's look at the music and dance'; the latter a divinely inspired suicide that changes into another immediate recognizable and thorough sublime pas deux for Fred and Ginger. <br /> <br /> The transfer on 'Follow The Fleet' is a bit weaker. The gray scale remains beautifully balanced, but now it looks a bit thick with not so much tonal variation as the previous titles. Grain is still present. So are age-related artefacts. Once you reach the slightly dense and sometimes more soft-ridden image quality, the overall impression is more than acceptable for a movie of this vintage. The sound is Mono, but very well balanced. Extras include a featuret, theater cart and short box, but weird ?? no sound comment. In view of the importance of this movie in the overall canon of Astaire / Rogers, it is an uncharacteristic overview of Warner Home Video.
