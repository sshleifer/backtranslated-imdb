In fact, wonderful film, the concept of a possible prophetic vision of the future, is frightening. A world overcrowded, unbearable heat due to the damaged ozone layer, and all our natural resources spent. In this nightmare-degenerate society, we have the great Charlton Heston as a lovely movie-oriented style detective who tries to overcome the truth behind a murder, beyond film-noir legend Edward G Robinson, who makes a fine last show. <br /> <br /> One of the images that always stays with me from this movie is the masses of people who populate the stairwell and the way Thorne (Heston) penetrates every time they use them. <br /> <br /> The movie's use of music is also worthy, though it does not contain the usual sense. The opening theme is good and the subsequent snatches of music we're here in Simonson's apartment, and especially the Beethoven pieces in the euthanasia clinic, are excellent. atmospheric.
