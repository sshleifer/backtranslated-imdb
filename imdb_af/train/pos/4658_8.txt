Talk about a dream throw - just two of the most wonderful actors ever to appear - Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith - together - in 'Hot Millions', a funny, exciting comedy that also has Charles Malden, Robert Morley and Bob Newhart starring. Ustinov is an ex-con embezzler who gets the CV of a talented computer programmer (Morley) and takes a position in a firm operation by Malden - with the purpose of keeping eclipse in mind. It is not at all sailing; He has attracted the attention of his rival at the company, played by Newhart, and his neighbor, Maggie Smith (who knows him at his home by another name), becomes his secretary for a short period. She can't work and she is seen throughout the film in a variety of employment - everything ends up firing her. When Newhart makes her forward, she invites Ustinov to her apartment for curry as a cover, but the two soon decide that they are made for each other. Of course she doesn't know Ustinov is a scam. <br /> <br /> It's such a good movie - you can't help but love Ustinov and Smith and are fascinated by Ustinov's operations, his genius and the ways he emits from trouble. But there is a turning end that will show you who really has the brain. Don't miss this movie, in the 60s of London. It's worth it if it's just to hear Maggie Smith shining, "I'm fired."
