In the sea of ​​crap that Hollywood (and others) continue to stick out, it's one of those diamonds in the rough. A small, simple movie that is very entertaining and makes you feel like you're not just wasting half an hour on your life. <br /> <br /> Ashley Judd is really great in this movie. I was never really a fan or had noticed her before, but went back and saw my early performance of her convincing me that she was very talented. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie was a command in a college course for me, so I was skeptical I'd even care. I thought, "Oh, boy, a stupid chic flick or feminist male bashing indie crap ..." I was pleasantly surprised. Without analyzing the many relevant themes, I will just say, if you haven't seen them, do yourself a favor and look it out. Sometimes the down-to-earth, cut-of-life films are the best, and it's a good one.
