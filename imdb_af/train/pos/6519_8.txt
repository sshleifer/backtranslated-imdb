This movie has big stars in their earlier years: Ingor Stevens has never looked more beautiful; Yul Brynner was a very convincing Jean LaFitte, confronted his piracy and wanted to maintain neutrality with the United States. Charlton Heston did a good job as Andrew Jackson, but a few moments were a little quiet. It's really a great movie for students to learn that part of our history, and it shows that all happy ends don't meet the lovers. Sometimes the happier end is getting away and finding partners of similar background that will better understand them in the long run. I watched it at least twice every year for 16 years; and although it's not the best movie I've ever seen, I love it every time!
