The good thing about this movie: The concept is interesting and there are some funny scenes. It also reminds you of the little things in life that can affect someone else's life without ever knowing. It's a small world and this little movie shows us. <br /> <br /> The bad thing: There are too many characters and it's hard to tell who the main character is, but it's still a good movie. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie and many people compare it to Magnolia I didn't see. <br /> <br /> 8/10 <br /> Not rated --- I'll cherish PG -13 for short violence, some language and sexual situations.
