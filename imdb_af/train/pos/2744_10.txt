Remarkable, disturbing film about the lifelong, senseless, brutal murder of a small town family, along with the aftermath, and exploring the lives of the killers, Dick Hickok and Perry Smith. <br /> <br /> No matter how much time is over, or how dated this movie may look, it still resonates the total incomprehensibility of criminal acts like this. <br /> <br /> It boasts many different tragedies: The tragedy, brutality and futility of the Clutter family murder, a decent farm family in the small town of Holcomb, Kansas; and the wasted, brutal and sad life of Hickok and Smith. <br /> <br /> An interesting point is made in the movie: that none of these two immature, scared, small criminals would ever want to go with something like this alone. But together they created a dangerous, murderous collective personality; one who nurtured the needs and pathology of each. They push each other on a path to prove something to each other. That their husband was enough to do it, to do it; don't want to be seen as too cowardly to finish their big "score"; an unfortunate and dangerous remnant of the abandoned lives that led them. It was two adult children living in a criminal's world not to hide from thorns; which must constantly demonstrate masculinity and toughness. In this case, these needs immediately led to the murder of the Clutters. <br /> <br /> The movie contains a somewhat sentimental look at the Clutter family, but the point is made. It was respected, legitimate, small town people, who didn't deserve this frightening fate. The movie also gives us a sense of the young lives of Hickok and Smith. However, Perry Smith, whose early life was full of security and love, looked horrified, while alcohol took his family on a tragic path. Hickok, poor and left much to his own devices, unable to see how he fits in, using his intelligence and charm, with which everyone comes into contact with him. <br /> <br /> An interesting, and perhaps the first, look at the death penalty, and that ends our hope of reaching. Is it nothing more than revenge to kill for a nation that has shaken a nation at a time when we had not yet completely faced that such predators might be among us, or to these guys at the end of to give a rope, really give a dislike to the childlike and brutal attitude of men like this? Is it possible to cheat, cheat, and mislead people who are alive and believe that they all let down who they come into contact with? To be deterred, you must believe it is possible that you will be caught. Is it possible to deter these men who believe they are too clever to be caught? Who committed hundreds of crimes and escaped with them? It was supposed to be a "cinch", "no witnesses". <br /> <br /> When caught, Hickok finds he can't charm and clothe the agents as he has shopping malls. Smith, who believes he deserves such a fate anyway, who was apparently the only one who really grasped the gravity they did, tells the story willingly when he learns that Hickok has been cowardly. Hickok clenched the first. A crazy game of chicken between two immature, emotionally damaged, dangerous men. <br /> <br /> Fascinating psychological thriller, which tells a story of a terrible crime in the country's history. Beautiful portraits by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson. These roles have made their careers.
