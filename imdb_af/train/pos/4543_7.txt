Well no, I'm telling a lie, it's not really the best movie of all time, but it's a very enjoyable movie nobody knows. <br /> <br /> It's a friend-cop movie featuring Jay Leno and Pat Morita (Mr Miyagi) with some fluffy story about a missing car car prototype or something, but it doesn't matter. The reason why this movie is fun is because of the interaction between the two leaders, who initially dislike and mislead, but eventually become friends in a shocking way. The whole cultural difference is pretty well done, because it's fun to watch, it's totally ridiculous but in a cheesy and pleasant way. The soundtrack is cool, again in a cheesy 80's kind of way, it fits the movie. I tried to find one of the songs for centuries, but if I work out the memory of what I think some of the words I can't find. <br /> <br /> Another thing this movie has is the most fantastic discount of any movie ever, but I won't give that one away, oh no! Finally, I would have taken this movie in 48 hours. Most of Eddie Murphy's exports, including Beverly Hills police spokesperson, and whatever the partner Jackie Chan or Martin Lawrence has. If you are looking for a buddy cop movie and are filled with "straight white policeman, zany meets streetwise black cop, give it a shot. You can be pleasantly surprised. That means the whole formula upside down with a straight Japanese policeman meets zany streetwise white cop. <br /> <br /> I give this 7. to be honest, I find it more than that, I'd rather look than many things I want to give, but I think I know deep that it is a kind of madness that makes me like this movie.
