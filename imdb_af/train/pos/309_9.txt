Before I watched this TV movie, I didn't know much about one of my favorite actresses. After watching it, I realized how sad Lucille Ball's life really was. It also had good moments, but I didn't realize how sad it was. This movie was very good and told the story of the beloved Lucille Ball very well. I highly recommend it.
