"8 SIMPLE RULES ... FOR THE DATING OF MY TEENAGE DAUGHTER," is my opinion, is an absolute ABC classic! I'm not sure I didn't see every episode, but I still enjoyed it. It's hard to tell what episode my favorite was. However, I think it was always funny when an accident happened. I always laughed for it. Despite the fact that James Garner and David Spade were good, I liked the show more when John Ritter was the leading man. If you ask me, his sudden passing was very tragic. Everyone has always produced a good performance, the productions design was spectacular, the costumes were well designed and the writing was always very strong. In conclusion, I hope some network will bring it back on the air for fans of the show to watch.
