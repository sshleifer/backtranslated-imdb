What was just another intro-French French film offering was no more than a jealous sentiment for me, a truly informative and very satisfying presentation. <br /> <br /> Spoiler of sorts follows. <br /> <br /> Poor Cedric; He apparently didn't know what hit him. Poor hearing; We were initially trapped in what seemed to be a very beautiful and romantic story that had to be led back and forth in the dark reality of mismatch. These two guys just didn't get together from their first ambiguous encounter. As far as Mathieu and Cedric were sexually attracted, the absence of a deeper emotional tie made it an intellectual essence for Mathieu to find fulfillment in the part of life with someone whose sensitivity was more focused on carnival parties and trunks on the beach. <br /> <br /> On a purely technical note, I loved the camera action in this movie. Subtitles were completely unnecessary, although my French is "presque rien". I could see it again without the annoying English translation and enjoy it even more. It was a polished, very professionally made film. Although many scenes seem superfluous, I rate nine out of ten.
