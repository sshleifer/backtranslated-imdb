The word "classic" is being thrown out nowadays, but this movie deserves the appeal. The combination of Neil Simon, Walter Matthau (possibly the world's best live comic actor), and the late defendant George Burns make for a comic masterpiece. It's interesting to consider what the movie would have been like if death didn't prevent Jack Benny from playing George Burns's role, as planned. As is the case, the reunion scene in Matthau's apartment probably won't be exceeded as a side player. Definitely one of my desert island movies. <br /> <br /> "Tap !!!!!!!!!"
