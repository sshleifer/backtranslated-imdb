"A Cry in the Dark" is a masterful piece of cinema, haunting, and incredibly challenging. The true story of Lindy Chamberland, who saw a terrible face in 1980, saw her 3-month-old baby being taken cruelly from their family's tent while camping in Australia. Azaria (the baby) has never been seen again, and the result of her terrible disappearance has caused a real life threat throughout the world. Meryl Streep does impeccable justice to Lindy's role as she always does. But the one thing that "A Cry in the Dark" helps never falls flat is the brilliant direction. A truly inspired and accurate view of this baffling affair, tears are brought to mind. The concept is nothing less than frightening, and then you are being followed, but also inspired.
