Gung Ho is one of those movies you want to see over and over again. Michael Keaton is in charge of asking a Japanese car company to come to his village to create jobs for Hadleyville residents. What happens next is a hilarious moment after another. The two cultures clash and it's up to Keaton to keep things together. Look for great performances by Keaton, Gedde Watanabe, George Wendt, Mimi Rogers, John Turturro, Soh Yamamura and Sab Shimomo. Everyone was thrown perfectly. Don't be fooled by the low number rating. This is a 7.5 in my book. It is interesting to note that the town's name Hadleyville was also used in High Noon. Yes, there is a real Hadleyville, but in Oregon.
