Since it's been a few years since I reviewed these classics, I decided to go back and review it more in the dept, but first a few insider notes of a film critic. <br /> <br /> This animated series is one of those I grew up, it made my childhood joyful, it made it fantastic, miss some of these things today, which we clearly don't see as much as what we did in those days, to the review ... <br /> <br /> Talespin, or Air Heroes, called it in Denmark, is a great animated series. It's very much like chips and valleys, ducks and many of the old ones, so it has that strange feeling around it, I can't remember this series as much as I would like to remember. <br /> <br /> But I think it was very good, it came with some kind of message, not so much of a message, but it is one of the old ones that can be forgiven. <br /> <br /> Now I don't want to sound old or anything, but I feel as if the time has slipped out of my hands with these cartoons. Today we see something like Ed E dd and Eddy or something weird, we have all these new or almost new shows like Hannah Montana or something, but I feel like we don't have the same spirit in cartoons or real shows like us in the early days. <br /> <br /> Now maybe I'm wrong, but I feel that time has changed too much, to the conclusion I would be happy to see this series as Talespin re-released to the TV screen instead of all the new kids, give me back my childhood cartoons, give them to the kids i have a day, give them again ...
