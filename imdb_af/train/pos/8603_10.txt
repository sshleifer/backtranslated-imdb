The movie is a fantasy. The story line is thin but serves as the structure on which some great songs are beautifully sung. (I still can't believe that such attractive and attractive people can sing this stuff.) Some of the dialogue is wonderfully clever. The costumes made me feel as if I had been watching a fashionable fashion show from 1942 on. <br /> <br /> Movies are designed to serve multiple purposes. This one is designed to entertain and certainly does. If I had one negative comment, it would be that Nelson Eddy was a little too old to be the attractive score. Some of the closeups made me uncomfortable. But he could still sing and sing. However, Jeanette MacDonald was just as brilliant as ever. She makes a spectacular angel. <br /> <br /> This genre is good for me, and I'm new to Jeanette MacDonald / Nelson Eddy movies and related conversation. The music in this movie is beautiful. As much as I love the classic rock music that fills most modern movies, there is no doubt in my mind that this music is simple and more memorable, nicer, better built. The stars in this movie are more talented than the stars I see in movie theaters today. And Jeanette MacDonald, without the benefit of the Beverly Hills plastic surgeons, was more beautiful than the stars I see today. I am unclear why so many other posters are apologetic about the taste of this movie and more generally this group of movies. They say it is dated and trying to explain why this is so. And those who don't like it say it's not very good, but compared to what? I think this movie will undoubtedly still entertain people when so many other movies are forgotten. There is just too much quality in every way in this movie because it doesn't remember and enjoy. I recommend this movie without reservation to anyone who appreciates good talent, good beauty and good music.
