This movie is about basically human relationships, and the interaction between them. The main character is an old lady who begins a journey to her past on the twilight of her life, and analyzes how she lived her life. This trip is set down because of the boys' economic crisis and its intentions to place her in a nursing home. It is a very honest look at some issues we are all asking at some stage in life, and there are many secondary ideas to discuss in this movie, such as family legacy, real love, marriage or fate. Although this kind of movie melodramas is nothing new, it can be useful to look with family members to discuss some ideas. There is a good performance by the actors and the characters are very credible, but as a result some characters may not be fully developed. I really recommend this movie for a quiet Saturday afternoon.
