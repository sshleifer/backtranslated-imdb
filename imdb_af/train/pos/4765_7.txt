A priest who left his ministry meets a young man who has just been ordained. <br /> <br /> This movie is about the cruel dilemma between a life dedicated to God and faith and a life of more earthly enjoyment. In post-war France, it is also about the mortal aspect of Faith itself. <br /> <br /> It may not be the movie of a lifetime, but it is a sin that allows it to fall into oblivion. In addition, Pierre Fresnay is sublime.
