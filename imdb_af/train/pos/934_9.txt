In our household, we are huge fans of A Christmas Carol and look every Christmas almost every version, including the old 1938 Reginald Owen and the modern 1999 Patrick Stewart. Our overall favorite is the black and white classic in 1951, because Alastair Sim is Ebeneezer Scrooge and his conversion is the truest. However, this 1984 version has its own unique merit and makes a beautiful and entertaining story, very faithful in general to Dickens's novel. (See my comments on other movie adaptations, if interested) <br /> <br /> First, George C. Scott can certainly look pretty funny and doesn't make a bad Scrooge. I adore his sideburns, his long jacket and hat. He cuts the best fashion figure of fate, and quite a nice man. Sometimes, however, Scott seems to enjoy his role as Scrooge just a little too much and does not take it as seriously as he belongs! <br /> <br /> This version has the best overall Christmas atmosphere, hopeful and optimistic. Somehow you know this story will have a happy ending. Filmed in the town of Shrewsbury, England, it just seems to be some British. The film has a beautiful musical score, with wonderful, vibrant caroling music through all the appropriate parts of the story. Sometimes I can almost smell the chestnuts and the pudding sings in the buyer! <br /> <br /> Marley's crazy ghost (with his wonderful jigsaw scene) and the three Spirits are all pretty convincing. Past Christmas is a beautiful ethereal lady, Christmas, wonderfully gigantic and jovial, Christmas, but to come shrouded and foreboding as always. However, I found Scrooge's cousin, Fred, a little quiet and grim, almost as jolly and warm as he should be. I love the cousin's wife, with whom she named Janet, with her beautiful, fresh hair style. Instead of the blind's blue, they confiscated a game called Similes for the cousin's Christmas party. It's a cute little touch, Scrooge gets right in the spirit of the thing. <br /> <br /> The Cratchits and their somewhat slim (although much appreciated) Christmas dinner is well portrayed, with Bob (David Warner) being quite sympathetic and slow in his miles of scarf. Mrs. Cratchit is beautifully portrayed by Susannah York, who also played with George C. Scott in the wonderful 1970s adaptation of Jane Eyre. Above all, this version undoubtedly has the best Tiny Tim, not just a beautiful and impressive little waif but sickly. With the dark circles under his eyes, the weakened thing seems unlikely to survive the hour! <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful and heartwarming version of the holiday classic. With its festive atmosphere, it's sure to put you in the spirit of the season.
