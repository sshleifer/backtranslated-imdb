I am a university student who studies a level and needs help and remarks from anyone who has any opinion on the theme of mothers in film, in the mother. Whether you have done anything similar or just want to comment and help me research more about this movie, any comment will be greatly appreciated. The comments will only be used for examination purposes and will be included in my written examination. So if you have any opinion, I can make sure I can use it and you can help me get an A! I also study 'About a Boy' and 'Tadpole', so if you saw these movies, I would appreciate it if you could leave comments on the page. Thank you.
