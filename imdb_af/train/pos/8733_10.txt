When I bought my Toy Story band when it came out to the video after I was released into the theaters, I saw a trailer that told Toy Story creators. As soon as I saw I knew it was a good thing! I was right! A Bug's life like Toy Story is a wonderful story, wonderful characters and good animation. My favorite characters are Dim's rhino Beetle voiced by Brad Garrett and Hemlich the Caterpillar voiced by the late Pixar Storyman Joe Ranft. My favorite scene is when Slim lifts the walking stick (David Hyde Pierce) to try to divert Hemlich to the Bird and Hemlich's like you, Mr. Early Bird. How about a nice tasting worm on a stick and Slim's as I go! I'm going to understand! I just died and laughed at that scene. Being a big fan of insects, I think A Bug's Life is my favorite Pixar, although I know many people consider it the worst Pixar movie ever! I don't know how to hate a Pixar movie! I think they are all pretty good movies! Good work PIXAR!
