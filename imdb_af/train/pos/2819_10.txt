This movie is luxury! and I loved it! The "bearer" (Jacky Chan) and his friend, "cowboy", made the movie fun, meaningful and just foolish. The movie is a rare mix of good vs. evil battle and (somehow) the wonders and fun that grows up. Long Shao Ye takes the viewer through the daily activities of the young "dragonfly" (so called because he is the son of a rich family) and "cowboy", which includes the implementation of clever, elaborate ways to escape to study (with the help of the whole household, including the tutor), competing in rather boyish (and idiotically interesting) ways to get the love of a local girl, competing in football (you'll see what I mean) and the list goes on. Somehow they find themselves in the middle of a battle to save the variety of valuable antiques and the lives of many people. <br /> <br /> The movie has its serious moments. But they don't push, but rather inspire. The playfulness of the boys is not lost in this exchange, but is actually in the service of evil. What I really loved about this movie is how it ends. Not the typical confrontation (which in itself was wonderful), but you will see. Let me just say that it really captures the spirit of the movie. <br /> <br /> Foolish, greasy, meaningful and nostalgic. great movie.
