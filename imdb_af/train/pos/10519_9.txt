I am a great Jane Austen fan and in addition to a movie with a lengthy direction (a real fan wants to be left out so little and it can only be reached in a mini-series), it was really great. Gwyneth Paltrow really catches the slightly clueless but deliberate rich girl and Jeremy Northam IS Mr. Knightly with his speech and nobility. I wasn't excited about Ewan McGregor, though I like him much like an actor, but it didn't feel like he was spoiling the movie. As I said, as a Jane Austen fan, things I liked to see included what wasn't, but that would have made it much longer than it was permissible for a feature-length movie and as it was , I felt they really summed up the story. well. I saw every adaptation of this book and felt it was the best!
