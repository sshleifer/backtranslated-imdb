Well, I'm going to go against the grain on this movie, so it looks. To be a self-confident horror fan, I put it on and didn't know what to expect. After 2 or 3 minutes I actually found myself scared (pretty scarce). Of course, the film has a small budget and is set to get a cross station, but the films' lack of money does not detract from the story. Yes, the story is a bit far-fetched and does not explain itself very well, but THE CREEP is a class action and continues to break down and dampen something that goes its way. MESSAGE FOR LADIES !!! THERE ARE CERTAIN PARTS OF THE MOVIE, YOU MUST CLOSE YOUR EYES OR LESS YOU LOVE! you will understand when you see it. <br /> <br /> All in all a good movie and it makes a change to see a good treasure trove that actually scares.
