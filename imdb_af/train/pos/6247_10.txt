Trailers from this movie can show scenes of violence or non-mainstream sexuality, but these scenes are just scarce fragments, selected to attract audiences. Of course, they show the main message of the movie: <br /> <br /> People who are constantly kicked in their jobs and live, use power, which they can have elsewhere, to suppress other people infamously. And on the low side of the suppression chain, mostly women. <br /> <br /> A movie that shows it so brutally as Hundstage is definitely difficult to confront, but it must be even harder. <br /> <br /> Technically, the movie is much like Short Cuts, but consists of documentary style episodes, with people like your neighbor, and playing just like them. Without glittering and most disturbing, without any hope. The documentary style makes the movie even more disturbing because you realize such people are out there, and there are plenty of them, though our society focuses on the beautiful outside. Somewhere, the porn industry needs to do its business, somewhere illegal domestic violence must occur, somewhere has to be crushed. If you want to see a movie without any funny scenes (some might think the disabled woman repeating the top ten supermarkets is funny, but it happens for real) and without any Melodramatic, look at this movie. However, it will lose if you focus on captions. I fear, because captions cannot convey accent.
