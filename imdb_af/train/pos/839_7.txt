Think Pierce Brosnan and you think suave, brave, intelligent James Bond. In this movie Brosnan plays against type - and it's very fun to do it (like the audience). It's a movie about a hired assassin who's been married to a married businessman ... and it works! <br /> <br /> It's a fun movie with very good scenes (a sounding Brosnan and a good, up-and-coming "off" ridge Kinnear has some good lines). My only caveat is that Hope Davis plays the o-so-tolerant woman ("Can I see your gun?") Doesn't appear more often: she could have been a wonderful foil for these men. <br /> <br /> This movie is like a matador: it plays with the audience while "goes for a kill". The end is wonderful because a storyline (with a positive moral!) Emerges: it is a frenetic, insane and fun movie that deserves a wide audience.
