The first word that comes into my mind after watching this movie is "beauty". Beauty is everywhere in the actor play (Andie is excellent as always), in well-designed shots, and in author's red line idea - Love. <br /> <br /> I think the Kenny's character is the only white spot in these three women's otherwise boring and predictable lives. His interaction makes Andie's character as entertaining as possible. When he is gone, it has become clear that we cannot really appreciate and appreciate our valuable and sacred desires. <br /> <br /> The fact that Andie successfully recovered from this loss is nothing bad, but it shows that life is dominant in any form, even in this tiny British town, shown perfectly. <br /> <br /> Another reason I like this movie is that it is so British in every way - everything that houses and "fags" and accents :))). And Andie does wonderful work again! It's a pity that this movie has so low points. 10 out of ten!
