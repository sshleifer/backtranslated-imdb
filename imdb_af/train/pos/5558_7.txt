This story is known in the long-running Tom and Jerry cartoons, especially in the 1940s. The only difference is that two cats, instead of one, are threatened to be evicted if they don't catch the mouse (Jerry). Tom has an anonymous friend ("Butch?") Who lives with him in the home, and this is a big problem for Mammy Two Shoes. They can't believe they have a mouse, despite TWO cats in the house. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the one who catches Jerry can stay while the other gets the luggage, so the competition is on! <br /> <br /> Although well known, I still enjoyed it because the cartoon had enough original siggats to entertain. Not only did you compete with the cats against everyone except Jerry in the equation, so there were plenty of good gags to definitely recommend if you're a Tom & Jerry fan.
