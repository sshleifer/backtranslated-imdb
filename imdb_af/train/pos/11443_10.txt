This film is fascinating in its beauty and creativity. An artist's in-depth vision, his art that is intuitively derived from his natural source, brings us an inspiring Hosanna, blends his creations with trees, white water bumps against rocks, fields and rain ... Andy Goldsworthy leaves the viewer feeling alive that we are all made from the clay of this glorious earth. He doesn't save us his occasional frustration, but in general we see the miracle of joining nature with art. Of course, credit goes to the filmmaker, Thomas Riedelsheimer, who directed, photographed and edited the film with incredible sensitivity and perfect timing. <br /> <br /> If you have a feel for beauty, nature and art ... don't miss this fantastic movie!
