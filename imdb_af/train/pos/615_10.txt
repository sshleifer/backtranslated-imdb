This is the symbol of fairy tale! The villains are completely angry and the heroes are refreshingly clean. Danes, Deniro and Pfieffer are wonderful, as well as the new actor who plays the role of Tristan. Outstanding performances, beautiful magic, funny and dramatic, and a perfect fairy tale end make this movie absolutely fantastic! I'm not so sure that all content for younger children is suitable, but for an older audience there are many hilarious subtleties! The previews do not do this movie justice! My fiancee and I were quite skeptical, but were so excited that we had a chance on this movie that I can only hope to get someone on the fence over to try it!
