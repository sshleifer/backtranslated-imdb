An excellent representation of one of the more unusual aspects of that era. I loved the visual arts - well suited to a story linked to a graphic novel. <br /> <br /> I thought Tom Hanks was really great in this, he appeared very well as someone hardened by his work (which he didn't quite choose for himself) but still a normal life for his want family. He does the best he can to see what happens. Do not spoil the plot - but YOU MUST see this movie if you want to be a person who wants more of a movie than the usual shoot-up action / gangster format. (However, it is violent.)
