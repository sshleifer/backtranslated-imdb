Election is a Chinese mob movie, or triads in this case. Every two years, an election is held to decide on a new leader, and at first it seems to be a turning point between Big D (Tony Leung Ka Fai, or as I know him, The Other Tony Leung) and Lok (Simon Yam, Who was Judge in full contact!). Although Lok first wins, Big D refuses to accept the choice and goes to any lengths he can to ensure recognition as the new leader. Unlike any other Asian movie I watch with gangsters, this one is not an action movie. It has its bloody moments when needed, as in Goodfellas, but it's basically just a very effective drama. There are a lot of characters, which are really hard to keep up with, but I think it plays a bit in the madness. A 100-year-old bar, which is the symbol of power I mentioned earlier, changes hands a few times before things go down. And although it may seem that the movie ends at the 65 or 70 minute point, there are still a few great surprises to wait for. Simon Yam was my favorite character here and the anchors of the picture. <br /> <br /> Election was the award winner of last year's Hong Kong Awards for Best Actor (Tony Leung), Best Picture, Best Director (Johnny To, who did the heroic Trio!), and best script. It also has nominations for cinematography, editing, movie rating (which I loved), and three more upcoming performances (including Yam).
