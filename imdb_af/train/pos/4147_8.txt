I don't think this movie is for everyone. But I saw it this weekend in Seattle and I thought it was so funny. I didn't laugh at it for a long time in a movie. I thought the whole cast did a good job. You will learn the first moment by laughing at the last scene. I suspect some moviegoers (especially those who take WAY too seriously) will be turned off by this kind of humor. Not me. The movie was a real surprise. And the whole theater was running low in the show and I think many people enjoyed themselves and were happy to have a good time at the movies for a change. I can't wait to see it again! If you're in the mood for LOL, it's for you. Funny, funny, funny, funny!
