It is comedy as it ever was and compares it to the two remakes, THE MONEY WORD and IS WE DOING NOW?, Just showing the 40's filmmakers had a comedy flair ever since. <br /> <br /> I was 15 when I first saw it, and even at that gentle age, there was a lot I could laugh at. Now, of course, familiar with adult frustrations, I see a lot that I missed as a youth. <br /> <br /> The three main players ... Cary Grant, Myrna Loy, and Melvyn Douglas ... agreed perfectly. but the essence of the film lies in the frustrations that occur in reaching a dream. It's never so easy and free from unseen complications as you think. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a classic comedy that still stands above the efforts to revive it.
