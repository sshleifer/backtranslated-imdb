With all the things going on in the world, we sometimes need an escape. Curly Sue is just that. Not a complicated plot or deep meaning; but it is not without substance. There is more than angry action or heartbreaking drama. There are beautiful little ones that you can see with your children and have enough content to enjoy with your date. Try it, you can do it more than you think. The girl is very smart and cute. The "Dad" and the girl go through a few slapstick routines. When a jealous boyfriend enters, the trouble is for curly breweries and the famous sheep can be torn. Fred Thompson and Kelly Lynch play good roles as the top crust and Alison Porter and James Belushi are an interesting fable like a duo portraying street homeless drifters. Their worlds collide and comedy occurs.
