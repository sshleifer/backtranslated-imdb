After reading many of the other reviews for this movie on the IMDb, there seems to be a consensus between purists that this film is nothing like the books on which it is based. At this point I can't comment because I've never read any of the protagonists' adventures. But what I can say with certainty is that many of the judges mentioned must surely have a sense of humor. Let's be honest here - this movie is just as much fun! <br /> <br /> OK? .. so I must admit the point that the movie does not seem to be representative of the character / s, but let's put it in a clear perspective ?? .. do the same individuals running around this movie also the fact that the classic 1960s Batman series does not adhere to the original DC cartoon character? Or maybe there are still unrest in the same people that the 1980 movie version of Flash Gordon was too much of a departure from the original series? <br /> <br /> The point is, yes, this movie is incredible camp, but it's their charm! <br /> <br /> Former Tarzan, Ron Ely plays the eponymous hero in this (and bears more than a comparison with Gary Busey to get started!) and is backed by a great supportive role everyone seems to be a ball with their respective roles. Also look out for a very short but very welcome appearance by horror movie lover Michael Berryman. <br /> <br /> Best scene? Too much to choose from, but watch the hilarious facial expressions adopted by the waiter when Savage and his men on a formal occasion ordered the ultimate faux pas to order boiled, lemonade and milk! Also the often-listed scene near the end of the movie in which Savage tackles his nemesis Captain Seas and uses various martial arts disciplines marked on the screen! ?? Priceless! <br /> <br /> Simply put, the movie doesn't take him seriously and is all the more fun. Great fun from start to finish! (and you'll be guaranteed the John Phillip Sousa custom theme song for days after that!)
