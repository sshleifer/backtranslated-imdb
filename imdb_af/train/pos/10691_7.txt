I caught it on the dish last night. I like the movie. I traveled to Russia in 3 different times (with our 2 children). I can't figure my finger exactly why I like this movie except to see the bad turn "good" and "good" turn "semi-bad". I like the look Ben Chaplin has throughout the movie. Like "I can't believe it happens to me" whether it's good or bad, it's the same look (and it works). Great end. 10/07. Rent it or take it as a dish.
