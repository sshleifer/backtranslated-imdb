What happens when someone has so much social anxiety that they stop functioning? How alone can a man get? When the everyday crap we have to do to become part of society becomes too much, what happens? Frownland is investigating these questions. Definitely an exciting original debut by Bronstein. The tone is strange and claustrophobic, as we are in the mind of a man named Keith who is so devastated that he can hardly form a good sense. We follow him around as he tries to communicate with people and function daily. Most of us knew people like this - people who say "sorry" too much or "I appreciate it" when there is nothing to appreciate. So we know there are people out there, but why would anyone want to make a movie about them? Well, because its interesting and Bronstein and the main actor, Dore Mann, do an excellent job. This movie is about as un-commercial as a movie can get. A few friends filmed it in the course of a few years when they saved money. It's shot at 16mm and the scratched movie watch is beautifully low budget. With no distributor, it can be a difficult one to find, I think it is random for the past year or so. Hopefully it will be on DVD at some time. I saw it at the Silent Movie Theater here in LA. There were 10 people in the audience, among them Crispin Glover, if it tells you something of how strange this movie is. Highly recommended.
