"The Luzhin Defense" is a good film with fine central performances, but too much of the novel and not shining enough of the filmmaker's craft. It was felt by most of the films that the characters only helped to compress the narrative. Marlene Gorris may have investigated the psyche of Luzhin, rather than tearing him apart as a tortured innocent victim by the cruel motives of others. <br /> <br /> Adapting literature to the screen is clearly a difficult task, especially a novel written in the early 20th century. This movie is not deep enough in the relationship between Luzhin and Natalia. Natalia's divide with her mother comes across a rogue disagreement by the mother rather than a dramatic flash point in the film. I felt like I was put through Luzhin's torment and ultimate tragic end, without having the pleasure of unraveling his unusual and complex personality. However, it was a moving and enjoyable movie, but certainly not a wonderful one.
