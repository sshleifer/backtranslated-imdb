Author / Director John Hughes covered all the bases (as usual) with this bitterly lovely Sunday Afternoon family movie. "Curly Sue" is a lovely, preliminary being cared for by 'Bill' from the infancy. The couple live on their mind while traveling the big US of A. Fate fits them into a "very nice" yuppie lawyer, and the rest is predictable. <br /> <br /> Children will love this movie, as they may relate to the heroine, played by 9-year-old Alisan Poter (who became the "you go girl" of Pepsi ads). The character is supposed to be about 6 or 7, as it is encouraged to think after school. Some of her vocabulary suggests that she is 9 or older every day. <br /> <br /> Similar to "Home Alone", there are many bangs and small fists that punch big fat cats. Again, it is "formula" film making, aimed at a young audience. Entertaining and heartwarming. Don't look for surprises, but be prepared to throw a tear or two.
