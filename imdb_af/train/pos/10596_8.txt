Every time this movie is on the BBC, someone in the Radio Times said it was a satire against the post-war world of rationing and the welfare state. I don't think that's the point of the movie. The film parades the spies (small-time criminals who have managed the black market) and the housewife league that has been campaigning against government restrictions, but was actually a Tory pre-organization. Yes, of course, the film sends out the political / social situation, but ultimately people realize that they need all the controls to ensure a just society, they want to be British and riddled rather than strangers. <br /> <br /> But I don't think they're going back to exactly as they were before.
