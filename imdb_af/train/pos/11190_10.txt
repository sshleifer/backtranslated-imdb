One of the best (if not the best) Stephen King's performances. Being dark as dark, surprising non-hollywood ending, frightening atmosphere, amazing book adaptation, excellent role playing, educational (don't play with life), briefly - everything must be an excellent horror ... <br /> <br / > My favorite horror movie, straight 10+.
