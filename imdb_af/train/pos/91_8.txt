In general, it was a good movie with an ideal ending; The acting was spectacular and the characters did not turn away from their people. I especially liked the plot, although you knew what was going to happen, it still gave the surprise element throughout the movie. However, I find that could come to an end, it could have been a bit longer (maybe maybe) - it seems a bit rushed; as if the writer wanted to take off sheets of lines before the rain fell. For example: What happened to Tristan's brother, Hayden? For everything we know, he died in hospital. Maybe he is the one who sets up the whole thing? Who knows! Maybe there will be a successor? Can be? If there is .. I can't wait to see it.
