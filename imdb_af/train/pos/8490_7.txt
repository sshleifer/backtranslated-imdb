I recently saw this movie in my International Business Class. I didn't expect anything other than another boring documentary (not to say I don't love documentary, I just have hard movies with movies in that class). Imagine when this movie, actually a movie, came up. <br /> <br /> This film tells all the cultural differences in the workplace and how to work together to get around. The culture clash shows just how different the world is and how else we see ourselves coming to someone and waking us up. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone in the business or just wanting a laugh, because yes it is funny. <br /> <br /> Well, that's about it! Cheers
