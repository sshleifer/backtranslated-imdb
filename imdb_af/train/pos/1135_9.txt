I first saw it in the movie when it came out, and the crowd was really in the movie that made the experience more fun. These are good role-playing characters, very big names in it, some not as recognizable as they are now. I think it's a good idea if you follow any of these actors, or loved them in other movies, to add them to your selected list. Some of the screens actually remind me of the kind of well-behaved comedy like The Birdcage or even The Clue, a kind of strange spontaneous phenomenon, with some real-life professional delivery of these beloved actors. The film did a good job of giving you insight, perhaps even very realistically, into the culture of a day's soap.
