I received my first comment on this film almost five years ago. Then the ideas presented in the movie were still mostly fictitious, if they could ever break. Not anymore. Indeed, politics, society and the media in The Running Man look very close to home. <br /> <br /> Consider the following factors, which were mostly absent in 1987 (the year The Running Man came out) present today: <br /> <br /> Worried, as Richard Dawson's character Damon Killian puts it , "traditional morality." CONTROL <br /> <br /> Entertainment in the form of extreme reality, including pain, fear and discomfort of participants. CHECK <br /> <br /> Cameras everywhere. CONTROL <br /> <br /> Limited travel for citizens in the appearance of government, controlled by a centralized computer system completed with bar-coded passports ("travel pass" in the movie) and approved under the guise of national security . CONTROL <br /> <br /> An enlarged blend, adjacent to just, from government and media. CHECK <br /> <br /> Computer-generated graphics that are advanced enough to manipulate real movie material (such as the "digital mat" of Ben Richards' image on the stunt double). CHECK <br /> <br /> Danger of conscientious objectors or opponents of the current administration. CONTROL <br /> <br /> Flag economy further expanding the gap between the rich and non-so-rich; increasing numbers of fringe groups responding to the tighter nose of the great government; civil unrest that breaks just below or on the surface of almost every major public event, regardless of its origin or intention. CHECK, CHECK, CHECK <br /> Then again, maybe it's just a movie based on a Stephen King novella. But just to be safe, I'm going to Switzerland.
