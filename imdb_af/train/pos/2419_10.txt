Besides airplanes, trains and cars and Uncle Buck, it's John Candy's funniest movie. When he is hypnotized with the playing card (similar to the manchurian candidate) and becomes a horny man who does not know what he is saying, he makes two very memorable quotes. Both deal with male anatomy. The love scene involving groceries should be seen. It cannot be described. <br /> <br />
