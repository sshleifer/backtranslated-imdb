I don't know what this movies is. But history or religion films are always criticized for their accuracy. Of course, it's not 100% accurate. It is difficult to make 100% accurate movies today even when even the "experts" do not agree. Therefore, I prefer to judge a movie by what it tries to say than to choose all the inaccuracies. <br /> <br /> So I'm starting to say I liked this mini-series. But I agree with the criticism that his childhood has gone too fast. The series had to be a three-part story, and his childhood was the first part. But if they had no more money to shoot more story, is it to criticize it ??? <br /> <br /> There is only one real problem I have with this movie and that is the fact that it is told in a history. book way. Especially the second part which is just a sum of events that happened. I'd rather see Hitler more humane (more scenes where he himself and so on). Noah Taylor did it more in the movie 'Max' which looks better than I think. Yet I am glad that it was made and it owns on DVD. Just to remember more clearly what happened, and see Carlyle give his best. 7.5 / 10
