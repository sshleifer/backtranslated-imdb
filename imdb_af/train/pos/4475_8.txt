The United States has still fought World War II (the film was released between VE day and VJ day). Any studio worthy of its salt has either made sweeping films where fearless American soldiers hit the enemy, or Americans in general were singing and dancing. Technicolor Musicals was where America thrived in the oppressive days when everything rationed. Most musical of the day were just a bunch of musical numbers joined together with the best available plot that filled in to fill time to the next musical number! I get the feeling now that the people who reviewed this movie were all born after 1970. Depressing how fast we forget. <br /> <br /> This movie can be called "The Search for Jose Iturbi" but now everyone is wondering why. Allow me to explain. From 1929 - his arrival in America - to his death in 1980, Iturbi was one of the most beautiful pianists to enjoy a concert phase. He agreed to do some movies in 1942, but Hollywood has been behind him for almost a decade. Not only an excellent pianist, but also a successful conductor, Iturbi has been a household word for over 40 years. <br /> <br /> The scene where Iturbi and 17 other pianists play one of Liszt's Rhapsodies is planned early - and has no one ever noticed that the other pianists were all the kids? Joe Pasternak, who produced that movie and many other MGM musicals, has credited Iturbi with interesting America's youth in classical music. Grayson wants an audition with Iturbi in the movie. Everyone wanted Iturbi to go. The joke among soldiers was that "GI" means "Get Iturbi" (he did many concerts at military bases). <br /> <br /> Gene Kelly was a good dancer and Frank Sinatra is a great singer, but at the time this movie was made, Sinatra was barely 30 years old and was only contracted to Columbia Records for four years. . Kelly was already known as a dancer, but Iturbi was a sensation for 20+ years worldwide. <br /> <br /> And with the lack of a plot, Americans didn't need plot. They were tired of war, they were sick of fear of their loved ones, and worried about the future. They needed happiness and hope, and the assurance that things would eventually work out well. They need music and smile and joy and romance. This movie and others like just delivering what was needed. <br /> <br /> Enough reading. Mouse dancing aside, the best scene in the film is between Sinatra and Iturbi. Each of them "ignorantly" complements the others' music. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in Jose Iturbi, the Spaniard has made more of America than De Soto, Cortez and De Leon, please leave my website at www.joseiturbi.com, where you can find a plot summary , excerpts from movie reviews "of the day" and pictures of these and some other MGM's musical of the 1940s, as well as a biography and discography of Iturbi. <br /> <br /> Trout
