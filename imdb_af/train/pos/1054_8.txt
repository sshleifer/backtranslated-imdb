If you want unceasing action, hot chicks and a post-apocalyptic view of Seattle, then this is the show for you! <br /> <br /> The concept of Dark Angel is not something new (in fact, there is controversy over whether James Cameron stole the idea from a book), but I spend every hour every Tuesday from start to finish . <br /> <br /> Jessica Alba is smoking and Max's friends (original Cindy, Kendra) are just a shot. <br /> <br /> The battle scenes are getting better, but the dialogue between Original Cindy and Max should be a little better (the snake sounds forced and it seems as if someone in the suburbs has written it). <br /> <br /> According to me, Dark Angel is a great, guilty pleasure with everything an action fan can ask for, but if you're looking for a hard hit, award-winning drama, watch "The West Wing "or something.
