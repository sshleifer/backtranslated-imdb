Can't believe my eyes if you read a lot of other comments and reviews. As if it were a mediocre movie of some running drops. <br /> <br /> The movie is big, funny, crazy, over-the-top violently with minimum gore, and all the way energetic to the core. Love each piece of it. Can't remember that something insane like this was made for the laughs and martial arts that come out. And now the most important thing (at least for me): it's computer effects free. When I look at some Hollywood actors watching it on the screen in modern high-resolution and damn high-quality action "fuflo" (a Russian word meaning "bull * beep *"), I understand that any * beeps * it can do - you can adjust the threads to the body, add some cute computer effects, and place them in the action movie. Here it is different. I don't think there will be even a dozen of physically advanced action stars worldwide, who can repeat the noise that takes place at the end of the movie or the "Chinese football" game. And it's just a small Hong Kong movie that has been fun, and not as "Star Wars". <br /> <br /> Having a DVD with English soundtrack is not a problem with this movie. It doesn't inspire me the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Can't call a very neat play. Some of you won't like it. As far as I'm concerned, it's incredible. Look at the Dragon's friend who speaks bravely to the criminals and suddenly gets a fist punch in his left side of the head. His face expression turns into something funny and he comes to Dragon with a baby expression. And look at the imminent size of his mouth - it is almost from one ear to the other long when he makes grimaces. <br /> <br /> This movie earns a higher rating and a thousand comments from people around the world. . Thank you to our Russian industry for the release of classic Jackie Chan movies. His modernes are much weaker in my humble opinion and don't earn much hype. <br /> <br /> Total 10 out of 10 - a legendary movie in his genre. Thank you for your attention.
