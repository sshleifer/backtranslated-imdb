This show is freaking hilarious! the jokes are original, god and i love Eric and Kelso! yes i know what they say, after the 8th season it is no longer funny, because Eric and Kelso are no longer in the show, and Randy is a real dumbass. Randy is, compared to Eric and Kelso. <br /> <br /> You can't take the funniest characters and link to "I'm a cool old" guy (Randy). It's not his fault anyway, but the authors are trying to keep the 8th season funny. It's still not as much as the previous seasons, but it's good. <br /> <br /> The 360's are wonderful, the circle, Red is a real kind of spiritual abuse dad :) and Kitty is always half-high half circle. Hyde always tries to be cool, he also has his moments. The least favorite characters are Jackie and Donna. they are cool but not without Kelso and Eric. <br /> <br /> great show. Goof!
