Takashi Miike's actions in the kiddie area almost conquered me immediately, showing nerve and courage in dealing with fantasy elements. It is a fairy tale that dares to be dark. Even as a child I thought there was something sinister about most fairy tales; terrible things happen to people in most children's books. Miike understands that these classic stories are a bit scarier (and more disturbing) than they seem at first glance. The filmmaker takes the archetype story of a child on a wonderful quest from the preschool classroom. He emphasizes the very real fears of a world of dangerous missions that never ends. Westerners like to write the seriousness behind bedtime stories specifically for children. I appreciate the fact that Miike was more honest than most American filmmakers. He goes for the story of the story, but he also shows signs of withholding. But a self-managed Miike is even stranger than most filmmakers. I thought it was a good movie. Highly recommended.
