It ran from 1959 to 1973. It's more than his long life that says a lot to this series. It is also that it survived fashion and taste changes of the 50's, psychedelic 60's and remained popular in the 70's. <br /> <br /> I remember repetitions of this series. It was a successful combination of all of its elements of stories, films and productions that made it exceptional. Lorne Green had his definition-iconic character from this series. The appeal was over generations. All members of the family can enjoy it. This balanced morality with violence, humor with seriousness. A strip series is made as a spin of this because of its impact. The shame is that this series is no longer repeated and many will not know its meaning.
