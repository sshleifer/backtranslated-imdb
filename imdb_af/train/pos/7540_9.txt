I really enjoyed this movie. I've always been a fan of Whoopi Goldberg and this movie just highlights it. She portrays a housewife in an African-American family who's social chain up because of her husband's (Danny Glover) success as a lawyer. She moved to a whole white area where the people were friendly, but a little uncomfortable to her. The different events that occur during the movie make some laugh, but mostly appeal to the other emotions. This movie is not so much a comedy as a drama. I give it a strong 8/10. I recommend you catch it on TV or rent it soon.
