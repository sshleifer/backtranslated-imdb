I wasn't quite sure if it was just one of those idiotic night-time soap operas that would seem like the first, but it turned out to be a good, good performance. Four female friends with diverse backgrounds gather and share the weekly course of their love life. The hour-long program follows each of them separately by their often-screwed quest to find love and it does so without being boring. Sharon Small's Trudi is the housewife (allegedly widows after 11 September) who gets a little preachy and annoying with her friends (who tend to be a little looser and more creative in their efforts). It is wonderful to get Klein back to tsv. see, because she was wonderful in the "Inspector Lynley Mysteries". The chick can act. Orla Brady's character (Siobhan, a lawyer) may be the most corrupted but still very sympathetic of the women, struggling with her friendly but self-absorbed husband Hari (Jaffrey, formerly of Spooks) with his desire for a child with her, whatever her needs. The last two members of the film are the bustling Jess (Shellie Conn), an event planner who is a wild child who sleeps with anyone and everyone, who is not specific, and Katie (Sarah Parrish) was a dreary doctor His relationship with a patient is AND his son sent her career and loves the life that was out of control. That said, I'm hooked now and hope the BBC continues to break this series because it's good, it's different and it has a good role to play.
