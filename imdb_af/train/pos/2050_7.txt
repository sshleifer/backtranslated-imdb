Everyone has bills to pay, and that includes Christopher Walken. <br /> <br /> In Vietnam, a group of soldiers discover that the war is over and return to home when they experience a lot of POWs, including Christopher Walken. After a Mad Max 3 (!) Thunderdome battle, and a short massacre later. Walken and a Colombian man have a dollar bill that promised something or something else. <br /> <br /> Cut to the present (1991), and the Colombian man is leading a revolution against El Presidente. He was successful, but after El Presidente threatened to comfort people with a tank, he was forced to surrender and was shot in the head on live television. It is shown in complete detail as a newsflash on American telly, which leads Walken to collect the old team (though not actually part of the group) to Colombia and gun thousands of people. <br /> <br /> McBain is a monumental silly movie, but it's also a good laugh and also action. This is one of those movies where logic is given a wide cab. How can Walken also shoot a fighter pilot in the head of another plane without suffering decompression or even breaking a window? It also seems that these guys can beat the number of drug dealers in New York without the police bothering. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of b-movie madness to chew here, from Michael Ironside's deadly play in the Vietnam order of heroic but utterly useless death of one of the heroes, to the side-scattering confrontation between Walken and El Presidente, and let's not forget the passionate speech of the rebel leader's sister, who is watching television in America (almost brought a brown tear to my just-eye, that bit). <br /> <br /> It's out there for a pardon. Buy it if you have a sense of humor. See how many times you can also see the camera crew.
