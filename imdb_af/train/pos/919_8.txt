After a fan of 'Columbo' I was very disappointed in 'Corky Romano'. Although it was a funny movie, Falk's mob boss character was far from the sweet lieutenant he has played for so many years, especially with the offensive language he used. After 'Corky Romano' I was honestly surprised by Mr. Peter Falk. Having found John Christmas and his predecessor, a village without Christmas, I have to say for the first time in a week that 'Max', Peter's Falk's beautiful character is in both movies. surely as memorable and lovely as 'Columbo'. While parts of the movie are pretty predictable, such scenes in no way carry away the pleasure of watching the story play. I wish I both recorded these heart-warming Christmas movies, and I strongly recommend them to be a Falk fan, a Christmas note, or just someone who occasionally enjoys a good movie of the week. This movie can eventually be lost to the crowd of TV holiday movies, so be sure to find John Christmas before it's too late.
