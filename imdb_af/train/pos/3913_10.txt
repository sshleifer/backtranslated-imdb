Carlos Saura's Carmen is one of the best achievements in the world, let alone Spanish, theater. It manages to generate interest in flamenco in its amazingly enhanced adaptations of Bizet with powerful physical power. At the same time, we see the impact of the creation and rehearsal of a new interpretation of Carmen on the choreographer / director and the principal dancers. The fine line between life and art is brilliant.
