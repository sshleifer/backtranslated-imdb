This movie is good for TV. I like it because I'm a big fan of disaster films, though it's a family movie. Accuracy on the film from the book is half-and-half. They have the characters' names right, but in the book there was no storm hunter. The car scene involving the Hatch family, running away from the tornado, was not in the book. involved Dan hatches and his friend drives a police officer on his way to the police station for safety. And in the book Dan and his friend are both 12 years old. That's all I can think of. Overall, it was a good movie, although it might be a bit more accurate for the book. Did you know the book is based on a true story of a series of tornadoes that destroyed a small Nebraska town in 1980?
