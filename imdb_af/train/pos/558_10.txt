Classical drama / action western with incredible cinematography before the time (1954). The production is very good and you can say that it was done with pride and love. Unique look in American North West pioneers is very educational and entertaining. This movie is much under rated because most people do not like to see the reality that many "legislators" at this particular time and place were very crooked / corrupted like most developing countries today. The action series could have been more realistic, but still this movie really covers most of the essentials. Not for an audience who only wants pure. testoterone type westerns for this movie is more for those who have a sense of history and philosophy .......
