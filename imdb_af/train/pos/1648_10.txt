It's one of the best movies ever made. It is a realistic portrayal of rural farming life that was a major part of American history. The area is 1906 Wyoming, where life has not changed much since the last century. The movie holds your interest without the additional Hollywood myths. The whole family can see this movie and are intrigued by how life in America was when it was mostly a rural nation. With this film you will escape the present and witness the daily life of 100 years ago. In a beautiful, picturesque setting you will see the hard physical work that needs to be survived, as well as the constant concerns and concerns of the elements and the market pressure that will make a difference between success or failure. See this movie and experience life as it was for most of our nation's history. This movie is worth seeing your time. My only question is: why are there no more movies like this one?
