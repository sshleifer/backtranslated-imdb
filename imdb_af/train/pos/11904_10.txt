I gave it a 10, since everyone else looked it and it would have been stupid. The reason I'm bothering you is to add a personal observation to Castle's work. <br /> <br /> I saw "Homicidal" and "The Tingler" (the version with the clever color sequence where everything but the blood is in black and white) several times and "The House On Haunted Hill" many times. <br /> <br /> Even I'm not old enough to see them when Castle was his showman tricks, so I appreciate them for their own merits. And while most like him as a second class, shocking, hammy, etc. Passing by, I believe they make him an inconvenience. <br /> <br /> The end series of "Homicidal" is actually shocking and work today - and The Tingler's foreground, while stupid, was very original. <br /> <br /> But "The House On Haunted Hill" was a TRIUMPH. After I used the Frank Lloyd Wright home as its outside, the great Vincent Price and a solid throw, plus a good score and production values ​​- when I first saw it late seventy in the night, saw an audience reaction I hasn't seen yet and hasn't seen yet. <br /> <br /> It was the piece where the heroine alone is in the basement (if you haven't seen the movie, stop reading now) and we're waiting to hear the hero on the other side of the wall. <br /> <br /> With no telegraphing of what's coming, the camera slowly pulls back and forces the AUDITOR to change their look. I say no more (my "spoiler" statement above only covers this movie). <br /> <br /> The point is, I believe this jersey was DELIBERATE - not coincidental - and when that happened, the WHOLE AUDIT SCREAMED (including most of the men!) taken to calm down. <br /> <br /> Now it's superior movie-making. A flamboyant showman he might have been, but "House" and the other two movies I mentioned were GOOD FILES. Castle wasn't a Hitchcock, but he wasn't Ed Wood either. <br /> <br /> It's easy to focus on someone's attributes and forget to explore their TALENT. So I hope this documentary acknowledges that. I look forward to seeing it.
