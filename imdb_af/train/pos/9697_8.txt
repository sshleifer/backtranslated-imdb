It is a very heart-warming family movie. It has absolutely brilliant animal training and "acting" (if you can call it that too) (just think of the dog in "How did the Grinch Christmas steal" ... it was a bad training). The Paulie story is done extremely well, well reproduced and in general the characters are also greatly expanded. No more to say, except that it is a BIG FILE! <br /> <br /> My ratings: story 8.5 / 10, acting 7.5 / 10, animals + fx 8.5 / 10, cinematography 8/10. <br /> My overall score: 8/10 - BIG FAMILY MOVIE AND VERY WARNING!
