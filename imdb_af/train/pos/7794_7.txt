Victor Nunez imbues this unimaginative story of a young woman's emotional journey with a sense of poetry rarely seen in the cinema. By poetry I mean the sentence in which the literary and the film come into play. There is something very literary about the movie, almost as if a novel has been adapted, the page per page is modified. In this sense, the film reaches depths that many cannot; but it is also quite slow at other times, which underestimates the depths it once achieved in favor of ennui. Movie star Ashley Judd has not made a better movie than her debut here. She fits the role of lead Ruby like a glove, almost as if she didn't have to act. She has a real movie scene in the film and has not really succeeded in giving the same appearance to her later films, although she was impressive in normal life.
