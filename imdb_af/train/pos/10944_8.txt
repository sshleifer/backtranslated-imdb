The Sarah Silverman program is ... better than other programs. No laughter tracks, no painful jokes, just a program. The Sarah Silverman program. If you're like me and you love the comedy, it's probably a show for you. <br /> <br /> Sarah Silverman brings it there, and right here, funny with the table. A variety of different styles that make up for them. <br /> <br /> This program is not something you want to start a comparative war because it has absolutely nothing to do with them (other shows). This show is its own entity, and I think most comedy cups will really do it well. <br /> <br /> See and see.
