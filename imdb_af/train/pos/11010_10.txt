When the matrix appeared in 1999 and questioned its existence and identity, many movies were expected to use it as inspiration. It didn't really happen, surprisingly, and it runs until 2002 for a movie of similar theme to appear. But to say that Cypher is, a clone will be his credit. <br /> <br /> The story is from a Morgan Sullivan, who is applying for a job with a high-flying technology company called Digicorp. His job is to be a spy and get information about a competitor, while being under a supposed and false identity. His home life is quite normal, but he must lie to his wife about what he actually does. But things start with conspiracy, and before he knows what's going on, he begins to question who he actually is. It is not helped by a strange woman who emerges. <br /> <br /> Turns and turns in every direction keep you completely fascinated, and in no way does anything ever seem to be chosen or incredible. <br /> <br /> It's a pleasant journey through a not-too-distant future, and with a good acting, you'll be on the edge of your seat. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
