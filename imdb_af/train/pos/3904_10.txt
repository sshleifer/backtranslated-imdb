In my opinion, this is the best stand-up show I've ever seen. I became a direct Eddie fan after seeing Dress, but I have to say I think it's his best job. However, if you ever get the chance to see him, I will say. It is worth the effort! <br /> <br /> Most of the time, after a few times a rising routine has been seen, jokes begin to grow. But I have to say, I've seen this show so many times that I literally have the whole thing remembered (yes, I realize is kinda sad), but every joke still makes me laugh. It's really a good show. <br /> <br /> Dress to Kill will never grow old for me. I own it and watch it when I need a good laugh.
