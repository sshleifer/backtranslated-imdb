This is the second part of 'The Animatrix', a collection of animated short films that tells us a bit more about the world of 'The Matrix'. In this one we learn how men and machines can work and live together. It is a small history lesson in the world of The Matrix. Not as good as the first part ('The Final Flight of the Osiris'), but still quite entertaining.
