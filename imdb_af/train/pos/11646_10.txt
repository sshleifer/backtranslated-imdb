This movie, though one of the favorite topics of manufacturers of Mexican producers, is the utmost life in our cities, having a funny way to put it on the screen. <br /> <br /> Four of the more important Mexican directors, from the past, are approaching the history of our city outlined in various literary types, as it can be the farce or the satire, which is a movie with An ear exposed topic in our country, but telling in a completely different way that shows him a freshness. <br /> <br /> With little-known actors but excellently interpreting their paper, each of the directors in the stories shows the ability to identify us, anywhere in the world, the ability to laugh and to to celebrate the grief. Perhaps for many in our country, the movie is not satisfied, but I believe that people from other countries can find attractive and surrealism of the Mexican part.
