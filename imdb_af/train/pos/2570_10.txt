Well, it's probably one of the best movies I've seen and I'm so fond of writing most of the writing (especially the scene in the storage unit when Jerry Lee breaks wind) and even with the script in my head I still like to see it for Jerry Lee, the German shepherd is hysterical and is really tested to see who is smarter. The tag rule also applies. Not to mention the acting is wonderful, though Christine Tucci otherwise whispers in a whisper (See CSI filmography if you don't know what I mean). It is too bad that this movie only has the single problem Dooley and Jerry Lee had to work, and it would have been pretty cool to see the tricks Zeus and Welles had in their sleeves.
