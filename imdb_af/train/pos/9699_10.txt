Something about Paulie touched my heart, like little movies. It's a witty, funny but emotional movie. I'm a late arrival to become a fan of this movie. I didn't see "Paulie" until May 2004, and have since ordered the Widescreen DVD from a eBay seller. <br /> <br /> The special effects of Paulie's display are wonderful. My son asked me how the bird knows so many phrases. Probably, my favorite part of the movie is when Paulie is in Gena Rowlands (Ivy's) company, followed by Cheech Marin (Ignacio). Tony Shalhoub (Misha) plays an excellent role as the kind-hearted man. You walk through the movie completely for him. <br /> <br /> You can't go wrong buying or buying this movie !!
