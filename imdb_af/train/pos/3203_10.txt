I think this movie was one of Kurt Russell's good movies. Kurt Russel is my favorite actor, so I think he is a good actor in any role he plays. But this movie had a lot of action in it and I know it had to be over 5.6 out of 10 on the meter, but many didn't like this movie. Oh, I thought it was good, so I think everybody should see this movie. If you see and love this movie, I think you should also see Back draft with Kurt Russel. I give Soldier *** 1/2 out of *****
