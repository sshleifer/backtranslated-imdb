Another demonstration of Kurosawa's genius, his first color film is a dark surrealistic look at the tragic lives of Tokyo slum dwellers, essentially a series of wing wheels depicting different groups of people who are dangerous in a harsh and harsh environment. unconscious post-war city. This movie shows from comedy to tragedy and back. This film shows how people handle the worst kind of life in their own way, mostly returning to themselves and living in the fantasy worlds of their own heads, withdrawing emotionally from those around them or drowning themselves in alcohol. Mix kitchen-sink realism with Kabuki-esque theatrics, Kurosawa toys knowledgeable with the emotions of his audience, drawing tears and laughing with equal deftness. A wonderful, draining experience.
