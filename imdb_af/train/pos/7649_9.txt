Undercover Jim Belushi vehicle, a modern cockeyed version of This is a wonderful life. Michael Caine plays a kind of angel who shows Belush how life would have been as if he "made it". Jim is at best with a good story and supporting role; looks like real chemistry between him and Hamilton. Not an Oscar contender, but good, warm-hearted fun.
