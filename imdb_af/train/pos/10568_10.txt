I loved this movie, seen tonight on a big screen in the kiosk! The audience listened aloud to many interesting things, and the quick pace was pleasant. <br /> <br /> As a singer and musical director, I do a portion of Roby Keeler's voice in "By a Waterfall." which does not match the somewhat tinny higher twitter voice she used in all her other fever. <br /> <br /> Does anyone know if this is superfluous by another singer? That sounds like this to me. I would like to know. <br /> <br /> Thank you very much.
