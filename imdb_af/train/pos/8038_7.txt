Two snipers travel deep into the jungles in search of their targets; a clever South American drug lover and a prominent general. <br /> <br /> Quite successful in building a sprawling atmosphere, Sniper is a very solid thriller in most accounts, it's time to establish its characters and their fate and climax in some good action series . Director Llosa is not always successful in maintaining the gloomy mood and could make the story somewhat stricter; some detours do not add up too much. But this movie is much better than its Stallone / Stone travesty The Specialist. <br /> <br /> Billy Zane, usually incredibly tiring, does surprisingly well as the inexperienced Sniper worked with veteran Berenger. As for Berenger, this film was his last good big budget Hollywood business. He can do these kinds of roles in his sleep and he is very convincing here, repeating the roll twice directly after DVD successors.
