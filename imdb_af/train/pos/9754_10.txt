This Raggedy Ann and Andy Movie are so beautiful. We love watching Ann and Andy sing and dance, with the camel with the wrinkled knees. This movie is what made the Camel with the Wrinkled Knees so popular, singing his song, "I'm nobodies I Love You". If you love Raggedy Ann and Andy Watch the movie and you will see why it is a movie the kids love and adults!
