I watched it over Christmas, I don't know why, but it reminds me of Christmas, so I watched it, so there we are. <br /> <br /> Arthur is a film that I see with a big dumb smile on my face all along and it is a mix of special performances, great music and a script that is cut with white and charm cause it. <br /> <br /> Dudley Moore makes a character that can be easily hated (spoiled, rich, lazy and sorry for himself), but transforms him into someone you love. Liza Minelli is wonderful as Linda Morolla, a queen waitress who manages to pull the tough / soft inside of the lady, gives Arthur almost his world. John Gielgud gets all the juicy lines and brushes them off with care. <br /> <br /> I can watch Arthur time and time again and it always makes me feel good, check it out if you need an elevator, it's a beautiful movie.
