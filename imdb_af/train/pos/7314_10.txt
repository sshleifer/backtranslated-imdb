The first time I saw this movie, I fell in love with it. The atmosphere was what caught my attention in the first place. I was expecting a great party, but had to look a lot of intelligent killer junk with my head to a cold soundtrack (it's actually calling me right now: P). The fact that I couldn't predict when he killed and when he disappeared was a big plus in my book. Predictable horror movies carry me. Now I know the storyline had some deviations, but if you are like me, you will only see them for a long time after the movie and you lie in bed, because you just saw a masterpiece in motion . Finally, as I mentioned, the soundtrack is timeless. This is one of my favorite plays of all time, so I was delighted to hear that Rob Zombie left it untouched in his remake. With the repetition I read a very comprehensive article about it and now I know that Mr. Zombie respects John Carpenter, I have great hope for his actions on this classic. This movie is great for any time you crave a backbone, but it's the perfect addition, opener, finale, call it an All Hallow's Eve movie marathon. :)
