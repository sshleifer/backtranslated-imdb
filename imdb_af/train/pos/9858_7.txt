I will not go as far as not recommending this movie, as the only issues I have experienced with it are due to an excessive exposure to the plot apparatus used in the movie. It doesn't make it bad, just not something I've gone far. <br /> <br /> It's a bit of saccharin, so I can say for the most part that anyone looking for something with a little more white could be disappointed in a natural for-kids movie like this. <br /> <br /> But all this goes out of the window when the squirrel (the one in all the trailers) appears on the screen. His time is limited, but it seems clear that the decision-makers have had the wisdom to tell these guys' hats, can you keep a little more squirrel? 'Every time it becomes unbearable. It doesn't save the movie, but you can say, "There was at least one aspect I couldn't stop laughing at." <br /> <br /> And of course it won't visually disappoint, but it's almost a given with Pixar flicks. Of all their stuff, I want to put it under control ... but it is not in itself bad.
