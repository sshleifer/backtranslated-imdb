Some of the acting was a bit suspicious. I remember Alexander Walker (Evening Standard critic, yes, OK, is now dead) in a rant over this movie. It was a disgrace that NI Protestants portray as murderers. Now for all NI protesters, this film was loosely based on the Shankill Butchers (who were loyalists) and who flocked in Belfast in the 1970s. Believe me, they are not called butchers for nothing. My head groaning over this movie is that it shows no ray of light or hope, it's all punishment and bleak, I mean, the girl has to die in the end. Maybe it sounds skinny, but it may have taken the beat that not all Prods & tiags are bad or quite good either.
