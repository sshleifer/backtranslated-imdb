"No one." There is nothing in room 237. But you don't have a business. "Anyway, stay out. You understand, stay out." <br /> <br /> There has never been such a degree of psychological horror as this movie has achieved. This is the highest rated horror movie of all and rightly so. Jack Nich Olson is an excellent actor and it is one of the best performances in the theater. <br /> <br /> It's about a family leaving for a remote and abandoned hotel in 5 months. Then the father (Jack) is almost in possession of the horrors in the hotel. <br /> <br /> Kubricks direction is nothing short of perfect, then perfect. The tense detection shots, agonizing music, mystical messages and confusing plot make it the best horror movie ever made. <br /> <br /> Throughout the movie there are constant references to danger, death and horror. Red is used in EVERY scene. Is the Red Intentionally Introduced by Kubrick? Of course! <br /> <br /> It's a definite Kubrick classic and that's the third of its films I've given 10/10. He's a perfectionist in his direction and you can see it in all his movies. He likes to confuse his viewers in each of his films. <br /> <br /> I'll be talking about this movie the next few months. It has infinite depth. <br /> <br /> Finally, this is the cornerstone of horror and tension. A masterpiece of terror 10/10
