In terms of visual beauty, this movie is outstanding! I had no idea that Technicolor came out so early. Although I didn't like the end, the whole movie is fantastic and I wish I was in North Africa. The film is excellent and Marlene Dietrich is a big plus and of course she is so enticing and I just loved her in this movie. Basil Rathbone is also perfect in this movie. I couldn't get over the landscape and the sets. The hotel, the palm trees, the desert, it's all there ... the legions also bring a Beau Gesture to the movie. They definitely don't make any more movies like this. Don't neglect to watch these classics!
