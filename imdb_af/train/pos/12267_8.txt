Tintin was one of my favorite heroes as a child. Every time I borrowed the books from the school library. My favorite was "The Red Sea Sharks" - so much action and humor. <br /> <br /> This documentary was a brilliant exposition of the background story of Herge and his Tintin development. The filmmaker's personal experience in interviewing Herge and the story of his relationship with the artist who inspired the Chan character were moving a lot. <br /> <br /> A great documentary of a talented and beloved artist. A good example of someone who has become internationally renowned and has brought joy to millions of children (and the youth of heart) all over the world.
