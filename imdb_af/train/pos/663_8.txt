I watched this episode more often than any other TFTC episode, it's so nice. And it's pretty scary, but all in good, evil fun. A woman kills her second husband, but runs into a problem when an escaped maniac in a worn Santa Claus outfit decides to visit her and her little girl at that moment. Mary Traynor, who I remember from SNL or another TV comedy shooter, is the evil woman, and Larry Drake plays the crazy in the dingy Santa outfit. I forgot Santa was played by Drake over the years. His Santa is an unstoppable force and sometimes frightening. You can probably guess how Santa finally gets in the house. The episode is played for the laugh, but it can also be very intense.
