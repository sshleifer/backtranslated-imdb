British newspaper reports seem to be focused on the fact that the judges tend to know Toby Young, the journalist whose real life is experiencing this movie. The keyword here is "based". How to lose friends is a fictional romcom. <br /> <br /> Sidney Young joins a sought-after gossip in New York, where he continues to make gaffe before finally making it. This involves selling him out, and the film has some serious points to make about journalistic integrity. However, they are not overdoing: the main fabric remains a comedy centered around Sidney's misadventures. The script has its cake and eats it in the sense that Sidney is a stupid, well-meaning buffoon while being a clever, moderately unpleasant writer. This contradiction is never so much of a problem, because Simon Pegg (as Sidney) is projecting equality too well. <br /> <br /> Jeff Bridges subscribes to Sidney's editor a bit too effectively and Kirsten Dunst is quite anonymous as the contradictory ultimate object of Sidney's affections And, regarding Megan Fox (who plays an airhead bimbo starlet), I can only say that, just say the word, Mrs Fox, and I will leave my wife, sell all my belongings, and buy myself a plane ticket to take my place at your side as your peace of mind. Of course, as I am a fat 56-year-old English accountant, you won't find my presentation too tempting, but it's on the table anyway. Given how short her career has been so far, one might think it's too soon for Megan Fox to play a role that relentlessly looks like the kind of actress she's supposed to be. But she does it well, with some skill, and very sexy. This girl goes far. <br /> <br /> There is solid support from a variety of seasoned performers - United States Miriam Margolyes and Bill Paterson, Gillian Anderson and USA Danny Huston. <br /> <br /> There are some laugh-out loud moments, and I laughed most of the way. As ever, the F-word performs when it really doesn't need to, although at least some of these are very funny.
