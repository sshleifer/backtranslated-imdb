My first child was born the year this program came out, and I played the record album for the boys every Christmas. When the CD came out, I bought about 10 copies and gave it to friends and relatives when their families started ... it always becomes their favorite Christmas album. I recently found several DVDs (made on DVD-R of video tapes, probably) for sale on eBay. The one I bought was an excellent copy, and it was so nice to see the show again after more than 25 years. There are some songs on the show that were not on the album, and some of the songs on the album were studio versions of the same songs on the show. But both the CD and DVD stay in our library as the best Christmas entertainment.
