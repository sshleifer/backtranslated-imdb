This movie played an interesting role, and the mat didn't throw a list, but the actors in this movie did a good job. I'm glad we have b grade movies like this one, the story is basically the actors are basic and so is the way they do it, you don't need a million dollar budget to make a movie, just a mixture of b-list ordinary actors and a basic plot. I like the way they had the street for themselves and that there was no one else and what I was interesting about was that they didn't close a cafe to put tools in and that they were all about it. police station. Arnold Vosloo and Michael Madsen did a good job of depicting roles in the hostage situation. It was a good movie and I hope to see it in the near future.
