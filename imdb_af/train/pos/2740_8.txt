Great black and white night cinematography, and much of it, highlights this so-called real life account of a 1950's killing in Kansas where a whole family was wiped out by two men. <br /> <br /> The story was written by Truman Capote so you get the end of the movie the very liberal anti-death message. It is ridiculous to know the facts of this matter. Robert Blake and Scott Wilson play the two atheist losers who twisted their way of life and murdered this beautiful family unnecessarily. <br /> <br /> Despite the annoying slope at the end, it's a sounding story from the beginning and cinematography makes it even more fascinating. Well-known photographer Conrad Hall has done a fantastic job here. It allows me to make more modern films in black and white. See it on DVD. <br /> <br /> Blake, Wilson, John Forsythe, Jeff Corey and the whole supporting movie are great here. My third viewing of this film, in early April 2005, shortly after Blake was in real life, pronounced innocent in his wife's murder trial. One can't help but look at Blake and this movie differently afterwards.
