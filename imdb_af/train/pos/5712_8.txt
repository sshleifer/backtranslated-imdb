It's an irresistible big cheerful and technically great movie! <br /> <br /> The movie contains some of the best pieces you'll ever see in a 30-movie, even though it's clear that it's sets rather than real-life. Often, if a character were to fall or a doorpost would be too aggressive, the whole set would of course move. <br /> <br /> The best moments of the movie were the quiet, more old-fashioned, slapstick kind of moments. It shows that René Clair's true heart was on silent movies. The overall humor is really good in this movie. Of course, the musical moments were more than great. It is a very pleasant light and simple pleasant early French musical. Although the best moments are the quiet moments, it doesn't mean that the movie is not filled with good humorous dialogue. It is very well done by the main actors, who all seem to me to be plays, which worked a lot in this case. Well for the movie is its overall style and pleasant atmosphere. No wonder it worked out so well, as this movie is actually based on the play by Georges Berr. <br /> <br /> It's a technical, very good movie, with some fantastic innovation camera work in it and some very good editing, which makes a few quick moves and enjoyable sequencing to watch. There is never a dull moment in this movie! <br /> <br /> René Clair was such a smart director, who knew how to build and plan comic moments in movies. It's a very creative film that, in spite of its simplicity, still feels like an original and cleverly crafted film, which never grabs entertainment. <br /> <br /> The last half hour is especially unforgettable fun without spoiling. Too much, and is really one of the biggest, as well as the most creative moments in the early comedy film-making. <br /> <br /> The movie is filled with some very pleasant characters, all of which are very stereotypical and stupid and obviously thrown out because of their appearance. All of this adds to the pleasant light comic atmosphere and crap of the movie. <br /> <br /> One of the best movies you'll ever see! <br /> <br /> 8/10
