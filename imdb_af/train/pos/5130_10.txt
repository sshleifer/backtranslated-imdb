... may seem like an over-statement, but it's not. <br /> <br /> So hard to understand - why didn't they make musical shorts like this any more? Wasn't its beauty quite clear to everyone involved? I do not think so. So many shorts are made only for commercial reasons, and with any luck there may be some artistic value there. This is an exception - the only one? - where it turned out the director had a vision and clearly appreciated the music as art. Why didn't anyone ever think of shooting Lester or Charlie Parker on a live date? Crazy man. <br /> <br /> Sorry, there were no successors. If you've seen something of a similar quality, please share it!
