If you like "Othello", you will love this movie because half of the movie is about the stage production of the play. <br /> <br /> The movie plays a major role with Signe Hasso and Shelley Winters as the women in Colman's life while Edmond O'Brien plays the enterprising press agency. <br /> <br /> Some of the supporting players I especially liked were Millard Mitchell as the grizzled reporter who gets a corner and Joe Sawyer, the 1940s answer to Drew Carey, the policeman on the matter. <br /> <br /> Great raw moments in this one with noir realism throughout.
