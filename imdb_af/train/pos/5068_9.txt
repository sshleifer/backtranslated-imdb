This film is a wonderful movie based on the life of a man, Gray Owl, in the 1930s. I found it to be similarly sound and sad as 'Rudy' and 'Awakenings'. It comes late in the Golden Owl's life and follows him through his most turbulent and influential era. <br /> <br /> The film is about a Canadian Indian staircase that finds it fears the concern of the over-crowded Beaver. He also predicts the decline in natural land and the over-exploitation of Earth's resources. It was an outrageous concept in the 1930s and received surprisingly well. He becomes a well-known speaker and the masses are ready to listen. <br /> <br /> Pierce Brosnan's casting looks rather strange, but not shameful. Anyone who wants to argue that point must first see the movie to understand. Brosnan offers a great show like Annie Galipeau. Galipeau is a strong actress whose place next to Brosnan is refreshingly natural compared to the forced couples in recent Bond films. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone interested in good drama, beautiful scenery or environmental issues. It's also a movie for families, but children under 10 (depending on maturity) will struggle to follow the plot.
