Soldier may not have academic action or Lucas special effects, but it certainly does. I won't tell you what it's about. I'm sure you've read the summary. This is a great doomed future action / science fiction movie. Kurt Russell doesn't say much, he usually has a crook or thunder on his face, but it suits the character. There are great action and fighting scenes; Some of the scenes are unrealistic, but it is Hollywood that believes we must escape our normal lives. I didn't see Soldier 2, but this one is one of my favorites. I'm lucky enough to have a woman digging on old movies; We both love this movie and recommend it to anyone who likes strong man / sci-fi movies.
