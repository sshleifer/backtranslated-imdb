Two wizards fight in the fourth dimension, one (Brian Thompson as a Cabal) trying to destroy the Earth, the other (Jeffrey Combs and Anton Mordrid) to save it. "Doctor Mordrid" is a pleasant fantasy money that has lots of cheese. The plot is pretty stupid and the gore is completely absent, but the film is very short and entertaining. So if you have enough time to kill, give this one a look. My rating: 7 out of 10.
