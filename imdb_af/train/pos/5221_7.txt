I didn't have too much interest in taking The Flock.Andrew Lau. However, the masterpiece trilogy of Infernal Affairs was fired from the Flock and replaced by an emergency director named Niels Mueller. I had the feeling that Lau made a good film, but it did not satisfy the study, and they fired him and appointed another director. It usually doesn't work well (let's remember the Invasion). But the herd got better than I expected. It's not a big movie, but it's an interesting and entertaining thriller. The character development is very well done and I can know the characters very well. Also, the relationship between the two main characters is natural and credible. Richard Gere and Claire Danes perform well. Now, let's go to the negative points. One element that really pests me (there was a moment in which it irritated me) was the excess of spending tricks to give the movie more "attitude" and style. These tricks feel out of place and d their presence is arbitrary. Plus, I think the movie should have been more ambitious. Despite that, I recommend the herd as a good excitement. It is not unforgettable, but it is entertaining.
