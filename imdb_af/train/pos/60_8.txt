"Home Room" such as "Zero Day" and "Elephant" were inspired by the recent wave of school shooting. But unlike the other two movies, "Home Room" focuses on two survivors (not the shooters or those killed) in the wake of a shooting. This makes it less exploitation and more useful because little effort is being made to ask questions for which there are no answers. <br /> <br /> Don't give the first 20 minutes of this little movie, it's supposed to set The real story is up, but play like a rejected "Hill Street Blues" section. It is lame but carries it, at least it's the length of hard enough to get the movie as a feature. I recommend hitting it completely and just jumping to the hospital scene. There's nothing here that you can't pick from the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Like many good little movies, it was creatively a one-man show like Paul F. Ryan was the author and director. While this arrangement does not guarantee a good movie, it is usually a good sign because it will mean a certain unity of construction and execution, often lacking in major budgetary features. Because the writing of the "Home Room" is its true strength, it is fortunate that the author also performed the production and ensured that his vision made it on the screen. <br /> <br /> Ryan is taking a great chance at the end, testing the limits of the average viewer's sentimentality tolerance. He runs it to the edge, but at all logic lets you cry instead of cringing. Why the end work is a combination of audience needs for a reward at the end of this kind of journey, the song (Sarah McLaughlin's "Sweet Surrender") he goes out and the wonderful editing of the final minute. <Br /> <br /> The other strength of the film is the decisive occupation of Busy Phillips (Alicia) and Erika Christensen (Deanna) as lead actors. Although Phillips plays her standard estranged surly teenager and Christensen's intelligent daughter of a good family, they both bring more intensity to their roles than ever before. The family life of both girls is more than satisfactory and of little interest to Ryan. What's happening here is all about the two of them, despite a low side story about a police detective wondering about trying the town to tie Alicia to the one-time shooter. If they ever cut and cut the film again, this side story needs to be condensed. <br /> <br /> A story about two very diverse girls who bind and help each other is almost a new idea and Ryan could have managed this movie easily. in clich√© and predictability. But instead, his screenplay puts them in a fascinating and convincing sparring game that slowly breaks loose and shares moments of vulnerability just to retreat back into themselves. Deanna's "I die inside" line breaks you apart - I can't think for a moment in any other movie I feel as intense as that one. She desperately needs a bond that Alicia just desperately resists. Deanna only makes progress when she returns. The viewer still expects the group button that never looks. <br /> <br /> Eventually, it not only creates excitement, but lets you admire the characters as well as the two actresses they bring to life. <br /> <br /> Then again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
