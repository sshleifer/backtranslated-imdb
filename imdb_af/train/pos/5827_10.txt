This three stooges flick is in line with my other favorite movie "Disorder in the Court". It's a thrill of laughter for any three-Stooges fan to enjoy. <br /> <br /> The boys are anchors at a recording studio when they hear the lovely Christine McIntyre sing a good version of "Voices of Spring". She will be offered a record deal, but she is scarce to be honest with her father about her choice of career and to prove herself as a true singer. When she and the others leave the studio, the stooges decide to have some fun and play her record and curly up as Christine. The contract lady who can make Christine's career sees Krullerig and misses him for Christine and invites Curly to sing for her. Of course there is a man who upset them at the party and they destroy his solo in front of the crowd, so he will find a way to get back. <br /> <br /> What a wonderful Stooge flick, it should not be missed! <br /> <br /> 10/10
