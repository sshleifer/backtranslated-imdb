Director Sidney Lumet has made some masterpieces, such as Network, Dog Day Afternoon or Serpico. But he didn't have too much luck on his most recent works. Gloria (1999) was pathetic and found me guilty was an interesting but failed experiment. Now, Lumet brings his best movie into decades and, in my opinion, a true masterpiece: Before the devil you know you're dead. I think this movie is like a rebirth for Lumet. This movie has an excellent story that has deep, very low. Also, I think the end of the movie is perfect. The performances are brilliant. Philip Seymour Hoffman, as usual, brings a great performance and is undoubtedly one of the best actors of our day. is also an excellent actor, but he is underestimated by my point of view. The performance here is wonderful. The rest of the cast is also excellent (especially the great Albert Finney), but these two actors bring monumental performances that are unfortunately ignored by the pathetic Oscars. , in part, thanks to the brilliant script. Before the devil knows you are dead, a true masterpiece with perfect direction, a great screenplay and excellent performances. We need more movies like this.
