Love is overwhelming ... In everything it is manifestations ... Beautiful, absolutely beautiful ... Tudor Chirila, Maria Popistasu and Ioana Barbu, a truly dramatic story of love in all its forms, a story about the unspeakable ways of young hearts, about life and lost innocence all directed by Tudor Giurgiu's skilful eye. With a wonderful soundtrack with Faultline & Chris Martin and Vama Veche, it surprises in every way to leave the sour taste of misunderstanding love ...................... Is it me or is Roem Ense movie art slowly but surely promoting and respecting? It's a brilliant movie ... Two thumbs to everyone involved.
