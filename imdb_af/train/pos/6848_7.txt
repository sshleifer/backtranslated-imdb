A very silly movie, starting with a soft porn series, ventures into the art gallery, adding a shocker to a discovery in the hotel room and suggesting a random murder. No clear reason. <br /> <br /> What follows is bizarre and surreal (especially the stopwatch scene is beautifully unnecessary), resulting in an exciting "spinning" end that is as clear as it is unfair on the viewer ( see the trivia section for exactly why it's deliberately unfair). <br /> <br /> The movie goes out of its way to offend as many groups as possible - transsexual, the madman, and the wonderful "Huggie Bear" style racetrack on the subway - and treat the viewer as follows. an idiot in the end tones, as characters explain endlessly in detail and over and over what just happened in the movie. Although the background female characters in the restaurant scene at the end are a joy to watch. <br /> <br /> In fact, the whole movie is a joy to watch: Despite its many, many flaws, the whole package has worked well, well.
