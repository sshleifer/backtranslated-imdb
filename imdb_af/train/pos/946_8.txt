As the celebration of Christmas has evolved over the years, or one focuses on religious or secular traditions, it is a time when people are supposed to behave a little better toward each other. It slipped in one way or another at Ebenezer Scrooge, dealer and money lender in London in the 19th century. <br /> <br /> Like his cousin shows his uncle, he doesn't like Christmas in any way, because Scrooge feels the whole thing is humbug. Humanity in Scrooge has long been driven away, he is a hard case, much like his 20th-century counterpart, Mr. Potter of Bedford Falls, New York. <br /> <br /> But as Charles Dickens told this story, salvation is not too late for any of us, and a lonely ghost and three spirits visit Scrooge and show him how. <br /> <br /> A Christmas Carol is such a timeless holiday classic that we sometimes forget that it was so much social commentary from the 19th century Britain was as Oliver Twist. The characters in this movie are middle and lower class. The Cratchits are a few tracks above the street people in Oliver Twist, but they have to struggle to stay there. Yet love and happiness keep their house out, no thank you to the man for whom Bob Cratchit works. <br /> <br /> Like George Bailey, who did very well in his life and just had to remember how much, Ebenezer Scrooge needed a wake up call about the potential he still had to do it well . old world. <br /> <br /> Patrick Stewart in his lively performances and filmed play has almost taken over from Scrooge. But George C. Scott captures the old misery in this movie. The meanness of him, but with a trace of sadness that makes us root for change. Scott joins a good tradition of people like Reginald Owen and Alastair Sim, who both did good interpretations of Scrooge. <br /> <br /> Among the supporting roles, I especially like David Warner as Bob Cratchit and Edward Woodward as a warm and strict Christmas spirit. <br /> <br /> According to IMDb, it's one of 32 versions of A Christmas Carol that made them archive and that's one of the best.
