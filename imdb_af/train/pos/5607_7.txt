Once I looked at the tenant and interpreted it as a horror movie. It uses many of the genres of the genre: the sinister apartment, suspicious neighbors, appearances, mysteries, hallucinations. The life of the hero, Trelkovsky, surrounded by bad, secret powers that chose him. <br /> <br /> The last time I looked at it, I challenged this initial interpretation. If this movie is a horror movie, it's just horror in the sense that a Kafka novel is horror. In fact, this film can literally be understood as a lonely man who becomes slow, without any external influence. <br /> <br /> In his career, Polanski made three films that are of insanity: Repulsion, which I do not do particularly because the development of madness in the heroine never convinced me; Rosemary's Baby, in which the heroine is upset by evil forces; and the tenant, who can be the best paranoia study ever in cinema. <br /> <br /> Trelkovsky is a young man renting an apartment in which a woman killed herself. He becomes obsessive with her and begins to grow slowly: he wears her clothes, makes makeup, talks like her. But is he possessed by a spirit, or does he just get his wild imagination the best of him? It is this hesitation between what is real and imaginary, and what Polanski never solves, it makes this such a fascinating film. Many events in the movie can be as easily attributed to the supernatural as it can be for normal causes, and it is up to the viewer to decide what to believe. <br /> <br /> Although not my favorite Polanski movie, it is nevertheless a good example of its ability to create tension and in many convincing terms portray madness. And technically, it's also a miracle. He has enough to work with film composer Philippe Sarde and the legendary director of photography Sven Nykvist (Bergman's DP) in making this movie. A slow pacing and sometimes uninteresting segments can make this movie difficult to enjoy, yet it is an experience.
