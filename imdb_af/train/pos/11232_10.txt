Okay, so the first few seasons took a while to fetch the special effects, but from the beginning Hidden Frontier consistently gave good story lines and performances. They have always been prepared to make mistakes they made. They advise people to see new episodes first so they can see how well the show is, and understand how much it has changed since the first episodes. The movie has a fantastic comrade and it is displayed on the screen. <br /> <br /> The influx of gas actors that make their show on the show and also testify to the performers, as the story lines go from strength to strength. The show has suffered barriers with its various story lines - depression, drug addiction and mainstream homosexuality - and it may have sworn a few people wrong, but that's where Star Trek goes and has everything left. It depicts the story lines in a smart and emotional way, which treats them subtly and smoothly. <br /> <br /> Yes, they used some characters from Trek history, but they did their justice. Characters such as Shelby, Lefler and Necheyev, who stayed in the show, had a rebirth in the New Frontier books, but they lost their face after a while, when Peter David more than a wild fantasy versus serious science films , and HF shows the characters in a completely different light, which they serve better. <br /> <br /> The site also enables fans to communicate with classrooms and forums and they can get to know the people involved. They release free episodes for every episode, so the fans can see how a laugh they have, because they are doing people in their spare time, with a dedication that will make many professional actors widely shocked! <br /> <br /> What this series, which now draws about 7 years on such a limited amount of resources, is nothing but wonderful - bringing people together and inspiring others to do the same . HF will live long after it ends, as long as people still get the reason it started in the first place.
