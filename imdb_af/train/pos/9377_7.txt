A surprise thriller with more turns and double crosses as a doodle path. A good throw mixes it with an intriguing plot dominated by a Twin Peaks-ish influence in director Dahl. Nicholas Cage is a very underrated actor and shows a great representation of a man in a band looking for the right thing. J.T. Walsh (RIP for a good actor) is always a great villain, like Dennis Hopper. It's so sorry he never made a higher profile in the biz. I'm sure he has his followers. Overall, it's a good movie that shows you don't need an entertaining movie.
