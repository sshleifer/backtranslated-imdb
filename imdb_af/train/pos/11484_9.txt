I just came back from the Montreal premiere of Zero Day ... and I'm so surprised to find a negative comment about the movie. Actually, the debt to Coccio is to make an easy and survived social message. Well, sir, I'm an adjudicator, it's an easy and playful critic of films with a social complaint. <br /> <br /> Not that I want to expose my life here, but I come from a small town with a similar school to these guys. Reject and ignore the menu. Thing is ... I understand how young children can be driven to do such an abomination. High schools have become fields of conflict. It's a real ugly sight. You must fight your way to be like the others. It is difficult to explain, but many people do not realize that high schools become cemeteries of human intelligence. Meanwhile, parents close their eyes and smile about how their lives in their comfortable suburb are perfect. <br /> <br /> The real motif of the movie is not about what they manage. It's about this deadly calm suburb and everyone closes their eyes and tries to create this atmosphere of a perfect town. Cal said it well. It's a wake up call. Drama is everywhere and it can take any form. In that case, small plays (like Andre is called wearing a J.C Penny shirt) form the worse nightmare of a whole town. André & Cal have the extreme way to express their pain. The malaise of inconsistency in an era where you need more than ever to be like the other to be accepted. <br /> <br /> I especially like the last scenes where some guys burn the crosses of André & Cal, as if With the pain they communicated, Cal & Andre conveyed their blind rage to their community, refusing to to think about the causes of some acts. <br /> <br /> It may seem aggressive like a movie, but Coccio meditates more than groaning or explaining. What André & Cal live is a reality ... and a scary one that other kids can get. <br /> <br /> Disturbing movie ... Making home and feeling strong Ben Coccio is making a very disturbing movie.
