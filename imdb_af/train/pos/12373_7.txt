Time was not so good for this movie. One time controversial adaptation of Jeffrey Konvitz's bestseller, this movie looks just like a regular mainstream version of your typical ghost party. Terrible touch (especially the crazy, top-up) is essentially a shining horror movie for the people who don't give much to the genre. It has an extraordinary role in small roles (Jose Ferrer, Ava Gardner, Eli Wallach, Burgess Meredith, Christopher Walken and many others), but something tells me that producers wanted such an expensive role to convince the audience that not your average lowbrow movie (producers of '70s disaster movies had a similar idea). I liked seeing the familiar faces, but the story is very stupid. And how high the class pretends to be, it works at the level of your average 70-year-old movie (not a bad thing). Still, it's a pleasant movie, especially for the viewers who love stargazing. As usual, Albert Matlock's carpet is excellent. Overall, nice entertaining.
