Meryl Streep was incredible in this movie. She has an incredible talent for accents, and she shows incredible skill in this movie in general. I really felt for her when Lindy was prosecuted. She was also played realistically. She became cranky, upset and unpleasant because the media and government continued their relentless witch hunt. At first I didn't expect much from the movie, but I was really interested in it, and the movie is based on a real person and real events. It was better than I expected. Sam Neill was also outstanding; This is the best work I have ever seen of him, and I liked him very much in other movies (for example, the Piano). I gave the film a 7, but if I could only evaluate the acting, I give it a 9.5, and a perfect 10 for Stripe.
