Initially, it looks like a boring comedy like The Odd Couple, but when I got there, it was a very funny movie. Especially forgetful ex-comedians Willy Clark (Golden Globe winner and Oscar and BAFTA nominated Walter Matthau) and Al Lewis (Oscar win and Golden Glove nominee George Burns) were a great comedy duo and a return to leave their hospital sketch revived. for a TV show. Willy's cousin, Ben Clark (Golden Globe winner Richard Benjamin) is confident that they can come back with no hard feelings to each other, how wrong he is. They can not always be quite touched, they are forgetful, especially during conversation, but it does. Also read Lee Meredith as Nurse in Sketch (Miss McIntosh), Carol DeLuise as Mrs. Doris Green, Al's daughter, Rosetta LeNoire as Odessa, Willy's nurse and Muppets from Space's F. Murray Abraham as Mechanical. I think the best rule of the movie is Burns, which mentions that Matthau called him a boy of a bitch bastard. This is nominated for the Best Art Direction-Set Decoration and Best Writing Oscars, Screenplay adapted from other material, the BAFTA for Best Scripts has been nominated. It won the Golden Globe Best Motion Picture - Musical / Comedy. It was nominated for Best Screenplay. Very good!
