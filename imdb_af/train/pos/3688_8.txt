Delightful movie directed by some of the best directors in the industry today. <br /> <br /> My favorite segments: <br /> <br /> 14th arrondissement: Carol (Margo Martindale). The film also plays some of the great actors of our time, not just from France, but from everywhere. , from Denver, come to Paris to learn French and also make a sense of her life. <br /> <br /> Montmartre: There probably wasn't a better way to start this movie than with this segment of romantic Paris. br /> <br /> Loin du 16ème: a picture of Paris of which we are better aware of the riots in the Cités. Ana (Catalina Sandino Moreno) spends more time caring for someone else's child (she's a nanny) than her own. <br /> <br /> Quartier Latin: So much fun to see Gerard Depardieu as the "tenancier de bar". with Gena Rowlands and Ben Gazzara, who discuss their divorce. <br /> <br /> Tour Eiffel: Don't tell me you didn't like that mime! <br /> <br /> Tuileries: a little to see Steve. Buscemi as the tourist who makes a high contact (a no-no) with a Metro girl. <br /> <br /> Parc Monceau: Nick Nolte is wonderful. Ludivine Sagnier too. <br /> <br /> I spent 3 days in Paris in 2004 and this movie allows me to go back! <br /> <br /> See on Verdi in Barcelona (another big city) on March 18, 2007. <br /> <br /> 84/100 (***)
