Thought about me for days after I saw it. This to me is the sign of a big movie. Eyes Wide Shut had the same effect on me. I'm tired of these people ending these happy Hollywood cookie cutters. I plan to see it tonight again to understand the plot a little better - but regardless of the emotional messages of the movie was completely felt.
