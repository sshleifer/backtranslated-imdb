As a horse lover, you can only appreciate this movie. There are few movies showing horsemanship like this one does. I would like to know if Brian does his own ride in the movie. Would also like to know if he enjoys horses. Brian is in many movies where he drove. Where did he learn to drive? The only part that is difficult to take is that the trails always tilt completely, as a horse can run full of steam forever. The camera work is first time and the horses are caught in a way that shows how dangerous things can be on top of a horse. It would be very interesting to know how they went to throw this movie to find all the very good horse riders.
