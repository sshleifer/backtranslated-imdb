After watching this movie, I feel I know a little more about the US. David Lynch is synonymous with shock value and strange to be strange, and indeed these elements are not missing from The Straight Story. However, it's in a light I haven't seen from Lynch before. We start with a simple family living a quiet life, but ending with a variety of absurdly interesting characters with depth in their lives that cannot be clear from their introduction. Particularly moving was the bar scene with two World War II veterans, who discussed the events of fifty years ago and how it still influenced their current lives and emotions. If you are looking for Wild at Dune, you shouldn't look here. But if you're looking for real people with real stories, it's the movie for you.
