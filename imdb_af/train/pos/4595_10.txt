Jackie Chan's name is synonymous with stunts. This movie never leaves you. The first best play and the last movie of the pole is as risky as one wonder if he knows the meaning of fear. This film comes very close to Jackie's best that PROJECT A. is. But the main difference is that PROJECT A contains three stars where Jackie wears the film completely on his shoulders. This is perhaps the main reason that this movie Jackie made a greatest martial artist, followed by Bruce Lee. The movie also has a nice comic touch. What makes this film work is Jakie's ability to show his respectable side, which she has contracted on the typical martial arts action hero. This movie was followed by a successor who was good but was fairly soft compared to his predecessor.
