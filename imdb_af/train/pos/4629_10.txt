My dad was the custodian of the prison (he is now retired) who appeared in this documentary version and I grew up around prison life. Perhaps my view will be completely different from anyone watching this movie. I will say, the filmmakers we brought this 93-minute miracle are fantastic artists and even better people. They were brave enough to show A and tell this story. B) Within these prisoners get thoughts and hearts, and C) do it all responsible. Responsible for their art and, more importantly, responsible for the prisoners and staff of Luther Luckett Correctional Complex. They must be praised for this work without end. To take 170 hours, yes hours, of footage and to cut and cut it to 93 sounds minutes, is nothing short of extraordinary and they have my utmost respect. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie under circumstances that only saw very, very little. I was at the inmate investigation. I was in the same room with these men watching their hearts pour on the screen. I saw men crying on television and crying in the chair in front of me and let me tell you, it was a very profound experience. These men have committed terrible crimes in some cases, but have found ways to save themselves, even though they consider themselves inseparable. How many of us have the courage to do so? How many people can do what they did in such a difficult environment? To see them respond to the movie was an experience I am forever grateful for, and I will never forget it. I thank the men who allowed me this look into their lives, and I thank my father for the possibility of all these things, and I thank Philomath Films for the time to throw their blood, sweat, soul and tears into this project. /> <br /> This movie will change everything you think you know about prison life and the prisoners held in it. "Oz" is not real, television is not really. 'Shakespeare Behind Bars' is.
