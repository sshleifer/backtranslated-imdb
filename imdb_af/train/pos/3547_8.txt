Entertaining music where Nathan Detroit needs $ 1,000.00 to stand up to a floating crap game, so he raises Sky Masterson to try and get a redemption force, Jean Simmons played to go to Havana with Masterson. <br /> <br /> 5 years later, Simmons will be in the missionary again in the fabulous Elmer Gantry. There was his sister Sharon and here is his sister Sarah. Same temperament, different story. <br /> <br /> Frank Sinatra is that devil Nathan Detroit. He has been with Vivian Blaine for 14 years. She left his gambling habit. <br /> <br /> In a real change of pace, Sky Masterson was played by Marlon Brando who actually did his own song here! <Br /> <br /> The movie is saved by superior choreography. The dance and singing routines are fantastic. They are made especially by Stubby Kaye as beautiful (Johnson). <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a very good production.
