Come on people. This movie is better than 4. I can see it ... rich people have done crazy things like that. And it was funny. <br /> <br /> I watch a comedy being entertained, escaping from the pressures of the world for a while, and taking nothing too seriously. This movie fits in perfectly with that purpose. I judge a movie on its own merits and will not compare surviving Christmas with Blazing Saddles. I watched as totally dysfunctional people grow in caring, similar individuals who could easily live in the street from home. It will stay on my list of "favorite ..... must look for the holiday season". If you just want to enjoy 90 minutes, watch this one.
