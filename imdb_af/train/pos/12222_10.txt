I thought this movie was a wonderful film, it made me confused and my cousin looked at me. In fact, I think younger Kevin Dillon was hot. Hahahaha. But I also thought the girl was stupid to go with the policeman and it was wrong what he said before her death: "I was inside you." I think that's what she gets to do what she did to him and how will he tell her she's too young when he never cares? how old were the other girls? Now I don't think I can ever trust such a policeman myself. But to tell the truth, it was pretty obvious, he was, even though he wanted to become a policeman, I would still be suspicious. from him or way.and it was funny when she sprayed him in the eyes of the shop. Hahahahaha.she was still stupid to go through herself in the warehouse again and so was the police who died HELLO !! it is called backup. Sometimes these movies make me angry when people do foolishly and do stupid things. But that's what I think a thought about the movie.
