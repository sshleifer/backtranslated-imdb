This movie is by far the cutest thing I've seen long ago! Wonderful animation and adorable characters (even the bad guys were cute!) Made this one a total winner in my book and also in the books of those I saw. I still want to see it but didn't have time. Better than Toy Story, which was also good, but not good.
