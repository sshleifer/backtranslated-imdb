I called my heart and looked at this movie. I have never suffered from an eating disorder, but I think it should be a very real picture. <br /> <br /> Alison Lohman is great! She expresses these feelings extremely well. My teenage years came to me so vividly. Anyone who has gone through a difficult time as a child or teenager can relate to this movie. I recommend you all to see it! <br /> <br /> The music is also wonderful. I discovered Diana Lorden now. <br /> <br /> I also look forward to seeing Alison Lohman in White. Ol√©ander, because I am positive, she is perfectly suited to the role of Agnes.
