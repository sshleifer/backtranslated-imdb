After watching this movie for the third time, I think it's almost Adam's worst movie. PUNCH DRUNK LOVE IS VERY COMPARED TO THAT I HAVE TO FIND AT THE END When Dickie is thrown off the boat, it's so funny (the hair is different from she and I like it when he turns off all. a true Adam Sandler fan. <br /> <br /> The characters are poor compared to his funny movies like the Waterboy, which has the same people in it (Peter Dante) who is one of the killers trying to Australian Bird to Kill <br /> <br /> This film has depth and a decent storyline and earns it in the bottom 100
