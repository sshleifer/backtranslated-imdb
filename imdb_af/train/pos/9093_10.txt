I am the parent of a special needs child and I enjoyed the movie very much! It was fun, warm and fun. I have long learned to see the humor in things. I especially thought it was sweet how all the other characters were concerned about Frankie and who would care for him after his grandmother died. I attended a focus show of the film with other special needs parents and brothers and sisters before the film was made. Everyone enjoyed the movie and it really inspired wonderful conversations. We talked about how our children made us laugh and we also talked about how we were concerned about them. The scriptwriter talked about how she worked with autistic children and other special needs children as a volunteer. She based the character on a real person. Our family is blessed with a sense of humor that has come to us through many stressful times. I give the movie two inches !!!
