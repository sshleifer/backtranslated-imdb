With an impressive all-cast cast, which looks so impressive almost like the Mad Mad Mad Mad World of horror photos, The Sentinel (1977), it is a spectacular film focusing on the relatively unknown actress Cristina Raines. In this one she plays a fashion model, Alison Parker, who moves to a Brooklyn Heights brownstone, which (and I don't think I give too much away at this late date) is very close to the Gateway of Hell. And as a tenant in this building, she suffers worse conditions than leaking plumbing and the occasional water bug, to soften it! In fact, the scene in which Alison meets her listened neighbor is really scary and must surely send the ice water running down the spine of most viewers. Despite many critics 'complaints about Raines' acting ability, I thought she was just right, more than just holding herself in scenes with Ava Gardner, Burgess Meredith, Arthur Kennedy, Chris Sarandon and Eli Wallach. The picture builds to an effective honest conclusion, and although some plot points are inexplicable, I feel more than satisfied. As the book "DVD Delirium" puts it, any movie with Beverly D'Angelo and Sylvia Miles as topless cannibal lesbians in leotards cannot be bad! On a side note, I passed on to 10 Montague Terrace in Brooklyn Heights yesterday to watch the Sentinel House. Yes, it is still there, and although it has been cut from its heavy skirt and a blind priest / nun in the top floor window, it looks very similar to what it did on this photo. If this house really is at the entrance to hell, I'll take what hell is ... the Brooklyn Queens Expressway. But we, New Yorkers, have known it for some time now!
