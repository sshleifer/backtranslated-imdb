Vaguely thinks of the western 1940s, such as "The Treasure Of The Sierra Madre" (1948), "Red Rock West" is a story of conscience, greed and betrayal. Michael (Nicolas Cage) is an occasional but honest, young man from Texas looking west for work and money. He finds both, but not as he expected. <br /> <br /> The film's screenplay contains many surprises and intrigue. Excellent cinematography, fine movie editing and moody Western music add tension and tension. The vastness of the vast airland offers a wonderful environment. And the play ranges from good to excellent, with great performances by Dennis Hopper and J.T. Walsh. Dwight Yoakam's specially recorded country / western song offers the film a strong final. <br /> <br /> Correctly labeled as neo-noir, "Red Rock West", seems to me something different. The plot is full of incredible coincidences and unlikely timing, so much so that others consider the script as incorrect. I usually agree. In this case, however, when combined with the moody atmosphere and the fact that the small town of Red Rock seems almost empty of normal daily life, the coincidences and unlikely time lapse suggest a story that is not just "noirish" no. unreal. It is almost as if the lot intentionally intervenes with unlikely events to force Michael to take hold of himself. From this point of view, the coincidences are not at all scripts. They are essential plot points in a nightmarish story of a young man who must confront his own demons ... disguised as other characters. <br /> <br /> All we need here is Rod Serling, in a post office, explaining his ever-clear voice, that ... a young man looking for himself in a small, almost deserted village, a thousand miles from nowhere stop. It's his last lifetime in a trip to the twilight zone.
