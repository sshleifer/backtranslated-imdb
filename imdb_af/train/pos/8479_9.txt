If you were a child a few times, it was quite the experience 15 years ago, and now that I have found it again, it still has a movie experience like few others. If it is risky, it is a good display of moral and life lessons recommended for family viewing at young children. While it is still mature, I was fortunate to learn a lot from years ago. Finding it today is difficult enough. . . But believe me it is worth it, no matter what the age is. Anime fans will find it a wonderful entry to Masami Hata's filmography. With impressive artwork and unique designs, "Chirin No Suzu" represents a valuable experience. While some of the lyrical songs are not so hot, they are recorded in English, but the musical score is fascinating. But even the tuner is much better than released today. Unfortunately, it went out of RCA Columbia Home Video in the mid-1980s, and I didn't receive a new format release anyway, at least in the US. Look hard for it and you'll be pretty satisfied! It is an artistic, intense, enjoyable and important landmark in Japanese animation.
