This is the only full-length movie about the world of bridge. I found the first 10 minutes a bit slow, but then the movie is absolutely perfect in describing professional bridge players and how they are going to earn a living. <br /> <br /> Some of the screens are very funny. I don't think a non-bridge player will get the charm of this movie. <br /> <br /> Some of the dresses are really nice, sorry the movie is in black and white - I can only imagine how they look in color. The way the media is portrayed is absolutely hilaries. There is no way the earth bridge will ever be. <br /> <br /> See it as soon as you can and tell your friends about it.
