This movie is a bit of sunshine in a dark season. It celebrates a quality that is best described as ordinary old friendliness. Morgan Freeman plays a character like Freeman himself - a successful actor who pushes 70. He traveled to a small, rather stinking grocery store that was planning to explore a part he could play as a manager of such a place. He greets the staff and clients, especially the beautiful, young female woman (Paz Vega) who pretends to be the "10 items or less" checklist. <br /> <br /> Doing 10 items or less has a great statement to make and does not do or does. It follows Freeman and Vega as they become friendly. As the older man offered his advice, in return for a ride home, the movie gofer who picks him up never showed up and Freeman forgot his own phone number. he can't ask for help. I had some of the blues on a gray Sunday afternoon in New York City and this movie healed what helped me.
