A Chinese Ghost Story opened my eyes to the incredible world of Asian fantasy horror, a magical empire housed by beautiful female ghosts. wheeling Taoist monks, monstrous spirits and dark lords of the underworld; I immediately fell in love with the film's exuberance, energy, humor, ingenuity and visual excellence. <br /> <br /> Two decades later, and this wonderful movie remains one of the best examples of his genre I've seen? A beautiful, breathtaking masterpiece that combines brilliant fright, comedy, fantasy and romance. With excellent direction from Siu-Tung Ching, excellent editing by David Wu, beautiful cinematography and a whole host of imaginative special effects (including a humongous killer tongue, a lot of tentacles and several flying heads!), A Chinese Ghost Story is a totally unforgettable and thoroughly enjoyable experience from beginning to end.
