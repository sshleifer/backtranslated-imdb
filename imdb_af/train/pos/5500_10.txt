This documentary version (now available on Video.Google.Com) is a fantastic demonstration of the power of ordinary people to overcome injustice. Everyone should see it. <br /> <br /> In 1998, Chavez was elected to a landslide. His platform was to derive the fantastic oil wealth from the 20% middle class to the 80% poor. He banned foreign drift into Venezuelan waters. He sent 10,000 Cuban doctors to the slums to treat the sick free of charge. He wiped out illiteracy and set up new free universities. <br /> <br /> But it was his 30% tax on oil companies' profits that got him into trouble with the Bush administration. In 2002, while Irish filmmakers questioned Kim Bartley and Donnacha O'Briain Chavez in the Presidential Palace over his social programs, a CIA support coup was launched. With the cameras rolling, Chavez was caught and flown out of the country. It was announced on national TV that he had "resigned". <br /> <br /> But the poor of Venezuela did not believe the media. They went to their palace to the palace and asked that Chavez be returned. In the face of such overwhelming numbers, the army appointed coup coups and the plotters fled to the US. Chavez was rescued by military helicopter and returned to jubilation.
