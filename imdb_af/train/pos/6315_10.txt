Welcome to Collinwood is a lot of things, but it is not one of the following: <br /> <br /> A George Clooney star vehicle Unfunny Un-Original <br /> <br /> And yes, I know, the base for The movie is another movie. But as far as Hollywood is concerned, it can arrange this with their most authentic outputs this decade - and do it for me. <br /> <br /> The movie is from beginning to end, an absolute gas. Here's why. <br /> <br /> There's no bad performance in the movie. The funny parts are funny. The edgy parts are edgy. The script does not contain a dull moment of dialogue. The cinematography is fresh and yes beautiful. And it doesn't meet the Hollywood norm (you'll see what I mean when you watch the movie) <br /> <br /> When I was a kid, I remember advertising for the movie. This film was hit by the radar after not bringing much to the box and not even a cult classic. The reason Transformers 2 is considered acceptable by average filmmakers is because they have seen Transformers 2. If the movie is so original and funny, it is pumped as often as multi-million pieces of s ** t. movie experience will be a lot more place. <br /> <br /> When they say they don't make em as they used to, they didn't see a welcome in Collinwood. <br /> <br /> A fun, mini-masterpiece of hairdressing comedy, which refuses to compromise. One of my favorites.
