It was simple and yet so nice. I think the whole sense of sex segregation in society, which can become bitter, is very delicate. It had a bitter kind of lobster in it. The fact that most of the actors were not professional made the film more tangible and more realistic. There was also a "documentary" side to the movie. The best scenes were those who all the girls who were banned to watch, listen passionately to the soldier, who was supposed to monitor the game. If you are an Iranian, win the celebrity and dance in the streets after a game, fill yourself with national pride! If you are not Iranian, you will still love it!
