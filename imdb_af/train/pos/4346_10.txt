Paul Reiser is one of my favorite people in the show business. I read both of his books and thought he was wonderful. Peter Faulk can deliver a punch line with the best of them. The combination of the two is magic. <br /> <br /> It's a story about a family who really know each other. Through a road trip, a father and son include for the first time in their lives in the midst of a family crisis. They do everything fathers and boys have to do in life ... they just do them much later in life. The situations are very funny, but have the feeling that they can actually happen to people in real life (not obsurdly on top of cartoon). This is the first time I've seen Paul Reiser and every emotion portrayed is fully believed. Sometimes his eyes look so sad. <br /> <br /> Gretel movie and great story and plot. It has comedy and emotion, but an uplifting message ... Olympia Dukakas also does a good job :)
