In 2151, in Broken Bow, Oklahoma, a farmer shoots the Klingon Klang with his plasma gun after the explosion of a methane store in his farm and the Klingon is sent to Star Fleet Hospital. The Vulcan Ambassador Soval proposes to disconnect the life support system and bring the Klang corpse to its fury with honor in the planet. Captain Jonathan Archer, however, proposes to go with the Enterprise in her first trip and bring Klaang back to his home ground. Jonathan calls Ensign Hoshi Sato and dr. Phlox, who deals with Klang, to complete his crew, and the Vulcan Sub-Commander T'Pol is assigned to participate in the dangerous first mission of Enterprise. When the equipment of the starship ends, Klaang is kidnapped by Sulibans after a hospital shooting. After the autopsy of the Suliban killed in the shooting, Captain Archer is informed by Dr Phlox that the alien was actually a mutant, turned into a sophisticated genetic engineering process. T'Pol changes the Enterprise sensors to find the Suliban spacecraft until their planet reaches Riger X. They investigate and reveal that Klang was a courier, an important message about the Cold War of Suliban Sarin to the leaders of the Klingons in Kronos. <br /> <br /> Despite a big fan of Star Trek, I didn't follow the episodes of "Enterprise" on cable television. I decided to buy the DVD box of the first season and this first episode surprised me. The adventure of the first venture, Captain Jonathan Archer, the beautiful T'Pol, Reed, Mayweather, Dr. Phlox, Hoshi and Trip are excellent, at least in this pilot. I noticed in IMDb that this episode is actually divided into two parts, but on DVD they are just one, so my review is valid for both. I didn't have the music score theme, which I found very annoying, but it was an exception to this great show. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Broken Bow"
