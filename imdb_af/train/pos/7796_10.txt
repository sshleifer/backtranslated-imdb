It was the first movie I've ever seen Ashley Judd and Victor Nunez's first movie I ever said, and boy I'm glad I did. Its quiet silence, a relaxed pace, a realistic portrayal of a young woman just starting life, a fine representation of the struggle she has to go through to make her mark alive, the decisions she makes based on real things, the people she meets - there is nothing wrong with this movie. It's as close to movie magic as I've ever seen outside the Star Wars movies, and given what those movies are, it means that this movie does earn a high rating. Ashley Judd's play, Mr. Nunez'writing, and its a great, simple, valuable story, makes it a nicely outdated story and a wonderful movie.
