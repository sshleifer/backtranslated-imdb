I can't remember this movie getting a movie release about this. I just saw it coming on the cable. The film deals with the dehumanization of children in murder machines. Specifically, one person, the way he is replaced and literally dumped into an outside world community, where he finds himself unable to deal with who he really is and what he feels. <br /> <br /> Seems to me that many people expected it to be Rambo in space and would have been happy if it was. <br /> <br /> I'm definitely lucky it wasn't - Kurt does a good job for an emotional cripple. The scene where he is out of touch shows it, though the decision for two slow-mo replays detracts from the moment. <br /> <br /> It's not a classic SF movie like Bladerunner, Alien, Silent running. , Logan's run or THX1138 was, but unfortunately it's the closest I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> He turns into the movie after a credible degree, he doesn't make Arnie one liners, he doesn't become Snake Plissken and there's no definite happy ending. <br /> <br /> Therefore, this movie didn't perform well. It didn't follow the formula, and under an 18-25-year-old target American audience it was unforgivable because it wasn't what they expected. <br /> <br /> Fear and discipline. <br /> Always.
