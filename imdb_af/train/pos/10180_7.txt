Indian directors find it difficult. They have to compete with movies like "Laggan" where 11 henpecked, Castrated men defend their town and half of them are certified idiots. 'Devades', an intrepid, strange, strange return drunk to oblivion, with characters walking in endless corridors, unaware of anyone's feelings or sentiments - even if they live in a decorated villain of red tapestry and attempt. But to make a good movie, you must saturate the front benches, which are the mysterious ones with Split skirts and Dishum-Dishum, and preferably a "Bollywood" leader that is marginally attractive. So you can get in touch with a director who wants to tell a story of Leonine village chief, who in his own words "defends his village", is considered a violent film or too masculine for a male audience. There are very few actors who can convey the anger and pathos like Nana Patekar (Narasimhan). Nana Patekar left you in his courtyard and watched him rob and mock the politicians when his loyal fans burst into laughter with every word of satire being thrown at him. Meanwhile, his daughter bathed his grandson. It is such a scene that you can find in rural areas. In the. Nana Patekar is the essential actor who belongs to the old school of acting, which is a devastating race in Hindi Movies. The violence depicted is a complicated part of storytelling with songs and dances being thrown in for the gawkers without whom movies will not sell, a sad but true state. Faster it changes better for "Bollywood". Everyone said it was a good movie.
