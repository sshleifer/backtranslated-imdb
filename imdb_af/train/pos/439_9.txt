The true measure of any fictional piece of work is whether the characters grow out of their experiences or come from the experience that has changed significantly (note that this change does not have to be positive or beneficial). <br /> <br /> By that measure, Enchanted April is a successful success. As a film in general, it performs quite well with excellent ensemble-cast, well-developed characters that you care about, wonderful writing and beautiful sets and locations. In short, the movie is good, magical. Although all performances are top notch, three must be mentioned: Josie Lawrence, Jim Broadbent and Joan Plowright. It says something when Miranda Richardson does her usual fine work and is overshadowed by so many others in the role. Most recommended, especially if you are a romantic heart. Further Deponent does not say.
