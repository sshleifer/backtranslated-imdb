I accidentally watched this movie. What a little gem. This film made in 1956 looks and feels like a late seventy movie. And is actually better, more constrained and correct than, say, Blue Soldier. The environment, anthropological undertones is far away from its time. The underestimated cinematography is wonderful and terribly realistic. Much more than Dance with Wolves, the Last Hunt manages the look and feel of the buffalo "murder fields" of the late 1800s. Probably because those in the movie were real murder fields. The movie was shot at legal-minded buffalo culls, so the animals you see are really shot, the bones are real. Finally, a very underrated western masterpiece, excellently acted, directed and shot.
