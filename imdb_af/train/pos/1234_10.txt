I grew up watching this movie, and I still love it just as much today as when I was a kid. Don't listen to the criticism reviews. They are not accurate on this movie. The Murphy really shines in his role. You can sit with your whole family and everyone will enjoy it. I recommend this movie to everyone. It's a comedy with a touch of fantasy. With demons, dragons and a little bare child with God as powers. This movie takes you from LA to Tibet, from the wonderful views of the wonderful temples of the mountains in Tibet. Just a beautiful view! So do yourselves a favor and snatch this one! You won't regret it!
