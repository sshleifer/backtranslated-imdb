It was really a good movie. I loved Dennis Quaid and the whole baseball team. Jay Hernandez is also a very nice actor who is very pleasant to watch. The chemistry the team had after combining things was spectacular. It just goes to show what you can achieve when thoughts unite as one with one purpose. This team came from the edge and lost several seasons to just win everything. I like movies like this because they are very inspiring. <br /> <br /> In addition, Dennis Quaid's character has a place in the big leagues. You can't do anything, but root for this man. It looks like someone has to do something, they are going to do it. Things just happen to get in place and click everything. <br /> <br /> Based on a true story, this movie will really remind you of the fact that nothing is impossible.
