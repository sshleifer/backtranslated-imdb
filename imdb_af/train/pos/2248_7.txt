A surprising rental at a local video store, I was delighted to find a media satire worthy enough to challenge Oliver Stone's "Natural Born Killers". And almost so disturbing. I think it went well with my performance to be late 2004 to watch the Republican machine, and that is the magic of the majority of America's television viewing. This raises the question: "Are we really so manipulative?" <br /> <br /> It certainly scattered my view. There was also a greater theological question being challenged - the story of Christ. Can word of mouth and overwhelming dependence on anything be exploitative, as television produces a messiah? Can the story of Christ be exaggerated? Can it be completely manufactured? This is something that puts the film in a remarkable light.
