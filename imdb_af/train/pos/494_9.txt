This is the start of a new and interesting Star Trek series. It has a "down to earth" child of feeling with darker and less "plaggy" scenography. <br /> <br /> The characters need even more time to develop, but they have potential. One thing that is pretty disappointing (with all Star Trek series really) is that they portray such a bleak picture of the equality between men and women in the future when they paint a very positive picture about everything else. (The earth has stopped war, famine, etc.) <br /> <br /> The female characters here are two, T'Pol subcommittee who is volcano and communications officer Hoshi who is human. Hoshi is very wimpy and T'Pol is a "volcano babe". <br /> <br /> Some of the crew attitudes feel a little too American (as opposed to the more international feelings of the TNG crew) but create interesting dynamics. <br /> <br /> A very good pilot for a very good range.
