The movie is about Anton Newcombe. The music and careers of the two bands is simply background. It is only fair that Newcombe has the last word on the movie, which is available on this brianjonestownmassacre website. I'll link it here, but IMDb won't allow it. <br /> <br /> Documentaries are limited by what the camera captures, as well as the need to gather a coherent narrative from the somewhat random opportunities when coincidentally the lens of the camera has been placed on a line of sight with relevant events . In You! Smiled on the Dandy Warhols, who captured their turn to the status of pop-idol candidates, as they created sweetened pop-ups for mass consumption, especially Bohemian Like You, a song that made their worldwide darlings. thanks to a Euro mobile ad. <br /> <br /> No such luck for Brian Jonestown's massacre. The film captures a bit of what made the original BJM series good, with the exception of a single montage, which lasts a moment or a moment. Newcombe creates a number of brief instrumental parts, which are not in themselves noticeable. play the sumptuous, glittering sounds that had to be in Newcombe's mind and soul before entering the world. <br /> <br /> Three commentaries accompany the film; one of the filmmakers and two by the members of the groups (the BJM track is exclusively former members and without Newcombe). Both the Warhols and BJM alumni show this montage sequence as the "best" bit in the film, and I agree that, given the film's focus on Anton Newcombe, it is the only part of the film that she highlights gift, and seems too short to give the right balance to this attempted portrait of the "tortured artist." Interesting thing about commentaries is that, unlike film, they are recorded in real-time - one long take - It can be more revealing than a documentary that is mainly through editing. <br /> <br /> The Dandies don't get well in their comments. If the rock-roll world expands the experience of high school life for its residents - as I believe it - the Dandies are the popularity obsession preppy types, those who listen to rock, because that's what their peers do while the BJM Crew comes down as the half-rejected, half-outraged outsiders (to insiders like the Dandies, "losers") who are the real rock spirit. BJM's Joel Gion, who speaks a lot, nails the film's message to me when he says (paraphrase): "You can't forget that Anton wanted to do the only thing he ever said. Make lots of great music." <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the Dandies are laughing at every outrageous performance during Newcombe's crash. All of the BJM recordings end here in 1997, before Newcombe stops heroin. Courtney Taylor-Taylor's discounting of Newcombe's commitment to his vision is summarized as follows: "He is 37 and still lives in his car. He can download all his work on his site. He was so tired of being ripped off by everyone. He gives everything away. He can make a coin. "You can almost hear him. <br /> <br /> The film's shortcomings cannot be blamed on the filmmakers; This is rather the problem of documentary form and the loss of collaboration through the film's subject, which makes this Newcombe portrait so fragmented. But it's probably the best we will get, beyond his music. <br /> <br /> I just hired disk one, which has the feature. Most of the extras are on disk two. Don't rent as I put in my order to buy the set.
