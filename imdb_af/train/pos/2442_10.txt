This movie is about a side of Ireland that Americans normally do not see, the meticulous religious side of the 'friendliest race in the world'. The film, by admitting Fethard residents old enough to remember the events, is fairly accurate (though they insist that the filmmakers invented some of the more violent scenes just to renew the action). <Br /> <br /> The movie was very unpopular in Ireland, as it portrayed the Catholic Church in a bad light, but the simple fact is that representatives of the Catholic Church * vetoes minorities (before protesting it were the Jews) organized. <br /> <br /> The film is a fascinating insight into the whole religious problem in Ireland
