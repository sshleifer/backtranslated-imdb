Just came from a sneak preview for this movie. It laughed me every 30 seconds. The end was so funny that tears roll off my face and it wished me I didn't buy that big coke. There are definitely some lulls, but generally, very entertaining. The movie gives Steve Carell the chance to shine after stealing both Jim Carrey in Bruce Almighty and Will Ferrell "Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgendy" in their movies. Paul Rudd is scary as always. I love that he can be so funny in these broad comedies and still work in indie dramas (like P.S.). I think Seth Rogen needs more work, because he is so talented and engaging. Leslie Mann also had some amazing funny moments. I strongly recommend it to those who just want to laugh like a maniac. However, if you're easily offended, don't see this movie. If you're a rabid feminist, don't see this movie. And, no matter what, even if you think you are one of those "hip" parents, don't take your kids to this movie. Sure, you have to let your teens see this movie, just don't watch it with them. It will make for incredibly awkward moments.
