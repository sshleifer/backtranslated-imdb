Fido is a cute comedy that deserves wider recognition, especially in the light of the mainstream chess that we entertain today. <br /> <br /> As already noted, it's almost a real zombie movie, but rather a lovely satire that uses the dead to show fingers. Although there are necessarily a few bloody scenes, there are almost no gores and the way this movie is presented (feel good 50's style), I can't imagine anyone actually scared or fired by Fido and his fellow sufferers no. <Br /> <br /> While the scroll hole is generally good, I felt that Moss and Nelson stood out. The humor is not in your face, but rather muffled; There is a lot of attention to detail and I have laughed myself several times at the same time in the film. This is certainly not a masterpiece of the theater, but it does not strive to be - instead, Currie succeeds in delivering a heart-warming black comedy.
