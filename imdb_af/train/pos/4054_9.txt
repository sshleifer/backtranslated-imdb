The first time I ever saw this movie was back in the 1980s as a young boy. My dad actually recorded it from the TV. I had to watch was more than 20 times before the relatively recent version on DVD. <br /> <br /> Of course, I bought and watched the DVD and was amazed at how much the dialogue changed. In the first version, which I still have on VHS, the sphere of the movie, thanks to the dialogue, was actually very dark. However, the new version, with Van der Beek et al, is more slips. <br /> <br /> To put it another way, it's like watching the original American edition of Akira with that dub, before you get the remastered version with the literal translation of the Japanese. <br /> <br /> I never beat, the story and quality of animation are not compromised, but it does matter whether Miyazaki intended for a lighter or darker narrative and theme in his movie .....
