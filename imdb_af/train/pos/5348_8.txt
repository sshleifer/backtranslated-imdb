Another excellent Arnold movie. This futuristic movie has great action in it, and is one of Arnie's best movies. Arnold is framed as a bad man in this movie and plays a game of death. This movie is excellent and a good Sci-Fi / action movie. I've always liked this movie and it must be one of the best adventure movies. 10 out of 10! PERFECTION
