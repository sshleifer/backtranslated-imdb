After watching the trailer, I was surprised. This movie never made it into theaters, so I ordered the BluRay. I had a good time watching it and having to say that this movie is better than some great animation movies out there. Of course it has its faults, but I can really recommend it. The animation was well done, very entertaining and unique and the story watched me until the end. Some of the backgrounds are just deadly beautiful and you can see the French talent behind it. I thought Forest Whitaker's performance felt a bit lifeless, but that's how the character Lian-Chu is portrayed in this movie. So overall, thumbs up, I liked it a lot and I hope it's successful enough for all the studios involved to continue making great movies like this. I would recommend giving it a chance and being surprised at how good a movie with such a small budget can be. Hector alone is worth watching the movie as some of his moments are Stitch-like hilarious.
