The best Cheech & Chong movie so far !! Of all the Cheech and Chong, this is definitely the best to date. I think I've seen them about twelve times, and I love them all. But it's definitely the best. Compared to the other, this one covers many themes and gives you very good laughs. Some of the texts are still part of our language, after 25 years. I hope one day they can make one, because they are still good comedians. I heard they were writing a new script, so who knows ... I think these guys are the only ones who managed to make decent movies in this genre. I wonder if John Ashcroft ever watched one of them ...
