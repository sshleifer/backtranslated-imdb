I agree with what "webbreaker" wrote about the "Ahhhh" feeling you get at the end of this movie. I absolutely loved the places they chose to film, the songs were well written and interesting, especially the psychedelic soundtrack on which Hans Matheson sings. It's trippy. Nighy was fantastic in his role, Nail "nail" it, Beano was the typical drummer, and Rea held it together. Bruce Robinson was wonderful. Helena was a lovely girlfriend. But I felt Juliet Aubrey's performance was wonderful. The screens between Aubrey and Robinson killed me! Perfectly played and the music behind the scene was about! Sorry, not many more musicians have reviewed this movie! They belong! I told all my musicians friends. great quote by Jimmy Nail's character: "It's supposed to be rock & roll, not the Phantom of the f ***** g opera!"
