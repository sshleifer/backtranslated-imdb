I think the film is educational. However, it fails to deal with the issue that led to so much controversy: plural marriage. Also, the film fails to disclose what the LDS church is predicting. Great opportunity has been missed to tell the world what they actually believe. I couldn't get a clear idea of ​​what it was. LDS views are on central topics of religion. <br /> <br /> I have many LDS friends and they are nice people. It would have been nice to get a clearer picture of how they view their prophetic more controversial statements. Perhaps these statements are just too controversial to be treated in a film format, but it would be great to hear the whole story of Joseph Smith's truly interesting life. It gives insight into American thinking about religion in the 18th century. Hope they do documentary programs on this fascinating subject so that historians about Smith's life can comment. One day we can have a Mormon president. After all, Smith went to president.
