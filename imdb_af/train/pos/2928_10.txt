EDDIE MURPHY DELIRIOUS is easily the funniest stand-up concert movie I've ever seen. Most stand-up acts usually come at one time or another, but not this one. For 90 minutes there is not one moment, which is not funny. From the moment Eddie makes a hilariously dead-on impression of Mr.T, the laugh is silent. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it was done in 1983, and Eddie didn't do anything so funny. It's amazing that the man who wrote this phenomenal brilliant performance wrote a movie called HARLEM NIGHTS. It was not very funny at all. <br /> <br /> Eddie, if you are there, go back and do a concert movie in the vein of DELIRIOUS. Believe me, your supporters will love you for that. And I think you know it.
