This movie is fantastic. Finally well written characters that you can love all their good and bad. Pierce Brosnan is flat hysterical in this self-fulfilling role. I think it's the best thing he ever did. He did other roles that exhibited shades to be able to do this kind of full-fledged work, but this role finally gave him the space to run. I almost died when he walked into the hotel lobby in his underwear and boots. And Greg Kinnear and Hope Davis are also some to strive for, as well as actors to strive for. Kinnear is so good-natured that his turn is really satisfying in the end. You give good actors good work to play with, and they give us something back.
