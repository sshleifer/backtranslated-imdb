Ms Patty Duke's story about her life and struggling with manic depression was just like my life struggle. I saw myself just like her. I was so surprised at the similarities of our lives to include the sexual abuse we both endured as children. <br /> <br /> I saw the movie when it was first presented in 1990 and I loved this movie so much. Anyone who has struggled with manic depression can get so much from this movie. Never mind if it's her awards or what they were for. This is not the problem here. The problem is how Ms Duke had a disease and fought to survive and overcome it. Me. Duke has much to be proud of her achievements with her struggle for survival of a disease that often leaves many victims without hope. <br /> <br /> Unless a person with this disease has personally struggled, they do not know that hell should live with them. The movie for me was a success, as it showed the real issues and how a person acting depressed and manic. It was so real ... so, so, really. It was as if I was watching myself on the screen. <br /> <br /> I wish I could Mrs. Patty Duke personally thanked for the courage to let the public know about her illness. Bocka
