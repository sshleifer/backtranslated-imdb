The dinner may well be the biggest adult cinema production in my opinion. It is crafted in such a beautiful way and the actors excel in their roles. The kitchen scene with Yvonne and Julie Ashton is wonderful. Using the butter and milk really makes the scene. In addition, the doctor's office scene was well done. The campfire scene is full of fun action, though the choice of actors in this scene is questionable. Asia Carrera's performance in the junkyard scene is unbelievable, but what would be expected from her. The closing scene is somewhat more used in adult movies, but is also classic. I would highly recommend this movie to all fans of adult movies and those casual viewers. Go out to your video store and pick it up today.
