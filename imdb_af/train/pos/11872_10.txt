Many people like this movie and much more like it, but it all seems to be wrong. Scarface should love and be loved, but not as it was or was. <br /> <br /> Many people say the play was on top, but better to do a top character than Al Pacino. To say that Pacino went above the top would be an understatement. Yet he does it so well, he only brings you the inner devil as well. His character Tony Montana wasn't such a good guy to start with, but his thirst for power only brought his illness from greed to another level; an inhuman level. Certainly Pacino is sometimes a little bit of cartoon and surreal, but it doesn't seem to me a liability. The supporting role-player served his job very well. Michelle Pfeiffer was not really the best, but she definitely played the role she played. On the other hand, Steven Bauer was at his best, but he was Steven Bauer. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio was good and, like Michelle Pfeiffer, her role fits very well. Robert Loggia I've always enjoyed watching in just shouting. Other than Pacino, it wasn't really striking or memorable. Everyone seems to fit their roles by being there. They didn't fit perfectly, but were convincing enough. <br /> <br /> Brian De Palma did a good job of directing this movie. When an actor can get bigger than life with his performance, the director must be given credit, and I will definitely give it to De Palma. Brian De Palma, although not respected, is a very versatile director by my score. He knows how to direct movies according to their genres, but sometimes it didn't show well. This happens, it is a gangster movie for everyone, but little is much better than that of De Palma. <br /> <br /> The writing was wonderful, it was just pure Oliver Stone. When I saw the credits at the end of the movie and saw Oliver Stone writing it, I was not the least surprised. However, this is a will for him. I have always liked him as a great writer and to me he proves it again with Scarface. No one knows how to write a surreal reality for a movie like Oliver Stone. <br /> <br /> The music was good but not so good. This is definitely not my favorite of Giorgio Moroder. The music was a bit too 80s for me, but it didn't bother me. The cinematography was good, not great, but really who cares with such a movie. <br /> <br /> It has probably been one of the most influential movies in the past 25 years, but as before, it's for the wrong reasons. People need to realize that Tony Montana's character is not a hero, he's a monster. He is not inspiring anyway. He is greedy, bloodthirsty, uneducated and self-consuming. Yet he is a role model for many people because he is somehow a rebel, but probably especially because he is a fraudulent gangster. A Vigilante will be like Scarface's Mother Tereasa. <br /> <br /> However, the good thing about this movie is that it seems that Tony Montanas is not the right problem. If we or the authorities want to close people like him, we can do that, but we don't. In a freaky twisted way, he is a necessity for our society. He is someone you can blame everything and get better about yourself. The Tony Montanas of this world are the scapegoats of our society. It in no way excuses people like him. Instead, it's more a reminder that we shouldn't excuse or allow us to do bad things, just because we measure or think we should better compare to a gunman or drug dealer. I love this movie because it is more than a corruption movie, it is a movie that makes you wonderfully self-reflecting.
