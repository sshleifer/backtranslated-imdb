I caught this movie on the Sundance Channel on a late afternoon cable. You can say, "Who loves the sun" is a perfect quiet pastime of a story, why not. You're going to hang out with the trio: Lukas Haas is Will (returning after leaving all of them suddenly years ago), Molly Parker is Maggie (we learn she's a lot of the Bloom family), and Adam Scott is Daniel (is he friend or enemy or fiancee, through the picturesque Falcon Lake, Manitoba, Canada, trapped in graphic compositions alongside bright summer colors at sunshine and shadows. And the trio's support is another two family members in the revealing mix: Wendy Crewson is mother Mary Bloom, and R. Thomson is Pa Arthur Bloom. Author-director Matt Bissonnette delivered an ingenious line-up of storyline and his various tentacle links. Don't worry, Haas may have a listless face, but humor will come when Parker and Scott are reunited in the circle of friends. break and know congratulations stir. Dialogs can be more or less zero, but we will get the taste of what is cooking, moody or wondering. <br /> <br /> Yes, "Who Loves The Sun" can be voted as a sleeper. The chemistry between all five principals ensures gels and "burns", which gives an energetic ensemble performance. After all, it's all in the family, and the movie doesn't make him too serious. <br /> <br /> It looks like the official website is still available at "wholovesthesun.com" and there is information about the soundtrack by Mac McCaughan (Portastatic with guitar songs and strings) where the slots are played, and behind the screens production notes, interviews with author-director Bissonnette on how film and concept originated, decisive and more. Always be appreciated by Molly Parker since her thrifty show in 1996 Lynne Stopkewich's Kissed, and she is married to Bissonnette, who wrote the Maggie part for Molly.
