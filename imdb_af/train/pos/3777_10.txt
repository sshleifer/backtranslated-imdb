Anyone who does not think of Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey is one of the best movies of all time that have checked their heads. It somehow manages to be completely in vain and non-brain, but also frightening and clever. One of those rare movies that actually improves on his predecessor can be enjoyed repeatedly by Bogus Journey. Striking highlights include the duel with death and the end, which is highly "emotional". Keanu wants to forget about all the Matrix litter and do what he does best, Ted Theodore Logan in Bill and Ted: The Return.
