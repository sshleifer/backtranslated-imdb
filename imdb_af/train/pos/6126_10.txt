I saw Jack Frost at my local store for Â£ 4:00 and I thought it looked pretty good for a low budget movie, so I bought it and it was right, it was good. For the beginning, this movie is about a killer snowman, so it's something to laugh about and the way it looks was funny compared to the snowman on the front. <br /> <br /> The play was okay and the lines Jack Frost said I laughed: "I just drove you for a smoke" and "Worlds most pi ** ed off snow cone", how funny and camp is this? The story at first was rather funny and stupid. "Jack is fine, Jack is fast, Jack's golden eyes with chopsticks." If you're looking for a B-movie Comedy horror full of points, watch Jack Frost. 10/10
