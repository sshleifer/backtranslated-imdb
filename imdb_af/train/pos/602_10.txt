I have never danced flamenco, but somehow I feel this movie was perfect. The colors, how blatant the dances were, the gypsies and the rivals all made, made a movie that ended too soon. I saw other Carlos Saura movies and I agree that this movie can be its best production. I feel that the best features of his past films have been compiled and aligned to make Iberia. I appreciate the use of mirrors to reveal the activity behind the cameras. Looking at this movie, I felt like I was sitting in a small restaurant in Madrid, and watch the dancers on a wooden shelf over a delicious fruit cocktail. For me, this movie is like a glove. I don't know how I will get a copy of this movie in the US over the next few years. I recommend this movie to anyone who is attracted to the existence of other cultures. It's safe to say that this movie is definitely on my favorite list.
