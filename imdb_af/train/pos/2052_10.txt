I don't have much to add to my summary, but this movie also features Top Gun as one of the funniest movies ever made while not trying. I don't think it should be taken seriously when viewed, as it is very pleasant. <br /> <br /> I don't think this brings Christopher Walken's reputation off, as his reputation was on the back, anyway. It took Pulp Fiction to wake him from the slumber he was in. As for Michael Ironside, he was in some of the great funny while he wasn't serious. Total remember, Top Gun. What I think is wonderful is the budget this movie had. The screens and actors and explosions, etc., are quite surprising, so of course someone liked and willing to take a lot of money. Who he or she is, they like them because I love this movie! <br /> <br /> If someone reads who is looking for information about McBain (and I seriously doubt there will be too much) just know it is a hilarious movie and should be seen with a smile on your face!
