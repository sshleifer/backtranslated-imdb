This is the best piece of film ever created. This is a masterpiece that brought a tear to my eye. I never forget my experience to see it. I don't understand why people don't think like me. The dinosaur turns into a show combined with De Niro in Raging Bull, Pacino in Scarface and Crowe in Gladiator. It should be released on DVD in Superbit format so that I can fully enjoy it as it was meant to enjoy when it was produced and filmed. Whoppi Goldberg really is in the lifetime of a tough, messy policeman who is against her, working with a hot shot dinosaur as her partner, and the hi-jinx is the least. By the way, I say the complete opposite of what is true, this movie is completely rubbish.
