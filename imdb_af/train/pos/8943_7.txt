The 1960s TV series Bewitched is due to the idea of ​​this movie. This is the movie that Jimmy Stewart & Kim Novak made right after they were thrown together in Vertigo by Alfred Hitchcock. This one is not as obsessive as the one, but Novak is just as fascinating. <br /> <br /> It was Jack Lemmons's 10th movie and he is well supported here, as well as Ernie Kovacs. The movie has many good things about it. Hermine Gingold is very good at this movie, almost as good in support here as she was in The Music Man. The film is very solid. <br /> <br /> This movie has a late 1950s New York City feel and a cat that looks like a litter in any movie. It's worth watching because it's a love story with all the emotions of any, and a bit of magic to start. <br /> <br /> It's not Vertigo, but I think because it followed the movie, viewers didn't judge it as well as it deserved - it's sure William Asher saw it so created the 1960s series. I'm not so happy about what Will Ferrell did on the big screen. This movie is much better than that.
