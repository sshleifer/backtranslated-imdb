"Kaabee" portrays the suffering of a woman before and during World War II, while raising her children alone after her husband has been imprisoned for "thought crime". This movie is directed by Yamada Youji, and as expected the atmosphere of this movie is really great. Although the historical correctness of some scenes, especially the beach scene, is suspicious. <br /> <br /> The play in this movie is absolutely incredible. I'm amazed at how they managed to collect this all-star cast for a 2008 movie. Yoshinaga Sayuri, possibly the most decorated actress in Japan, will undoubtedly win more individual awards for her performance in this film. Shoufukutei Tsurube in a supporting role was also very nice. However, it was Asano Tadanobu who made the most impressive performance, portraying the whiteness of his character and the difficult situation in which he was. <br /> <br /> Movies with pre-war setting are not my thing, but thanks to great directing and acting, I was totally absorbed by the story. It was also not a weathered nonsense like "Yuunagi no Machi, Sakura no Kuni", and explored the controversial and sensitive issue of government oppression and brainwashing that occurred in that period in Japan. Excellent movie, highly recommended for all viewers.
