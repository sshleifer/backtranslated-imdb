The man in the moon is a good movie. It is sometimes very touched and is done very well in all respects. I wouldn't say the movie was terribly original, but what are the days? <br /> <br /> The role players all did a good job with their respective roles. I really enjoyed enjoying Reese Witherspoon at such a young age and doing a good job. Jason London also does a good job. And the only other person I recognized was Sam Waterston, who did a fantastic job with his role. I very much loved Sam's character (Matthew Trant). Sometimes it was the kind of father you fear, but eventually you love his character. The rest of the role play was also very good. <br /> <br /> Touching movies about growing up and dealing with life thrown on you requires watching this movie. I suggest you read the plot synopsis and if it looks like something you're interested in then go for it. Anyway, hope you enjoy the movie, thank you for reading, <br /> <br /> -Chris
