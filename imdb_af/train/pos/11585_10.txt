This movie is full of stock. Horror movie delicacies: cracked lunatics, pre-meditated murder, a mad (vague lesbian) female scientist with an even crazy father wearing a mask because of his horrible indignation, poisoning, haunting castles, werewolves and women), adultery, devoted lovers, Tibetan mystic, the half-man / half-plant victim of some unnamed experiments, theft, mind control, rolled up bodies, a car accident on a lonely road, electricity, knights in the armor - Fate, all was completed with an incredibly terrible score and some of the worst Foley work ever done. <br /> <br /> The script is incomprehensible (even called the bad Spanish Horror movie standards) and some of the editing is not bizarre. In one scene where the leading female scientist goes to visit our heroine in her bedroom for one of the bad names: "It's fantastic. I don't understand. Explain to me again what it is ..." movie, there is a sudden hand-nailed to the girl's thighs as she gets out of bed without a clear reason to cover a cut in the bad scientist's "Mwahaha"! All your werewolfs belong to me! speech. Although why they have bothered, I don't know, because there are many other jumping spots all over the place - even for the horrible pan and the scan of the pressure I saw. <br /> <br /> According to an interview with the star, the director was drunk for most of the shooting and the movie looked like it. It's a disjointed mess. It is made even more incoherent by the inclusion of reef material from another film The Mark of the Wolf Man (made 4 years earlier, with the same actor, but the part with more aggression and with another shirt and makeup - IS There is a word in Spanish for "Continuity"?) And more stuff from another actor in the wolfman action that goes over a long shot. <br /> <br /> The music is incredibly bad, alternating almost randomly from full orchestral music, to bosannova, to the longest piano and gong duet ever recorded. (Think about it, it might not be a duet. It might have been a solo. The piano part was so simple that it could be played with one hand while the player was awake with the other.) <Br /> <br /> This is one of the most staggering trance states that have caused bad movies of the year to date. Enjoy. <br /> <br /> Favorite line: "Ilona! This madness and perversion will turn against you!" How true. <br /> <br /> Favorite shot: The lover, discovering his girlfriend's murder, leaves the candle in a cartoon-like surprise show. Arrange amateur who is going there.
