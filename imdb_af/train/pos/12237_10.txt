Pairing Game is a beautiful, wonderful movie from a past era. Hollywood should consider a beautiful remake of this movie. My wife and I will see it. <br /> <br /> It's an excellent romantic comedy that my wife and I watched on AMC. <br /> <br /> This movie has Tony Randall at its best. Debbie Reynolds is great, as always. <br /> <br /> Loved this. We plan to order on DVD to join our growing collection of movies. <br /> <br /> Bad, Hollywood no longer makes movies like this. <br /> <br /> Hey Hollywood .... time to dig some of these scripts out of the old safe, they work a little (without surprising the original movie and script as you did with other remakes) and hold a decisive call. <br /> <br /> A remake would be a big hit on the silver screen, DVD, and on cable / SATTV. <br /> <br /> SN Austin, TX
