It's a movie for entertainment; I didn't think the world made social commentary from a small movie. I find this movie personally funny, mysterious and memorable. It is a fantasy, not a cinder girl who becomes a princess. This movie is very well done. In the 1970s, I could add some of the best experiments in film to name a person's sexuality. This movie is not about a person who is homosexual or not. But it's about love, in all its strange forms. This film does show the realities of gay in the 70s in Hollywood, or in California. Beautiful boys are cared for by older men not so beautiful. Women who had to stay deep in the emotional closet or had the risk of not having a career. Baths were an integral part of the gay community. <br /> <br /> Then the fantasy starts !! Let's mix a lesbian with a gay and add some liquor and what do we have? Well, this movie, which was in any way better than that dishonest repeated "The Next Big Thing". Maybe someone should have asked the whole crew to see this movie and then try better. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this movie when I saw it in the 70's and it still brings a smile to my lips. I highly recommend anyone who wants a funny, soft movie - to curl up with some popcorn and have fun. Some people need relief !!! And this is the movie you have to do with it! <br /> <br />
