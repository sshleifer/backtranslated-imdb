Criticism tells people that Antz is better. Antz is a good movie, but I enjoyed Bug's Life a little more. I can't remember a Pixar animation except the two Toy Story movies that I laugh so hard. The animation is clean, the story is original and does not preach. The voice remains what makes this movie. Dave Foley is a serious ant who gets him into trouble. Hopper is an excellent characterization by the always wonderful Kevin Spacey, like Haydn Panettiere as Dot. There is also good support from Dennis Leary, David Hyde Pierce and Madeline Kahn, and I can continue. The writing is fantastic, so funny and sometimes even touching. It lacks the social messages of Antz, but what we have is rock solid entertainment. 9/10. Bethany Cox
