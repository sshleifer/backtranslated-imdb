It was a hit at the South-South West (SXSW) Film Festival in Austin last year and features a fine role by E.R. Gloria Reuben and a landscape shoulder John Glover are seated. Though shot on a small budget in NYC, the film looks and sounds great, and we take behind the scenes through the rehearsal and build-up of what the actors call "The Scottish Play" as a reference to the word " Macbeth thought to bring on the play's old curse. The acting company displays all the emotions of the drama itself, lust, jealousy, anger, suspicion and also some fun. The games begin when a completed actor (starring) is replaced by a well-known "beautiful face" of the TV soap opera to draw larger crowds. The green-old monster takes off from there, and the drama unfolds beautifully. Fine soundtrack, and good performances everywhere. The DVD also includes director comments and some deleted scenes.
