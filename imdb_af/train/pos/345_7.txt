The first hour or so of the movie was mostly boring to say the least. However, this improved after the Valentine Party started. Apart from the controversy over the identity of the murderer in the end, the hot-bath scene was one of the few relatively unforgettable aspects of this movie. The scene at the garden with Kate was well shot and so was the very last scene (the 'turn'). In those scenes, there was a real thrill and excitement and the hot bath murder scene attributed it to a nasty (the way the slashers should be). The earlier murders are frustrating without gore.
