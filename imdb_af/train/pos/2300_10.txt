This movie has so many wonderful elements to it! The debut performance of Reese Witherspoon is of course wonderful, but also her chemistry with Jason London. The score is remarkable, weak and pure. James Newton Howard enhances the quality of any film he composes for tenfold. He also seems to have a talent for lost days-of-youth movies, sure to get his score for the recent "Peter Pan" and the ghostly Gothic music of The Village. I first saw this movie about 13 or 14 and now I'm not just screaming at the end, I ejected a tear or two for the nostalgia. Show this movie to your daughters. It will eventually become a lifelong comfort movie.
