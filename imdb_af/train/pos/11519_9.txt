The only reason I didn't give these 10 stars was the DVD format - no menus, extras, etc. However, if you've ever had a dream to do something with your life, this movie is for you. If you believe in yourself and your dream does not let anyone stop at you. It's one of the most life-changing movies I've ever seen. And magic. The play is wonderful, the plot serves the purpose, and the opening is fantastic. This is one of those films that have been "cult" status. I recommended this movie to all my friends. Some like it, some can't complete it. When I think or feel something is impossible, I think of Alan Arkin's role in this movie. Sure he wants to make more movies.
