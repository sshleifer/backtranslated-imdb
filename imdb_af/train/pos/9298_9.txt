One of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen. It is a parody of the crime life, parody of everything the Chicago 1930 represents. - There is no real need to underestimate this movie, because the score is below 5. This is a mass and opinion. the mass is hypnotized. Who decides to look at it - it will be regrettable, who decides not to see it - will regret it.
