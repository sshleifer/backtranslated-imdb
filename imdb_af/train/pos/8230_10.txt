Eglimata (= Crimes) is a story about small crimes every day people commit that it can lead to absolute disaster in a crazy scenario. One of the smartest Greek series ever! Actors such as Ketty Konstadinou and Maria Kavogianni showed a whole new dimension of themselves and talent. and gave us moments of incredible 'guilty' laugh. Each viewer recognized the bad side of themselves in one of the characters or at least a side of their self that they wished they had. Actors of all ages who played bigger and smaller, got an equally large space in the Greek audience's heart. My personal favorites (except the first two I mentioned) are Vassilis Haralambopoulos, Athinodoros Prousalis and Stavros Nikolaidis, but so many incredible actors have passed through some episodes. from time to time. Whoever understands Greek all over the world must find a way to watch this series, though it has been on TV for over 5 years. In Greece, they hold the series (ANT1) in every chance like summer or early afternoon zones. We will never forget Eglimata or any of the crew!
