When I first saw this movie, the first thing I thought was this movie was more like an anime than a movie. The reason is because they do vampires that do amazing stunts. The stunts are much like the Matrix moves, like moving too fast for bullets, and a bit to jump. Another reason I'm good at the movie is because the beautiful anime faces they do during the movie. The way Gackt faces or acts just like them, VERY ANIME. I think it's a very good movie to watch. ^ _ ^ The action in this movie is a 10 (not to mention Gackt and Hyde also a 10). ^ _ ~ If you are Gackt and Hyde fans, you should see it.
