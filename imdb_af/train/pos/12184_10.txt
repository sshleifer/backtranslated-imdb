In many of his films (Citizen Kane, Confidential Report, Touch of Evil) Orson Welles gave him the role of an exuberant man. In "The Lady from Shanghai" this is the only time I see the role of the victim. The role of the culprit, he gave it to Rita Hayworth, I think it's because he fell in love with her. That's why it's an interesting movie. But I find the story excellent too. The direction is genius as usual with Welles: two scenes are particularly brilliant: one in the aquarium and the last one with the mirrors. This movie is brilliant. (10/10)
