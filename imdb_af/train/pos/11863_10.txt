Perhaps this is the best movie ever made, and if not, it's definitely one of those burned to your pupils like Brian De Palma here, a great piece of cinematographic artwork. First, there is the director's touch of Brian De Palma, who again proves he can be one of the best directors ever. There is the excellent performance of Al Pacino delivering an immortal hero on the big screen (Tony Montana). There are many different (violent) scenes that you will never forget (the one with the chain saw, the one in which Tony sits in a bath as big as most people's living room), there is the very beautiful one -liner (count how many times the word "f * ck" is used), there are the wonderful little details (the Pan American world shouting the world) or the great discomusic of Giorgio Moroder. Nothing can be named here, and it is easy to join with "The Godfather", "Good fellas" and "White heat" one of the best gang programs ever made!
