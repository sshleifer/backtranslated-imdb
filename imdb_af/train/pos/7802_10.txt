I was electrified when I first saw it in 1983 or 1984. Steven Biko is halfway through the film, but the resonance of his courage and wisdom is not forgotten. I did not finally do in South Africa in 1993. It is also largely a story about friendship and loyalty. When I was in South Africa and heard the audience in a dance review in Natal, Nkosi Sikelel 'iAfrika, my hair is standing on its ends. There is much to learn from this story for all people.
