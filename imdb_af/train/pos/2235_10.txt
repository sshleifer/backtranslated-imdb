I love this movie a lot because it is a true story set in the Amazon, a part of the world that has always intrigued me. I believe that a condensed form of the book was published in Reader's Digest shortly after the actual event took place. <br /> <br /> Being a "baby boomer", the character and the actress are my contemporaries, and for this reason I was related to the movie. I also believe the movie is valuable for teaching survival skills if the viewer follows the character of the streams leading to the river and the coastal settlements where they can get help, as well as other survival techniques. Most importantly, she wanted to survive and maintain a positive attitude. In conclusion, I hope viewers will learn something from it, and also for entertainment. <br /> <br /> I wish the movie will be released soon in VHS and DVD as soon as I want to add it to my video collection. . It should also be shown more frequently on the satellite movie channels.
