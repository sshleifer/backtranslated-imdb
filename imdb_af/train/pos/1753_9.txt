As we all know the subgenre of sex comedies is pretty full. Simply exaggerated is no longer enough. I saw so many disgusting jokes and actions and heard that a sex comedy should actually have other positive points to appeal to me today. <br /> <br /> Come in the 40-year-old Virgin I basically knew what to expect; I've seen the ads; "Is it true that you lose it if you don't use it?" What I didn't expect to find is a warm and honest character development. There are still the strange characters we see in Adam Sandler movies, and there is still enough inappropriate language to sink Noah's Ark, but somehow the movie has a valuable love story and even a message. <br /> <br /> The main character Andy is (unfortunately for me) a person to whom I can connect. In the first shot I see that he even shares my love for Mystery Science Theater 3000 (he has a poster for the movie on his wall) and through the film we see his real neat collection of antiquities. Andy also has lots of video games and a working knowledge of movies and technology. Andy doesn't want to buy a car because he prefers his bike. Most important of all; Andy is a good person, he doesn't swear and he respects so many women that he stays away from them. Combine all these factors and everyone starts thinking he's a serial killer. It's like my life story. <br /> <br /> The other characters each have funny little stories to go with their slightly exaggerated personalities and they all work on a certain level, but not like Andy. I felt that it was somehow distracting, as Andy and his girlfriend Trish are really the only real human characters in the whole movie. <br /> <br /> I suppose, since I mentioned one error, Other noticeable one to lift. The story is smart but too predictable and as far as novels go, it's pretty simple. It's about Andy's relationship with Trish for a long time and we all know what will eventually happen. Certainly his final detour is a little different from what we can expect, but you know what will eventually happen and I assure you do it. It's definitely tiny spots on the movie, but there's so much good here that I can easily ignore it. There are few mistakes. <br /> <br /> Of course, if I say "good", I mean bad. It's a sex comedy and it wants to be bad. For the most part, I think it has succeeded. There are so many hilarious scenes like Andy to get rid of an erection after he refused to have sex with Trish. Or the scene where Andy and his Trish daughter go to a sexual education class where he eventually asks more questions than anyone else. Oh and we shouldn't forget to be a classic chest. "Oh! Como's llama!" An interesting little note about that scene; Actor Steve Carell actually washed his stomach and the pain shown is real. Of course, they only did one, but it was still a very brave thing to do. <br /> <br /> Actually, since we're talking about Steve Carell, I would like to say that he has now risen to my list of respected comedians who are so strange because I didn't even know who he was before I made this movie. seen. I was equally impressed with his writing, acting and timing that I really want to keep an eye on his future roles. This man has talent. The 40-year-old virgin proves it. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I had uncertainty about this movie, but early word was positive and I knew it was something I would finally see. I'm glad I also did because it's probably one of the funniest movies I've seen in the past and it doubles as you feel worth watching. It is not just a series of genitals, but rather a series of sex holes that are entangled with a very valuable character and a truly enjoyable romance. Excuse me now as I stretch out my bowels; I can't believe I just wrote it. <br /> <br /> My review of Frider Waves: http://friderwaves.com/index.php?page=virgin
