Teenager Eddie spends his life because of his obsession with heavy metal music and is humiliated and humiliated. One day he finds his hero out. Sammi Curr died, presumably burned by the foundation that ended his music. But Eddie had his last record, never released, and when he played it, he started receiving messages telling him how to deal with his evildoers. For a long time, Sammi has revealed that he plans to return to the local Halloween party for eternal revenge in the town that once mocked him. <br /> <br /> Filled with humor and jokes, it's a highly entertaining movie. Sammi herself is an original horror movie villain, playing on the 'horrors of rock music' obsessions of the 80s. Worth watching.
