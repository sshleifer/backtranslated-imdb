Old horror movies are interesting, very screaming, very screaming and lots of humor to go with it. "The Blob" is a classic in its own work. Steve McQueen (1930-80) plays a teenager trying to be a hero in his town. Going out on a date with his girlfriend is very typical for all teenagers. But when the old man discovers the same falling object from the air, he ends the victim, and Steve helps him the best he can. When it comes to teenage power, this movie really offers it. I know most teens had their hardships when they acted. When in danger, they must learn to forget the past and do something good to save mankind. When the adults in town eventually learn the tough path about "The Blob" run crazy, they have to learn to trust teens and not get their behavior the best of them. The oozing juggernaut was pretty cute in the day, and I think it was JELL-O! Once everyone arrives to stop the threat, the town is once again safe, thanks to good old cooperation. I still eat Jello and watch this movie all the time, if you don't like Jello! RATING 5 STARS
