Eddie Murphy spends his time searching for lost children, so when a very special magic child is abducted in Tibet, the sexy Charlotte Lewis asks for his help to save this child from the clutches of evil himself. <br /> <br /> Although the story is a bit stupid, it never feels granular, despite the hilariousness of the comedy throughout the film; Charles Dance off sets the comedy with its very serious and dark characterization of the evil that the child holds. <br /> <br /> The Golden Child is very funny, action-packed and really compelling in a beautiful, almost magical way. <br /> <br /> 7/10 Great for all generations.
