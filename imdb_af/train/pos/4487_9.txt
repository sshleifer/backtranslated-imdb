"Fraidy Cat", the fourth of these cartoons, is a good one. At least I like it, so I'm surprised it becomes mixed reviews. <br /> <br /> This one is more of a macabre story than a funny one, though it has its moments of comedy. The atmosphere is dark and haunting. Suspension is another strong element here. Regarding humor, it is usually dark humor. <br /> <br /> In this brief, Tom listens to a creepy radio show at night and is absolutely frightened because it's about ghosts, something he believes. While Tom is dead, Jerry sees everything and can't help but laugh all the time. In fact, Jerry quickly finds a way to torture him more and more. With the help of a white shirt and vacuum cleaner, he creates a great "ghost". <br /> <br /> Tom lives the frightening experience of his entire life. Although Jerry is scared of Tom for a good reason, the way the story is made is funny. Plus, again, there is no violence here because it is one of Tom & Jerry's oldest cartoons. But I don't get that joke from Tom's 9 lives almost in the vacuum cleaner. <br /> <br /> When Tom finally found out that it was all a Jerry's scheme and that Jerry made a fool of him, Jerry was "caught by hand in the cake pot" (he deserves to discover it) be). Yet Tom shows an incredible patience before responding. He looked furiously at Jerry for about a minute. The funny thing is that Jerry Tom invites to laugh with him and takes about half an hour to realize that Tom looks at him with a very serious face. Jerry tries to be funny, but Tom doesn't laugh. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's another, strange and remarkable Tom & Jerry experience.
