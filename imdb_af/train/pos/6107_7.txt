Then I watched the movies ... I thought, "Why was the movie such a big success in the Korean Box Office?" Even thought the movie had a clever / unusal scenario, the acting wasn't that good and the characters were not very interesting. For a Korean movie ... I like the fighting scenes. If you want to watch a movie without thinking, it's the movie for you. But I have to admit ... the movie was kind of childish ... 6/10
