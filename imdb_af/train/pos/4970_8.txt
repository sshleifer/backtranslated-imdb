Some critics found this film dark, but to me there was plenty of good humor and optimism to overcome this impression. For example, the quiet positive and stoic character of the daughter is the centerpiece of the film, often counteracting the unfortunate aspects of the environment and plot line. <br /> <br /> The movie is full of original ideas and characters, and the final outcome is not predictable: I felt it could have either gone. <br /> <br /> By the way, many reviews I've read call the effective use of black and white, but the pressure I've seen on the SBS TV network here in Australia was in full color. <br /> <br />
