Ok, it is unnecessary to say, this movie will only appeal to a certain audience; namely stoners and like-minded people. <br /> <br /> That being said, if you are one of these people, this movie is a MUST. In fact, I think it should be mandatory for head offices to sell a copy to someone who buys their first bong. What Monty Python's Holy Grail is to geeks and nerds, so is this movie to potheads. I only saw the movie 10 years ago, and I've always cracked every time I see it. The jokes are perfect for improving the stupid lifestyle, much better than the latter day, like a half-baked effort. <br /> <br /> There is no plot to speak like this; the film is more of a collection of different sketches; as the movie characters stumble across Los Angeles in their legendary haze. In spite of this, the film has an excellent fit and does not wear at all. Many people call Up In Smoke as C & C's best work, but I have to say the next movie is better. <br /> <br /> So if you're in the mood for an hour and half of the stomach, call light, tune in, and move your mind away =) <br /> <br /> Oh, and FREE TOMMY CHONG!
