It is not a 'loose' but a precise, faithful memory of 1958 Monicelli's classic "I Soliti Ignoti" with Toto, Mastroianni, Gassman, Cardinal, etc. And that's the reason it's good, it copies all the funny characters and the plot, even in detail (like the scene where the photographer steals the camera from the local market). <br /> <br /> I watched the beautiful old version many times and I knew all the gangs and the end of my heart, but I still enjoy "Welcome to Collinwood", which has its own freshness and atmosphere. It is interesting to see how the life and ways of the little thieves in the 1950s were adapted to Italy's 2002 US. Things didn't change much. 8/10.
