If you love Deep Cover, you can also keep this movie. Many of the poetic interviews of Fishburne recites in Deep Cover come from the lyrical script of "Once In the Life", a screen adaptation of a play Fishburne's writing. If you love Larry as much as I do, you'll love this movie, it's all Larry, all warm, and everyone has fallen out. Of course there are rifle games and illegal substance use, it's a gangster movie, but the writing is beautiful and the story touches, even a little on the chick side. <br /> <br /> AMAZING movie ... dark, scary, sexy and exciting. If you ever came out in the night or hung in a clubhouse, you would get the proper impact of the cut sets (meteoric echoes trapped in life). Full of clever advance and complex relationships, this movie is tight. Each sentiment reflects in the set of dressing and camera shots. GOOD WORK!
