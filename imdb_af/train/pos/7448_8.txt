I didn't laugh for so long - although the movie also has sad moments, especially if it changes from hip-jokes to honest and serious. The characters are most realistic most of the times, sometimes juicy, but reasonably credible. I'm not a fan of the Jerry Springer show. I feel sorry for the participating people. Rather, this film is a satire, and it goes well. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that all scouts * were released while this movie was broadcast on public television, which is a great pleasure. I'm going to rent this movie to fully enjoy it. <br /> <br />
