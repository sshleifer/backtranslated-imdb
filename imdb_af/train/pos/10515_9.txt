A light, charming little movie, surely, but a wonderfully crafted one. Gwyneth Paltrow shines in her early showcase for her British accent, and the cast put her all around the dialogue. It came out over the time of Sense and Sensibility, and I'm sure I don't know why that one got the Oscar attention. Emma is Jane Austen's most accessible and least stuffy story, well said.
