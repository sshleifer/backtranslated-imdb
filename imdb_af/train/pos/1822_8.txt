An unforgettable masterpiece of the creator of The Secret of Nimh and The Land Before Time, was a very bittersweet cartoon. I remember it very well from my childhood, it was funny and sad and very beautiful. Well, it starts a little dark, a dog that has escaped the pound, and is killed by an old friend, ending in heaven and coming back. But it becomes sweet when he befriends a beloved girl who can talk to animals. Some scenes were a bit scary in conflict with other cartoons, such as Charlie's dream series, but everything was okay, and the songs were fair. An unforgettable role of Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise, I just love the old, oh hehe. And Judith Barsi of Jaws The Revenge, God may rest her soul, poor girl, she did not deserve to die, but she is now in Heaven, all good people go to heaven. Overall this is a very good animation movie, a Don Bluth classic enough to anime and Disney to be ashamed of. Recommended for the whole family. And knowing this, if you have the original video of this, you will find behind the movie, Dom DeLuise has a very important and special message. You must love the guy, hey.
