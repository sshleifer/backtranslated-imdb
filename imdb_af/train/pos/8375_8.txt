<br /> <br /> Robot jox is a good movie, and some of the sets are bad and the acting is not that good, but the special effects are great for a movie of this size and age. You have to remember that this movie is now over 10 years old and made very cheap in the 1st place so you can't complain about the bad parts too much. So just sit back and watch a cool movie with big big robots in it.
