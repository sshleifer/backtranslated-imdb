It took me a while to view this version, but unfortunately it doesn't seem like I can rent it in the video store, but the other version, but I fell in love with it. I was always borderline with the other Emma. Of course, Gwenneth and Toni Collette, since they are not British, must emphasize, and it doesn't look good to me. It looks like it's being used. Sorry, but don't think Toni and Gwenneth have done a brilliant job there. I couldn't warm any of the characters, but this version is more heart warming and more the type of person I thought Emma should be. This is definitely the version that I come back from now on. I was disappointed that Mr. Knightley doesn't look better, but he's convincing. I also like Jane Fairfax better (played by Olivia Williams). I never warmed her in the movie version, but she was better portrayed in this version. Think about it (except for Knightley), all the characters are played better, and much less at the top. Unfortunately both came out the same time and the Paltrow version got more publicity. Sorry ...... I also love the new scene at the end. Well done to Kate Beckingsale! Therefore, if you are a Jane Austen fan, don't forget to look at this one.
