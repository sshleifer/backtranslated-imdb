I really enjoyed watching this movie about the Delany sisters. I knew about them, but it was all. This movie opened my eyes to their bravado and courage. What a few. What sacrifices they made to live life on their own terms. It's not just a movie for African Americans, but for all Americans. It's kind of a history lesson and a documentary role in one and combined with an entertaining cinema biography. The acting was better than anything, and we really get a look at the hardships these two sisters have been through for years. Both sisters are completely different. They came from a very loving and very strict family with high, perhaps even impossible, standards of perfection. It is sad to see Sadie's father refusing to allow his daughter to continue her boyfriend for a possible misunderstanding. I thoroughly recommend this movie and I'm glad I caught the other day on television.
