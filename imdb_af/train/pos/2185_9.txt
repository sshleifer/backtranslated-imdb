Poor Basil Rathbone, a selfish composer who lost his sparrow. He has been buying his lyrics and his music from various sources for some time. The problem is that two of the sources (Bing Crosby music) and (Mary Martin words) happen and fall in love. And then they discover what they did. Complications occur, but everything is right at the end. <br /> <br /> Crosby and Martin sing great. Mary signed a Paramount contract and at the same time doubled as a regular at Crosby's Kraft Music Hall Radio Show. For reasons I didn't understand, the film did not take audiences to her, so she returned to Broadway and in 1944 did One Touch and Venus and stayed there. <br /> <br /> In one of the few times he played Basil Rathbone makes it very good. His ego is constantly being deflated by Oscar Levant, and I'm surprised they didn't do any more movies together. <br /> <br /> As in most Crosby's Paramount vehicles, there are no large production numbers, but I agree with the previous reviewer about the tune title being done as an impromptu jam session in a pawnshop. Good work at all. <br /> <br /> A surprisingly original plot and wonderful entertainment.
