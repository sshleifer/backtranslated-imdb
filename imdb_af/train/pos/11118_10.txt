The "gangster" genre is now a worn-out topic that is too often subjected to parody. In retrospect, the series is a highlight of previous genres used by the genre. Fortunately, the authors made this mistake by creating a realism that was applied to it. The Sopranos is an epic crime story that illustrates it with the psychological depth characterized by subtle nuance, humor and unfinished violence. The main proton Tony Sopran is regarded as a dangerous general fear and moral values ​​by his crew, but Tony is of two persona who is the bestialist, while the other is in conflict with guilt and rebellion. With any inhibitions or contradictions, I still believe that Sopranos has the best ensemble cast of recent memory. All the things I consider, I can make an extensive statement on the series, but I won't. If there is ever a visual dictionary in global consumerism, these definitions seek out vital, ambiguous, relentless, epic, uncompromising, and the soprano's broken display will smile straight back.
