I'm not a fan of Adam Sandler. In fact, I don't think I've ever liked it all, and I saw him. The opening scene of this movie confirmed my worst fears. There was Adam Sandler, who plays a somewhat ridiculous character driving New York City on a scooter. He looks sorry and lost. Typical Sandler-type release character, I thought. I got up there and then. But when I got stuck with it, I actually discovered something I never knew: Adam Sandler can act! He is truly outstanding in this movie as Charlie, a lost and lonely figure, whose entire family (including the dog) was murdered in one of the hijacked aircraft on 9/11 and apparently disappeared with reality. Don Cheadle plays his former college roommate who unexpectedly joins Charlie again and assumes it as his goal to help him get better. Of course, Cheadle's Alan Johnson has his own problems and sources of unhappiness, and somehow these two men can help each other through their problems. The two of them made a completely credible team, and especially Sandler really made Charlie work through his emotions and feelings. It's not a Sandler comedy. If you are looking for it, go to some of his other, souls, things. It is a rather heavy film - sometimes sad, sometimes hopeful and always exciting. There are some funny parts in it. I loved the scene in which Charlie Alan convinced his partners to remind him of how hard he was in college, and then the conversation left them two. <br /> <br /> I personally didn't think Saffran Burrows added much to the movie as Donna, a clearly needy Johnson patient. The only reason for the character was (based on one flashback) that she looked like Charlie's late wife, but it never really developed, and I just didn't care much about the character. Look for the part of the judge, but played by Donald Sutherland, who I thought, splashed the party. But as far as I am concerned, it is Sandler's movie and a good performance for him. Definitely his best in my opinion. 8/10
