It would have been a sure fire if they only chose everyone else than John Abraham. This man is a terrible actor. These are comedy, drama, rubbish carts, etc. He stinks. It seemed as if Priyadarshan had realized it too, and he had pretty much chased him around like a monkey to make his solo screens a little funny. <br /> <br /> He's the only noticeable downside (there are some more annoying time slots) of an ABSOLUTE, hilarious movie different. Best comedy to come together in Bollywood since Hungama, IMO. Like Hungama, it is a situational comedy carried on the shoulders of a brilliant screenplay and of course Akshay Kumar. This is probably his best performance so far. He's better than a shoe for the best comedian at every award feature. AK was always good on comedy, but he took it on another level here. The body language, the facial expressions and the way he delivers each line. It's a genius performance. The packed theater was almost the entire length of the movie and I don't think I've ever seen such an atmosphere for a Bollywood movie here in the US. <br /> <br /> Garam Masala doesn't have a "main" heroine. This star 3 amazingly hot + pretty girls I thought did a pretty good job. Very sure they all make their debut. Paresh Rawal is solid as usual, although his routine wears himself for a while. Rajpal Yadav is his typical annoying self (sick of his over-the-top act in every movie). Rimi Sen has nothing to do. <br /> <br /> Overall, definitely worth it. I'll say it's FUNNIER as no access, and it says a lot. Could have been even better if they chose someone better than John Abraham. <br /> <br /> 8/10
