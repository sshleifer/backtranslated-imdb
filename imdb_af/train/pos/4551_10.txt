I have never seen such an amazing work in a movie as I did when I saw Daniel Day-Lewis Christy Brown in my left foot. From the scene, his role wasn't even over. He played the role of Christy Brown or at least disabled as he needed all by filming the movie and surgery because of the damage his superior act had on his back. For me, it is remarkable and through all the pain he has gained to do that role, I believe it is quite true to say he has used the most Oscar-worthy performance in history. He was so masterful in this difficult part that I believe no one could do it better or better than he did. Although I can't say it is the biggest movie of all time, I can say that how he played this impossible role and then continue to act until it doesn't even act any longer is the biggest footage I have ever see an actor do. Probably also a man.
