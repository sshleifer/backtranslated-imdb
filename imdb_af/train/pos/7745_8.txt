"Life is in the face of us ........ we must stay beautiful" <br /> <br /> Debut movie of one of the best artists in Belgium (he sings songs), Tom Barman. A long-awaited movie and --- happy happy joy for Flemish filmmaking --- really worth watching, and a promising piece of work! It brings us to life of 8 main characters living through a Friday and night. The title says a lot about how we spend time with them: as in Friday night's party we meet where they meet. <br /> <br /> It's rhythmic style is much thought. Wonderful use of music. It sometimes takes the top of the images and then you feel its power. Gainsbourg! QOTSA! The party scene (20minutes ???) is an exciting visual experience, the cause of the shot. It really keeps you in mind while sitting in a small place with lots of people having a big party ... so hard to shoot. <br /> <br /> Thank you Menij√®r Barman for making this daring movie It has been bad times for Flemish film entertainment for many years. You made my day!
