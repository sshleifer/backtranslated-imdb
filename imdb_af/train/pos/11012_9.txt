I wasn't even sure if I watched a documentary, propaganda movie or dramatic performance. I think the production time was a mix of all three. <br /> <br /> The dramatic plot was predictable. But you felt there would be some interesting scenes when the movie went on. We were able to see what realistic training arrangements and equipment were. <br /> <br /> When this movie came to me, it was nearing the end. The screens had a realism (at least as I saw it) that I haven't met before. You can put yourself in action and suggest the thoughts of the young fighters. It was mixed with the common problems of portraying passionate Japanese soldiers at a time when you think real Japanese actors will be somewhat scarce. <br /> <br /> The movie is excellent as a source of the state of the American mindset in 1943 as the war was waged with Japan. Also of interest was a dig at the Japanese on the help the US has given Japan in recent years.
