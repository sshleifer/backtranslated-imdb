I loved this movie! It's really bizarre, extremely funny, morbid, witty ... It's not a good idea to tell about the contents of the movie, because then I'll give the result! You have to see it without knowing what it is all about! Everything is connected and she has why and because. It starts subtly and then things start rolling faster and faster until they run out on the most insane eruption you can imagine! It's even fun to watch the movie the second time, once you know all the "tricks". The actors are excellent, especially Ivan Trojan, whose final scenes are a true masterpiece! I recommend this movie, it's one of the most original I've ever seen!
