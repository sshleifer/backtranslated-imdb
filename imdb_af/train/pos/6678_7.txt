I didn't really expect much from this movie, but it wasn't bad; Actually, it was pretty good. This movie features some of the funniest pieces I ever saw of a movie. Now it doesn't say it's one of the funniest movies of all time, but I have been laughing pretty hard at some parts. "Police ruled suicide in my father's death. He said he hit a lift. Now this movie is not for everyone, its mostly silly humor like Zoolander or Dodgeball; so if you hated this movie, I would probably recommend staying clear, overall it was a nice movie, about a group of superhero wannabes, who eventually eventually become real heroes, a very overstated comedy that many people probably haven't seen, because as I watched it before, it expected it to be absolute rubbish, and after watching this movie, I finally understood why this movie could collect such a superstar cast that Ben Stiller, William H. Macy, Hank Azaria and even the kid of Good Burger, because the Mystery Man is full with an excellent comic writing period of 7 out of 10. A very big surprise.
