This film was excellent - the emotional power of Tom Hulce and Ray Liotta's performances brought tears to my eyes and joy in my heart - this film shows us that there is still hope in the world. If this movie came out at the end of 1988, Hulce would certainly be nominated for a best actor Oscar in place of Rain Man. Definitely a must-see!
