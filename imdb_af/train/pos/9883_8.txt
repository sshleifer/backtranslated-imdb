It ran for 8 seasons, but it was early in 1959, and last, in the fall of 1965, it was shorter than the seasons 2-7. CBS chief William Paley canceled Rawhide's production after watching the first show of season 8 in September 1965 because he did not keep the series without Eric Fleming as Gil Favor, which left after season 7. The last new episode was broadcast in November 1965. The lonely 1966 CBS broadcast, on January 4, 1966, was a revival. <br /> <br /> I often wondered why Rawhide didn't switch to color filming for the past season? Most of the great western of the 1960s turned into color in 1965. CBS exhibited in the fall this autumn, for many of their sitcoms, but Westerns like Gunsmoke and Rawhide stayed in black and white. Gunsmoke was the last western (and last-time network series to switch to color) on September 17, 1966 for the Snap Decision episode.
