It is a great movie for true romantics and sports enthusiasts. <br /> <br /> Drew Barrymore is at her best in this movie. As a Drew fan it was quite nice to make her shine after having had several flops. I had my doubts about Jimmy Fallon, but he completely delivered Ben the comic, sport-crazy darling. The comedy in this movie is wonderful. There were several laughter aloud moments. <br /> <br /> Their first date began to rock when he appeared at her apartment with flowers and she was sick to her stomach to eat a new place. earlier in the day. Instead of leaving, he helps to take care of her, to make her change in pajama, and then clean the pussy on her toilet and tell the bathroom that she's a lot of lady-like ... no pieces is not. "Everything goes well between Ben and Lindsay all winter, but then the baseball season starts. Lindsay begins to realize just how obsessive Ben is at the Red Sox and why is this seemingly good man still single. She tries to shut it down and thinks it's a good thing, as she has a busy work schedule and she won't feel guilty about working extra hours while playing games. She even buys all the books on The Red Sox she can find, including one on 'The Curse of Bambino'. <br /> <br /> Everything goes pretty well until Lindsay has a false alarm that missed her time. It makes them both realize how serious they are and she begins to question whether it is the person she wants to be with. A very moving role in the movie is after she told him she has her time. It shows that unfortunately he is a baby-size Red Sox jersey he just bought if she was pregnant. <br /> <br /> Eventually Ben tries to show her how important she is and decides to go to her birthday birthday. Some after she said, "I had to check my calendar and when I saw that there was a Red Sox / Yankee game, I knew I was going to stare." After the party Ben told her that it was the best night of his life. Shortly after he received a call from his friend who went to the game, he got up for the party and said to him, "This was the best game ever!" Ben freaks out to miss it and eventually hurt Lindsay when she said, "A few minutes ago you said it was the best night of your life." He says "it was a few minutes ago." <br /> <br /> So they divorce for a while, he realizes how immature his obsession is and decides to sell his season tickets he inherited from his uncle, because if he didn't do that, "remind him too much of what he gave them. " Lindsay finds out by a friend and decides to stop him from realizing he is doing it for her. It ends very sweetly and shows how his childhood love for baseball is overshadowed by a whole new deeper love, Lindsay. They still go to the games and even go to the World Series and St. Louis and it's a happy ending everywhere. 2 inches up !!
