I never read Shakespeare's Hamlet before I watched it, but I had a Shakespeare book with me and could follow the dialogue accordingly. My view of the movie may be partially biased as I have never read the play, but I have taken the film's grip. Shakespeare is undoubtedly one of the best writers ever to live, and Hamlet's story is certainly one of his best achievements. <br /> <br /> But now the movie ... <br /> <br /> I found that all the actors in the movie had a good understanding of what they were saying and so it was good articulate. Leonardo in Romeo and Juliet is nothing compared to Kenneth Branagh and the King. The thing I like about it was that it worked very well as a "MOVIE" and not as a play you are studying. You don't have to be rich with Shakespeare to make sure of all the misery you have to go through. I would recommend this movie to a wide audience. <br /> <br /> It's me two cents.
