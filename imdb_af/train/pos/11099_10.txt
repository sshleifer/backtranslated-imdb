Chase created a real phenomenon with The Sopranos. All the movie is strong, but Falco and Gandolfini earn every inch of those Emmies. Anyone who doubts this need just needs a few episodes; especially from the first few seasons. James Gandolfini is absolutely terrible, very scary, and you still find him loving him. He is fascinated by him. <br /> <br /> Many people I talked about The Sopranos (who hasn't seen it yet) will say, "I'm just not a fan of mafia movies / shows". Whatever. Start - don't walk - and get it. The same people usually like "E.R." but I do not care much about hospitals. It's not about the context.
