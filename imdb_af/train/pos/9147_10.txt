As a fantastic Prince fan of the past three to four years, I really can't believe I just came around to watch "Purple Rain". The brand new 2-disc birthday special edition led me to buy it. Wow, I was really looking forward to seeing it, but I wasn't prepared for how electricity it actually is. Prince's musical performances throughout the movie are nothing short of surprising - he really has the movements in this one. I am very familiar (from repeated listening) with the classic "Purple Rain" album and all its songs, but to see it in the context of the movie, change your perception of the songs and lyrics, such as COMPUTER BLUE, THE BEAUTIFUL OUR, WHEN CROSS AND PURPLE RAIN HIM. There is something indescribably hypnotized about the scenes where Prince and the Revolution are acting. The last songs BABY, I AM A STAR and I will die for you, how much energy and mere talent Prince had in his mid-20s (he is flooded!) It blew me away. It even makes Michael Jackson look like he's even in his peak years. <br /> <br /> Prince shows you how to win the girl's dreams - Drive her to a lake, let her jump, then drive down - totally hilarious afterwards. <br /> <br /> Some of the screens are many 1980s and are inadvertently hilarious, but it adds to the overall charm of the movie. Morris Day is the coolest cat on the block (and hilarious), and if his group The Time does the BIRD, you see Morris Day and Jerome Benton lighten the stage Minneapolis funk style. I love their dance in this little bit and how Benton offers Morris a mirror performance. <br /> <br /> I can't wait to watch it again, I really can't! Extra's are great - especially since a young Eddie Murphy admits pre-Beverly Hills Cop he is a "Prince groupie".
