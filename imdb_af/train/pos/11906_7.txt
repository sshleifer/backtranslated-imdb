This documentary on schlockmeister William Castle takes some cheap shots in the naive 50s-60s environment in which he did his most distinctive work - look at the funny, stupid people with the ghost glass - but it is also loving and alive, with particular fierce comments by John Waters, who at that time was the target audience for such things, and from the Castle's daughter, who loved her father and was also very vigilant about how he practiced his craft. (We never find out what happened to the other Castle's descendants.) The movies were not very good, it made clear, but his marketing of them was brilliant, and he was a lovely, hard-working family man. Fun people stop like Straight Jacket's Diane Baker, who looks good, and Anne Helm, whom she has replaced on the attack of star Joan Crawford. Darryl Hickman explodes everything in the giggle, with the joy of working with Castle on The Tingler, and there is plenty of footage to give us an idea of ​​the level of Castle's talent. Not very high, but very energetic. An enjoyable look at a time when audiences were easier, and it makes you nostalgic for simpler movie day.
