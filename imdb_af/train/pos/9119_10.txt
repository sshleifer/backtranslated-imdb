An interesting way to look at how we act so often as humans is sometimes blinded by our desire to achieve perfection that sometimes destroys the basis of what we are trying to achieve. It also addresses the problem of how we tend to ignore those of us who are not so outspoken, and it may miss a great opportunity. The injection of comedy also makes the movie a pleasant experience to watch. One must see for everyone interested in a reflective but comical look at life. I look forward to your next product. Hope you continue to provide us with quality entertainment. Excellent work ...... Joanne
