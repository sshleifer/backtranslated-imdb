Deep humorous but honest comedy about a lot of adults (Bill Paxton, Julie Warner, Kevin Pollak, Elizabeth Perkins, Vincent Spano, Matt Craven and Diane Lane) who spent a week following Tomawka, a camp in Ontario, Canada former consuelor (Alan Arkin). Author / director Mike Binder has on his experience in the same camp as the main source of creating a soft and understanding yarn that makes sense. Also, the movie has very funny moments, some of which are quite bizarre like my favorite, one involving the use of masking tape. Newton Thomas Sigel ("The Usual Suspects", "Three Kings") presents the film with some impressive shots of Canadian wilderness. Under the film, Sam Raimi, director of "THE EVIL DEAD" movies and "The Gift", here is Arkin's messy right hand. One more thing, this movie reassured me that a camp should not be an area of ​​bloody murders.
