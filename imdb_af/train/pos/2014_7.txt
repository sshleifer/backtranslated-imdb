Mel Torme and Victor Borge serve in their younger years to make this film interesting - and especially to view a young Sinatra on the sunny side of the 30 and definitely carry it his "yes, I am a popular singer, but hardly an actor yet "stage. Michele Morgan is an annoying, foolish presence, and Jack Haley is an actor whose appeal has always been completely lost to me. Leon Erroll is stupid, as always, but generally pretty funny. 7 stars of a potential 10 is about the right "grade" because with the combination of its positive aspects, coupled with the lack of much of a story and a foolish one and the aforementioned annoyances, it is overall average on its best. Most of the fascination is with the performance of the three entertainment icons in their early years.
