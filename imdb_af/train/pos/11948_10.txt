"Match Point" and now "Scoop" both convinced me that Woody Allen is not just doing a neat job in England, and that Scarlett Johansson is the right player, but confirms what I have known for years. Don't focus on New York's neurotic empire. In this case, Johansson plays journalist student Sondra Pransky, who puts the sorcerer Sid Waterman (Allen) in his vanishing room, where she meets the ghost of murdered reporter Joe Strombel (Ian McShane), who tells her that the serial killers who have harassed London by millionaire Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman). So, she learns to know him, and ... well, I don't know how much I can tell you without giving it away. But I can say that it's probably Allen's funniest movie over the years. There is his ubiquitous unique humorous style (especially his line of religion). <br /> <br /> So you're sure to keep this movie. If nothing else, it will make you fall in love with London. But mostly, it's just as damn hilarious. Even if you don't like Woody Allen, you should love this one.
