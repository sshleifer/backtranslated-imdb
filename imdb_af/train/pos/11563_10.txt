I saw it many years after the television series and initially I didn't care for it. Then, when my memory of the series withdrew over time, I looked again and found it absolutely hilaries. Based on the play by Neil Simon, it's not opened to the big screen, and it's one of its strengths. Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are brilliant as Oscar and Felix, and the supporting role play is wonderful, especially John Fielder and Vinnie. Even now, certain moments can make me laugh - Felix interrupts Oscar in the midst of a dinner match match. Oscar hit Felix around the apartment and rushed Felix, the giggling 'Pigeon Sisters' got through Felix's sobriety, and of course, the legendary cafeteria scene (later ripped off by Nora Ephron's 'When Harry Met Sally'). Sharp dialogue also. If the boys think Felix has taken an overdose, Oscar says: "They can be vitamins! He can be the healthiest in the room!". Great!
