I first saw this movie almost 21 years ago when it was an ITV (before the days of cable and satellite) Matinee. I was down with the mumps and I was completely wrapped in the film. I got it on purchased video for about 10 years and I want to get a DVD copy of it. David Niven is my favorite actor of all time and I think it is a travesty he had overlooked so many times when the Oscars came. I also think the queen had to curl him because he did so much for the film industry so much more than Sean Connery or Anthony Hopkins. The way the black and white movie switches to color and back is well done and the film has such star actors such as Roger Livesy, Marius Goring and an early appearance by Richard Attenborough.
