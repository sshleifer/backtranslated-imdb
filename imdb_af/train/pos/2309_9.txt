It was life-changing, it was really !!! The Man In The Moon is an awesome experience to watch. The play was fantastic, the story line was great and it was a perfect start for Reese Witherspoon's career. I don't see how anyone can't love this movie. Sure, it's not the best movie ever, though it was close, but it was very amusing to watch, and I even had a big laugh at one of the jokes and a lot of other laughs. Of course, there were also some crying hearts out of your heart, but this movie was enlightening and it brightens your day, although you have to get a little depressed from now on. I can believe I didn't win this movie at least one award, and I can't believe it was seen by so few people on this site. Seeing this movie if you don't want it is definitely touching.
