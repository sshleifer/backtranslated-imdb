I love this movie. As a child, it was one of the first movies I saw that made me flinch. Sure, it's soft now, but back in the day it was wonderful. Dentists are one thing so many people fear, so why not make a movie about a killer dentist? It's cute, it's fun, sometimes it's scary, but it's great. And I always had a love for medical horror. And Corbin Bernsen plays dr. Party tones perfect, no one could have done better. And for a low budget horror movie, the effects and so are pretty good. And I also love the theme music, the movie is fine. Ken Foree (Dawn of the Dead) is also in this one who plays a nosy cop, and does a good job. There is a fair amount of blood, and some very cool torture / deaths. Check this one!
