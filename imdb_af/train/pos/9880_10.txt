This film was made in 1943 when I thought Judy was at her peak (looks sensible). In her previous movie For Me and My Gal, people often say she is challenged. Well in this movie she looks perfect. She is beautiful and shows that she has a flair for comedy. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is hilarious, especially when it comes to arranging an audition with John Thornway. One of the funniest scenes is in my opinion Judy's version of Lady Macbeth and when John is looking for her to give her a spanking. <br /> <br /> One criticism I have is that there is a hole in the plot when John and Lily fall in love. I mean one minute he despises and the next they go out on a date, then the next time they meet, they fall in love. <br /> <br /> Another point I didn't like was at opening hours. If I were Lily, I'd be furious with John, but she's not ... it just doesn't make sense. <br /> <br /> All in all, though, I would have to give this movie a 10 because it's just wonderful and almost perfect.
