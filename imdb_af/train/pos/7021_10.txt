I had the pleasure of attending a performance of The Pacific and Eddy almost at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival. This movie caught my attention for a while when I stumbled across an article about it in Jalouse magazine. Seems interesting at the moment, but nothing too exciting. Anyway, I saw it on the festival program and decided to check it out. All I can say is that I was speechless when the end credits started rolling. This is one of the most beautiful and refreshing films I've seen in some time. The photography, art direction, acting, and especially directing, were seamless and impeccable. Nothing is spelled out for you in this movie and makes you think. Something that makes a large majority of films the exact opposite today. The dialogue was carefully crafted and although this writing is not a wall-to-wall talk, the characters are very deliberate and meaningful. <br /> <br /> It's definitely one of those movies that earn a second impression and the more you see it, the more things you notice. It's a very layered and intelligent movie. Not sure when or where it's playing again, but a definite must see for movie enthusiasts.
