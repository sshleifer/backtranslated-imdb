Great fun. I accompanied 8 friends to a preview of this movie. We came to see the one, but after 10 minutes wondering what the gate we had ourselves at this time, the jokes became funny and they seemed to be funny throughout the film. In the first part you just ask yourself about these 'malinski' and 'bellini' things (there are many more examples of this lingo) and because they repeat the same jokes (with different twists), they become more beautiful and funny. In search of this malinski, all the main characters are introduced as the first to wake up to the next. Until half of the movie was over, we didn't even know the name of this movie, because there were no opening credits and we went to this sneak look, but we probably had a good time. The house was loaded (about 250 people) and I think half of them didn't like it and the other half loved the movie. If you like strange comic movies with a great dialogue, you'll love it. Apart from Clooney, this movie earns a lot better than the 5.6 IMDB rating I had when writing it, but if more ppl saw it, it's sure it'll go. 7.0 is pretty I think, I'll give it an 8 out of 10. (10 out of 10 after a few beers) <br /> <br />
