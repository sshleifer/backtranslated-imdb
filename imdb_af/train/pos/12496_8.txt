For years, we've watched all the horror movies that come out, from the dull Hollywood commands like Saw 2, to horrible indie releases that are totally unacceptable. We are suffering from all the bad movies hoping to find little gems like Dark. Stay. "<br /> <br /> We managed to catch a show of this movie at Shriekfest 2005. The audience loved it and I believe it has won the best film award in the end. <br /> < While it may not have the budget or strength of studio movies, it punches a serious punch in the creepy atmosphere and fright category, as well as the acting and cinematography, but it's the direction this movie makes worthwhile. The story and characters evolve into just the right fit to offer fantastic scares. <br /> <br /> Editing and visual fx are also great, and while many horror movies fail to use music to their advantage, add the score for "Dark Remains" only adds to the creepiness. <br /> <br /> I know the movie showed up at a lot of festivals, but nobody's near me, so I can't wait to hear it finally come to DVD, trust me, even if you are sick about the current state of horror movies, g ee this one a chance ... you won't regret it!
