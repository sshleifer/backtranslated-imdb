Kim Novak is a prowl witch for a mortal lover, and James Stewart is her choice. Scintillating comedy of ways, from the Broadway stage; shot by James Wong Courts in Witch Color, and performed by a sterling cast. Ernie Kovacs is wonderful as the constantly upset writer Redlitch. I love this movie, though few others look. Kim alone makes it a winner in my book. Ha! My # 5 movie from 1958.
