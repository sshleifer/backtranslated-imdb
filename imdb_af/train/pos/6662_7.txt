Gandhi My Father is a well-made film. It depicts the life of Gandhiji's oldest son Harilal beautifully. His character, his differences with his father, his love for his family, his desire to stand on his own, his failure, his ego. Akshaye Khanna justifies Harilal's role. Not just him, everyone did well in the roles they played. Darshan Jariwala is the best on the screen Gandhiji I've ever seen. But I will cut three points because there were few shortcomings. <br /> <br /> First, the movie was fifteen and twenty minutes longer than it should have had. Secondly, the film needs more research on Harilal's character. Someone seems incomplete. His relationship with his brothers was also not shown. There was no mention of any other child of Gandhiji in the whole movie. I believe that the character like Harilal should have at least some differences, including his brothers, in the light of the selfish nature of Harilal. <br /> <br /> Anyway, despite some shortcomings, I enjoyed the movie.
