The daughter's words are poetry: "I can't go back a year. I have to come to a hotel room." "I lost my blue scarf in a sea of ​​leaves." "The marble is flying in ... he just gave us a washing machine. This is the deal." "I'm pulverized by this latest thing." ".. Series and cats are a bit boring for a long time boring." A little rotten nest, mouse hole, I'd like to be better. "And there is wisdom in the mother's words," Yes, the pleasure is mine. " "This little book will keep me straight, straight like a dye." "Always do everything right." "Where do you come from?" "... bring me my little radio, I need professional music." "I'm your mother. Remember me? ' The mother / daughter relationship is drawn in this beautiful film. It's a Mother's Day movie.
