Initially I had the reaction, many people left it after I saw it: those shots of fat people were healthy, and so on. are cheap shots in some way. OK, so he does diane arbus. . . whatever. . . but it was not long before I realized that it was not done in an inhumane way. As the images unfolded, I felt that the problem was completely heard: we were conditioned by Hollywood and also movies from just about anywhere to actually feel. something unholy, something not to be shown. If all that film is offered, it will be a lot. But the story of the woman with the abused boyfriend and his drunk friend hits like a bunch of bricks: very eloquent storytelling, incredible performances, and to think the scene is improvised. That blonde man is a brilliant actor. Eventually I want to contradict those who say this film is about how pathetic all these people are. The old man at stake with the woman who eventually dances him is quite an OK character who breaks that form, and doesn't over-light the movie by seeing him. yes his dog is killed. It is not a rosy picture of the world, but it is not. . . totally hopeless. Anyway, I felt the filmmaker very grateful for making such a beautiful movie. I won't say that each of the wires was as strong as the strongest, but I say this movie basically gets the hole and will highly recommend it. . .
