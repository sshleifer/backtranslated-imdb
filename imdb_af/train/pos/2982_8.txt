I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I am convinced that Matt Stone and Trey Parker are comic geniuses of our time. They have the incredible ability to add this level of absurdity to the pop culture and make it reasonable but in a realistic way ... if that makes sense. This makes South Park especially funny. Once you are beyond the fact that it is probably the most vulgar and fearless cartoon, you see every message the message being conveyed. This is evident in BASEketball. Although directed by David Zucker and quite reasonable, it has a genuine message about corporate America and the shame that big league sport is. I'm also a fan of sports, so I find this movie hilarious at times because it's so true in that bizarre way people hate to love. The opening prologue is brilliant ... tears from the laugh every time I see the soccer players, Riverdance starts! Some may not like this movie because it's not everyone's cup of tea ... but just like South Park, once you look past the absurdity, it has a real message conveyed by literal comic genius. I gave this movie 8 out of 10 stars.
