I loved this movie, and I'm one of the older people who didn't suppose to enjoy it, or so it seems. No, this movie is not deep - who cares? These kind of movies are never. But strangely, there's a message in it. It's that we each have the potential to be what we want to be. <br /> <br /> Parker Posey is great in this movie. I always thought she had a bit similar to Katharine Hepburn. So, it's good to see both Hepburn and Posey filming librarians (Hepburn's is The Desk Set). All librarians, especially those with a sense of humor, should see Party Girl. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie an 8. It's not a good movie by film, though there are some nice shots. in it. But it is incredibly charming and entertaining.
