Cinderella is a beautiful young woman who is cruelly treated by her evil stepmother and step sister. One day a ball will be held in honor of the prince, but Cinderella has no chance of going, for her stepmother and step sister will not allow her. With the help of her fairy-tale grandmother and her animal friends, she was on the ball, with the warning to return at midnight. At the ball she meets the handsome Prince Charming. When the clock strikes midnight, she walks home, behind one of her glass enclosures. With the help of her animal friends, her true identity is revealed. She and the prince will marry later, and they are always happy. <br /> <br /> Cinderella, released 56 years ago, was a great box office success, and it remains the public today. It has a well written script. The characters are memorable. The songs, including a dream is a wish your heart makes, "so it is love," and the great "Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo", help to tell the story. It was my favorite movie growing up, and it didn't lose any of its charm. A true Disney masterpiece! Recommended. 10/10 P.S. The recent DVD edition is the best way to appreciate this movie, including featurettes, deleted scenes, music video, vintage radio programs and a restored print of the movie!
