Well, before I saw this movie, I wasn't really sure it would be my cup of tea. How wrong I was! I thought it was one of the best movies I watched for a long time, a true family classic. The story of a young evacuee and his new 'commit' father, this movie flashes all the boxes. I didn't read the book (maybe it's a good thing, and I enjoyed the movie more), but regarding the story I really can't see bad points, which I chose 10 out of 10 (and I hardly ever think anything guarantees top marks!). By the time William proclaimed, "I CAN DO MY BIKE, DAD!" I put my heart out (anyone who saw it will understand it, I'm sure). Really heartwarming, and definitely recommended.
