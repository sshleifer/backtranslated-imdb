Looking at David and Bathsheba is a much better way to get your Bible books going to Sunday School. Despite a script that is sometimes unintentional, the movie is highly entertaining. The studio system had faults, but it did not save any cost when an abundant production was requested. Peck portrays King David as a fun but plump poet who committed to the murder of a sexy Bathsheba, Susan Hayward. Raymond Massey as Prophet Nathan delivers his usual saturn and fiery achievement. Find the silent fencer Francis X. Boesman as King Saul and a young Gwen Verdon as a dancer. Hooray for Old Testament and Hollywood.
