I found this episode as one of the funniest things I've ever seen. The South Park creators did the best spoof of a Romero movie I've ever seen. They really touched on Romero's underlying social commentary that he made with each of his films. I would like to know what George Romero's opinion on this episode was. I'm sure it was pure positive! Keep his true vision for his zombie epics intact! Most spoofs deal with the pure gore without thinking the viewer like Romero is trying to do with his films. I think if a zombie outbreak happened, we might actually be worried about our property values ​​before our lives as shown in this episode!
