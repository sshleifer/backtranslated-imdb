If I haven't seen this movie in about 20 years, I'm still impressed with it's heavy impact and star rating. Of course, one is Mr. Mickey Rooney is indeed immeasurable in his role as the leading 'Killer'. (Referring to another review here, none other than Orson Welles has named Mickey Rooney's name as the biggest movie actor.) I also remember the jazzy-brassy score and the sheer black-and-white photography. I like the Mick's last line before going out for his lead poisoning dose. (I think the Stranglers highlight it for a line in one of their songs. Get a grip on yourself.) It's a good movie and unfair grave. Let's get it out! His note: A recent Film Review magazine made a big headline about Don Segal's Babyface Nelson, a few years before "Last Mile" and also starring Mickey Rooney. Another rave of the Mick's intense and sympathetic performance. Maybe it's the beginning of a ground for appreciation for some really better movies.
