I remember Parker Posey on "As The World Turns" before she became the Queen of Independent films. In this film, Posey shows her potential as a top active actress. In this film with supporting cast that includes Omar Townsend as Moustafa, a Lebanese immigrant who works as a street vendor falafel, striving to become a teacher. The supporting film has a wonderful actress who plays her godmother and only family-related such as Judy, the librarian who is style-old, dedicated and menopausal. Posey like Mary learns that she should grow up and grow up. If she loses her library clerk's position, she realizes how much she misses it as a place in her life. Mary's life is surrounded by friends in the Lower East Side Village of New York City before mingling with yuppies. This movie is pretty good for an independent and I got Parker Posey as Maria and other characters in other movies.
