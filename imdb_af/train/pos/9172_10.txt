I studied Charlotte Bronte's high school novel, which left me with an impressive impression. Here was a beautiful novel about a young woman's struggle to find love and acceptance in the dark times of Victorian England. This young woman was Jane Eyre, a poor and simple character with a strong mind and will of her own. Her story, which Bronte said through Jane's own eyes, was both sad and inspiring. <br /> <br /> As part of our study we looked at the 1983 adaptation of the story, and it blew me away. The mini-series not only made the effort to remain true to Bronte's original text and the essence of the story, but the actors who portrayed the characters were just wonderful. Zelah Clarke (Jane Eyre) and Timothy Dalton (Jane's lover, named Rochester) have brilliantly captured the essence of their characters. I can't imagine anyone else in their roles. (The other performances of Rochester in other versions such as the 2006 version lack the passion, energy, and tenderness needed to accurately depict Rochester. I say that Timothy Dalton comes on top because he has all these features in his portrayal of Rochester owns, Clarke doesn't just look Jane Eyre, but she takes Jane's quiet but sturdy and passionate nature brilliantly, keeping in her emotions, like the Jane's book, the right moments in the story, but leaving her in fire Come out in Jane's passionate scenes, the chemistry that Clarke and Dalton put together in their screens is also credible and reliable for Jane and Rochester's dedicated relationship.) Also, the supporting actors fit their roles perfectly, and the sets fit the Gothic nature of the story. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend this version of the classic Bronte story. If you haven't read the book before, consider this production as a true introduction to this beautiful story.
