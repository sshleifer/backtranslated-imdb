Gus Van Sant made excellent films. I'm really a fan. <br /> <br /> But I can't help but feel that the cerebral edge of Tom Robbins's book "Even Cowgirls Get the Blues" is lost in translation to the big screen. Alone, Tom Robbins and Gus Van Sant are incredible visionaries and talent towers. Eventually, however, this one just didn't work. <br /> <br /> It's not that the characters aren't well-developed, or the plot and content didn't come alive. It's just that our imagination is much stronger when we read a book like this. We are taken away to a different time and place and we sometimes think the worst and / or best and add to the overall roller coaster of the book as it unfolds neatly according to the author's accuracy. However, movies can leave one with less of the imagination and emotion roller coaster that detracts from the overall experience. This is what I believe happened here. <br /> <br /> I suggest reading the book!
