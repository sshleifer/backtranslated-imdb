Have you ever read Jim Thompson? He is hard-boiled noir with the extreme fatalism and misanthropy I've ever experienced. There are seldom private detectives in his work - only losers, psychotics and small-scale artists. This movie, Thompson said, "If God made any real mistakes in this world, it was to give us a will to live if we had no excuse for it." Each character in the film balances on the razor's edge between surreal and creepy realism. There is slick, twinkling Uncle Bud, played by Bruce Dern and ghostly doctor Doc Goldman, played by George Dickerson. Jason Patric gives a wonderful, often heartbreaking performance as Kid Collins, a not-too-bright, shy ex-fighter who is more afraid of himself than anyone else. Rachel Ward is Fay, the sexy femme fatale we can't really find out. It's not your standard movie noir, nor is it the intention. After Dark My Sweet, along with The Grifters, two excellent adaptations of novels by one of my favorite writers, Jim Thompson.
