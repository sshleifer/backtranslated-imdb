There is nothing really to be said of "The Odd Couple", and it is no surprise that Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are making a huge comedian team. But there's something so underdeveloped about Neil Simon's adaptation of his hit stage game to make it look more like a shit on a sketch comedy show as a full movie. I didn't see the scene, but suppose the screen version is pretty faithful, since Simon wrote it so the flaws can't be blamed on a stage-by-screen adjustment. There are some interesting ideas in this story: two newly divorced men who immediately fall into traditional married roles when they become households because no one else knows - that Simon never completely fleshes. However, there are many worse ways to kill a few hours.
