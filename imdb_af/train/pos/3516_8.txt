Ella was excellent, Franchot was inevitably over (but he played similar parts in other films like "The Man on the Eiffel Tower") and Alan was almost non-existent, but the movie was definitely "excited". <Br /> <br /> * soft spoiler before *: I wonder how many times Elisa Cook curled in his films, but I want to remember several other examples. I will avoid calling the killer, but I think it is obviously obvious because of the plot "thriller" claims. <br /> <br /> Very well done, but dated film noire (for example: everyone smoked like crazy and the police were really stocking characters. And no dead bodies ever appeared, unlike today's gore festivals .) In the familiar short-table tables format of the period. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10.
