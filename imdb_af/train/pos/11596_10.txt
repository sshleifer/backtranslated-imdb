I saw this movie when I was 7 years old - 33 years ago - and I never forgot this movie! I was deeply touched and moved by the brave boy and the beautiful eagle. And I just couldn't believe it when he turned into an eagle, just when everyone in the theater thought he was going to die. <br /> <br /> My sister was in the movie with me and I recently asked her if she remembered the movie, we saw with the boy and the eagle and she said she remembered it as if we were yesterday just seen. So it's not just me. <br /> <br /> This movie is a MUST SEE !!! <br /> <br /> You will never forget it - just like my sister and I ...
