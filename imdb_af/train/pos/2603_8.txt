Unfortunately, director Amos Guttman died of Aids-related diseases this year, so we didn't know how many more gay-related films we had from him. I found this used DVD, from Cinevista, on Amazon, but none of his other works seems to be available. Hessed Mufla (Amazing Grace) contains full frontal male nudity, at least in magazines, which becomes a desirable dream sequence. and some drug use. This is the story of two families who come or try it, but the mothers, the girls and the gay boys all have their own problems to find out. Jonathan (played by Gal Hoyberger) meets the next neighbor, Thomas, who obviously has his own problems. The translations are also a little poor, or Guttman may have barely kept the conversation, for a little mystery. If I see this, I get the feeling that we don't get the whole story, but that's right. Throw a cute gay roommate ex-lover Miki (Aki Avni, who did many projects, mostly Isreali TV). Lots of smoke. Very worrying about the mothers. A great blues song "All Night Long Blues" performed by an unknown female artist; If she is listed in the credits, it is unfortunately not translated into English. Nice to see mothers and brothers and sisters who treat gay relationships with respect, like any other relationship. But then the US is always this way years behind other countries. A good way to spend 98 minutes ... I wanted to see more of it. Win awards at several film festivals, to IMDb and the film jacket.
