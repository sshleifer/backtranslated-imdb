Nifty little episode played mostly for laughter, but with a clever pop of excitement. Somehow, a Martian boarded a demolished bus on his way to nowhere, but what a passenger it is (talk about your illegal immigrants!). Overall supporting role, from Wild Eye Jack Elam (after a shameless hamming), to sexy Jean Willes (if she's the Martian, I say let's open the boundaries!), John Hoyt (the most obvious suspect), along with famous faces John Archer and Barney Phillips (and a good turn from Bill Kendis as bus driver). Make for a very entertaining half hour, even if the action is limited to a single set.
