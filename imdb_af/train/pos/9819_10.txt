It's a good movie from the lost age of reactionary drama for television. My everyday favorite actor, Robert Culp, skillfully sets a course through ongoing liberal equity and belief in the system, the conservatism of the knees and the fear of crime and murderous psychosis. The teens are a collection of pure bad stereotypes, and the ultimate message of this film is to make episodes of Dragnet in comparison. But what really shines in this is the great fit of the film, the build up of fear and paranoia for degrees, as well as the feel of the entire California environment. The cars are also very good, as I remember. I give this movie a 10, and I defend someone to watch this movie and not enjoy every minute. Remember, just because it's made for television doesn't mean it's not good art.
