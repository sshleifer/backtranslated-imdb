This film is arranged by Renny Harlin the Finnish miracle. Stallone is Gabe Walker. Cat and Mouse on the mountains with relentless terrorists. Renny Harlin knows how to target action film. Stallone needs this role to get back on track. Snowy mountain is very good place for action film and who is better to direct film where snow, ice, cold and bad weather is like Finnish man. Action is good! Music in the movie is spectacular. The bad guy is John Litghow, other star Micheal Rooker (serialkiller portrait), Janine Turner (Strong Medicine). It's placed in a beautiful location and it's a very exciting movie. Overall good movie **** / ***** <br /> Remember Extreme ääliöt: special collectors edition, with good extras. Come straight to Finland straight to video.
