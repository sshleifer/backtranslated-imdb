All I hear is how poor the animation was. It may not be the same as everyone expects, but look at it. Will you expect perfection in hell? It is my belief that the animation has been made urgently and eagerly. It was great to see her character transformation in this movie, as it would probably be as close to action as we ever would. I hope very soon for a sequel. If we want a living action, I think we can be better with Chastity or Purgatori. I don't think Lady Death will transfer well to film. But be what it may be. It is my own personal belief that all the naysayers about this movie are dead. No pun is meant.
