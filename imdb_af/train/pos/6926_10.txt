The narrative confirms the classic image of good to evil in the form of a struggle between brother and brother. The main character, Lin Macadam, played by James Stewart, represents justice and justice. His brother, who plays under Dutch Henry Brown, who is played by Stephen McNally, stands for the classic stage coach who has robbed Western exorcism, driven by his brother for killing their father. The world of the story is the classic Dystopian west where the only way to prevent its residents from killing each other is to take away their sidearms as soon as they enter the town. The man responsible for keeping this law and order is the classic Western lawyer Wyat Earp. <br /> <br /> In addition, such flat characters are typical of the western, such as the murderous Indian warrior, the besieged cavalry and the distressed girl in distress. <br /> <br /> Another key archetype in this film, which gives the film's name, is a personal Winchester rifle. The weapon can be regarded as an allegory for the rewards given to those who do things honestly. Once stolen from its rightful owner, it brings a tragedy to all who come into contact with it. In this sense, it looks like other such icons as the Holy Grail in the Raiders of the Lost Ark, and the blood color letter in Saving Private Ryan. It gives the film an element of surrealism that is usually absent from Western, a genre that is not known for esoteric themes and symbols. <br /> <br /> To be essentially a revenge movie, share this element with many other examples of the genre, such as Jack Arnold's No Name on the Bullet and Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven. <br /> <br /> There is also a tacit theme of rape in Winchester '73. Waco Johnny Dean, one of the film's villains, plays very effectively by Dan Duryea, kidnapping a woman after killing her husband. The fleeting cowboy toy with the soft-footed man, and sends him like a caricature of a cat hitting an insect before biting his head. Waco Johnny Dean finally gets what comes to him after he got in touch with the ominous Winchester gun. <br /> <br /> The main story of Winchester '73 recalls the mythological story of Jason and his quest for the gold fleece, as told in Apollonius's Argonautica. Both stories deal with the acquisition of a sacred object that has a kind of intangible quality. Like Jason, Stewart's character stompes from one adventure to the next looking for a one-time prize. Another theme in Winchester '73 similar to a mythical story is the struggle between brothers. Several ancient stories deal with this issue, such as the Hebrew Bible's story of Cain and Abel, and the story of Romulus and Remus. <br /> <br /> About the theme of abduction and rape present in Anthony Mann's film, it is present in many mythological works, such as the rape of Europe as told by Ovid in his Metamorphoses. <br /> <br /> Winchester '73 is a good example of the Western genre and serves as the objective correlative for many classic American western and ancient mythological themes.
