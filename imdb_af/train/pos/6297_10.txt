My friends and I just discussed how frustrated we are with the way movies and especially romantic comedies are made. We feel offensive by the shock that Hollywood has spent today, as they act like everything is good. <br /> <br /> Well, everything is not good ... with the exception of some shiny spots, like this movie. It doesn't have the big names actors, the big budget, I don't think it had a huge release (I hired from Hollywood Video). It didn't really have anything that had the most great romantic comedies in the budget. <br /> <br /> But it lacks most of them. It had great chemistry between love interests, "Parker" (Jonathan Schaech) and "Sam" (Alison Eastwood). Their love story is not forced on us so. The director took his time to really get to know these characters. Their story reminds me of one of my favorites, "Tootsie". <br /> <br /> The supportive role has not only really funny comic moments, but also added depth to the story. James LeGros's character was absolutely priceless. Sam's gay friend was hysterical. Parker's interaction with his co-workers in a psychic hotline was fun. <br /> <br /> I laughed, I cried, I remembered how well it felt to fall in love.
