] Didn't see this movie? Didn't you even hear about this movie? It won't surprise me. One of the few real "independent" films produced over the last ten years had no studio, and never acted for great distribution. Independent company Kino Films has given BOESMAN AND LENA a very limited run with virtually no promotion, and the majority of major film critics have not even reviewed it. I think of a movie based on one act, one set of apartheid game and its influence on two individuals has never really had a chance in today's market - and that is the loss of intelligent film lover . <br /> <br /> For the record, both Angela Bassett and Danny Glover deserve Ocsar nominations (like the filmmaker), but the movie received such a fanfare that I can't even blame the academy. It is a film that is challenging, tempting and heartbreaking, and it actually requires the audience to meet it on their own. Taking this into account, it's definitely not a sensible entertainment movie. Director John Berry certainly doesn't show Athol Fugard's play. Certainly, we get some broken flashbacks and some awesome spectacular shots, but the movie version of BOESMAN AND LENA generally remains a story of two people living in inhumane conditions. <br /> <br /> Stripped of their basic human rights, Boesman (Glover) and Lena (Bassett) no one has to attack, but each other. A third character joins them for a while (Willie Jonah, unbelievably in a big quiet role), but the film's focus never falls on the title characters and what they have become. Bassett and Glover give brave performances as the broken couple, performances that simply can't be improved. Boesman and Lena defend strongly and brutally, both intellectually and emotionally, to be rediscovered from home video. Hands down, the best movie of the year 2000.
