I watched this performance as a child, and I loved it! I watched it when it was on Toonami YEAR .... Sheesh, I sound so old! I had to be 13 or 14 when it happened. But it was good anyway, and I'm one of the girls who watched the Sailormon, and I really enjoyed it. The animation wasn't the best. It was actually amusing in some parts, and the voice action was extremely lame at first, but it was all a good look, and I sucked myself in it day after day. br /> Samurai Troopers / Ronin Warriors is a classic, and an all-time one of my faves. Go Ryo !!!!
