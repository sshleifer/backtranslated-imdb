A movie / documentary about different people in Austria on the hottest weekend of the year. It follows what they do and maybe more they don't. The pace is very quiet ...... so you need to relax ....... breath in ... exhale before you see it ...... <br /> <br /> First you think .... but nothing happens and you get a little angry about it .. and that's the problem, because it's the mood of the movie and the really nice social realistic pictures that are nice in this movie ...... .... many people will say disgusting ...... but it's not so bad ... I think it's more used for marketing .... and there are some very funny moments ... a 60 old woman stripping ..... i guarantee she's the most unsexy striptease in movie history ...... his movie is actually .. i think that's the word ...... upright in your face. .. .... and this makes it a bit scary.no computer manipulation here ..... its real life ... and as we all know movies can win over reality when it comes to doing sick things. ..... .... so it is much worse in the real world ....... <br /> <br /> If you survive the movie, you can look at your neighbors and d ink ... maybe they are like the people in the movie ... i bet there are a lot of them out there ...... sick ... crazy people living with a nice facade ..... ... After watching the movie, I feel it is more interesting to look at my neighbors ........ <br /> But maybe you shouldn't see this movie on your first date not .........
