Marlon Brando and Frank Sinatra hung each other while following this film and in the years following. Braando asked Sinatra for some singing lessons, but Sinatra (who was already upset about being thrown as Nathan Detroit when he wanted part of Skye Masterson) wanted to be the star singer in the production and didn't want anyone should be better than he was. He told Brando to get lost, so Marlon could still screw the scene into the meal. Sinatra was eating cheesecake, so he had to eat, eat and eat. In recent years, Sinatra Brando has given the nickname "Mumbles" or "Mr.Mumbles" because of the way he speaks.
