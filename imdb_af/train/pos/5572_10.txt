This movie was hysterical. I didn't laugh about it for long. I mean, it's not 'Good Will Hunt', but was it supposed to be? I actually went to the advanced show that was much less anticipated and was pleasantly surprised. The comedy hits hard and is fairly constant. Amanda Peet is warm and wonderful. The whole audience I selected was to enjoy the movie as much as I did.
