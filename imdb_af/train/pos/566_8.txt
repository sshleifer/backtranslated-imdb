Versatile interesting Western from a director who had few people in the genre. Like the other Anthony Mann photographs, the Far Land combines a powerful pot cookery story with a knowledgeable knowledge of nature's impact. Both of the pekadillos of Mann play as honor, integrity, betrayal and of course death! The story sees prosperous hunting partners Jeff Webster {James Stewart} and Ben Tatum (Walter Brennan) travel to Oregon Territory with a herd of cattle. Aware of the thriving golden tree, they plan to make a neat profit selling the cattle in a Klondike town. As they arrive in Skagway, they find self-appointed judge mr. Gannon (John McIntire) right to justify Webster because Webster violated the law. It's all with honest reason, on the go. In punishment, Gannon throws the partners herd from them, but they steal them back and cross the Canadian border to Dawson with Gannon and his men in pursuit. Here, beautiful women and a gentle and lawless town will fill the plight of all those involved. <br /> <br /> Interesting from start to finish, the Far Country has benefited greatly from James Stewart's bubbling (anti) hero in waiting depiction and Mann's sleek direction of the stiff Borden Chase script. The cinematography of William H. Daniels is superlative, it's not favorable to current DVD prints, and the movie has some surprises and a "will he get used to?" core distribution of viewers. Dividends paid for repetitive genre fans, it remains a vital sight for the first rally in Anthony Mann's and James Stewart's marvelous but dark world. 8/10
