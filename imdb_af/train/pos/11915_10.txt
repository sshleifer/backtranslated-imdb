But how can you stand a baseball team that can't win. For George Knox it's not easy. As the film opens, Roger Beaumont (Joseph-Gordon-Levitt) and his best friend J.P (Milton Davis Jr.) ride their bikes around the angels' stadium. When they return to their foster mother's house, Roger is surprised to visit his father (Dermot Mulroney). His mother is dead! And when he asks his dad when they'll be a family again, he commits jokes. "I say when the angels win the division championship." Roger and J.P later hold a tree to watch the angels play baseball. When the manger George Knox (Danny Glover) takes out his pitcher, the pitcher gets angry and gets him a fight and soon the angelic team comes in the battle that Knox expels. That night, Roger makes a prayer, because the corners are winning the championship. When his foster mother, Maggie Nelson (Brenda Ficker) agrees that Roger and JP are going to a baseball, Roger sees that right angles come on the field and helps left ranger (Matthew McConaughey) make a catch leaving the manger and the playing field . -play man (Jay. O Sanders) how did he do that? Roger learns from the chief angel (Christopher Lloyd) that he can only see the corners, because he was the only one who prayed for help. <br /> <br /> 10/10
