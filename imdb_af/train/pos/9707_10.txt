About a year ago I finally got up on American television. I thought to give up television completely for a friend who lived in England, showed me programs that included the office, extras, blackadder and The League of Gentlemen. It was then that I decided to switch to British television. Among all the above shows, the Lord's league is easily the darkest and twisted of them all. They give guilty songs and material not found in any other comedy I have ever seen. The characters included are the most unhappy married couple, a butcher who contains ingredients in the meat that is going to be unnoticed (probably for the best), a distorted couple looking at a local store just for local people and worst vet ever determined. This program is one of the best I've seen.
