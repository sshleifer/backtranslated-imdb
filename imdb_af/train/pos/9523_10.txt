I loved this movie! I'm a real Tom Hanks fan, and I've always been impressed with all his work. From its most dramatic roles such as Cast Away, The Green Mile, Saving Private Ryan, Forrest Gump, Apollo 13 and Philadelphia. Being his hilarious roles like a leader of their own, Turner and Hooch, catch me as you can, the Lady Killers, Big & Of course Toy Story. But in this movie, Hanks is not the only big actor to illuminate the screen. Tyler Hoechlin, an emerging star showing a great promise in Hollywood stars as Hanks son and delivering nothing less than a good performance. He is definitely someone to think about his career, I believe he will do good. Paul Newman always delivers a brilliant performance on the screen. He is truly a legend. We cannot forget the people who did not have such a big part in the film, but still helped to make it good. The beautiful and very talented Jennifer Jason Leigh, whose performance in Bastard Out of Carolina & Single White Female I will never forget, brings her mercy on the screen as Hank's wife in the movie and does an excellent job. Liam Aiken is another treasure in film. He does such a good job with such a small role, and like his roles in Lemony Snickets, and Sweet November, and I dreamed of Africa, he gives a good performance.
