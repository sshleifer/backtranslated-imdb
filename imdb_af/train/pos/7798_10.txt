I can't begin to describe how wonderful this movie is. It's enough to say, every time I'm depressed about how unfair or useless things look, it's the movie I'm going to hire to put me in the right mood. The background music makes you realize the simplicity of existence and how simplicity offers the greatest happiness. The Indian girl who sings is but one example of a character in this movie who doesn't try hard, and is happy because of it. Persifina, Ruby's laundry worker (Ashley Judd), is another. Her eyes and smile can make the hardest person's day. I look at this movie and I dream of better days to come or have a good conversation with friends, and I realize that I am alone - Ruby is very common - is not the same as lonely. Recommended for anyone enjoying a thoughtful silence from a movie.
