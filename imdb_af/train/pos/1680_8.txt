Well done and stylish, while still making sense, it will be better for non-fans who are interested in the genre than the later Argento entries that go overboard in all directions. <br /> <br /> For fans of these crazy Italian vibrators, they will appreciate George Hilton and the turns that take his character and what he penetrates. The camera work is fresh with blunt graphic violence and strange but appropriate choices and good, non-remaining music score. The less you know the story, the better it is to work. <br /> <br /> The only thing missing from being a great Sergio Martino-directed giallo is that the story isn't that extra sexual or psychological, or both element to top it off. It's more of a routine riddle, the characters are well defined, but do not live or die according to their own virtues and defects. <br /> <br /> The recent release of DVD (2005) is beautiful and definitely the way to watch the movie, unless it ever gets unlikely to showcase art shows.
