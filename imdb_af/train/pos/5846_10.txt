It was at 07:30, too close to school to see very often. The animation and computer graphics were spectacular for the time. The idea of ​​cowboys and ordinary people unknowingly moving around space vehicles and robots was great. Maybe it inspired the treasure plan. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it's really boring in the DVD format. The performances are all basically identical. When viewing non-consecutive episodes on a DVD, you are stoned by disc # 3. At today's standards, the animation is mocking. We no longer see the computer graphics and focus on how wheat the characters are in place. <br /> <br /> The bright spots are the heroines. They were much more credible, used themselves more seriously than modern heroines, and were not stubborn. They actually saved men.
