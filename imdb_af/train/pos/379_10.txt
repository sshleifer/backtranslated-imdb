1985 was a good year for movies - maybe even great - but the one who misses a gong has played a major role in convincing supporters that ols Oscar is more than a good party member. <br /> <br /> 11 nominations and not a single title: it was the Academy's contempt for one of their greatest directors; and one who had to wait another 8 years before any prejudices prevented him from portraying him, allowed him to give him 7 for Schindler's List, which is probably not as good (and I'm half-Polish). <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong, Schindler was a classic. And I don't beat 'Out of Africa' (who won that year); but it was in my mind a class behind this one: an epic tale of suffering and hope that brought me to tears - and I'm not a big robber. <br /> <br /> Maybe it was the music (wonderful), or the cinematography (wonderful), but more likely just the play: Whoopi, who proved to us all that she was much more than a comedy; Danny Glover, I've never heard before; And of course, Oprah. <br /> <br /> The rest is history; but then: who knew?
