First, the female head is too beautiful to be missed. Now actress Wang Zu Xian, the one who played Xiao Qian in the movie, is 42 years old and good old. It is always good to revisit these glorious times when you see Hong Kong productions like school. <br /> <br /> The movie is one of the most influential titles made in the 1980s. The art decoration and other aesthetic facets are all fascinating. More fantastic, the movie had a total black humorous undertone in it. It feels like a horror movie, but in the end it's not scared but just fun. <br /> <br /> I had the experience of translating the second script of a Chinese Ghotst Story, and I thought the writing was a decent writing. . But when I saw the movie, I was disappointed to see the movie differently from the script, such as in smaller scale and more comical roles. However, it seems to be performing better than entertaining. <br /> <br /> If you saw the Lord of the Rings, you will see the similarities in this movie to LOTR. The climax is like a mirror of Miranda Otto fighting with the Ring Witch. It's definitely a laugh-aloud. Bravo!
