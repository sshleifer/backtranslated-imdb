A surprising, wonderful look at the films that inspired the excellent Martin Scorsese. Many of the films in which he speaks are easy to relate to his works, especially the earlier, the quiet era. Very enjoyable, although I was a bit long, I found this to be one of the best documentaries on film. Required viewing if you admire Martin Scorsese and his work.
