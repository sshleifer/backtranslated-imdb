Chess chess is pure entertainment. Great stories and a big role and nothing else to weigh it off. Darren McGavin gives an energetic performance that draws the audience with him. Simon Oakland, Jack Grinnage and Rut McDevitt give McGavin the kind of solid support that most leading actors can only dream of. Some excellent guest stars add color and indulgence to individual episodes - Erik Estrada in Legacy of Terror, Phil Silvers in Horror in the Heights, Antonio Fargas in The Zombie. It's easy to see how a boy spent and Kolchak drove Chris Carter to create The X Files. Darren - RIP. Simon - RIP. Ruth - RIP.
