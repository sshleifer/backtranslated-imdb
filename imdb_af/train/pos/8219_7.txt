The Dirty Harry series started with a very harsh cop action, and was almost immediately relieved of "Magnum Force". By the time "The Enforcer" had rolled around, Dirty Harry wasn't much more than a television show program (only saved by Tyne Daly). After a break of seven years, Dirty Harry finally returned to his roots. Maybe he's been too long this time. <br /> <br /> Clint Eastwood has been the first well-directed Harry movie since Don Siegel first made it, which greatly helps. Harry is a darker character again, not the nice policeman he has become. He can do things like "Go, make me day" and really say it. "Sudden Impact" is a real Dirty Harry prosecution. The "Enforcer" should never be made. <br /> <br /> 7.2 out of 10
