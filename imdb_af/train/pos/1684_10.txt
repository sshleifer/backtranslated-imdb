Say what you want from Andy Milligan - but if his family was even 10% like the one in this movie, then I think he might have been worse. Unfortunately, the video print of this movie contains sex plays that were originally shot by the distributor to improve the image's professional office. Several times during the film, Milligan's ugly camera work and silent movie music suddenly ends, and suddenly good views for Milligan's home-grown actors are taking over and starting with the psychedelic 60's guitar rocks. Moving forward is pretty easy as you try to pay attention to Milligan's original movie, which unfortunately misses a bit of action to make room for the additional sex scene. However, what remains is still compelling things. I don't think I've ever seen a more hateful mother in any movie.
