I think the majority of people don't think the right idea about the movie, at least that's my opinion. I'm not sure it's a drug abuse movie; rather, it is a movie about how to think of the genius brothers, drugs are side effects, something marginal. Again, it's not a commercial movie you see every day and if the writer wanted it, he certainly failed, as most people think it is one of the many drug-related movies. However, I think something else is the case. As in many movies depicting different cultures, the audience usually understands movies depicting their own culture, ie something they have grown up with and are well known. This movie is to show what those "genius" people think very often and what problems they face. The reason why they act like this is because they are bored: they have to meet people who do mediocre things and accept the things as if they are starting daily spaceships. They start a pretty hard job and do not perform in any time. They feel like I've done work, done nothing, done twice as much better than the guys around me when they were about their projects. What should I do with my free time now? And what's even more boring? When you can predict behavior, not because you are a psychologist, but because you have seen this pattern in the past. So for them, on the one hand, it is a non-challenging job, which is sometimes boring, and from others they start working out people's behavior. It's a recipe for great boredom. And the stupid things are usually done to get out of this condition. The guy who mentioned earlier that their biggest problem is that they are trying to find life in terms of logic (math describes logic), while life is not really a logical thing, is actually quite right.
