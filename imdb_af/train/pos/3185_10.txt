engaging story ........ has chosen ten against all means for my age and sex ... not so much comedy (compared to an almost wet movie) although it is funny enough. Not a fan of musicality, so probably a bit too much for me, but they give you time to grab a drink or a drink without losing anything important. maybe a fifty version of when Harry met Sally? Ahab, not really, but if it's in your top ten, it's mine, you'll keep this movie. really it just leaves you with a warm fuzzy feeling, which reminds you of what romance could and should be, something to shoot. my summary describes it best in very few words ..... very charming
