Wow, how can I even discuss this movie without tears coming to my eyes? It was certainly the highlight of my year - no, my life. As if the raptor graphics were not wonderful enough, the award-winning editors still used exactly the same shot throughout the movie, even though the background did not match the scene setting. Wow, what a genius. And while the movie is full of plot holes (for example, a few tracks from a T-Rex-type animal where a raptor should be and one important moment where Pappy finds a torture chamber, "Colin's a girl!" Shouts and runs out) I will never forget the brilliance that Raptor Planet forgets. Thanks Sci-Fi for another classic.
