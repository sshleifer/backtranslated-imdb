I saw this movie as a kid on Creature Feature when I lived in New York. It was a nice, unpleasant movie, but not as good as Horror Hotel. I just bought this movie on DVD, and it differs from what I remember because in the DVD I bought there are several scenes where the actors speak French and / or Italian and no captions are provided. Then the other actors respond in English to what was said. Kind of strange. Also on the DVD box, the names of some of the actors are spelled out differently than on IMDb. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, this movie is different in that Elsie's character takes off her clothes and offers a naked shot in one scene and in another scene tries to force Julia Elizabeth (Barbara Steele) to express her by pushing her on the bed and kissing her while resisting Steele. That scene is in the TV version, but it is very edited. I wonder if there is any extra material that can be included in a remastered ultra edition? It seems sad that some of these old low-budget classic pieces are split and sold in all kinds of edited versions. Where are the masterbands and all the unused footage? <br /> <br /> Apart from the first boring twenty minutes before Allen is delivered to the Castle, the rest of the movie is pretty good. There aren't too many special effects (but Herbert's face to Julia clubs, he's a good one). The creepy atmosphere and the strange, exotic and seductive look of Barbara Steele make the movie much better than it should be. I can honestly say that if Barbara Steele wasn't in this movie, it would be a great zero. She makes the movie a ten!
