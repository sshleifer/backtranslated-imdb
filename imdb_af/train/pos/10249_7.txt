It is the first of the Guinea series, and is one of the more notorious films from the collection. <br /> <br /> It took me a long time to finally act and my hands on a copy of this infamous group of movies. I bought the Guinea Pig Box Set and decided to order the collection on release date. So I pressed this sucker and sat down. <br /> <br /> From what I read on the Internet and realized the contents of this movie, I expected to test my nerves in full force. This did not end in the end. <br /> <br /> The film focuses on a group of men who kidnap a woman and start torturing her with the hope of discovering the human breakpoint, and how long can one tolerate pain. <br /> <br /> Sounds like one sick movie right? Wrong. The film fails to shock. It may be because I have become unaware over the years, to my horror obsession, but I think it's safe to say that any true ghound dog can easily happen. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Individuals who do not have a good knowledge of this type of movie are likely to be overwhelmed and reproached by the images they see on the screen. Although it didn't shock me, the movie contains some fairly moderate and graphic scenes of violence. Including nipple swelling, the intestines that are thrown into an unconscious woman and a needle through the eye. <br /> <br /> Overall, I think the majority of ghores on this board think you should just get your hands on a copy of this movie for its novelty, but I suggest that for any new entry to this movie type of movies you need to work on this one.
