When this film was opened in 1976, the legend said it was met with great zeal and contempt. It is generally considered a failure. I remember Ebert's giving it one star and it was probably in Cannes. <br /> <br /> Apparently, these people don't understand the film, it's not that hard to understand, as it is very esoteric, dark and layered. in ways that still amaze me. By reading many of the reviews here, I find (even after about 7-8 views over the years) many elements of the movie I listed earlier. But even without much understanding of the psychological foundation of the story, it's still a cracking amplifier ... even if you just take the misery of paranoia and persecution that overpower Polanski's title character such as a tsunami wave during the two hour's run. <br /> Explore the source material - an excellent novel by underrated novels Roland Topor --- reveals more intriguing layers. Polanski's Trekovsky is a milquetoast of the highest order. Although he seems to be still a light everyday soul, he gradually realizes that he is one of those people who seem to be drifting through life so he can lead him. He seems to have little strong feelings about his likes and dislikes. He found himself lightly pressed in this way and it, but never seems to bow. This vague sort of desirability is more noticeable in the novel than the movie, but there are also early flashes in the film. <br /> <br /> A play piece for the apartment of a woman, one Mademouiselle Choule, recovering in hospital from a recent suicide attempt, appears to be the most daring thing he has tried (even effectively the price of the deposit in the bargain). However, he soon finds that he is paying more for his "good thing" than he cares, as he finds himself in the middle of the maelstrom, created by a building full of neurotic, control fears that are hypersensitive to even the slightest. sign of human life, like a footprint at night or a knock on the door. <br /> <br /> Instead of getting stance, Trelkovsky is increasingly alienated by the situation, and taken over by paranoia and a sense of persecution. He becomes obsessive with Choule, suggests that he is as she is, like dressing her, and so on. Since his own personality is swept away quickly by his own madness. <br /> <br /> If anyone ever doubted Polanski's fearlessness as an artist, they would be well advised to watch this movie. His trademark black humor is prominent (and sometimes embarrassing) on ​​the screen here and --- God blesses him - he makes himself his butt. It's a tour made the power performance in one of the richest, riskiest, most Gothic horror movies ever made. That more people have not seen it is a real crime.
