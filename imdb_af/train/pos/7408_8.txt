I had the privilege of watching this movie at the Intenational Film Festival in Rotterdam. <br /> <br /> 'Xizhao' or 'Shower' is a $ 200,000 low budget budget for a father and his 2 boys. The father somewhere has a traditional bath house in a traditional Chinese village where local, mostly elderly, relax and go swimming. The father has sons: a 'delayed' son who lives with him and a boy living in a large modern city who visits him. For this boy, the traditional village, the bathhouse and its 'delayed' brother look strange and annoying, but it changes alongside the movie. <br /> <br /> Although the story may sound like cheese or cliche, it's not. With very good performances, especially the father and the "delayed" son (sorry, I don't know their names) and a great story that touches the movie and funny at the same time. <br /> <br /> If you have a chance to see this movie do it. This is a good alternative to the mainstream Hollywood theater. <br /> <br />
