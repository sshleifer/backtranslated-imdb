In 1979, I was a 12-year-old boy. My parents just got the home office that was beautiful in our area. As a 12-year-old boy, it was the first time I saw books on television. I will never forget the joy of those times. Racing trucks, the total donkey sweep of the bathing suit, the waterbed, the herbal smoke, the hot 70's chicks, the 'makin love in my Chevy song, it was all so new to me. A complete movie with all the memories you can hope for. I own it and enjoy it once a year. Looking at this movie, I want to get my shoes, with 4 wheels, not in a tough line, go to the park and hunt some babies with feathered hair. really good memories of young adolescence!
