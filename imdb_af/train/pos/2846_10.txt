I'm not a writer or critic ... I'm just a student who saw this movie a few minutes ago. AND I want to thank people who worked to create this movie! It's not the best or the most .... but it touched my heart ... why ?? I'd love to understand it ... it's easy and accessible. It's a movie that makes you feel like a bad day without any regrets It's about love and caring, about the life we ​​have, but sometimes we miss it because of material things ....... Look at all that time we have, but we miss it. ... why are we doing this? We must live like death ... to look after every second and remember: if we do good things, good things come back! . And it has a special taste in New York ... I love this town and the world we live in !! Thank you for the movie and sorry for my mistakes (English is my second language) ...
