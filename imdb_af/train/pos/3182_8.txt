Crispy and drunk British pilot pilot George Taylor (a sturdy portrayal of Guiseppe Pambieri) is defeated by the thugs after a wild night in Hong Kong. George meets and falls in love with the sweet and virgin Dr. Emy Wong (a nice and beautiful show by the beautiful Chai Lee). George recovers his health and goes back to work. When Emy does not hear from George for a long time, she carries despair and becomes a prostitute. While director / co-author Bitto Albertini indeed delivers a satisfying amount of anticipated nice nudity and steaming softcore sex, this movie is nothing but your routine walk in learning. Instead, it is a surprisingly considerate, touch and tragic love story between two well-drawn and highly attractive characters (Chai and Emy Wong are particularly radiant and engaging). The picture begins to be bumpy and cheerful, but the tone radically changes in a more mischievous and harsh mood over two-thirds of the way through. Emy's descent into the filth after she falsely assumed that George had left her was dark and disturbing; This is the remarkable sadness and sad surprise. Granted, the narrative is definitely melodramatic, but never too stupid or trashy. In addition, the sex scenes are quite tasteful and even erotic. Notorious Italian porn star Ilona Staller has a great supporting role as George's jealous and uninhibited secretary Helen Miller. Guido Mancori's polished cinematography offers remarkably brilliant shots of exotic locations. Nico Fidenco's funky, throbbing score saves the brand new place. A look is for those looking for something else.
