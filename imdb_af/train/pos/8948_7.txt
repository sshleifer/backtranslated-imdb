This is the kind of movie that, if made today, will probably die Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant; Actually, now that I think about it, this one is actually ready to get up again someday. It's nice, but with no depth. It suffers from the fact that James Stewart almost misses a role he is about 20 years old, and as a result there is no chemistry between him and the beautiful Kim Novak. Ernie Kovacs, in the small supporting role of an aspiring author, is the only actor in the film whose performance is closer to what you call "white." (** 01/01)
