Well, if you are one of those Katana's movie cars (just like me), you will appreciate this metaphysical Katana swinging blood samurai action movie. <br /> <br /> With Tadanobu Asano (Vital, Barren Illusion) and Ryu Daisuke (Kagemusha). This samurai war between Heiki's clan against Genji's clan is the culmination of the final performance of the Gojo Bridge. The body composition is countless. <br /> <br /> Demons, magical swords, Shinto priests against Buddhist monks and the beautiful visions provided by maestro Sogo Ishii will do the rest. <br /> <br /> A good Japanese Flick for a rainy summer night.
