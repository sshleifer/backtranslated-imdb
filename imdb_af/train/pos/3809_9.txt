Have you heard the story of the reluctant heroes hired by a king to kill a dragon? Oh, you? Was it compiled in a world made up of small islands floating above clouds, and made the heroes dangerous jump from one island to the next on their journey? Did water flow up and remains of big cities stay on the horizon? I didn't think so. <br /> <br /> I accidentally stumbled upon this movie and I'm really glad I did! This is one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen. Like the Pixar movies, it's a piece of computer animated art that can only be in today's world. The animators thought of almost everything on the screen, and this attention to detail was staggering. The scene where the mushrooms fall to the foreground green smoke while the characters are unaware of the background is one of my favorites. The monsters are also fully aware and wonderful to watch. <br /> <br /> Although the plot may not be quite unique, the movie has enough charm to make sure you keep watching. Our protagonists are nice and interesting to ensure that the audience behind their almost impossible pursuit is to reach the end of the world and destroy the dragon that could otherwise devour everything in its path. Of course, Hector is the character most in love with. A tiny blue creature with a crazy grin and a tendency to speak a mix of nonsense and English, offers Hector comedy relief in a way Jar Jar Binks can only dream. <br /> <br /> In summary, I would recommend watching the dragon hunters if you get the opportunity. Watch it for the amazing animation, the breathtaking tones and for a look at a world different from what you've seen on a theater or television screen. At the very least, it's a fun way to spend an hour and a half - no matter if you are twenty-nine or twenty-nine (which, in fact, I am)!
