This was definitely the case with Angels abroad. It was on TV last night and I believe I haven't seen the film since my second year at high school and I'm now in my 4th year of college. Although the film has many flaws, it is so touching that you can't help but sit down, watch and enjoy. It's also hilarious. Danny Glover's ranting is just as great that you can't help but laugh aloud at him. It adds to the movie and I'm sure that's exactly what the director wanted. You actually feel the characters in the movie, though the development is not the best. A must see. I recommend. <br /> <br /> 8/10
