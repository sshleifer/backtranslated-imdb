Josef von Sternberg presents this beautiful silent movie about silent Hollywood and the former imperial general on the Chatar of Russia who found him there. Emil Jannings has won a well-deserved Oscar for his role as the general who is cast ironically in a silent role as a Russian general. The movie flashes back to his days in Russia, leading to the country's autumn revolutionary. William Powell makes his big-screen debut as the Hollywood director who casts Jannings into his movie. The film serves as an interesting look at the fall of Russia and an imitation of the Tinseltown in the early days. Von Sternberg delivers another classic, and one that is filled with the great elements of romance, plot and tragedy.
