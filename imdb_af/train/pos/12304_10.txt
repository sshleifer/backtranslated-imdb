this is a good movie. I like it where the climb climbs to get its ink, and the skeletons chase him, but fortunately he dipped them, opened the window and didn't even notice them. xiao qian is also very beautiful. And when he tied the needle, he had Wu's butt, his hysterical. And when he says love is the greatest thing on earth, it's also good to stand between two swords. also the part where he eats his buns while he is watching, kills many people. Then you see how he sings poems as he runs to escape the wolves. the love stories are romantic, xiao qian and ning look cute. Add the comic timing, the giant tongue, and you have horror, romance, comedy, all at once. not to mention excellent special effects for the 90s.
