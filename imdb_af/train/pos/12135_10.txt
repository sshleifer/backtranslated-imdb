Every movie star in Bette Davis is worth experiencing. For Davis co-stars with Leslie Howard in "Of Human Bondage", she was more than a movie of movies. Legend has it that Davis was robbed of an 1935 Oscar for her performances as a cockney-speaking waitress, unpopular mother and manipulative boyfriend user, Mildred Rogers. The story is that the AFI comforts David by awarding her 1st Oscar for Joyce Heath's play in "Dangerous." I think Davis's supporters of "Of Human Bondage", which agree with the Oscar-depriving legend, will be at my criticism's contrast with the 1934 film, for which the AFI did not award her performance and the 1936 film "Dangerous" performance for which she received her 1st Oscar in 1937. <br /> <br /> I've been trying to see all the movies from Bette Davis, TV interviews, videos, World War II ads, and popular TV shows. In hindsight, it's easy to recognize why this film, "Of Human Bondage," provided Davis with the opportunity to be nominated for her performance. She was only 25yo when the film was completed and only reached Hollywood's red carpet. The public saw Bette Davis as a star due to her performance in "Of Human Bondage." That's what makes her legendary performance. But, RKO saw her greatness in "The Man Who Played God," and borrowed her from Warners to play Rogers. <br /> <br /> I'm going to look at the AFI after 41 years after their clever decision to award Davis her 1st best actress Oscar for "Dangerous" 2 years later. In doing so, the AFI can be instrumental in bringing out the very best in one of Hollywood's most talented 20th century actors. Because of "From Human Bondage," Davis knew for sure that she had to come deep inside to find the performances that earned her the golden statue. Undoubtedly, she earns more than 2 Oscars; maybe as much as 6. <br /> <br /> "Dangerous" offers an exemplary contrast in Davis's depth of acting characterization. For it is in "Dangerous" (1936) that she becomes the greatest actor of the 20th century. Davis is as good as Joyce Heath, she is dead center on the red carpet. While Davis is right on the edge, still on the pavement, she is ready to take off over her 60-year-old acting career. <br /> <br /> Perhaps by not awarding her the legendary Oscar. In 1935, instead of a star born, an actor was encouraged to come across the stars in her soul for the best work of the gifted actor. <br /> <br /> It is known that her contemporary counterpart Joan Crawford was; a star whose performances still don't measure up on Davis. Even Anna Nicole Smith was a 'star'. Howard Stern is also a radio host 'star'. Many people on stage and the silver screen are stars. Few became great actors. The main difference between them is something that Bette Davis can sense: the difference between the desire to do great acting or to die. <br /> <br /> Try to compare these two movies as I have, the other. Maybe you will recognize what the AFI and I did. Davis was about to become one of the biggest actors of the 20th century to reach 25yo and reached her goal by the time she was 27. She added the next 50 plus years to the bar so it wasn't reached. . . still. <br /> <br /> If the AFI sent her the message that she had arrived in "Of Human Bondage," Davis's life history would have been abandoned as a great actor.
