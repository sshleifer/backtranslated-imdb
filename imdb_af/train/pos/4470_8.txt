Similar to "In the Village", this music game about sailors falls short of country-past short of the later pacing classics and the quality of the songs, but it has its own charm. Kelly has three fantastic dance routines: one with Jerry the cartoon mouse of Tom and Jerry, one with a little girl, and a fantasy series where he is a Spanish lover, determined to reach his wife on a high balcony . Sinatra, playing Kelly's shy, inexperienced friend, and Grayson, the wife of love for both men, do most of the singing. Iturbi offers fine piano playing. For nearly two and a half hours, it's a bit too long for a light music, but it doesn't.
