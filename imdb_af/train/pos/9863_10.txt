I thought Ice Age was a great movie! As a 30-year-old woman, without kids, I still really enjoy enjoying these humorous, witty animation movies. Sid is the best character I've seen in a while, better than Bartok in Anastasia (though he was really humorous, and I didn't think his character could match or even be beaten) and even more humorous than Melman in Madagascar . I saw the movie at least 15 times (I realize this of course) and I get the movie to work (on many occasions ... yes, still). My favorite scene is the part where Sid says, "Oh, oh, oh, I love this game!" and Sid and Manny continue to find out what the squirrel is trying to tell them about the "tigers" ... "Cloud suit, beer packs, pack fleas, packet cuts, packet noses, pack a bear, pack lies, tackle problems, pack a mantle, pack birds, pack of flying fish ... "or it goes! This is the funniest part of the whole movie, although I also really enjoy the humor behind "lazy on the map" and many other parts as well. The only animated movie that can remotely compare to Ice Age is "Brother Bear".
