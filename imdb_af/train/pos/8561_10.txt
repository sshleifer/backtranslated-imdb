When two authors make a screenplay of a horror version of Breakfast at Tiffany's, you know something is going straight. Drew Barrymore, Patrick Highsmith, Leslie Hope, and Sally Kellerman are excellent actors. The FBI agent was a terrible actor. The screens Patrick Holly looked up and down like a kind of observer, it was just strange. Drew Barrymore is very hot. Intimate aliens, where Sally Kellerman worked, were a big part. The strange gumworm was just strange. Nathan was a very nice cat. But what was that scene where Patrick Holly followed a cesspool and Gooding attacked him? And the scene with dr. Wallace? What did he roll around there? And not every male said a woman like Sally Kellerman. And when Patrick and Elizabeth Drew saw outside Victor, it was strange.
