Power and her husband visit their children and grandchildren. The visit is uncomfortable, because the grandchildren and "children" don't really look like they would expect. The warmth that needs to be lacking. After dinner, May's husband says he doesn't feel good, blames it on his daughter's boil, and says irritate he wants to go home. He died that night. <br /> <br /> Perhaps, now a widow, is lost. She obviously didn't have a passionate marriage or a very interesting one, but she had a purpose. She had someone who needed her, and though her own needs had become uncomfortable for years, she had something to do with her days. <br /> <br /> She is depressed and unmotivated. She went to stay with her daughter, Paula, who, shortly after her mother's arrival, told her mother that she never felt that her mother had given much of herself. She let go of anger over her mother's lack of nurturing. May seem disarmed and surprised, but she also does not look like the energy or desire to fix it. "I'm your mother and I love you." What really says? (I've heard this from my own mother too often and haven't found out yet what that means.) Paula is a bit (well more than a little) neurotic. Both women are needy, even though they are very different. <br /> <br /> Paula is involved with a friend of her son, Darren, who is a craftsman who works at home with her son. While Paula was working during the day, May began discussions and lunch with Darren. Darren is a married man who stayed with his wife because of their autistic son, Nicky, but apparently did not live with his wife in the house. <br /> <br /> May be attracted to Darren because he is virile and she enjoys the connection they look. Darren is attracted to May because she offers a kind of peace and understanding that he does not get from other women in his life. (He also gets interested in money May says she can give him away to get away from it all, but he is clearly not interested in her desire to go with him on such a journey. They end up in the spare room during the day and May enjoy fulfillment as a woman she did not know in years, and never expected to know again, as her daughter Paula often told her to leave the married Darren, it became part May's rationalization that what she is doing is good. <br /> <br /> At a Paula writing group, May is introduced, rather forced to join a widower, to whom she is not dressed. There is one scene where she has sex, with the older man who is clearly scarce and really painful and disturbing as we see the total aversion in May's face as she endures the one-time boring link. br /> In the end, Paula discovers through many Graphic sketches done by her mother is indeed her mother and Darren sex. <br /> <br /> This movie will undoubtedly be seen in many ways. Sympathy will be divided. At one point, during Paula's writing group, May can unveil through a short essay what she previously felt as if she had hated her children by the end of the day and went to pub after they slept. Make sure you come home again. her husband. <br /> <br /> Obviously, a good mother is not planning to leave children alone while going to the local bar. May, however, also revealed earlier in the film that her husband did not like her any friends, so she had nothing. She did what he wanted her to do. She was miserable, but she made it up because, as she said, "it was easier." So while May wasn't the best mom, for those who were inclined to have any sympathy for her, one could see May's actions as the act of a woman who just wants sex and a few minutes in her lifetime must be . A woman who just wanted someone to listen to her, know her as a man, a friend and a lover. <br /> <br /> Paula, though neurotic and unhappy, may have become so because of the distant parents who raised her. Certainly, it's not hard to understand why Paula feels completely betrayed by her mother. <br /> <br /> It's a well-deserved movie, with more complexities than I mentioned, and definitely one that will leave the viewer with many, perhaps conflicting, responses. It's a movie worth discussing and debating, and above all worth seeing. <br /> <br /> One thing that the movie leaves us is the horror and fear of a lonely life. No matter who is considered 'right' or 'perceived' by every viewer, that theme of age and loneliness, which in most of us causes a sense of fear, is inevitable.
