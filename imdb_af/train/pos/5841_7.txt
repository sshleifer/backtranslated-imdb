The story of peaceable farmers and townspeople fighting for land, water, law and order, and the respect and eventual suppression of long-established cattle interests and their hired rifles, was better worked in earlier (Shane) and probably later movies than well. There are some good action scenes and the general explanation of the story, excluding a disappointing end, is well executed. Law and order and religion have established roots in the town, but the old order of cattle races, cowboys and gunslingers is still so close. The clash of the two takes place in a nice prison sentence where the villages fall straight into a fall. Granger, an armed warrior, plays the man avoided by the townspeople, who need his rifle expertise.
