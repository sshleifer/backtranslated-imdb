It's good to see that Vintage Film Buff categorized their excellent DVD edition correctly as a "musical", because that's what this movie is, pure and simple. Like its unofficial remake, Murder at the Windmill (1949), the murder site is just an excuse for an extensive girl program featuring Kitty Carlisle and Gertrude Michael, including a super-decorative girl movie, including Ann Sheridan, Lucy Ball , Beryl Wallace, Gwenllian Gill, Gladys Young, Barbara Fritchie, Wanda Perry and Dorothy White. Carl Brisson is also about to lend his strong voice to "Cocktails for Two". Undoubtedly the movie's most popular song, it is heard no less than four times. However, it is Gertrude Michael who steals the show, not only with her version of Sweet Marijauna, but her strong performance as the rejected friend of the hero. As for the rest of the cast, we could have done without Jack Oakie and Victor McLaglen. The only good thing about Oakie's role is his poorly running gag with the cult, Toby Wing. To give an idea of ​​how far the rest of the comedy is over and overwhelmed, super-fool Inspector McLaglen simply can't put his hands on the killer, though, you think, in this case this is the person who you suspect most. Director Mitch Leisen is actually painful to point out the murderer to even the stupidest member of the theater audience by giving the player a close look after the close-up.
