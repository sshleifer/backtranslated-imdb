This shorter film is the appearance of the expected results when the imbecile performs the asylum. It is sad how the future of these young people is rolled into a craps table, while not Saddam Hussein or the people of Iraq, God the souls of the 350,000 plus killed, have anything to do with terrorism or al-Quida . <br /> <br /> Following this movie, the smart viewer needs to upload or download a copy of 'Loose Change'. This movie is available free of charge on the internet, until the Bush Cape closes it, by throwing the title in brackets. <br /> <br /> God saves our country. This will not be done by following the Christo fascists who controlled congress halls for over 10 years before November 2006!
