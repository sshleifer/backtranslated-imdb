Every time I see Nicole, I love her more. I love a movie like this. A woman you just won't give up, but she'll break your heart. First movie I remember seeing was Van Human Bondage, the Kim Novak - Laurence Harvey version. The beef about the correctness of the Russian spoken in this movie is small, it's good enough to trick me or someone else who can't speak Russian, I'm sure. Funny how people miss the point. The Russian guys who were not good were also well thrown. Finally I had to tap my hat to Ben Chaplin, as someone else noticed, playing a juice with great dignity, and there was definitely some heat between him and Nicole. To think, guys are paying for it, thoughts.
