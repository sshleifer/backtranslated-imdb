In the opening scene, the eyepiece called the desperado, Hawkeye, a smooth forehead, but when he followed Johnny in the pueblo, he was scarred over his lapping eye. It is just one of the many continuity in this spaghetti western, but rather detrimental to the picture, adding a special flavor to the proceedings. <br /> <br /> Another appears when Sanchez turns into his three dead. bodies, they need to be examined for their identities: "You just can't imagine how many false cadavers we have in our town." Immediately afterwards, Carradine (Lawrence Dobkin) shows his bounty with nothing more than a desired poster. <br /> <br /> As far as the movie Johnny Yuma (Mark Damon) movie is concerned, he is shown alternately with his shirt. on his right and left hip throughout the movie after exchanging rifle bands with Carradine following the barroom noise. Johnny is praying for San Margo at the request of his uncle, but will have to avenge his death in the hands of fraudulent wife Samantha (Rosalba Neri) and her convincing brother Pedro (Louis Vanner). It takes time to get there, but it's a fun ride with one of the best music scores on record. Regarding that salon fight, I punched every time. I had a kick from the kung fu sound effects. <br /> <br /> Make even more story exaggerated? After the duel with Pedro the first time, Johnny wipes out a small amount of blood from his lip which he manages to smear Pedro's entire face. Likewise, if Pedro later begged for little Pepe in the film, he didn't cut him, but by the time Johnny arrived, Pepe's face was covered with blood. <br /> <br /> "Johnny Yuma" is probably one of the best of the genre that doesn't have Clint Eastwood in it. Like Johnny, Mark Damon is a fairly suitable stand but without the outside. Carradine was a substitute for the obligatory Lee Van Cleef character, without being a total bad man. Initially, the identity exchange between Carradine and Johnny doesn't seem to make sense, but it's all tied up by the time the movie ended. You knew every handler would stop getting his excuse; Marking time for each was part of the expectation. <br /> <br /> If you are wondering, the title heroes have nothing to do with the Nick Adams character of the classic TV Western "The Rebel". In this movie Johnny got his name from a firearm he once had in Yuma. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the most unique feature of the story was the way it tied up with evil Samantha holding the strings behind the scenes. After she shot Carradine, she hit a hurry before Johnny could get his revenge. Still living, it seems Carradine is trying to shoot and miss her, but Johnny and Sanchez don't want to go to the dessert where she died without water. Carradine was looking for her canteen.
