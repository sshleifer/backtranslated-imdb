I waited to watch this movie for a long time and finally I could see it at the Istanbul Film Festival. Maybe because I expected too much from this movie and so I'm a little disappointed. I wasn't the best movie from Korea, but it's still worth watching. <br /> <br /> The subject was nice and the movie made you look without getting bored even though it was long. But there are gaps in the movie and you jump from one point to another. However, the play by Jeon Do-Yeon is incredibly beautiful. It was one of the best performances in early theater history and I don't think this movie would be great if she wasn't in the lead.
