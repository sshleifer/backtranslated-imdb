Before all, I want to point out that I didn't read the book, so there was no chance that I would be disappointed with that aspect. The big mistake I saw was historical detail, with several cars, trains, clothes, etc. I don't think at that time. <br /> <br /> *** Possible spoiler ***** <br /> <br /> The technical aspect of the movie is ok, nothing to boast about. But the acting, I think, was great. I have no experience in acting, but I cannot believe how people can consider this terrible! Maybe they only saw two movies, and the other one had to be very good! <br /> <br /> I especially liked Jeremy Irons, and really understood his character, someone who had crawled the social ladder. with a lot of hard work, then fighting against those who would take his life's work from him, just becoming so involved in this fight, he doesn't realize the reason is no longer on his side, and he ends up a beaten, disappointed man . Irons made it so credible, I experienced the character despite his brutality. <br /> <br /> After Jeremy Irons, Winona Ryder is also wonderful as a romantic young woman, drawn by her boyfriend in the revolutionary ideas (Banderas, he had an underdeveloped part, I think), and Glenn Close was also very good. Meryl Streep had an average performance, it was not bad, just not the standards of the other actors. Watch out for Miguel Guilherme, a good Portuguese actor, among so many stars. <br /> <br /> Unlike today's movies, here are just the interpretations, but only people matter, but at the same time it's not a pretentious movie, too worried to be intellectual. The best proof I really liked, I write a review 7 years later.
