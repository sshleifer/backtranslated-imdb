This is one of the best music concerts anyone will ever see and hear. I grew up when All My Lovin was brand new and heard again by the original artist today, is a measure of Sir P Mc's power to spell any crowd of any age. This doco goes far behind the scenes to show our lives on the road, not just for the group, but all along the way. I saw this man in Aussie 1975 and can assure you that his performance here on this DVD is no less than he gave almost 30 years ago. I have a great 5.1 surround sound system that does this justice and will recommend it, especially a Beatles fan. This is the closest you get to a Beatles concert today. Singer, songwriter, lead / rhythm / bass guitar, piano, ukulele, just pure genius. There are few artists who can stand alone with one instrument and hold the crowd in his hand. If you want perfect music, buy a studio recorded CD. If you want to hear raw music as it is spontaneously meant to the crowd, with all the excitement and emotion of the crowd, this DVD is for you.
