What would you say about a man who is about to marry and had his baby party with his closest friends at a Hawaiian guy bar? All smooth sails until he takes off his "bachelor hat". What would you say about him, talk to one of the suggestive dancers and then sleep with her? What would you say if that exact girl was the cousin of his finances? A new layer, right? Well, Paul Coleman, played comically by Jason Lee, leads this experience of a nauseating blur and a new low. I have to say this is one of his good leading roles. However, I believe his role in Vanilla Sky performed better. <br /> <br /> His finances, Karen, are played by up-and-down actress Selma Blair while Karen's character, Becky, is played by the sweet and talented. Julia Stiles. To come back to where we left off, Paul now has to deal with one problem that appears to the other. He gets illnesses, has to deal with some people, and has to play stealth games, or any member of each family can get P.Oed, including one of his family who didn't have a "gut movement". "for 14 days. * Vomit * All this leads to the long-awaited wedding with one hilarious scene before it recovers all the hell Paul and his brother had to go through. <br /> Overall, A Guy Thing is pretty funny and It's all right, sometimes it looks like the story doesn't go anywhere and you get tired of scenes here and there, but it's a mixed movie, and if you're a Canadian and a co-fan of the CTV Brett Butt sitcom, Corner Gas, acknowledges you are playing a small role playing Fred Ewanuick, the same man who plays the hilarious Hank in the series, this movie is right - it's another feather in Lee's hat (quite an empty hat). <br /> <br /> My rating: 7/10 <br /> Eliason A.
