Pierce Brosnan's latest, but no longer James Bond, is an assassin. He is very good at what he does, but he gets old and tired. Greg Kinnair is really good as the straight and narrow businessman. Now when the story opens the movie, these two people show up in their separate lives. Then one night they had drinks in a bar, and they started talking. Then you suddenly find that these two people are drawn together during a series of events. The story is excellent, the acting is and the humor is hilarious. I never thought Pierce Brosnan would be funny, but he's really and I have to say this movie is a must see.
