This film has a special place in my heart, as when I first caught it, I learned adult literacy. It was very true to me and even an excellent student I had at the time. There are scenes that scare you with sudden emotion, and those who even make a smile on your face through mere identification with the characters and their situation. <br /> <br /> Excellent performances by Jane Fonda and Robert DeNiro, who are best at their best work, make a big turn for a young Martha Plimpton, an inspirational story line and a haunting musical score for a pleasant and rewarding experience.
