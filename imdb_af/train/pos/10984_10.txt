One question that should be asked right away is: Would this film be made if the women in it were not Jacqueline Lee Bouvier Kennedy Onassis' aunt and cousin? <br /> <br /> The answer is: Probably not. <Br /> <br /> But luckily they (or were) Jackie's cousin and aunt. <br /> <br /> This documentary version of Maysles brothers about existence (one can hardly call it a life) of Edith B. Beale, Jr., and her daughter, Edith Bouvier Beale ( That, the same attraction of a train wreck - you don't want to look, but you have to. <br /> <br /> Big Edith and Little Edie live in a once wonderful mansion in East Hampton, New York, which is slowly falling. The once beautiful gardens are now a jungle. <br /> <br /> Beautiful oil paint diagonally on the wall (with cat stools on the floor behind them) and beautiful portraits of them as young women along the walls next to walls next to cover of old magazines. <br /> <br /> Living together for many years has broken many barriers between the two women, but erected others. <br /> <br /> Clothing looks optional. Edie's favorite costume is a shorts with pantyhose that has come up over them and wrapped pieces of cloth and nailed around her torso and head. <br /> <br /> As Edith says, "Edie is still beautiful at 56." And indeed, she is. There are times when she is almost luminescent and both women show the beauty that once was there. <br /> <br /> There is a constant undercurrent of sexual tension. <br /> <br /> Their eating habits are (to be polite) strange. Ice cream spreads on cartilage. A dinner for Edith's birthday of Wonderbread sandwiches served on fine china with plastic utensils. Time is irrelevant in their world; as Edie says, "I have no clocks." <br /> <br /> Their relationships with men are o-so-strange. <br /> <br /> Edie feels that Edith has succeeded in any of her efforts. She says, "If you can't find a man to imagine, you can be dead." To what Edith replies, "I'll take a dog any day." <br /> <br /> Obviously Edith doesn't see her role in Edie's lack of male company. Early in the film, she says: "France fell, but Edie did not. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it is difficult to hear exactly what is being said, while both women speak and contradict each other constantly. /> There is a strange relationship with animals throughout the movie, Edie carries the washcloths on the loft with Wonderbread and cat food.The cats (and many of them) are everywhere. <br /> <br /> On a stage declares Edie: "The hallmark of aristocracy is responsibility." But it doesn't seem like they can take responsibility for themselves. <br /> <br /> It's a difficult movie to watch, but worth it worth it.
