After a Halloween re-broadcast of Orson Welles's classic radio adaptation of WORLD WAR for a true Martian invasion, a group of moronic Martians on earth showed to conquer only their plans, as they truly their element and in fact alone. <br /> <br /> It's really good and funny, with some decent lines (just watch the memorable quotes) to get started. This will probably be an appeal to Sci-Fi fans. This has passed the test of time for me, as it has recently been seen, it proved much better than I expected. Despite a cast that consists of no-name stars, it may just be the funniest Martian invasion ever placed in the film. Interestingly, it looks as if the Martians themselves represent almost every classic Action Hero / Sci-Fi Hero stereotype. There is (cool 50's teenager, fighter pilot, fearless astronaut, brave soldier and boiling scientist). Fun for the whole family. <br /> <br /> Prepare to die!
