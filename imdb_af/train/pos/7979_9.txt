Tony Scott can make good movies and bad, personally I think he can be a bit flashy and trashy and his work obviously looks like his famous brother, but it's probably his best movie. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie so great is that Scott Denzel (on scorching form, better than training day) and the revelation that Dakota Fanning has time to develop a relationship of true warmth and tenderness. The setup is absolutely NOT boring, although it takes time - it entails, and takes us a bit of traveling to the characters - including an excellent role for Radha Mitchell as the mother. All this means making the action so much more effective, as we are invested in the characters, for all their apparent weaknesses. This movie is completely out of the question and not at the end. <br /> <br /> Of course, the movie will be nothing without Washington. I often wonder why he looks so much duff roles, if he's as good as almost any leading man out there (I can only really think of one, Daniel Day Lewis, who has more power today). This film had to be great, given its status and the strength of its performance and the quality of the film. It's just to show you that if a studio doesn't bring a movie back into the hilt, it ends up straight to the video. I wish I had the chance to see it on the big screen.
