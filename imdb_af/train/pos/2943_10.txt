I think it's still the best routine. There are some others, like Rock's "bring the pain", and Allen's "Men are Pigs" who are hilarious; "Damon Waynes last stand" is also funny in a slow way - but this routine has no flaws. All the jokes are funny, and the duration of 70 minutes is perfect. Just long enough to 20 years. I just love how he allows the audience to be completely self and unlimited. I'm a fan of the classics and for a guy who watched many Jim Carrey, I watched a more laid-back comic look. Not in a category with Ellen and Newhart, but something you can see when inflated. Thank you Eddie, God bless.
