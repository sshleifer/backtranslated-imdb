I was pleasantly surprised, I loved this movie very much. Spectacular writing (some "inside" jokes I have, others I didn't do - maybe because of top-of-the-line actors), great acting (especially John Cassini), great cameos, interesting and unique directing. I hired it to see Jeffrey Meek (very disappointed that he was so short, shining and you will miss him!), But the movie was remarkably entertaining. I'll actually watch it again before returning to Netflix. I think actors and will actors will thoroughly enjoy this movie. The end is somewhat expected, but wish they did something else (and more positively). Too bad the movie was not better received, except in the "festival" market. I suggest it to anyone who loves the acting biz.
