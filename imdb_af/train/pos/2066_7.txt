It's easy to forget that the X-Files have several times developed a series of Alien conspiracy plot bow. The X-Files wrote episodes such as "GenderBender" and "Fearful Symmetry", where the strangers were not all small gray men. or mind-control goop, but can really surprise you. <br /> <br /> "Awful symmetry" starts with an "invisible elephant" - actually an elephant is somehow disrupted in space and time, not a mile away from "The Walk" - and ending with a pregnant gorilla being kidnapped. And this is a great episode of wonderful moments. The subplot is annoyingly worthy - yes, we get it, zoos are bad except when it's not - but the ideas in it are fascinating, visually powerful and very memorable, and it covers a corner of kidnapping that is largely overlooked seen - why would people be the only thing that strangers are interested in? <br /> <br /> In the end, it wasn't an instant classic, but it was enjoyable to watch while it was expensive, again, very memorable, and mostly, it's something you can't imagine much other performances are done.
