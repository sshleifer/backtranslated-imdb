Sometimes a filmmaker brings a unique group of people to life, and lets you see the things we make people. Lawrence Kasden did it again. I always felt the Blue Cill was the anthem of his age and he could do it again in Grand Canyon. So often we find ourselves at a point where we have the opportunity to choose life and so often we blow it. It's a movie about people who find the courage to choose and experience life because of that choice. The merging of small and large events that shows us how basically trivial most of our concerns are genius. I watched this movie a few times and am surprised at how deep the emotions are through this movie. Danny Glover and Kevin Kline do their roles with great tenderness and Stever Martins's portrayal of a movie exec is invaluable. Thank you, Mr Kasden
