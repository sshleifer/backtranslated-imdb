How many of us hope we can throw and be free from social and cultural obligations? Most of us I suspect. Will we dance? is not a movie about dance. It's about learning about ourselves, acknowledging what we're looking for and having the courage to look for it. Mr Sugiyama is a middle-aged member of a Japanese society where ballroom dance is considered inappropriate behavior. <br /> <br /> One day Mr. Sugiyama a beautiful girl leaning out of the window of a dancing academy. he is fascinated by her and finally draws up for dance lessons. He was ashamed of his dance and was scared to mock. He hides the fact that he attends dance classes with his colleagues and family. <br /> <br /> There is a hilarious scene in the human room at the office when Sugiyama and Watanabe, a workmate who also dance, interrupted to practice some. dance steps. There are many other funny and sad scenes. <br /> <br /> The end isn't a fairy tale, but it makes the viewer feel good. <br /> <br /> This movie helped me understand the Japanese. people a little better. It's a hot and very valuable movie to watch.
