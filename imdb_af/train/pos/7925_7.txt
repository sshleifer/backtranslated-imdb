Silly movie is really funny. Yes, it has its dead moments, it can be a little too obvious, it sounds a bit in the second half and the story is an incoherent mess, but it's quite funny. And it's worth seeing just for Ed McMahon as a right wing. This movie is in the same class as Elvira, Mistress of the Dark, another amazingly funny, unabridged movie.
