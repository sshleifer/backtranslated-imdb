I was quite a fan of the series as a child and after that it always remained in my mind as one of those memorable cartoons that made a difference in the early 80s compared to the previous animated series (Heidi, Barbapapa, Il Etait une Fois l 'Homme ..., which I love most of all). I find that other similar Japanese cartoons of this kind that are released later cannot match Mazinger Z, as they are reviving the same pattern. <br /> <br /> That thing, the novelty, can be one of the best. Features of Mazinger Z. Another good point is its ingenuity, with so many exquisite monsters, strange devices and bizarre characters; Actually, we were eager to see every new installment to find out what kind of new enemy or evil machine was waiting for us!
