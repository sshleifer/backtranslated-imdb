This is an excellent stand-up DVD! Eddie Izzard is the funniest person I've seen for years. His routine is hilarious and makes a good conversation with others who have seen it. I recommend this one. The part about Europe's history is a bit slow, but the finite jokes in French are pretty good, because you don't have to speak French to get it (although you do, it's still hilarious). Also the parts of a transvestite are pretty good. The first scene (about San Francisco) is not good, but for the first time funny. Save it if you can. It's hardly worth looking at. However, this is really a funny, funny action that everyone should see. "I was dead at the time!"
