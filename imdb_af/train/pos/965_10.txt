Yokai Monsters: Ghost Warfare (Yokai daisenso, 2005) a movie about "yokai" or traditional Japanese "monsters" of folklore. It is also known as Big Monster War or as Ghosts on Parade. <br /> <br /> The first installment yokai includes the teapot freak, kappa water imp, a living 'Brella, a woman whose weeks can grow tremendously, a woman with a second face on the back of her head, a dwarf priest with a huge gourd-like wrist, and so on. <br /> <br /> These kinds of whimsical monsters not only lead to fairy tales, but of a kind of summer entertainment from the Tokugawa era, similar to today's Halloween haunted houses, or the previous year's "freak shows" but with only ominous freaks. Ghost and goldfish samples and dance-unified umbrellas were created in the hot summers. The fatcheek woman and such are recreated by tricks or illusions, based on monsters portrayed in medieval roles; And if they are designed for the movie a little bit simpler and hoky, it makes them increasingly representative of what has been historically recreated for summer worms. <br /> <br /> These rather engaging monsters should be an old Babylonian vampire devil who came to Japan and disguised himself as a samurai gentleman. Despite this, some of the Japanese appearances are a bit goofy, and too many of the costumes are barely more than masks without moving lips while talking. It all plays a lot of poker and is very charming. It has beautiful cinematography, much like being provided in a CGI movie of the same decade. Yoshiyuki Kuroda also directed the famous Lone Wolf & Cub: White Heaven & Hell (1974) and was the special FX. director of the excellent Daimajin trilogy. The Yokai Monsters series is not the best of Majin, but the Yokai is great fun. The first movie that is the most child-oriented of his family films, with the GOZU & IZOO successively more serious, though no one is too serious for young viewers.
