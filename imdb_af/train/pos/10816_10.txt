No, it is not supposed to be a high budget color, but it is brilliant in its own right. you have to look at it for what it is, a low budget masterpiece involving a zombie rapist, carrying a 12-inch love rod, which he keeps in flight. Those who came to give this movie a low overview were probably looking for the next cult classic or hidden "jewel" as they say and just didn't quite get there. I love how everyone is pointing out striking observations, like the "5 cent baby attached to a fishing pole" hahaha, yes. I don't think a movie with a budget like this can afford "good" actors or effects, so they worked with what they had. The intestines and intestines were actually very convincing. the movie was a bit bumpy from order to sequence, but overall, it's one of the better movies I've seen lately, which doesn't follow any trend or predictability. very good for a laugh.
