If someone ignites you, you usually want to strike it out: Stop! Drop! And Rol! But with this movie, you want to see how the flame saturates your entire body. You endure the pain - perhaps despite or an unknown masochistic curiosity that I can't even try to explain. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the mainstream theater will never bring this movie to a theater near you. . But if you get the chance to catch it, prepare yourself: bring a doggie bag.
