Soylent Green is a classic. I waited for someone to do it again. It seems to be reminiscent of sci-fi classics (this is world war) and I hope some directors / producers will do Soylent Green again. With today's computer animation and technology it will be the potential to be a good picture. Anti-Utopian movies may not be so far-fetched. The human race breeds like biscuits with no outside influence to limit it. We, as humans, have the option of placing the kibosh on the reproduction of fewer species when they come out of hand, but there is nothing to control human hatching except for ourselves. Despite all the diseases, wars, abortions, birth control, etc. Increases the human race as bacteria in a petri dish. Classic Malthusian economy claims that any species, including humans, will increase as their means of subsistence. 6 billion and growing .... this is obscene.
