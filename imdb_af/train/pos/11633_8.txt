Red Eye is not the kind of movie that will win the Palme D'or, but Wes Craven has never been such a director, and his brand is a good indication of what a filmmaker can expect. <Br /> <br /> The fact that the Red Eye is a small, unrelenting 94-minute package is part of its charm and an indication of Craven's craftsmanship in the manufacture of lightweight, but generally pleasant, cost price. In fact, this is the perfect kind of movie to show as entertainment education, attention without having to face any intellectual or emotional challenges. <br /> <br /> Overall, there is a cheesy feel to the plot, vague terror subplot motivation and supporting characters, and the main section felt a TV movie. However, there are definite elements of Hitchcockian suspense, and echoes of Schumacher's Phone Booth, which are ultimately a more sophisticated (and pretentious) play on the same idea that emotional crisis is suppressed in public. <br /> <br /> For a movie focusing mainly on two people sitting in airplane seats, it lives or dies on the characters and the writing. Cillian's icy but eloquent Jackson Rippner and Rachel MacAdams inventive Lisa are the main reasons why the film is turned down. Not only to sing the dialogue, but also to give a kind of Adam-Rib-type dimension to their struggle of 'male logic' against female 'sensitivity'. <br /> <br /> In the last part of the movie Craven gives him a little screaming style as a man-chasing girl-with-knife. The most surprising revelation here is what Brian Cox looks like after the "Just for Men" treatment, his ubiqutous appearance in films as diverse as Super Troopers, The Ring and it makes him the sex-generic version of Judas Law. <br /> <br /> Short distance fun.
