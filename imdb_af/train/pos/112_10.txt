EUROPA (ZENTROPA) is a masterpiece that gives the viewer the excitement that came with the birth of the story film almost a century ago. This movie is truly unique, and a work of genius. The camera work and editing is brilliant, and combined with the narratives of alienations used in the film, create an ominous and memorable movie experience. <br /> <br /> The participation of Barbara Suwkowa and Eddie Constantine in the film is two guilty pleasures that must be seen and enjoyed. Max Von Sydow gives his big voice as a narrator. <br /> <br /> One of a kind movie! Four stars (highest score).
