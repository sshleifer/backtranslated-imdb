One of the best comedians ever. I saw this show about 10 times and will probably see at least 100 more. My friends and family quote from this DVD so often, you would think we did nothing but see it. The start section about Alcatraz is a bit slow, but either wade through or zip through to the part where Eddie is on stage. Look out for part of the "Cake of Death" (joke about the Church of England) and the "Hitler / Pol Pot" section (Difficult to explain, just look at it). The best part of the show can be Eddie's facial expressions. He can say a lot with his eyes. (Mascara, eyeliner and eyeshadow probably help, huh?) Fair warning: Eddie has a tendency to throw a lot of four letters.
