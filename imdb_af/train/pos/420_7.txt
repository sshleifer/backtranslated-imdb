This film presents the saga of a legendary Wild Bill Hickock. He, Buffalo Bill Cody and Calamity Jane, are the central characters. As the Civil War concludes, Lincoln calls his concern that the country's dynamics would be strengthened if people were to follow the advice: "Go West, young man," who graciously did not misrepresent the movie to Horace Greeley, as some others did has. But then he is murdered, and some financiers speculate that they can get rich selling weapons to the American Indians. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, we see Wild Bill Hickock, who interacts with a little boy while a Steamboat is loading at a dock next to the Mississippi. Wild Bill uses a Bowie knife, which he eventually gives to the boy, calling it an "Arkansas Tooth", which was actually a different kind of knife, although both were used throughout the border. <br /> <br /> Finally, Hickock meets Buffalo Bill Cody, who looks close to the real man's photos and paintings. Cody is just married and brings his bride to the Old West to settle. <br /> <br /> When they arrive at their destination, they walk into Calamity Jane, who is loved by Hickock. She looked at Cody's wife, and asked Buffalo Bill, "Is this your moped?" The line was one that caused the Hayes council a problem, as one definition of "mops" was prostitute. Demille wanted the line in, and one of his followers pointed out that Beatrix Potter's books on Peter Rabbit were three of the rabbits Flopsy, Mopsy and Cottontail. He pointed it out and asked the sensors to identify the "bad virtue" rabbit. It worked; The line remained. <br /> <br /> The Indians became restless, partly because of the superior weapon they received from the agent of the East financiers.
