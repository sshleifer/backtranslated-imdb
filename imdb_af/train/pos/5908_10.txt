This is one of the most brilliant movies I've seen recently. Go beyond even an international film of any reputation. I'm really surprised why it didn't receive the recognition it deserved. Sonali Kulkarni wins the National Award may be the only comfort fact. Renuka Daftardar stunned just as his volumes spoke through her eyes. There are a few scenes that stand out: When Gauri returns from the city at Krishna's wedding, she and Krishna meet for the first time in many years. Krishna notes a change in Gauri, but not a single dialogue is said. The whole spectrum of emotions is conveyed through subtle ways and eyes. There is another to the end when Krishna pleads for Abhay Kulkarni to marry Gauri. If you don't move that scene, you don't have a heart. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie for mere movie brilliance and acting abilities.
