It is a very amusing and sometimes very creepy anthology, which is a bit short in the writing lab, more than the shortcomings in acting, work, and overall exuberance. The best episodes of this are the first with Denholm Elliot playing a horror writer punished by a character from his novel in the works (a perfect example of the play that draws it from the mere pedestrian); The third, with Christopher Lee as a man, scared his own daughter and the last episode with the late-big Jon Pertwee as a horror horror movie star who gets more than just a new role on his latest project. The dialogue between Pertwee and Ingrid Pitt is sparkling and inspired. Obviously, both of them respect the opportunity to really build it up! Cushing is typically good in the worst segment, which is certainly not helped by the fact that the wax image of the woman he occupied at the local wash museum is nothing but "pretty", as we are told she is! Someone of shocking beauty was needed and instead we got a woman with a tortoise's jaw. Minor eyebrows put this movie off and it's great country setting is one that captures when you can.
