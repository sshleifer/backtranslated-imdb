One day I talked "easily" and thought it was, but something wrong. Perhaps Buster Keaton played me strangely, or a leading woman's delivery. But the next day I thought about the movie. I couldn't get Durante's song out of my head, I tried to remember Thelma Todd's first scene better. I thought Keaton might have done some funny and physical comedy. The next night I saw a scene with Thelma Todd as a nodding girl trying to impress Buster and Jimmy with her sex appeal. A very funny scene, the actors excellent, their faces, their eyes, their stupid expressions. So I watch another scene, their performance is open on Broadway. Buster in his happy innocence botches every act. Again I laughed aloud and valued Keaton's claws and tumbles. So the next night I watched the whole movie again, and this time I see it for the first time: It's Stupendous! It's sensational! This is Sublime! Three great comedians! Todd dance! Durante sing! Keaton talks! Sure it's not poifect ... but there's a lot of laugh in this picture.
