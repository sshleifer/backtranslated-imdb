It is rare that I sit in front of the TV, specifically to watch a specific program. It's even worse when I actually enjoy the program, but Last of the Blonde Bombshells was one of the best movies I think I saw. <br /> <br /> A remarkable role, led by Dame Judi Dench and Ian Holm, combined an excellent, witty and horrible script to make it a truly rewarding experience. I can't really figure out how good I thought it was, so I won't try, I'll just say, if you get the opportunity, please see it !!! I just hope it comes out on video.
