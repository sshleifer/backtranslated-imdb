We talk so often about theater markets - Kane, The Godfather, A Bout de Souffle. However, one movie is often overlooked by "serious" film critics. Of course I'm talking about the classic Doc Savage (M.o.B.). <br /> <br /> This movie is not only exciting but also explores the problem of the exploitation of developing countries by American imperialism. Not to mention kung-fu. <br /> <br /> It also has the biggest soundtrack in film history (until then Queen's awesome work on Flash Gordon). Although it is a bit of a rarity, this movie is worth looking out for - it will pay back ten times the effort of your search.
