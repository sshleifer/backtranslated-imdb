When I first started to look it became one of my favorite programs. Melissa Joan heart is very funny and talented, so the aunts and other characters and the star of the show Salem the cat, he was very funny. The first few seasons in my opinion were the best where Sabrina was a high school teenager who attended witch life. they were the most beautiful, entertaining and most ... good. I'm not a fan of when they start the launch of Brad and Dreamer because I liked Valerie, but they were okay, the problem was that they were just there in one season. If you have to keep new people, keep them at least. I didn't like Josh, he was a pair, I chose Harvey, but then he disappeared. and they got rid of Libby! It would be great if you were in theses for seven years. and sir also, if he and Zelda were married who would have been gold! then Sabrina moves from her auntie home and into Roxie / Miles / Morgan's house. I didn't like these theses either, they didn't really like Sabrina. Sabrina lost her charm and things and the aunts seem to be avoided from her life and they are their own stupid story lines. I stopped a little to watch it for a while and the old re-runs were back and I was like whoo-hoo! LOL. I have to say the last few seasons were absolutely horrible. They got rid of the aunts sucking because they were a big part of the show. then suddenly she let the two free-loaders into the beautiful house when they treated like dirt. And now she is working at a magazine store, bringing them many well-known guest stars, if they ruin it in every episode. the program just went downhill and lost its brilliance. I saw the last episode. it had the aunts in it (Zelda was reduced to a cherry) and she is going to get married, but she walks with Harvey. I would like to know what happened. Well, that's my review and the only thing I can say is the only thing that remained an attractive one for the seven years, Salem was the cat.
