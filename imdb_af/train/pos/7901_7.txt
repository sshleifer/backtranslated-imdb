The worst movie of all time? Wow, who now? You can't be serious. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's all about what you expect to do a movie. I live in Oregon, so I enjoyed the beautifully filmed photos of well-known but incredibly beautiful Smith Rocks and other areas in Central Oregon (as well as the sweetness of our own Ken Kesey and Ken Babbs watching the baby Sissy's cradle at the beginning of the movie). Those who were alone were enough to encourage me to give the movie a better than an "average" score. <br /> <br /> Or .... Maybe it's about what expectations you have. After reading the book AGES ago and thinking to myself "Well, no one can ever make a movie from this interesting, weird, strange book. Especially 20 years later, when mores (MORAYS - not in the accent market online) has changed "- I was actually quite pleasantly surprised when I first watched the movie when it came out in 1994 and even liked watching it again today. <br /> <br /> Sissy was beautifully thrown, and I don't care what you all say. I was also pleasantly surprised by Rain Phoenix and John Hurt's performances. I'm not a lesbian or a bi or a trans, but met many people who are similar to the people they were supposed to portray - and these "real" people acted similarly to these actors. Stilted a little, stage-ey - always a little "on." Gus Van Sant is a strange native Oregonian, but by garsh he did a good job of adapting this crazy book, IMHO.
