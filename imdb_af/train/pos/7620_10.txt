Lost is the best TV series there. First, it has great actors and wonderful directing. The writing is a very controversial matter, because in the first two seasons the writing was extraordinary, but after season 3 the writing became very complex. Who is Jacob? Why are polar bears on the island? What is the fog? How did the island disappear? Who is Richard Alpert? Many people think that the writers are lost and that they have raised many questions and puzzles. what they can't explain. I believe these people are wrong. I have confidence in the authors. I think if the secrets are revealed from now on, all the charm of the series will be gone. Regardless, lost is undoubtedly the biggest TV series. and it will stay for a long time.
