So is your bairns away in a sleeping place? The woman is visiting the mother-in-law? You're already at home. It's a dark and stormy night and there's no football on the tally and the dishwasher needs to stack up? So now what are you going to do? <br /> <br /> I'll tell you! <br /> <br /> Make an old-fashioned cocoa (Freezer is the best!) Get some gingerbread and sit in front of the DVD. Now choose and play Arthur Askeys world war, two thriller / horror. The Ghost Train comes back to that comfortable bench and enjoy the night! <br /> <br /> The Ghost Train is a truly British war-time classic! Arthur Askey with his sidebar, Stinker Murdoch, entertaines you and I suspect the cast, a high octane, excitement and spill, spying thriller. It is in the old rural England in the Second World War. <br /> <br /> It's centered around a common group of people staying overnight, under circumstances beyond someone's control, in an old railroad waiting room they discover, being haunted by an old train. <br /> <br /> The plot unfolds neatly and precisely and is a credit for the entire cast it's humorous in parts and sometimes actually scary! <br /> <br /> (The story was written by the old boy Godfrey or Dads Army fame and it is clever) Arthur Askey is entertaining and at home and pretended to be your routine and throw, he also shows that he can do a little! However, the role play is never made up, even the railroad porter and the parrot help give the film the necessary gravitas. <br /> <br /> Oh and when it ends, please remember the dishwasher!
