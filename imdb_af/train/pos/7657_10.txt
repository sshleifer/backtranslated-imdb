It is a very grim, hard hit, even a brutal movie about a crime that goes wrong. It's black and white photography, keep it dated. Mickey Rooney is excellent as the twisted but oddly sympathetic lead. One of the first films to portray the psychological destruction of the deadly row. It is also very gripping.
