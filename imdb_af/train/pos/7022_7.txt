In closing !!!!!!!!!!! I waited for this movie to come out almost a year and finally saw it at the premiere in SB. I met some of the actors, which was really nice and great in the movie. I watched the trailer so many times that I didn't know what to expect, but I sucked completely. The movie was really nice to watch and the music was good too. I recommend it to anyone who is a ryan donowho fan, and dominique swain was also good. The other actors were also good. I hope it comes out soon on DVD !!!!! <br /> <br /> I first looked into Ryan in the OC and then saw him in a lot of good indies like Imaginary Heroes. He is wonderful in this movie, and everything he does is indie. I also love Dominique but didn't see her so much. Hope to see them both sooner !!!
