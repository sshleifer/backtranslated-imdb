Space Camp is a nice, fine movie. The plot is predictable, but the actors do a good job, and the special effects are decent for the time. <br /> <br /> This movie was originally released over the time of the shuttle, and it really created a barrier. about how popular it was. <br /> <br /> The scene where the sliding doors are open in space is simply spectacular ... on the big screen, it's ... on a TV ... it just looks average. I remember this scene in the theater. It made you feel like you were there. <br /> <br /> Watching IMAX would be a good movie, but I'm sure it will never happen.
