There were many films made by Hollywood during the war years designed to support our troops from the public. See today, some can dismiss them or just consider them propaganda - which they are technically, but of a positive nature and intended to unite the nation. This film is a pretty effective and entertaining example of the genre - with a fairly realistic writing and good production values. Pat O'Brien plays almost the same character he has played in many other movies (you know, the stubborn, hard-driven but swell guy). Randolph Scott is as always competent and entertaining and the rest of the extras are excellent (look for a young Robert Ryan as one of the training bombers). While the story is reminiscent of several other movies about our pilots and teams, the movie is made to make it interesting and not too far-fetched. That it may be, except for the end, where the film is a bit at the top, but also very satisfying. The only serious negative, and mostly for nitpickers, is that some of the stock footage is somewhat sloppily integrated into the movie and "nuts" like me who are both history teachers and most likely airplane lovers will probably see it - others probably won't no.
