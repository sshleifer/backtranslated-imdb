I watched this movie when I was about 8 years old and I liked it, but it was only when I was 13 years old. I really understood it for what it was; a cartoon of a real-hearted criminal dog, "takes a girl to exploit her for her talents to talk to animals. The female, Charlie B. Barkin, is murdered by his formal business partner, Carface, (which is completely diabolical) His soul then goes beyond true Heaven just to find a golden watch that really is his life's time, sending Charlie, the sneaky but sweet caddy he steals and reels Back to Earth, Charlie looks for revenge on the evil Carface and returns to young Anne-Marie, the lonely, small orphan who can talk to animals, which Charlie plans to do. Scatter her talents to come back to his enemy Carface, but Scoundrel Charlie is actually releasing Anne-Marie and his plans because he has to do what is right after Anne-Marie has discovered what her best friend Charlie really used to earn money for a new and better dog casino, now he has to save her from the feared Carface. I still love this movie even at the age of 22. The idea and plot is really different and original from that of many other animated films. I especially like the idea that a dog once plays the role of the villain. Carface was even better than he was in the All Dogs after the Heavenly successor. In that picture he became rather doubtful about his role of villain.
