the one and only season has just aired here in Australia and I thought it was absolutely brilliant! I love it! all the story lines are so good! And this is a much more realistic view of teenage and family life today. Yet, it still held strong family values ​​to keep together and be there for each other. their problems were real, and it really made you look. The show is basically about this family called the days and their lives. The family consisted of Abby Day (mom), Jack Day (dad), Natalie Day (sporting daughter), Cooper Day (outsider son) and Nathan Day (son genius boy). every episode a day of their lives, with cooperative perspective on things throughout it. I loved Cooper's insight through the show was just fantastic. He was by far my favorite character. It ended with so many things it could continue, I'm really sad yet another season is not made. It was a wonderful show I was going to miss.
