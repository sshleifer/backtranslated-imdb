Beautifully filmed, well-activated, tightly written film. Had me on the edge of my seat. I love the main actress and think the villain was doing very well. Not much to chew in the way of a theme here, but if you just come in your seat, turn your brain off, look at the fine camera work and enjoy the plot, you'll have a good time. The plot is well behaved, and regular moviegoers will probably know more or less what to expect with about 10 minutes. But it didn't bother me, because I enjoyed watching it unfold. In the old days, they might not have just focused on two characters, and there were a few tempting moments when I was hoping they would leave a few lines. But these people were probably right to keep the film so focused. The plot got me early on the throat and never let go. It's not a good idea to think too much during or after the movie. As I am not sure, it makes a lot of sense. Just sit back and enjoy.
