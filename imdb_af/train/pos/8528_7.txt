I love Peter Sellers, most of the time. I never saw him portraying a top-class Briton to this movie. He pulls it off well, although you see Clouseau insects in the mix. It doesn't get interesting until Goldie Hawn arrives. <br /> <br /> I never expected the youthful Hawn to perform so well. Her timing was great and her expressions were invaluable. The way she alternately shoots off Sellers lecherous character and seduces him is beautiful to watch. Verbal sparring as I rarely saw from a movie of that era. <br /> <br /> The last thirty minutes of the movie fall flat. It's worth seeing just the first sixty. Hawn is early after a few glorious seconds. Enjoy it...
