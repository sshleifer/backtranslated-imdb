I chose to watch this movie at Tribeca, based on Judd Hirsch and Scott Cohen and it was one of the best movies in the festival. Both leading actors deliver a well-rounded, sensitive performance that suits the characters on a personal level. The director has done a good job of bringing the characters and story to life with skills that are usually not first seen. <br /> <br /> One interesting aspect of this movie is the love of woodwork and New York City (Brooklyn in specific). The movie revolves around family-owned furniture and weaves delicate cinematography of both carpentry and ordinary Brooklyn life? Be the director again about this fine choice. <br /> <br /> It's jewel and I'll recommend it at all times (I'm sure it'll make it on the screen).
