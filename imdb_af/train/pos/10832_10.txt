If you like Deep Purple, you'll be starring in this great movie with Stephen Rea. The story is about the best known rock band there in the 70s, Alien Fruits, and they decided to play together again. But of course there are many problems during their concerts. Jimmy Nail and Bill Nighy are wonderful, and the song "The Flame Still Burns" is perfect. You have to look at it.
