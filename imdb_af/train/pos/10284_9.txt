`The United States of Kiss My Ass' <br /> <br /> House of Games is the direction of playwright David Mamet and it is an effective and sometimes surprising psychological thriller. It's the star Lindsay Crouse, who is the best-selling psychiatrist, Margaret Ford, who decides to confront the gambler confronted by one of her patients to consider suicide. By doing so, she leaves the security and comfort of her somewhat ordinary life behind and travels "downtown" to visit the lowlife venue, House of Games. <br /> <br /> The playmate Mike (played excellent by Joe Mantegna) appears to be somewhat sharp and cautious. He offers Crouse's character an agreement, if she is willing to play with him at a game, a big money game in the back room, he will cancel the patient's debt. The card game follows and soon the psychiatrist and player are seen in a familiar line of work (gaining the trust of others) and a fascinating relationship begins. What makes House of Games interesting and an essential view for any film lover is the constant guess of who's in charge, whether it's the psychiatrist or the man or is the famous man of great bluffs David Mamet. <Br /> <br /> In the House of Games the direction is sowing and most of the times flat and uninspiring. However, in every David Mamet movie, it is the story that is central to the whole process, not the direction. In House of Games it is partly donated to the wonderful performances of the two leaders (showy and distracting), but mainly as with many of Mamet's work, it is the dialogue that grabs you and slowly draws you into the movie. . No one in the House of Games says what they mean and conversations become battlefields and a war of words. All bluff and double bluffs, reminiscent of a natural order of poker games. It is a running theme throughout the film and is being used at the right moment to create a great effect to create great tension. House of Games can also be seen as a class-war division movie. With Lindsay Crouse we have the middle class, well-trained psychiatrist and Joe Mantegna is the opposite, the working class of America deserving an honest 'crime'. <br /> <br /> The movie seduces the viewer much like Crouse seduced by Mantegna and the end result is ultimately a very satisfying piece of American cinema. And the final of the movie is definitely something for everyone to watch and watch out, it's stunning. <br /> <br /> An extremely enjoyable movie experience worth repeating. 9/10
