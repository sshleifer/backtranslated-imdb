<br /> <br /> "After dark, my sweet" is a strange mix of sensuality and dull. The movie is slow, very slow, but takes a rythm to tell a story about murder and passion. Jason Patric has never been so sexy and powerful (the man gives a real show), and Rachel Ward is all but sexy. <br /> <br /> The sexual tension, the pshycological heat, the footprints of the past ... the flashback scenes, the strangeness of the Patric's Character, all become a sexy secret. I recommend this one cause is the more sexy dull movie I've ever seen. Look at love making scene, it's especially sexy.
