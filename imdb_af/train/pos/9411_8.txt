Sidney Stratton has problems maintaining job opportunities at various textile mills mainly due to his experimentation in the textile laboratories. Stratton's experiment on a formula for a new substance that will create the ultimate substance, one that never gets dirty, never wrinkles or bears. When Stratton eventually creates the dust, he creates enemies in all the textile workers (who will lose their jobs) and the owners (who will lose money since one mill has the exclusive rights), so Stratton in his white packs the most sought after man England. The film is ideal and only Ealing could have made it like that. Guiness's performance (and a great supporting role like Greenwood, Thesiger and Parker) and Mackendrick's direction make the movie a pleasure, but the real hero is the story itself, a nice satire on business and industry with additional elements of drama , romance, and tension. Evaluation, 8.
