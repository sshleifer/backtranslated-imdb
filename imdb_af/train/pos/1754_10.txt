This movie starts hilarious from about the 15 second point, and continues throughout the movie. I can't remember a scene I didn't turn to look at people laughing at me. He is the perfect actor for this role because of the way he looks and how he dressed. <br /> <br /> The comic parts were great to watch from actors who aren't very big or popular. As you can see people doing like this movie, it's currently 7.9 on IMDb. I think it should be in 250. So let's put it this way that I haven't seen this funny movie since the American pie or the original holiday. see it if you want a laugh. I give this movie 2 of the highest thumbs I've ever given since I found out about IMDb, a great movie site.
