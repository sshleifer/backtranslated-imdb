The title is the sound that one of the characters makes when he dumps his imaginary trolley over the trash can where the characters live. Based on a series of stories by Shugoro Yamamoto, the film tells the story of a group of people who live effectively in homes on the edge of the dump. It is a mixture of laughter and sadness. <br /> <br /> The first color film made by Akria Kurasowa was something I wanted to see long ago. Oddly, it is often referred to as being available only in a shortened version of a three or four hour original due to a fault in running time in some promotional material. I kept the full version and waited to see what Kurasowa wanted us to see, just to find out about the recent release by Criterion that the 140 minute version is the full version. <br /> <br /> Finally, to see the movie last night, I am of mixed emotions about the movie. First, it is visually linked to every movie that followed. You can see every other Cura√ßao remaining six films that are reflected in this movie, up to the painted sunsets. It is a striking film in the use of color and you can understand why it took him so long to make a movie stock that he liked (of course, there are also failed projects). The film is a visual artwork. (Although you are warned if you see it on your widescreen TV, it is shot 1.33. It will appear in normal TV ratio.) The rest of the movie is a mixed bag. Part of the problem is that the lives of all these people do not come together completely. As separate stories, everyone works well, but as a cinematic whole they do not depend on one. I don't blame Kurasowa, because one can't always beat things out of the box, especially if somebody like Robert Altman, who has specialized in various character films of this kind, sometimes bombarded himself. <br /> <br /> This isn To say there are no reasons to see the movie. Like all Kurasowa films, there are always reasons to watch his films, whether they work or not. The first trip of the "trolley" is one of the best things Kurasowa has ever done and is worth the price of a rental. One of the most magical moments in film history as the trolley is explored and exhausted. The father and son who live in the car touch (although ultimately very sad) and there are other pieces that shine (such as the role right across the board) and the film should at least try something other than a man to be. we are usually associated with samurai movies or crime dramas. <br /> <br /> It is an intriguing rubbish of a master movie maker that means it's better than most other movie maker successes. <br /> <br /> Between 6 and 7 as a whole, much higher in pieces.
