Another great foreign film that thoroughly utilizes the incessant harvest of rubbish from Hollywood! It is a story of life and life. No, definitely not the perfect little life portrayed so often in the completely artificial Hollywood movies, but rather the real life, with real characters, with strength and weaknesses, just like real people in our lives and ourselves. <br /> <br /> The dynamics of all of these lives, intertwined in the walls of this bath house, and especially its older owner, are beautiful, heartfelt and highly thought-provoking. <br /> <br /> Sit back, relax and be carried in simple and beautiful life. There is real wisdom to be taught in this movie if you just open yourself about it. <br /> <br /> You won't be disappointed.
