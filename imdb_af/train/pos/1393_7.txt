Probably the most whimsical installment of the first season, 'Shore Leave' has its ups and downs; Some parts are dragging too long and others are inexorably cut, but one cannot deny that they are throwing everything, but the proverbial kitchen sink to make it an entertaining episode. Kirk and crew seem to have found the perfect planet for beach leave after an extensive service trip has left on board, with rest, relaxation and so on. For all purposes, it seems to be an uninhabited earth, with beautiful scenery and an ideal climate. The first indication that things can only go a little wrong is when McCoy, who is leading a team, carries Alice (from Wonderland) to a big white rabbit wearing a jacket. Kirk explains and finds others who report similar bizarre events and encounters. The one thing they all have in common is that every crew member thinks about the person / place they have discovered right before they discover it. It doesn't immediately coincide with Kirk or anyone else. Follow more strangeness, including the observation of Don Juan, a Siberian tiger, a WW2 fighter plane, etc .; Kirk meets Ruth, a beautiful old girlfriend (of course) and a bully of his academy days, Finnegan. The hunting / fighting scene with Finnegan goes on for too long, but McCoy is running at a time with a knight and apparently killed. Eventually, an elderly man appears and explains what is going on. The planet is a futuristic 'amusement park' where visitors have to suggest something to make it appear. Nothing is permanent; McCoy is not really dead. As soon as this is explained, Kirk definitely decides to give everybody coastal leave. Despite the "it was all a dream" came to an end, "Shore Leave" stops as a first-ever episode of Star Trek's first season.
