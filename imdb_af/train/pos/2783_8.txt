Not one of your harder stories, and it's a real strength of this movie. There are at least two relationships in which less confident writers could add too predictable romantic tensions. Not only do they save for the audience, but also surprises. There are a few Disney-ish moments, especially near the end, but they are manageable. Overall, it was worth the rent and it was nice, fun fun. <br /> <br /> VAT, if you get the DVD, look at the segment where the director teaches you how to make aloo gobi. We followed her directions and it was BRILLIANT! Next time we plan to eat it the day before, because it is one dish that definitely gets better with a full night in the fridge to leave the spices out!
