I saw a lot of TV movies in my time as a student, the majority the normal waste of time that American television broadcasts. However, this one was well made and plotted and has a very nice twist to the end. Having seen Richard Dean Anderson only in MacGyver and Stargate, I was amazed at his excellent performance rather than the rather spectrum of expressions of A-B he usually gives. It was a pleasant surprise to return Daphne Zuniga to The Fly II after a long time. Also nice to see Robert Guillaumme again in a leading role. I can't say I ever take Jane Leeves seriously after her Benny Hill days, but she just managed to handle her role well. All in all, a highly recommended movie.
