I agree with "Jerry." This is a very underrated spatial movie (of course, how much good lower-budget one is NOT underestimated?) If I remember correctly, the solution to the riddle was a kind of variation (but not "rip-off") of 2001, because the computer that controlled the spaceship was actually a man who somehow changed into a computer. And like HAL, they tried to disconnect his "mind" but not the mechanical parts of him, and as with HAL, it led to disaster. There is at least one funny moment. When the Christopher Cary character, who can find no food, finds the abandoned pet, there is a kind of ominous moment, but then the obvious thing happens.
