It's a good little shocker; not perfect by any imagination, but strict, capable and disturbing. An excellent example of a simple idea has evolved into a compelling 90 minute script. <br /> <br /> The setup requires no bells and whistles, no long breakdown or recitals; Kate (Franka Pontente), a young German businesswoman living in London, waits while waiting for the last tube train. She wakes up to find the place abandoned, but soon finds out that she is far from alone. Someone, or something, is there with her and his intentions are completely malicious. <br /> <br /> In fact, she meets several other characters in her quest to survive, including a nice work colleague, a homeless couple and a herd of sewage workers, all who fit and add content to the plot. There is a slight uncomfortable change of gear somewhere in the middle of the movie when the gamer in the gorse festival changes, but nothing is so clumsy that the hectic pace is slowing. For those of you with poor attitudes, this is probably a sad ride; For those of you who enjoy a little well-executed carnal chaos, it should hit all the right buttons. <br /> <br /> The climax of the movie may be less successful than the main body of the movie, but it is structured. with a nice moment of unexpected social commentary that provides a satisfactory conclusion. <br /> <br /> Some people feel they've had a bit of a clear explanation about the exact nature and history of the threat Kate and her allies experienced, but for me it wasn't. A Horror movie writer does not need to feel every time needed to cross each point, and so a writer of political excitement can be expected. There are plenty of clues to give you a very clear idea of ​​what this evil has done, eliminating a detailed and conclusive solution. Retaining a certain sense of mystery is to be welcomed and remind us that in this movie the ride will always be more important than the exact destination. <br /> <br /> My understanding is that the budget for this movie was minimal anyway, in which case our applause for this British horror must be harder, because in no way does the impression of the corners cut or effects fail to deliver. <br /> <br /> If that sounds like your kind of movie, it's probably. Buy a ticket and get on board.
