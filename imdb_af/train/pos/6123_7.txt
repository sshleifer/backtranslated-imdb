Before I comment on this movie, realize that when I watched this movie, I expected the typical crap, horror, B-movie and just wanted fun. Jack Frost is one that not only delivers, but is actually one of the best I've ever seen. Scott McDonald is wonderful like Jack Frost, in fact I think he has a future in psychopaths in big movies if he ever gave the chance. McDonald is a serial killer who becomes a snowman through a dull accidental mixture of ridiculous elements. As soon as the snowman starts moving and killing people, you won't find it hard to laugh. The lines that are said to have been completely delayed, but really funny. The fact that the rest of the dice is completely handed over, just adds to the stupidity of the movie, but it's stupidity, it's genius. The scene where the snowman is with the teenager is truly classic in B-movie, horror movie fashion. I really hope there is a sequel and I'll be there to watch it on whatever cable channel it does. Of course it's just fun to watch the first few times and it's not exactly a good work of movie technology, but I just want to see snowman killing people. I gave it a 7 out of 10, it's a good movie for dates and couples in the late hours.
