This movie has always been a favorite of mine since I first saw it as a 12-year-old child in 1962 when it was shown on a late show of the Los Angeles television station. The characters love the beginning of the picture and it's too bad that the film has never been released for videotape, and it is never shown on television (apparently because of a ban on the Moss Hart estate, The playwright / producer / director who wrote the story and only presented it to the New York stage during World War II The reason why his performance is refused is difficult to get more than 50 years after making it. did not watch the movie for more than 30 years, when someone who was actually a big movie of the movie, could get me a bootlegged copy on VHS (poor video quality but good sound). correct: it was still an interesting and fascinating movie to watch.A wonderful thing about this movie is just how many of its stars, which only started in 1944 in their careers), also have great movie stars or at least familiar and full-time actors (eg Judy Holliday, Edmo nd O'Brien, Jeanne Crain, Barry Nelson, Don Taylor, Karl Malden, Peter Lind Hayes, George "Superman"). Reeves, Red Buttons, Lee J. Cobb, Kevin McCarthy and Gary Merrill. The screens with the B-24 Liberators are great, especially the close-up shots where the details of the giant (for those times) 4-engine bomber (then 18,000+ manufactured, now almost extinct) can be seen. Good insight into the different levels of training that a pilot cadet has made on the way to a bomber crew (of course, many prosperity like the trend of the day: only the men became pilots, the women only support them in their roles - barely acceptable in today's world). One day I hope it will be released on video for a new generation to enjoy.
