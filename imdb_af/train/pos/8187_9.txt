Anyone find it interesting that the Ood looks strangely similar to the 'Big Cthulhu' of H P Lovecraft vintage? hmmm? <br /> <br /> Great episodes (not referring to Billie Piper, as most seem to do!) in the impossible planet and the satan pit. <br /> <br /> Also the link to 'Legion' I also thinks in Who before and also refers to Satan in various novels after the Exorcist era ... <br /> <br /> Great suspense episodes that fear and use of faith elements. The new team for these 'who's working great magic for TV. <br /> <br /> It definitely creates new fears and 'hidden behind the bank' feelings that have not been seen for many years, in this continuation of an excellent BBC series (sorry the BBC confirms that Billie Piper stops - maybe not permanently - after series 2): O ((((
