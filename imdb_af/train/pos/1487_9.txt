"Casomai" is a masterful story depicting the story of a young couple blowing through the dark water of marriage. The story is very credible to tell the strange saw-saw between oblivion and ongoing interference by others. It is quite typical in Italy (one might wonder if such events are different elsewhere). Pavignano and D'Alatri were very good at writing, which is one of the highlights of the movie. Acting by Stefania Rocca and Fabio Volo is sober and gripping. And the figure of the sympathetic priest is funny and rounded. All in all, a truly earnings movie, probably one of the best Italian films of the year.
