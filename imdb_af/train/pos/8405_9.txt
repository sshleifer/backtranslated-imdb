I'm proud to say I own an uncut copy of this selection of the 70-year-old Crown International Drive Comedy Cheese on DVD. It is a very nice and unobtrusive movie with a nice breezy'n'easy 70s atmosphere. It seeks to make a sincere point that true love and friendship are more important in life than a cool set of wheels and a fast tail. Certainly, it's actually a blatant adolescent male fantasy peak. Head teen goofus character Bobby Hamilton gets the girls, the respect of his friends, and a chance to show a local from-racing bully - but it is to watch and Grace to hate. Stuart Getz as our gawky protagonist for an impressive town lead, Deborah White, as the main target of Getz's love, is a definite boyfriend, Connie Lisa Marie is also very nice like a clean blonde babe and nibbling steak Neanderthal Stephan Oliver (a 60-year-old biker film perennial) is wonderfully hateful like the brutal Dugan Hicks. A pre-reinforced Danny DeVito in particular is an absolute riot as Getz's crazy car wash boss Andy, a loveless cantankerous ne'er-do-well slab, wears very ugly lazy Hawaiian shirts and suffers from a serious gambling habit. I especially love the scene where two villains Danny cruelly beat - one holds his arms behind his back while the other man works over Danny's torso! And Sammy John's insidiously catchy fluke hit theme song will be around your skull for at least a week. In short, it's a great groovy retro 70's fun!
