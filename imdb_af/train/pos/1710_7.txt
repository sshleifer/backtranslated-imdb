This movie is an exact copy of a television series on the Indian television channel Doordarshan broadcast at least 15 years ago. The series was known as "gubbarre" which means balloons. Every episode was a new short story. The story is excellent and the original is much sweeter and convincing. Abhay Doel does a good job, but he doesn't fit the role of a "normal" and "third class" guys (as he calls him in the movie). In fact, Shayan Munshi cut short with his hair and without the designer clothes fit the Abhays role, but Shayan just doesn't have the talent to pull it off. <br /> <br /> I'd recommend watching the series if it's available. This is the same story except for walking around with the girlfriend and the initial introduction. The actors of the TV actors were much better than those "stars". <br /> <br /> The only reason this movie is a flop is because the director is half an hour (or 45 minutes) after 2+ hours. It must therefore become drowsy. Even the nasal singing sensations couldn't make up. <br /> <br /> This movie is good for a lazy Sunday afternoon and is really refreshing if you haven't watched the original TV show. The writing and the end of the series were much better. <br /> <br /> ##### SPOILERS AHEAD ################################### ########## # ##### SPOILERS AHEAD ############### SPOILERS AHEAD ############## SPOILERS AHEAD ######## The termination of the original series was much stronger, as the hero himself dumped the daughter, even thinking she was willing to marry him. He is aware and tells her that he doesn't want to be "repaid" and never helped with that intention. The director or the writing one way or another cannot capture the original end in this movie. The original end would have bought tears for the girls' eyes and the guys would have clipped. The delivery was just not right. <br /> <br /> But personally, I feel it is a pathetic copy. No credit must be given to the director / scriptwriter. The story is wonderful and is one of the well-known novelists in the class of PRemchand munshi. I'm not sure if it's prime hand munshi's story, but many of the other short stories in the series include some premchand munshis and other great Hindi writers stories.
