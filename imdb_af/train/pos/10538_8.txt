I work at a movie shop, and as such, I'm always looking for a great movie. I decided to watch nothing like it did in our Canadian section, and I tried to support my country's film industry. I was in a surprise. The film features David Hewlett and Andrew Miller in a highly entertaining story that looks so much of our minds and relationships as if we're not working so hard. These are consistent comedies through the interaction of the two characters, as well as some funny exchanges ("We can't be dead, we have cable!"). What more can I say without noting that it is worth a shot even if you drop it off within the first half hour.
