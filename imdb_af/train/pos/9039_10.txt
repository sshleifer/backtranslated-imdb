I grew up in Southwest Virginia; I'm about the same age as (or maybe a year older) Homer Hickam, author of The Rocket Boys, the book that forms the true story base of this heartwarming movie. <br /> <br /> And so I'm closely related to the West Virginia coal mine theme, and the beautiful effect that Sputnik had at that time (October 4, 1957) on us all. The Rocket Boys made themselves very good to themselves. I went to get my degrees in Physics and Computer Engineering. Even though Sputnik woke up many young people to the "Science Gap", the VS.S. In the US in the Cold War days ... <br /> <br /> It's a great movie for everyone, of all ages. But if you grew up in West Virginia in the late 1950s, it became the core of your being. <br /> <br /> Everyone: Get it; Beware; recommend it to your friends ... who will thank you many times.
