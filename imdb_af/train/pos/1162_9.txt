Like most people, I saw Jason Priestley on TV and I think he's great. But I didn't know he had a sister! Justine Priestley is simply "mah" quick like the mess other woman. Good music, plot and a dying scene that Amanda's revenge on an abused dr. Staying with you for weeks. I will then leave it. Kudos.
