Keeping someone holding your hand when you step up or down? To have others taste your food before eating it? Towards a transmitting mother? These are just some of the stumbling blocks that young Victoria is going to handle in this movie (there are also various power struggles, as well as efforts on her life). Needless to say, it makes very fascinating and informative viewing. <br /> <br /> I first saw Emily Blunt in The Devil Wears Prada (and slightly different). While she was in the movie, she's back in here. I was very impressed with her depiction of the young Victoria, and thought she had handled the role very well. She made the transition from young Victoria to the Queen Victoria at the beginning of the film, and she became completely credible later. Blunt is perfectly cast in the role, showing all the different sides (from the vulnerable, to the strong, of the young Victoria making mistakes to the queen who take control). In this role can't be said enough about Emily Blunt. She is - simply - beautiful and recommends that you be on the screen every second. She holds you to the final shot of the movie. <br /> <br /> Rupert Friend also proves that he was well-cast as Victoria's love interest (and ultimate man), Prince Albert. The actors have good chemistry and you absolutely believe in their developing relationship. They have their differences, but you can say they are in love. Blunt and Friend are excellent in every scene they share and interest you in what happens between Victoria and Albert. The other role-players in the film are also very good. Paul Bettany as Lord Melbourne, Miranda Richardson as the Duchess of Kent, Mark Strong as Sir John Conroy and Jim Broadbent as King William. There isn't a single bad performance in this movie. The less focused people are also well depicted, given what screen time they have. Even Victoria's dog (a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel called Dash) is unforgettable and impacts on the film. <br /> <br /> Although the movie tends to hit more than a few aspects of Victoria's life - especially at the end - and instead * tells us what happened (with her and Albert) on the screen, which matters most, is what we actually * see *. It's a movie about 'The Young Victoria' (not 'The Middle Ages Victoria' or 'The Old Victoria'). Although some beauties of history are made with this film, it remains focused on what it will do - which tells us the story of how the young princess came to power. <br /> <br /> The movie looks amazing, the costumes, Emily Blunt wears, are visually stunning and the music just adds to the movie, never detracts from it. It has been shot extraordinarily and unlike many movies these days, this movie is actually a good length because it doesn't take long to lose interest or feel it is unnecessarily pulled out. <br /> <br /> It goes without saying that what makes this movie so good is Emily Blunt. She is here in good shape and has taken on an excellent performance and elevated this film beyond what would have been possible. Another actress was cast into this rather important / historical role. It is a finely crafted film, with outstanding performances to be seen. If you appreciate a fascinating look at a woman who was extremely significant in history, it is a must see.
