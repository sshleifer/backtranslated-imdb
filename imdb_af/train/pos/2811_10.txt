Silverlake Life, The view from here, is an absolutely beautiful film about AIDS as well as a gay love affair. Some images are indeed very difficult to take, especially if one is gay or fears about Aids, and probably for any sensitive person who sees it. It's not easy to make a movie about such a terrible disease and its consequences for not only one, but also for two people's lives. This movie teaches how to take care of each other in such difficult times, but it never gets too morbid. It still shows life at any time, and reminds you it's outside the theater or in your room. Life goes on, whatever the fate of some people may be. The characters are incredibly engaging as we look at their intimacy in shots that never go beyond a very strict limit, and reveal nothing too private or offensive. Children should definitely not watch this movie, but adults, whether they should handle such situations or not, should do so and will not regret the tears they shed.
