If it is supposed to be a representation of the American serial killer, it comes as a decision average. <br /> <br /> A journalist [Duchovny] travels across the country to California to document America's best-known murderers, unaware that one of his white trailer-rubbish travel companions [Pitt] is a serial killer himself. <br /> <br /> Better predictable throughout, it has its moments of action and Pitt and Lewis portray their roles well, but I won't bother to see it again.
