Dark Angel is a futuristic sci-fi series based in the post-apocalyptic Seattle. She focuses on Max (Jessica Alba), a genetically improved young woman, in the process of her creators. <br /> <br /> The Dark Angel universe absorbs (not as much as Buffy says, but absorbs) with an interesting and credible set of characters. Certainly, it's not for everyone, but those who give it time will see themselves as one of the nicest ranges there. Dark Angel is criminally overlooked and underrated and unfortunately canceled after only 2 series. It was a great shame as it had the potential to become a huge series, although its 42 episodes are only 10 shy of the long-running BBC sci-fi comedy Red Dwarf. As it is, Dark Angel remains unfinished, so search it out, and if you want more, Fox lobby to make another series.
