It's a big "small" movie. I say "small" because it doesn't burn a hundred guns or have a dozen explosions, as in a John Woo movie. Great performances by Roy Scheider and the three "bad guys". John Frankenheimer currently looks more successful with small productions. The movie is very easy to watch, the story is more of a yarn than a washing machine - instead of everything that goes round and round, things just look worse when the plot thickens. Wonderful end, very positive. I never read the Elmore Leonard book, but it can't be much different from the movie because it feels like I'm watching an Elmore Leonard movie.
