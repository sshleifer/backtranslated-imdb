Audiard made a very interesting film here. It begins with the description of an almost deaf young woman, in his working universe as secretary; she is ignored, frustrated, rejected ... Renting an intern as an assistant seems to be a way for her to find someone in her life: but the man just comes out of jail. The two are rejected by the association and gradually reunited. Character description is deep, go into detail ... both start helping each other; because she can read on lips, which seems to be very useful to him. She would gradually develop far from what she was initially. <br /> <br /> It's beautifully filmed; the whole is very convincing, even though it eventually becomes a film noir. Gesture is especially splendidly observed in Audiard's filming. Emmanuelle Devos has to be nominated for the best actress Cesar Awards for her magical play. Action at the end of the movie prevents it from being a simple "etude de mours". It's actually surprisingly entertaining: 8/10.
