After watching TV on several occasions, Arthur laughed so hard. Dudley Moore's role as Arthur, a happy, happy drunken millionaire, was hysterical, but John Gielgud, like his servant / father, Hobson, was equally charming. I bought the DVD a few weeks ago and saw it, despite the fact that it lasted almost 27 years, it was still as enjoyable as ever Liza Minnelli's role, because the love interest was fascinating. The chemistry between the two was magic. <br /> <br /> Arthur Bach, (Moore) is a spoiled drunk millionaire with a bar account that read like the national debt, he has no desire to grow up and enjoys it as a child. His activities are supervised by his dry English butler Hobson (Gielgud). It seems that no one really cares for Arthur except for him. Arthur's father (Barbour) offers an ultimatum if he's not going to cut off his son's 750 million-dollar legacy with four-week-old blonde Susan Johnson (Eikenberry). <br /> <br /> But Arthur meets and falls in love with Linda Marolla (Minnelli), a young working class waitress and binds thief, now he is facing a difficult decision. Marry for love or money. When Hobson dies, Arthur eventually grows up and breaks it with Susan before the wedding, and lets him keep the money and his true love. <br /> <br /> Arthur is a truly enchanting romantic comedy for everyone.
