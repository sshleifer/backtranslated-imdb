[No Spoilers] <br /> <br /> To be a David Lynch movie, one can imagine that it portrays the mysterious thought of her as the majority of his films. But this is a very straightforward story as the title might be. Not to be caught in the usual Lynchian void of incomprehensibility that usually occurs after being watched, namely Lost Highway. It's a simple movie, but it's a good movie indeed. It is both an innovative and an entertaining aspect. It's innovative because it's not Lynch. But maybe it's Lynch. He likes to twist our minds and put together a movie that is very mainstream and far from Lynch itself. As a very avant-garde director, he can make such a movie to bother his ordinary audience because he knows what they expect, but he doesn't give it to them. It will be smart. <br /> <br /> The tempo of the movie is slow. I will almost say lawnmower ... Don't expect an action organ, but the movie is really entertaining for those who are going through the movie. Look carefully at the little details that Lynch plans in the movie for our entertainment plot. Look for the great cinematography that brings this movie to life. And listen to Badalamenti's score and the main theme that impresses Iowa and Wisconsin provinces is regularly shown. <br /> <br /> Farnsworth is one of his best performances in this film, making him one of the most beloved people ever portrayed on film. He doesn't have to say anything to express his feelings and thoughts. His cheerfulness just shines through him and his acting deserves him an Oscar nomination. Should I say his ill health was not dealt with in this movie? He was diagnosed with cancer and shot himself after completing this film. That knowledge puts more emphasis on the film, as it becomes a tribute to Farnsworth. <br /> <br /> All of the above form a very nice movie suitable for all kinds of people who are supposed to do like a movie. One can ask for homilies who are not so obvious and a little naive, but it does not ruin the overall picture, namely that it is an unforgettable movie. 9/10.
