I saw this movie in the theater when it came out. I grew up in Scottsdale and I went to Arizona State and enjoyed many places where I spend so much time. I remember at the time that Barbara's business was more of a sound (actually R and B to my ears). I was never a fan of Kris's singing until his last attempt at New West. However, as a songwriter and an actor, he has serious links, IMHO. I think it's a good romance. I like it better than the Judy Garland version and never saw Selznick's Janet Gaynor original. <br /> <br /> I believe they made some changes to this long-awaited DVD edition. Among other things, I remember the helicopter boot which shows that a packaged Sun Devil stadium is longer and more dramatic. I wish they had done a better job of writing, banning, banning, surrendering music to Kris or God. <br /> <br /> Along those lines, I had information from a primary source saying that music for Kris and Barbara was a problem. While interviewing my own new music documentary, Rocking the Boat: A Musical Conversation and Journey, interviewed Stephen Bruton, a good singer / songwriter / guitarist with close professional and personal ties with Kris, Bonnie Raitt and Delbert McClinton . others. Stephen was in "Speedway," the John Norman character's band. Kris had a very difficult time turning around, which was basically a pop score in something that rock could do. Stephen was and is Kris's friend and long-time member. There was tension on the set and at one stage the bond at Kris was blowing in Barbara's presence. She noticed that the band shouldn't talk to him like that. Kris realized they were his friends and they were rock and roll! In the end, Barbara came and decided to use Kris's band's live performances in the movie and specifically Stephen's role in making things work. I got even more respect for her as an artist to hear this story. Much of her is made as a diva. What she is is a pro. And I'm not gay. Not that something's wrong with that.
