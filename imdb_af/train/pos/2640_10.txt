Obviously, not many people have seen this movie because no one comments. It's not a movie to be missed. After all, it won the George Peabody Award and the Humanitas Award. Paul Winfield had won an award for his incredible performance in this movie. Eugene Logan, a co-writer for TV films, was also part of another film about humanity, or a loss of it, by a technical adviser from Truman Capote's film, The Glass House. to be. This movie is now available on DVD. If anyone is interested, I will send another letter telling how it was that Eugene Logan was the technical advisor of a movie of such a wonderful person like Truman Capote. Thank you for reading this and I hope you will find a way to see these two movies.
