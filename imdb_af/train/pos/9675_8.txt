Most people can say that if you have to spend a movie on a Saturday night, you have to be very bored. Actually, I just came back home not to be out and turned on the TV and there it was, Paulie. <br /> <br /> I missed the opening credits, so I didn't know its name, but I saw that it had Cheech Marin in it, so of course I thought I agreed to "Born In East LA " When I saw him talking to a parrot, I was ready to dismiss it as the kind of flop movie they showed late at night. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, it was better than that. As you know, if you haven't already lost Paulie and are trying to return to their original owner. Looks like it's been years to find her. What Paulie's advantage should be is a dis-advantage in ways. People come across a literate parrot and everything they see is a way to earn money or benefit themselves. <br /> <br /> While Cheech Marin's character "is" to make money from him, he's not common to him. The dance series with the parrots is something that children will find nice. I found them amusing. <br /> <br /> Paulie, who is naive, quickly learns that not all people are beautiful people. Especially the owner of an animal research laboratory. The man told him he would help him find his owner as long as he helped in his research on animal communication. Paulie is now stuck, but decides to make a fool out of the man at a demonstration of Paulie's vocal ability. <br /> <br /> In the course of the film, Paulie tells his story to the facilitator who eventually frees him, several other animals and finds the location of Paulie's owner. It's a touch. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10, the wing rock scene must be adopted and not shown. The part can bother younger children. Otherwise, it's a good movie for older kids and adults who are a child at heart. (END)
