OK, so the Oscars look a little more a year. And I waited for "Gosford Park" to win (come on, Robert Altman has earned an Oscar for years!). That said, it is high time for an African American to win the best actress. Unlike the previous reviewer, Halle Berry's role in "Monster's Ball" was much more original than Nicole Kidman in "Moulin Rouge"; I would never have thought of naming the latter for anything, especially in a year that saw "Mulholland Dr". <br /> <br /> Among the things I predicted were the attacks on September 11; I knew they'd say something about freedom. Yes, yes. Robert Redford needs to know better. But unlike the previous reviewer, Whoopi Goldberg is not the worst host (Bob Hope's hosts, among whom I have no respect); I really loved John Ashcroft. <br /> <br /> So, although I didn't give the best picture, "The 74th Annual Academy Awards", I still satisfied myself (I have to admit, I enjoy the Oscars more than my own birthday) . And the next day, when my parents and I were walking around in the homes of Bandalier, New Mexico - it was spring break. I thought to myself that when Jim Broadbent won his Oscar, most people looked and asked, "Jim who?" I wonder if Woody Allen will ever attend the Oscars again.
