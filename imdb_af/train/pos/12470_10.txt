I just watched this movie on TV. <br /> <br /> I lost my dad when I was young and this movie certainly touched me. <br /> <br /> I can feel the lost feeling the girl Desi felt. <br /> <br /> The feeling of wanting to see her dad again. <br /> <br /> Want to talk to him. <br /> <br /> or at least given the chance to say goodbye. <br /> <br /> And I was touched with the letter that was written back to her. <br /> <br /> says her father reads her letter, and sends it back to someone to answer her and buy her a gift because there is no store in heaven. <br /> <br /> It just makes me feel that miracles exist.
