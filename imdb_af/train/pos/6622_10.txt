I just went to a show of the movie at Expresion and Corto, a short film festival in Guanajuato, Mexico. One of the producers was there and gave a brief introduction. I was astonished by the movie role and the first shot: one long-running shot of a futuristic Paris in glorious black and white. <br /> <br /> I don't have to go ahead with the details, because I think it's a movie worth seeing. The sci-fi story can be found for many people ... for me it was very good. The action is great, the camera is free to fly anywhere and I mean anywhere. Things you can't do or see are beautifully achieved. The role performance is good, in my opinion no one beats the wrong note. <br /> <br /> Now, the thing I've found fantastic is the animation. 3D graphics look 2D. A BW comic book was brought to life. The details in the background give more texture as if done by hand (I'm sure it was but if the angles change, you'll see the depth). <br /> <br /> The producer at the show talked about the hard work behind the movie: 7 years! The director, she said, was brilliant, but perhaps he was quite inexperienced because he had only one short film in his CV. So, many people had true faith in them. They started their own studio from scratch and since then they have faced the challenge. <br /> <br /> Don't miss it. I don't think you'll regret it. Perhaps Richard Linklater is better than he thinks for the final appearance of this movie.
