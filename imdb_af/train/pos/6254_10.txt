I just watched this movie at the 2001 International Film Festival in Toronto. The work title there was 'Dog Days'. The hearing reaction is mixed. Some people have found that graphic sex and realistic violence are too much for them. Others seemed to really appreciate how good this film was. <br /> <br /> This movie is not for the faint of heart. It's like "Happiness" with explicit sex and a less optimistic view of humanity. There is an animal poisoning, a regional burial of a senior citizen, an orgy bath house in a shopping mall, anal Christmas penetration and the molestation of mental disability. <br /> <br /> If any of these sounds like too much to handle, then this movie is not for you. This film shows humanity at its most desperate and pathetic. The banality of our existence has shifted with great glory to our face. <br /> <br /> Seidl has no interest in the salvation of mankind here. And why should he? This film has excellent performances by everyone involved, is always interesting, and is probably the most intelligent social statement ever made on film.
