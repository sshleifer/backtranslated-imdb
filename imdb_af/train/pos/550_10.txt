It's such a fantastic movie, a Western from a self-managed man (Jimmy Stewart) goes to the Klondike for gold. Along the way, he is hampered by a local sheriff in Alaska (John McIntire, who has done a wonderful evil). McIntire threatens to be a dead man if he ever comes back through his town, which is unfortunately the only way to return to the States. The main part of the story is about the peaceful Klondike village of Dawson being upside down by new residents of McIntire's town. Ruth Roman, for example, who with Stewart and his two companions (Jay C. Flippen and Walter Brennen, who play Stewart's best friend), build a salon (a Hollywood front for a whorehouse) and try the town to manage restaurant and hang-out place outside of business. She paved the way for McIntire and she went to go. In 1953, Jimmy Stewart and director Anthony Mann made one of the peaks of the Western genre, The Naked Spur. The Far Country is just the smallest bit less, and it contains 99.9% of what made the film so special without, of course, feeling like a cheap copy. Like The Naked Spur, the Far Country offers beautiful cinematography on the spot. The landscape is beautiful. Stewart gives one of his best achievements (almost equal to his greatest success in 1954, Rear Window). I think it can be regarded as a cliche, as he starts a selfish loner and learns how that kind of existence ultimately plays out. Yet Stewart plays it so well, he makes this character very human. And the supporting performances are universally fantastic. In addition to the ones I mentioned, the lovely French actress Corinne Calvet is very good. And I also have to hand out Walter Brennen. He looks specialized in playing best friends. His relationship with Stewart is very much touched, as he is the only character to bring any humanity into the cynical man. The script is very well written, and Mann's direction is impeccable. N masterpiece. 10/10.
