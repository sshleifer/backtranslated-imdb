I've been a fan of Pushing Daisies since the beginning. It's great, and Bryan Fuller has the most remarkable ideas for this show. <br /> <br /> It's amazing how much TV needs a creative, original show like Pushing Daisies. It's a great relief to see a show, it's different from the rest, where if you compare it to some of the newer shows, like Scrubs and House, you would see the similarities, and it gets boring at moments to see shows so close to identity. <br /> <br /> With a great game, great screenplay and dedication in every episode, Pushing Daisies is by far one of the most remarkable shows on your television.
