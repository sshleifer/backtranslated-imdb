As a comic book reader, who still regards me as a total child, I admit that I might have been a little bias towards this movie. I mean, there was quite a good superhero movie out there. (NOTE: Batman Forever was NOT a good superhero movie). I really wanted this movie to be good, and unlike most of my recent cinema trips (see Blair Witch Project), I wasn't disappointed. <br /> <br /> Mystery Men were definitely not a high-impact, stress-filled stuffed action movie, it was a comedy. And on the basis it was a success. It all laughed in the little theater, and applauded and laughed right through the final scene. Quieter and Garofolo is hilarious together, as always, and Azaria just adds the right touch of madness. William H. Macy plays a good straight man, while Kel Mitchell and Paul Rubens, with a fast-paced power, just added to keep the kiddies happy. <br /> <br /> Although the sets are bizarre (and sometimes it looks like ripoffs from both Batman and Blade Runner), some of the jokes are obvious, it's still just funny. There are a few lines that even catch the most worn out viewer, and bring tears of the stomach lambs among us. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie. Although it's not an all-time classic, it's twice as funny as the latest Austin powers. The writing is good, and the throw is GREAT. If you're worried, plan the matinee and pay less, but either you'll be pleasantly surprised. I mean, who among us doesn't root for the losers?
