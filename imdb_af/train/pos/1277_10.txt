I consider this movie to be the best about Mike Hammer, with Biff Elliott's performance, the definite Mike Hammer. Harry Essex's writing is excellent and contains many improvements on Mickey Spillane's novel. His direction is strong and imaginative, and he makes fine use of light and shade. The camera work by John Alton is top-notch, just like the score by Franz Waxman. The film includes many veteran players, as well as Peggie Castle in her memorable performance as Charlotte Manning. All in all, this is one of the best private eye films ever made. Biff Elliott and Haary Essex needed more opportunities. I always cost this movie.
