As the prototype of the classic Errol Flynn adventure movie and with a good story, as well as two more brilliant co-stars in Maureen O'Hara (which is a beautiful beauty!) And Anthony Quinn, I can only recommend this movie to anyone who even has the slightest taste for romance and adventure. <br /> <br /> Hollywood at its best!
