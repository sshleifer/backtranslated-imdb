It's always a good surprise when a movie made for TV seems to be like Little Richard. It's a very watchable movie about the story of Rock and Roller, Little Richard played by an actor named Leon I've never seen before, but a very good job. Like most TV movies, it's a bit slower than Cinema's. It's a pity, because I'm sure there's a lot we could see about Little Richard who was controversial. Instead, we see many religious rubbish which is the only thing that spoils the film and eventually spoils a very promising career. All in all, this movie is good and the play is above the average of a TV movie. 7 out of 10.
