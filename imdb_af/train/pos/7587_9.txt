I have to say I was impressed that cinematography was great, the frames close to perfection and the way he built up the tension around a topic that sounds more like a horrible drill is out. <br /> <br /> The movie is about two narrators, one seen, one invisible. They both try to explain the meaning of a series of paintings that caused a long scandal. The film is about theories and statements of opinions, but the conclusion is pretty shocking what I have to say. Definitely a movie that earns more than 171 votes. <br /> <br /> With just 66 minutes to depict it, the movie still felt like a full-fledged work. Great direction! I have to say much better than the poet's Blood that reminds me a little bit odd. <br /> <br /> I suppose you can call it the snake word "artsy". It's pretty much just a very professional talk about various theories and beautiful visual effects, but the crew and Ruiz pulled it off. At least for me. A wonderful movie.
