This game is very addictive. I played it straight for hours until late at night, but also the fact that you can't save a game when you are in space sometimes contributed to just playing to not play. Solve any game data. <br /> <br /> So yes, "Freelancer" is addictive but also very flawed. Also, something that really bothered me was that you couldn't hit any of the cut scene, so you had to cut the same scene the same time. A great opportunity for me to multitask to check my email or have a conversation with my friends and more, while waiting for the cut to be over. <br /> <br /> The story begins with promising, but the farther you get, the more ridiculous it gets. Also the game ends pretty suddenly, at least it did for me. It is very clear that they think of a subsequent successor. I don't know if a successor is currently in the works, but I'm sure I'll probably pick one as soon as it gets released. <br /> <br /> The game is very easy! Even for those who are not familiar with flight games. To put it bravely, every fool can play this game. Yes, some levels are very difficult and require a lot of effort. It took me about 1-2 weeks to complete this game, which may be too short. But thank God for the multiplayer option! It allows you to play short missions just like the single-player game once you finish it. <br /> <br /> Although the fate of the mission is the same, it just keeps cool in <br /> <br /> The graphics are good, but nothing revolutionary or anything. <br /> <br /> Addictive gameplay but watch out for the bugs. <br /> <br /> 7/10
