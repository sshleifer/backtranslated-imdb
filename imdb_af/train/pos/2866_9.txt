I grew up on this classic Western series, and as a child it always seemed to be a surprise to see it late on Sunday evenings. Bonanza is still infinitely viewable in re running. <br /> <br /> The series of chronicles the adventures of the Cartwright family, living on a farm near Virginia City, Nevada, in the Civil War. Their farm (called the Ponderosa) is managed and defended by widowed father Ben and his unmarried three sons, Adam, Hoss and Little Joe. These three brothers have different mothers, all of whom have died many years ago. <br /> <br /> The Cartwrights is a hardworking, prosperous and honorable family highly respected in those parts. The Ponderosa is large so that the extreme of the Ponderosa is reached, requires a lot of horse riding. Travel is also often needed to buy or sell cattle. Needless to say, few of these outings inevitably succeed. Although hospitable, much of the Cartwrights energy needs to be devoted to defending their farming of interlopers, or protecting themselves from villagers who are jealous of their prosperity and star reputation. The Cartwrights do a fair amount of firearms in the air and such, but only shoot to kill when considered necessary. They are involved in various city issues, even the political life of the Nevada area. <br /> <br /> One of the main assets of the series is the underlying warmth that is always present (despite deviations) between Ben and his three sons, and (despite frequent differences of opinion) between the three brothers. Now, one brother may occasionally beat another, but in general he has a good reason and his anger never lasts long! The characters are all very well drawn. Ben is portrayed as a successful and noble man of great integrity. The eldest son, Adam, the most rational and suave of the brothers, left halfway through the series. The middle brother, Hoss, is a gentle giant of a teddy bear, who has an unforgettable appetite for food and is a bit shy of the ladies. The youngest, Little Joe, is a hot-tempered, attractive lover, who, on the other hand, has a great way with women. This trio of brothers enjoys different romances, but their love interests are typically killed at the end of the episode, or marriage is impossible for whatever reason. <br /> <br /> The actors are all stars in their roles, including Pernell Roberts (Adam), Dan Blocker (Hoss), Michael Landon (Little Joe), and of course Lorne Greene as the principal family patriarch, Ben. I also love the farm food, Hop Sing, played by Victor Sen Yung. <br /> <br /> It's a great action packed western with great values. The Cartwrights are always the noble heroes and most of the bad guys are very shameful. If there were just more programs like these vintage creatures on TV, it is today!
