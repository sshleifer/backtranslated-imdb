The movie "Atlantis: The Lost Empire" is a shining jewel in the rubbish of films recently produced by Disney Studios. Parents who had to sit by "The Jungle Book 2" or even a Pok√©mon movie would really appreciate this one. <br /> <br /> The movie is one of the few to try to get an original story. previous feature films were merely repetitions of existing stories. Movies like "Toy Story", "Finding Nemo" and "Monsters Inc." Everyone does the same, but it should be noted that all of Pixar was made and only distributed by Disney. Recent films from Disney Studios are mostly released directly to video, and follow an existing successful movie. The quality of the films is given away to profitability. A new era began with "Atlantis", followed by "Mulan", "Lilo & Stitch", and most recently "Open Range". The authors have created all the original story lines instead of the fairy tales of the past. <br /> <br /> A good part of the movie is devoted to the quest for Atlantis, a task that imagines many for hundreds of years. Including those of young Milo Thatch, pronounced by Michael J. Fox. Milo is serving a museum in Washington, D.C. His grandfather was a well-known archaeologist who devoted his life to discovering Atlantis. It was regarded by his peers as a waste, and they want Milo not to follow in his footsteps. After failing to convince the museum council to sponsor his expedition, Milo came home to find a woman in his dark apartment. She took him to her employer, Mr. Whitmore. Whitmore was a good friend of Milo's grandfather and wanted to send Milo a team to find Atlantis. Mr. Whitmore is very rich and pays the best of everything. The crew going with him is the same as his grandfather. The journey is filled with very big obstacles to overcome and is great to watch. The viewer finds themselves trapped or reaching Atlantis. The plot takes an unexpected turn after the discovery of Atlantis, not just the discovery of people. It's enough to keep the interest of the older audience. <br /> <br /> The animators have done a wonderful job in the depth of the animation. The movie is very successful in blending traditional animation with computer-generated images. An achievement not easily achieved, most audiences are quick to see the difference in the two. The characters are credible human. There are some nice hunting scenes, with lots of action going on. A few lulls are filled with jokes that the children might not get. <br /> <br /> The creativity of the writers really shines. The culture of Atlantis is richly developed, including a whole language. The film uses references to Atlantis from historical sources, such as Plato. The disappearance of Atlantis from the world is explained. Credible, as by a younger audience, the magic really exists. The powers of the people of Atlantis are not exactly presented as magic, but can best be described in this way. <br /> <br /> Although the level of technology used in 1914 is unrealistic. The trip is in a submarine reminiscent of Captain Nemo's nautilus, complete with sub-arrows that are fire hydrants. The giant diggers are powered by boilers, so they have tried for some era technology. The female characters are empowered in such a way that women of old age have not been, even in leadership. It's not a bad thing. It gives a good role model for my daughter to watch, rather than a male cast. <br /> <br /> One reason this movie is my favorite over other Disney movies is that there is no single song, ever. A tradition that begins with the first feature film, "Snow White", and continued through to "The Lion King", is almost every Disney movie full of perfect songs. This is wonderful and everything, what would be the Seven Dwarfs without "High Ho!" After the millionth time through it would be almost better, but this one saves the parent. Not once does every single person on the screen suddenly know the words of a song that no one has heard before and break out in song. I'm grateful. <br /> <br /> The storyline and depth of animation are sure to keep the attention of both parent and child. It's a movie I want to watch with my children again and again.
