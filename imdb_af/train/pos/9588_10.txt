When Paris burned, I came out, I completely dismissed it. I wasn't in the whole of Madonna and vogueing phenomenon. I thought it was going to be tough and stupid. How wrong I was about this movie. I watched it after the movie was out for ten years and I ran it out and bought it. It took me back to a time and place of fun and excitement. I felt as though I knew all the characters personally. The 80's were spectacular and the film captured the essence of the gay culture. What a great job! I went to the internet and found out what some of the original role-cast members did now, but I couldn't find them all. If anyone has any information about any of the cast members, please let me know. <br /> <br /> I hope they make another documentary. I WAS THEREFORE
