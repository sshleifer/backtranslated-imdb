The movie is very realistic. Ultimately, it doesn't belong to the Hollywood genre where every line should be expressed in a perfect way and where every move is exactly. The actors who play the roles of the lovers do a BIG work that represents the characters' feelings and thoughts - their everyday adventures. Overall, the movie climbs the viewer into a depressing state. This is where the realism of the whole story is clear. Not everything happens as we think it should happen. I can say that the movie doesn't end on a bad note. We look, we learn, we experience ourselves. This is probably the moral of this story.
