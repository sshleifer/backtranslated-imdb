This film is as unique as it is overlooked ...... Another story is just that, it shows how out of the need to survive or maintain one can find the ability to love if you have an open heart as well as an open mind. I only saw it on cable in the late 70's and it depicted the gay community constraints at the time. I believe this movie was before his time portraying a small piece of a dark way of life. It is truly a classic in that it was a forerunner to what is now portrayed as the extended family. This film should be available on DVD / VHS so that not only the extraordinary performances of Meg Foster & Perry King can be recognized, but to show how far we've come and still have to go where relationships are involved.
