I just watched the first series on DVD, but would sum up the Sopranos as a Shakespeare plot with a Tarantino-like script. The series is as good as Goodfellas and Casino, and almost as good as The Godfather (not a 10-year-old), and much better than any of Guy Ritchie's efforts. Although there is a lot of action, some of it is very bloody, the story is character-driven. Even some of the small characters add to big story lines; eg the priest's relationship (or lack) with Carmilla and the restorer's wife, and Christopher and his blind friend (who did not last long (a nominee for the Darwin award?) <br /> <br /> Apart from the plot, the writing and the acting, the other reasons I liked it; <br /> <br /> 1. It made me visit New Jersey and ate pasta with a tomato sauce. music 3. It shows that literally anyone can suffer from mental health problems.
