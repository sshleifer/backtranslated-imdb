"Tintin and I" hit me first and foremost as a masterpiece documentary. Photography and editing are truly breathtaking (almost anti-dogma). <br /> <br /> We are following the life of Tintin Tray Hergé through a candid interview of 1971. The Tintin series has been drawn to the background of the great ideological battles of the twentieth century. In the midst of this Hergé has his own demons to fight, and many of his drawing activities look like an attempt to tame it and escape into a world of perfection. <br /> <br /> Although there are spectacular photographic panoramas of drawings of Tintin albums, as well as reconstructions and readings from albums, Hergé's story is completely interviewed and archived and never told by reconstructions. <br /> <br /> Hergé has the turbulent life of a true, suffering artist. But the fantastic world that came from his imagination will still be amazed by readers.
