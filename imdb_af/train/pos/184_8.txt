There are no people like "Show People" Marion Davies (as Peggy Pepper) and William Haines (like Billy Boone). My introduction to me. Davies was a "clip" of this movie; the beautifully spirited one in which she drops a scarf to reveal different emotions. My introduction to Mr. Haines is currently viewing this movie. though, it is possible that I saw him in a less memorable role. Haines makes an incredible impression when he joins Davies for a commissioner meal - throwing his hat in the ring with some amazing pieces at the dining table. Indeed, Haines and Davies are delivering wonderful comics. <br /> <br /> The story begins with Dell Henderson (Colonel Pepper), who runs daughter Davies in Hollywood, sure she'll be Tinseltown's latest sensation. In fact, Davies and the already arrived Haines become comedy stars. However, Davies wants to be a real drama queen. Davies leaves Haines, and joins the dashingly dramatic Paul Ralli. But audiences prefer Davies in more comical roles; Maybe director King Vidor offered a case for art that imitates life? <br /> <br /> Full of great Hollywood spot material, both on set and off. Full large "cameos"; At a studio lunch, at the star table, Davies sits between Douglas Fairbanks and William S. Hart. The best "little" player, however, is Charlie Chaplin, who has enough nerve to ask Davies for her signature! While the cameos are fun, they help, and the episodic sequences, "Show People" become less of an important movie, and more of an important historical document. <br /> <br /> ******** Show People (11/11/28) King Vidor ~ Marion Davies, William Haines, Dell Henderson
