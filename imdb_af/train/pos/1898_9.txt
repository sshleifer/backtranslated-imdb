The father of Who's alcoholic drummer, Keith Moon, called Arthur. I found so many similarities between Dudley Moore and Keith Moon in this movie. Liza Minelli, who usually exceeded, had quite a good job in this one and could turn cheek on Dudley Moore in every turn. Yes, I agree, Sir John absolutely stole every scene. It was a very "different" movie, enabling the viewer to have a look at another life. We often try to catch a repeat of this movie on satellite. God rests Dudley Moore; It was such a nice movie. Lots of satire and thumbs to the rich and snobby / prosperous. The good friendship between Moore and Sir John is quite engaging.
