This movie is a classic in every sense of the word. It is very entertaining and also very disturbing. The acting in this movie is well done. The story itself is credible, exciting and well thought out. Character development is also well done, the audience can clearly see how each of the characters is emotionally tested by this film. The villains in this movie are very threatening, from the first moment the audience sees them, they can say they are something. This movie shows how, when taken out of civilization and sitting in the middle of the forest, facing a life or death situation, it becomes almost as wild and wild as the animals living in it. Not everyone is going to like this movie, there are many disturbing content that can make some viewers uncomfortable. It's definitely worth watching. This movie is a masterpiece.
