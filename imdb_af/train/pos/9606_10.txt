It was the best movie I've ever seen about Bulimia. It strikes the exact place that Bulimia really is about and how it's not always about being slim and diet. It showed how people with Bulimia tend to think of things like their outlook on life, friends and themselves. The best rule and part that really shows the problem with Bulimia is when Beth says, "It's not about you!" That line showed a lot about the character and others with the same problem. It has shown that people with Bulimia do not have this problem because of anything to do with someone else. It only has to do with them and them. It shows that it is time to talk about the person with the problem instead of focusing on themselves. It showed that Beth needed attention at that moment and she needed her mother's attention most of the time.
