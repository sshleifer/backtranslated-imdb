"The Last Hard Men" is a typical Western for the 70's. Most of them seem to be inspired by Sam Peckinpah. Also this one, but director Andrew McLaglan is a John Ford pupil and this can of course be shown in many scenes. IMO the start is very good. In a way, McLaglan wanted to show the audience of civilization to the desert. In the third part there are illogical mistakes and I complain about Charlton Heston. He has to play an old ex-lawyer named Sam Burgade, but he is in a fantastic physical shape. I never had the feeling that he really had trouble getting on a horse or on a rock. For me, he doesn't seem very motivated as he usually does in most of his epic movies. The same goes for the beautiful Barbara Hershey who plays the sheriff's daughter. Perhaps both had problems with the director or they were unhappy with their roles. Hershey and Coburn don't show their best, but they're still good. If scriptwriter John Wayne had in their minds like Sam Burgade? Michael Parks as a modern sheriff is also a little underutilized in his role. On the other hand, James Coburn is a ban on Zach Provo. Coburn is a very big villain in this one. He portrays the bad man between manic hatred and smartness. His role and play is the best of the movie. <br /> <br /> Landscapes and Shootouts are great. The shooting scene is bloody and the violence seems realistic. Zach Provo and his gang had greedy and violent scenes. What I miss is the typical Western action in the middle of the movie. I would appreciate a bank robbery or something similar. Overall, it's an entertaining Western movie. Not a good movie, but above average because of a good Coburn, a very good start and some greedy and violent scenes.
