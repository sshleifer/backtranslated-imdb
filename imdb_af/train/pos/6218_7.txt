79/100. Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers never teamed up with big movies. Although not one of their best, it is an excellent musical. There are some outstanding musical numbers, good support from Randolph Scott. Two notable performances, Betty Grable and Lucille Ball make unforgettable early appearances. Ball is exceptionally good, and also a blonde. The "Let's Face the Music and Dance" is one of the best music numbers ever. Harriet Hilliard, better known as Harriet Nelson of "Ozzie and Harriet" plays Ginger Roger's sister. The basic plot is fairly familiar, but with the exception of this exception, it works. Excellent art direction and counting.
