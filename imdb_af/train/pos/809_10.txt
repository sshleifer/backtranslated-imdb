A very good movie. A classic sci-fi movie with humor, action and everything. This movie offers a greater number of strangers. We see the leaders of the rebel alliance and many of the imperial powers. The Emperor is somewhat of an original character. I love the Ewoks who somehow represent the indigenous worlds and Vietnam. (Excellent references) I loved the duel between Father and Luke, which is the best of the saga. In the return of the Jedi the epilogue of the first trilogy is over and the Empire eventually falls. I also appreciated the victory party where it fulfills Father's salvation and returned in the spirit of Anakin Skywalker with Yoda and Obi-Wan. It gives a sadness and a tear. The biggest plays in Star Wars are under this movie: When the Father Turns the Emperor. Luke looks and finds comfort in Obi-Wan, Yoda and ... his father (1997 version Hayden Christenssen). The next best scene is when Luke is chasing Darth Vader to protect Leia. There is a deep dark side of this movie, though there is a good end. I felt there was much more to the eye. And as always, John William's music will bring classicism into the Star Wars universe.
