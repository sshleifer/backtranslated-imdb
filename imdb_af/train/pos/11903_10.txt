I was lucky to catch this movie while volunteering at the Maryland Film Festival. I have always been a fan of classic horror movies, and especially William Castle's trinkets, so it was definitely a must see for me. <br /> <br /> It's about the life and work of William Castle, who, in my opinion, was an underrated director. In fact, he has made some cheap budget schlocky horror movies, but he added something to these movies: real live theater gimmicks that you no longer see. For example, he had nurses if someone had a heart attack at his movies and put vibrators on the bottom of the chairs in THE TINGLER. <br /> <br /> It's really a well-made documentary and brings out this rather shadowy director, and celebrates his contributions to the horror theater. It also damages Castle as a greater than life-like character, which was much loved and had a smile on its face. <br /> <br /> Contrary to most movie documentaries, which are mostly wills of film historians, SPINE TINGLER! shows interviews mostly of his family members and directors influenced by his work, such as John Waters, John Landis and Joe Dante. A must see for classic horror and sci-fi fans.
