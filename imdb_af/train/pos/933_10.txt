I saw this movie in Christmas in the sixth grade, and I was very excited to see it, and when I heard that George C. Scott was in it, I was very excited, because I really love George C. Scott! When my class and I watched this movie, I was really in it, and when it was over, I was really impressed, I thought it was absolutely fantastic! This is the best version of Charles Dickens' classic novel I've seen so far! George C. Scott's performance as Scrooge is something else, I thought he was the perfect choice, he was Scrooge, he is the definite Scrooge! I saw two different versions of A Christmas Carol, the other one with Patrick Stewart, but that's the better one! <br /> <br /> What it really is good is the play, I thought the actors were fantastic, everyone was, the spirits, Tiny Tim, Bob Cratchit, everyone, they couldn't find any better than the kids . they did the parts! But the best part of the movie was George C. Scott! When I saw him, I thought he was the absolute best! He's the definite Ebenezer Scrooge, I don't think they could have found anyone better! I don't think they could have found someone better to replace someone in the movie! <br /> <br /> This movie is probably the definitive movie adaptation of the classic by Charles Dickens, and I really think you will agree, you will think this movie is fabulous! I will probably have to buy this movie on DVD, because I thought it was fantastic! I recommend you see this masterpiece! This is the best version of a Christmas Carol, period. <br /> <br /> 10/10
