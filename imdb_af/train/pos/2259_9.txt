I bought this cheap of the rent remnant from our local store. It was in very little condition, and I never heard it. Obviously no one else has. <br /> <br /> I can't believe my happiness. You go through the whole wealth of emotions and try to get a complex message - the very moral and non-triumphant attitude of the Mandela party. Despite its enormous length (I had to see it in two sittings) - it was like a book you couldn't lay down. Perhaps the songs are not so memorable, but the spirit of the thing forever. I cannot comment that a musical (clearly designed for the stage) is not realistic! I saw "South Pacific" and also read the book, and can ensure that musical is not realistic compared to the book. I'll treasure this little find until it's exhausted. One day they will make it on a better budget again. <br /> <br />
