I saw a trailer on Afro Promo, the movie movie collection for African Americans. It looked like it was; a highly tedious "wacky" comedy in which an exciting black man realizes his son is gay. Redd Foxx's (RF) wife seems to have left him for his brother, who works with him at the Phoenix store. He took the bus to visit his son. Norman is Los Angeles. <br /> <br /> Once RF arrives, Norman, wearing nothing but powder blue bikini shorts, comes out of his waterbed to answer the door. To try to buy time by making his older dad, take the stairs that seem to be the 60th floor, Norman tries to wake his lover, who refuses to visit. It was just to the point where I wrote "Why won't he wake up?" when he suddenly did, and my friend's jaw and I dropped out for the first time, like us with our first glance at the blue eye, whiskers Garson, Norman's white live-in-lover, who only had the most faaaaaabulous dream? ? "Garson is a flaming queen of a kind that can only be envisaged from 1976 LA. He has dresses and a purse and lots of jewelry and looks like he modeled his appearance and persona on The Brady Bunch's Carol Brady <br /> <br /> Norman commands his lover to find somewhere else to stay during his father's visit Garson will stay with Waylon Flowers and answer the phone when Norman calls. So RF tries to reach his wife in Mexico, while on the phone, Garson comes in to pack his dress and RF confronts him, with an outburst of 70's, soul music meant to elicit his revelation (but more than we are about to hear a very special track through The Emotions), he realizes his son is gay. <br /> <br /> His first impulse is: "I'll kill him. I'll kill him. "Then RF goes on a long walk, in which he walks through all the thoughts a confused parent can have, like" maybe we trained toilet too soon. " His thoughts are all caused by something he sees on his run, for example, a truck driver who appears just as he contemplates making a real man, and surprisingly he goes to a bookshop and buys about eight books on homosexuality. , is about eight books on homosexuality that my parents bought, then goes straight to a park bench and reads them all! <br /> <br /> RF hire then Audrey, a six foot Amazon prostitute (in this great fur thing) played by Tamara Dobson of Cleopatra Jones, who hired her for Norman to try out heterosexuality, but it kills Norman and he rushes to stay with his friend Melody. <br /> <br /> Garson came over and offered to rest for the night, worried about the loss of RF's wife, telling the story of his own mother, who had an irrational bias against Pilippinos because she was "molested on a luau "They live a long march of Wayon and Madame, leading up to Mrs swinging against the piano, until her hair comes loose. Once again the mouth was agape. <br /> <br /> So, you don't know, RF and Garson have a wonderful evening together! You see, naughty, traditional older black men just have to watch the crazy, extremely slight entertainment of mega-queens to come to offer ALL gay worlds! It's really that simple! It still does not prevent RF from screaming rape. when Garson wakes him out of a bad dream. It ends less predictably than you would think. <br /> <br /> There was so much just down. What is the basis of Norman and Garson's relationship? They don't seem to report, and Norman doesn't have to worry about Garson, and even when he gets up, he never defends Garson or speaks of their relationship. There were some sweet features like RF to buy all the books on homosexuality - and sit right on the park bench to read them! I like the idea that a parent is actually trying to find something about homosexuality, rather than just getting drunk or forcing friends. <br /> <br /> Unlike that, it's kind of just what it looks like: a little relic of an earlier era, an era in which some gay people thought if straight people sat up straight and " Seeing a portable puppet performance, we can all learn to love and understand each other! And because of the very naive of this thing, the extreme stereotypes and message-laden dialogue are just as charming outdated, and offer a large number of grievances for discussion on how things have changed for gays for the past 30 years. I think the only objectionable thing is the idea that gays' female friends are desperately in love with them, and are willing to get drunk to sleep with and to change them. <br /> <br /> ------ Hey, look at Cinema de Merde, my website about bad and cheesy movies (with some good movies thrown in).
