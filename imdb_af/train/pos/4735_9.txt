I saw and loved the new redubbed and edited version yesterday. Then I went home and watched it with captions and I loved it. I'm ready to see it again. <br /> <br /> I am a sucker for the gentle mannered secret identity and what can be more generous than a pacifist librarian? The screens where he reveals or absents his superpowers to his friends forget to be gentle, are my favorites. <br /> <br /> Of course, martial arts is stunning. There really isn't much I can tell from them if you're familiar with the HK style. However, if you are not ... we stopped the play briefly and Walker, Texas Ranger, was up. We noticed that after each strike there was a cut. Not in black mask. <br /> <br />
