Talented detective Mr. Philo Vance (William Powell) canceled his overseas trip to investigate a seemingly cut and dried suicide case. He has good reason to suspect, is really a lot more, a very nice complex murder! <br /> <br /> As far as killing murder movies are concerned, it just doesn't get any better than this one. Confirming with suspicious characters who are all linked to a dog program and all with very good reason to kill the apparent suicide victim, Archer Coe, is it really difficult to find this one or turn the head over, But boy, it seems fascinating to see unfold before us. Even the policemen, the objector and the district attorney prove colorful, filled characters that add a level of unexpected, eager realism to this one's proceedings and reinforce his overall "fun" factor. I especially enjoyed the comics that were played by the wanderer (played by Etienne Girardot). It seems he is always interrupted and untimely interrupted by the discovery of dead bodies or injured men during this time. Also Eugene Palette's Detective Sgt. Heath welcomes, often later humorously, at his expense, critical comments during Vance's investigation. I can't think of any valid criticism to actually give this movie, except perhaps it wasn't very well dated. Don't stop the movie just looking at a good fun. See if you can turn your head around this mystery. Highly recommended you try!
