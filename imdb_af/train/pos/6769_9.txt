I watched this show when I was a girl. Although I don't remember much, I must say that it was a pretty good performance. Also, I don't think I've seen every episode. However, if you ask me, it was still a good show. I remember the theme song vaguely. Everyone was ideally cast, the costume design was wonderful. The performances were also top grade. I just hope a network brings this series back one day so I can see every episode. Before I upload it, I'd like to say that I will always remember this show in my memory, though I don't think I've seen every episode. Now, finally, when and when this show is ever brought back into the air, I hope you'll catch it one day before it goes well out of the air.
