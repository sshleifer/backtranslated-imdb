Man over the house is a real situation comedy in every sense of the word. The comedy relates to a character called Robin Tripp (played by the great Richard O 'Sullivan) who finds himself after a wild festival, and ends at the house of two ladies named Jo and Chrissy. Ironically, the party was held to say goodbye to their old resident. The obvious occurs when he enters. <br /> <br /> The man over the house was a poet of Cooke and Mortimer's spin show George and Mildred who were the 2 characters who owned Jo, Chrissy and Robin. These two characters would actually appear to be a man of the house with Mildred (Yootha Joyce, the late and much missed), especially to get the best rules of the series. A semi-normal character was Larry (Doug Fisher), a useless person who was always on fire and just came around when he wanted to borrow (and never come back). <br /> <br /> The Americans did a version called Three's Company, but it doesn't stand a chance if it is compared to this much stranger original. Thames had a risk of making a comedy about a man sharing a 2-woman apartment at a very conservative time, but they should be concerned as the ratings suggest that about 20 million people are just fine old-fashioned piece of comedy wanted to see. inspired casting and sharp writing. What a pity modern comedy can't reach that high standard. <br /> <br /> This program is available on network DVD
