Like this show ... smart play, smart dialogue, great storyline with real people .... please bring it back or make it available online ... really miss it. Hope Davis really shines in this show. I like the idea of ​​SIX DEGREES ... It really makes sense in this insane world. Remember yourself from those stupid reality shows and give this show a second chance. Bring it back. Not to grovel .. but please! When it was off the air, I watched online and watched it with minimal interruptions. In fact, ABC makes it easy to enjoy shows if you miss it at the forefront ... the days of endless tapering. When you want to bring it back again, I'm ready.
