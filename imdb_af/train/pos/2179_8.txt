Prix ​​de Beauté was made aware of the transition from silence to sound, which came a little later in Europe than in Hollywood. Originally thought of as a silence, it was released with a soundtrack in France, with a French actress speaking Louise Brooks' lines, but released in Italy and other parts of Europe as a silence. I was happy to see the Cineteca di Bologna's flawless new recovery of an Italian style print at the Tribeca Film Festival. I haven't seen the talkie version yet, but I think it's safe to assume that the silent version is far more satisfying as the reports are poor in all reports (Louise Brooks clearly speaks English, so there's no way which her lips may not match.) Also, the movie is completely silent, with few titles and little need for dialogue. Prix ​​de Beauté visually tells his story, with exciting, imaginative camera work. The opening is immediately kinetic, with fast-cut scenes of urban life and swimmers splashing on a public beach. Throughout the film there is emphasis on visual detail, on clothes, machinery, decoration and symbolic images like a chopped bird, a lot of torn pictures, a diamond bracelet. It is a silent movie technique at its peak. <br /> <br /> Of course, Louise Brooks is responsible for saving the movie from the dark. Considering it makes it more heartbreaking to think that it was her last major role. Radiantly beautiful, dominating the film with her charisma and also giving a perfectly natural but highly-charged display. Her role here, more than in the Pabst movies she is best known for, is a woman who can fully understand and sympathize with us. She plays Lucienne Garnier, a typist with a proprietary fiancee, who wants to get more out of life and secretly enter a beauty contest, with immediate success. She is then torn between the excitement of her glamorous new life and her love for the man who insists she picks it up or loses it all. All the characters are drawn with nuances. The fiancé inspires pity and is not just a brute. He loves Lucienne, but is a limited man who cannot deal with her with a life apart from him or attract the attention of other men. Even the "other man" in the story is not the simple clever one we first assume him, although his intentions may be as possessive as the fiancee. <br /> <br /> ********** *************** WARNING: SPOILERS BEGIN ************* **** <br /> <br /> The film has very fine set pieces, including Lucienne's triumph in the "Miss Europe" competition, shown by the comic reactions of various members of the audience, who stop the heroine picking flowers; her misery as housewife, potato peel, while the cuckoo bell's sling lies behind her; a nightmare trip to a fun show (in the silent version it happens late in the film, after her marriage), where Lucienne, among the low-spirited and suppressed by her husband's macho feces, decides that she is not can not cope with her current existence; and especially the last scene in the projection room where she sees her talkie screen test. Louise Brooks never looked more beautiful than she did here, with the projector's bundle flickering on her alabaster profile, her shoulders sitting in white fur, her face glowing under her black helmet as she saw her singing on the screen . The double shot of her beautiful body and her still image on the screen is particularly attractive. Louise Brooks's image, like Lucienne's, remains immortal despite her frustrating apostate career.
