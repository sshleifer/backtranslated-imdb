I can't understand why any of the "judges" gave this documentary "0" other than for political reasons. No, the film did not investigate both sides of the story, but surely one movie in favor of Chavez against the tides of propaganda against him should be seen as an attempt to balance the narrative whole (especially given A. the history of CIA involvement in Latin America in the contamination of civil unrest - National Security Archive and B. the coverage in that country and elsewhere of the clearly blurred scenes of Chavez supporters shooting non-rivals). What is the most wonderful thing about this movie is the fact that the filmmakers have remained in the presidential palace, although the coup - surely the first in documentary - is the image of a coup from both sides !!!
