Why on earth should you explore the fascinating nature of documentary "Earth"? How much time do you have on earth so I can explain it to you? OK, I won't extend my review exploration on the "Earth" to infinity, but I need to find out why it's a "must see". The documentary takes a cruise on the migratory routes on three animal families: a female polar bear and her cubs with the actual subplot of the father carry it to dare to find food in its isolated path, take a whale mum with her baby whale a whale of a prey migratory ride, and an elephant mum with her little one (perhaps not so small, they are elephants), the offspring migrating in Africa. Directors Alastair Forthegill & Mark Linfield also did an "out of this earth" feature to preserve the survival skills of many other animal species, except the magnetic shots of our three animal sex agonists. The cinematically-trained team of Richard Brooks Burton, Mike Holding, Adam Ravetch and Andrew Shillabeer were the animals that shoot the amazing natural areas and animal instinctive behavior. Not to mention, the sloo-animal prey shots were your own. "Earth" is also a lesson teacher about the global warming effect on animals; the Easter polar bear in the doctor is the poster animal boy on that result. So fellowmen, it's time to take the documentary journey to visit Earth today! **** Good
