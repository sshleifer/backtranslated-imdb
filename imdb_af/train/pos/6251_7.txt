It's nothing brilliant, groundbreaking or innovative, but "Dog Days" is for some reason an extremely fascinating character study. It's like CRASH, which is on a bad dose of heroin, but not really. It is an Austrian film that follows the lives of various depressed, indignant and annoying people and their abusive relationships with one another. It is disturbing but very good and it is interesting to watch the crazy little things these characters do. Certainly not for the faint-hearted, this highly pessimistic film at the end does not end or revel, we see the lives of these sordid individuals over the course of two days. Degree: B
