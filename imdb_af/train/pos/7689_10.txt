That was what black society was before the crack epidemics, gangsta rap and Aids that occupied the ghettos in the eighties. Good working families who struggled to get around and all the traumas and tribulations they faced. Black America was another group in the 1970s. Still full of hope and high on the civil rights movements of the sixties, times were difficult, but still worth fighting. Keep your head above water and make a wave when you can. This show showed how the black community struggled to work together as people and families before they started each other and everyone else to survive the ghetto's horrors. It is heartbreaking to see what the black ghettos were and what they had become.
