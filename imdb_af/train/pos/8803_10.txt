I recently watched it on the Sundance Canal. The idea for the film was to illustrate many filmmakers in their own country to make short films, eleven of them, all in one movie, focusing on just one subject: September 11. <br /> <br /> From waking up This movie I could tell why these filmmakers were big in their country because it had all the elements of a good movie. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with a film from Iran in which a teacher struggles to teach students what happened on September 11 that they didn't realize until later. <br /> <br /> The Second Film from France involves a deaf woman writing a letter to her lover while not aware of what the TV is going to play. <br /> <br /> The next film from Egypt involves the filmmaker who speaks for himself with a dead soldier about recent events, not just about 9/11 terrorists, but also elsewhere. <br /> <br /> The next one comes from Bolivia in which a girl learns about the events of September 11 and believes they should act for them. <br /> <br /> Next from a country in Africa where a group of boys follow a man they believe is Bin Ladin. <br /> <br /> The following comes from Mexico where nothing is shown, but the sounds of that day. <br /> <br /> The next of Israel, who is engaging a reporter at the scene of a bomb, is trying to get a report, but is often told by the attacks. <br /> <br /> There are other movies I can "I don't remember at the moment, but everyone is powerful. It will bring back your emotions from that day. <br /> <br /> 10/10
