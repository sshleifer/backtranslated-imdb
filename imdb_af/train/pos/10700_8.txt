It is a comedy based on national stereotypes, no doubt. If you go away as if you know if you care about communism and how real Russians or Britons are, if you accept and are not injured by the conventions, you can enjoy this movie. Nicole Kidman is at her best, sexy, moving and funny. Ben Chaplin manages to prevent Nicole from being completely without shade, and the rest of the team also does good work. The final move, and logical - movie logic, of course. Worth watching, if you accept the rules of the game.
