Overall, I'll have to say I like the movie. Some of the battle scenes are really good. Especially the fight against Leung Ka-Yan. One thing that really bothered me was the fact that they used an Asian to play a black man. I mean really. Talk about bad taste. During a fighting scene you see one of the fighters lying on the floor. Otherwise, Sammo copies Bruce Lee's fight move perfectly. 5 out of 10 stars.
