I just came back from an advanced performance of Redeye and I have to say I didn't have much fun on a movie for a long time. WEST CRAVEN is always at its best. He brings us a wonderful end to the summer thriller. I was so urgent. This is the excitement of the year. No doubt. <br /> <br /> All the actors are great and the action is realistic and fun. The F / X was large. It has constantly built up tension. I was on the edge of my seat most of the movie. It was a while since I heard that an audience was brave and slammed into a theater. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for excitement, action and a good plot this summer, REDEYE delivers. Go see it!
