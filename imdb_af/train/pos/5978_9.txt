It's a real 80's movie. Back they might have made 100 times more movies than today. This makes many of them very interesting. It was a cultural phenomenon that no longer existed. Today, perhaps the same kind of people who made cheap "straight-to-video" movies in the eighties can do cheap porn. Pornie seems to be selling. Anyway, it's above the medium trash film level: It has a good and fascinating story, and it's pretty well made I think. In one scene you can even see the microphone floating on the top edge of the picture. Of course, there are also small comics by Ozzy and Gene Simmons, but they do not contribute much to the film's success, although they are good at their small roles. The monster, singer "Sammi Curr" really looks terrible, especially when he sings. One of the scariest monsters I've seen in horror flicks. I can have nightmares from him next night. Not recommended for intellectual movie lovers.
