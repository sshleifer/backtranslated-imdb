Of course, it is aimed at the same market as Monsters Inc. and Shrek, but is different in its lesser sense (despite the deliberate cartoon features of the main being). The story is not one that had a massive face in your face (it is more like its envelope at your shirt sleeves) but just chooses to tell a story about relationships between different "animals". You know the outcome, but you can't help getting recorded. <br /> <br /> The characters themselves are much more than their voices (the benefit of lesser-known actors doing the voices), unlike most Disney movies. They are well rounded and completely credible, weird. The group dynamics are brilliantly presented and the character revelations and attributes are subtle and pleasing. You will soon wake yourself up as you would think. <br /> <br /> The animation is brilliant, as you would expect, and you will pray for the opportunity to move on the ice in the Movie. You will fall in love with the characters, especially the comic relief of the prehistoric squirrel and his desperate efforts to bury his nuts. I came out who needed the compulsory goods, especially the lazy toys, to be disappointed the next day, when I couldn't see anything that was vaguely related. <br /> <br /> Making the movie remarkable makes the movie cleaner. <br /> <br /> Better than Monsters Inc. or Shrek.
