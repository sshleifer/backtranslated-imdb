Conrad Hall went out with a bang. The big film photographer completed his illustrious career with this movie before he transferred. He made himself proud because it is one of the best crime movies you will ever see. <br /> <br /> Of course, the play isn't bad if you play Tom Hanks and Paul Newman! The amount of action here is just right: not too much; Not too little. <br /> <br /> Not one of the characters in it is honestly "good guys," since Hanks is a professional hit for city boss Newman. Hanks' only redeeming quality doesn't want his young boy to be a killer like him, even though he teaches him how to be a breaker! Huh? <br /> <br /> Just as the acting is as interesting as the story is, the real star of this movie is cinematographer Hall, who paints the scene into the beautiful scene with his lens. His work is just fantastic.
