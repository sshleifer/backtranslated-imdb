I read the other reviews, and I found that there is a comparison of the real-life movie (eg, what is needed to get to the music school), Britney Bashing, and so on. So, let's focus on the movie and the message. <Br /> <br /> I evaluated this movie 7 out of 10 for the age group 8 to 14 years, and for a family movie. For the average adult man .... 2 out of 10. <br /> <br /> I like pop / rock music, I'm 45. I know about Britney Spears but never realized she was singing stronger before I have the credits and these reviews. I didn't recognize her poster on the wall, so I wasn't worried about any "self-promotion". <br /> <br /> I'm watching movies to be entertained. I don't care to casting, lighting, producers, directors, etc. What is the movie and it entertaines me. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie for the message. The world's largest epidemic is a low self-esteem (which is quite a different story), so watched with the message in mind as it is an area of ​​interest. The movie is light, bright and bitter, ideal for children. I found that the Texan twang started fading throughout the film and of course there are just as many ways to give up / not give up message, so yes, it was a bit predictable. Great message, though ... more of them should be. <br /> <br /> This movie is a good family movie, but for a look that looks in itself, Hannibal gets it.
