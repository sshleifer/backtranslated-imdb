it was the most expensive film, when it was manufactured. Sir Alexander Korda and H.G. Wells was both saddened by his poor ratings --- for good reason. It was and remains far ahead of his time. Apart from the seemingly poor direction, probably reasonably, the work works to a beautiful conclusion. <br /> <br /> Whether she is Sir Ralph Richardson's 'Boss' role, or even better, his wife's, Mr Cedric's, as opponent of space replacement, Raymond Massey's 'John Cabal' center role --- delivering everything Stunning performances. <br /> <br /> The scene with Mr. Korda's incomparable set, of the little girl-child, runs out to an absolutely 'never-compensated' scene, saying, "Life just gets nicer and loving"? It quickly brings tears to any parent / grandparent. It is not a movie for the young, unless 'experienced' and rather those who have seen the 'horror'. It's probably the 'parachute' The use of a 'magnetic cannon', now called 'mass engine', can be considered ridiculous, against rockets --- Sir Korda a break. Wells made that choice. and at +/- $ 8 million, this film went much further than 'over-budgeting' so he concentrated on what he could manage. <br /> <br /> The true power of this greatest film rests in 'John Cabal's Final Declaration of Human Destiny --- his friend' Passionate 'doubts the wisdom of spacecraft and says,' We are such small animals. "John Cabal's proper response is (paraphrased)" Yes, small animals, and if that's all we are, we must live and die. " they are under a large astronomical telescope. he wiped his hand over the night sky. "Yet we can have the whole universe, or nothing." - then the last chorus breaks in --- "What will it be?" --- It's not 'Star Wars', 'Blade Runner' --- anything you might consider to be 'Big' --- that's the right thing. <br /> <br /> I remember Steven Hawking's most recent address, on his latest "Medal of Honor" --- "Man must leave the earth. , or die. "- The essence of this work --- I love" standard entertainment "--- but this" relic ", for the wise viewer, offers much more. "What will it be?" be in the right mood - whatever it is needed - it will take your breath away --- I guarontee - overall, for humanity? the most important of the theater. <br /> <br /> Since the post, I have pointed out that many comments have been made on the poor 'media quality' of 'surviving' examples. In the 80's I developed a 'proprietary' colorization process that needed a 'clean' original. it led me to Michael Korda, who unfortunately noticed that everyone was gone --- so we have to remember what remains --- "sad but where?"
