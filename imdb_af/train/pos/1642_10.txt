Didn't see the movie for the first time, but it was memorable. Performances by Rip Torn and Conchata Farrell were wonderful, photography excellent, moved story line and everything about it was of the highest standard. Yet it seems almost forgotten. Maybe because the UK is a strange market, but I didn't see the movie on TV or video. It's sad. Has it had more success in the US, where it can be seen as a fairly accurate historical drama? <br /> <br /> Always the 50% of a good movie is the music and although I'm not sure, I think the title theme was a simple but moving clarinet solo of "What a Friend Us In Jesus has. " The movie then rejected it! Am I right or wrong?
