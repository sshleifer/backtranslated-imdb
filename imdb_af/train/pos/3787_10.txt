I saw it as a critic at the 49th International Film Festival Mannheim Heidelberg. <br /> <br /> Like every movie I know and Zelenka involved, it's just genius. <br /> <br /> I love his way of combining different stories and characters. <br /> <br /> His * Knoflikari * and the real magic * Powers * (part of Regina Zieglers * Erotic Tales IV *) is definitely worth checking out. Get it, people!
