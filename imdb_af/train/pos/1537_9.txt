The film takes place in a small Swedish town where everyone knows each other. Here, Mia visits her parent for her father's birthday, which sometimes has a kind of tragedy. The question is just what this year will be, and you'll be surprised. It's a very well-composed movie with a story that has a perfect balance of humor and seriousness, which is rarely seen. You get lucky, you're hurt, and basically everything in between. Finally, you can't help falling in love with Mia (if you're a boy I think (the main actress)). She is a very well-chosen actress, like many other actors / actresses. <br /> <br /> Enjoy
