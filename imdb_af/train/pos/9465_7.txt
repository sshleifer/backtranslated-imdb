Steve Carell dies again in a light romantic movie about choices, family and pressure. Judging by the plot and covering the art of the movie, I expected an exuberant comedy, lots of laughter and unrealistic elements, but I think I was wrong. Sure, the movie had comedy, but it made me feel a lot more of a light drama and Steve Carell again delivered a good performance. The film itself really captures real observations and it was a strong element I found. But the end was a bit rushed and predictable. Throughout, cinematography was great, the acting was great and the message it delivered was obvious but still very important. Although it came down to the old, flat and predictable end. I would say if different choices were made at the end of the movie (maybe for the bad, even), this movie would get better publicity. Another fun movie.
