Apart from the big movie METROPOLIS, it's about the oldest pure sci-fi movie. While the film is sometimes a bit preachy and the acting is a bit broad, it is a good movie for two reasons. First, it is extremely original in both style and content. Even in the 21st century, there are no movies that I can think there is something like that. Second, the special effects were absolutely incredible. Use rugged paintings, models and great roles to create fantastic scenes from a post-apocalyptic world and a great city tomorrow. Sure, you can sit back and beat the movie, because according to today's standards the effects are just the same. But you have to appreciate that it was the latest in the movie's release in 1936 and it should really be astonished by audiences. In many ways, the sets seem very reminiscent of the "modern cities" that appeared in the World Trade Fair in 1939. <br /> <br /> I think the movie is also interesting because it is torn by the question "are people really so stupid Or are we destined for greatness?" The end result seems to be a bit of both! How true! <br /> <br /> A final note: I watched it twice on TV and just a short while on video. The sound and pressure quality has been stinking three times - especially the sound. If available on a DVD, it will hopefully be a lot cleaner and will provide optional captions. As the sound on the video continues to cut, I would really appreciate it!
