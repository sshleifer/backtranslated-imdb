The cartoon between William Powell and Jean Arthur is the highlight of this murder mystery, which has one of the most bizarre and unlikely images ever. Powell is probably the most beautiful detective of the 30's, and Arthur has a unique voice that often sounds like a sequence of tiny bells. They are very nice to watch, so take the clash of the plot with a salt grain and just enjoy unfolding it. Eric Blore also has some comic innings as Powell's butler. <br /> <br /> Powell's contract with MGM included a clause that allowed him to be lent to another studio, but he wanted to work with Arthur again and he has the script, so he has the command barely accepted. They collaborated in two 1929 Paramount films, The Canary Murder Case and The Greene Murder Case, both in the Philo Vance series.
