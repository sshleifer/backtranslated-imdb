This is one of the best favorite movies. Parker Posey's character is entertaining overnight, and the library motif will not be lost to anyone who has ever worked in the books and stacks of the world. <br /> <br /> If you are a library student, RENT IT. Then buy the poster and hang it on your wall. The soundtrack is also highly recommended. I showed this movie to more library friends than anyone else - they all fall in love with it.
