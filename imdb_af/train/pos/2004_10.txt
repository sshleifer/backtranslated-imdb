I admit I'm a vampire addict: I've seen so many vampire movies I've lost and this one is definitely in the top ten. I was very impressed with the original John Carpenter's Vampires and when I discovered, there was a sequel that I went straight out and bought. This movie doesn't follow the same rules as the first one, and it's not quite as dark, but it's close enough and I felt it was beautiful on the original building. <br /> <br /> Jon Bon Jovi was very good like Derek Bliss: his performance was enjoyable and yet difficult for the viewer to believe he could actually survive in the world he lives in. One of my favorite parts was just after meeting Zoey and walking in the bathroom of the dinner to see if she's more than she looks. His remarks are beautifully relentless and yet highly practical, which closely resembles the rest of the scene as it unfolds. <br /> <br /> The other role-players were also well-chosen and they have a good knitwear to produce an entertaining and original film. It's not just a rehash of the first movie, and it has grown the same way Fright Night II grew from Fright Night. There are various elements that make it a new movie with a similar theme. <br /> <br /> If you like vampire movies, I would recommend this one. If you prefer your movies to be less bloody, then choose something else.
