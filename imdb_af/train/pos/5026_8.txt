It's a good movie that everyone should see. It plays like a Dean Koontz book. <br /> <br /> Bill Paxton's performance was wonderful because it really looks like he believes in what he says and does. <br /> <br /> I don't know why viewers should read in a kind of advocacy for religious murder in the movie. This is fiction. The end is amazing, but fiction. Approximately? I think that's what makes this movie so good. SPOILER DOES NOT READ MORE IF YOU HAVE SEEN THE FILE. During the film, the viewer is constantly shocked by Paxton's character, the impact on the children, and the way children treat this outrageous behavior. And then, in the end, it seems to be true. God set himself on a mission to rid the world of demons. Paxton is not clairvoyant as other viewers suggest. Certainly, he is given that he could not tell otherwise, but the film continues to show how God protects Adam through the convenient video quality problem and the complete lack of memory of the second FBI agent. The film does not advocate Christian murder, it simply exposes the viewer to a very unexpected ride.
