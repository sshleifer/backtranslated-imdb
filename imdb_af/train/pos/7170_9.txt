HOLES is not your average Disney stuff - it is a lot, much fun, even for adults who usually design the flashing, focus group "family entertainment" that leaves Uncle Walt's studio as live action. Perhaps the secret of this movie's success is its fidelity to the original book, which is a bit darker than your average childhood play. The action begins when Stanley Yelnats is sent to a boys' prison camp, forcing all prisoners to form holes under the desert sun as a form of rehabilitation. But as the story progresses, Stanley's story is intertwined with that of a legendary treasure, and this adventure is ten times more fun than any Disney movie about an all-boys prison camp, has any right to be. Jon Voight is especially dirty and colorful, and Sigourney Weaver is beautiful, as always.
