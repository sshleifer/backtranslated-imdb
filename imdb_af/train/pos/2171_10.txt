A true classic, ten out of ten! Every actor is perfect, the screenplay is a haunting sequence of exciting scenes. Scenes in the car and scenes in the mountains are breathtaking. Wonder if this movie is already in DVD, because it should be seen in the Widescreen version. I saw it in the late fifties, maybe three or four, and have never forgotten it. I remember it was one of the first Warner tunes such as Wimerscope, which gave a lot of neat cinematography. Shelley Winters and Jack Palance deserve an Oscar for their performances. The only thing I can criticize is not by anyone like Nicholas Ray, to increase his rhythm and tension.
