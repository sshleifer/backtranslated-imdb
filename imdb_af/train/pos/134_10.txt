Someone releases this movie on DVD so that it can take its sacred place as one of the best films of ten to twenty years, when critics and film historians look back at the so-called films of the 1990s and see how vapid they were the greatest, and how Lars Von Trier tried to revolutionize the international film world with this masterpiece. As it stands, "Zentropa" (or "Europe" as it is referred to outside the US) is one of the most fascinating and artistic views of the darkness and almost psychotic uncertainty that erupted from World War II in Europe, namely the decimated German landscape, whose physical horrors correspond only to the harm to the psyche of his people. Von Trier refines his vision on the screen. You will feel that from the late 1940s you watched a lost espionage noir classic with the perfectly illuminated black and white screens while at the same time feeling you are on the edge of something out of the forefront, especially in scenes such as the murder on board the train. Literally, if you see this movie, you see the evolution of an art form. <br /> <br /> For some reason Von Trier soon got caught up in his own Dogma movement. And while she's "Breaking the Waves" and "Dancer in the Dark" classics in her own right, it's with "Zentropa" that he has really raised the art of filmmaking at new and exciting heights. 10/10, ages like good wine, and begging for a DVD release.
