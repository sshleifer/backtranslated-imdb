It was surprisingly intelligent for a TV movie, and true to my own experience of bulimia. It was actually well researched, and I can only assume that it was written by someone who has a similar experience, as it had all the small details. The characters were fairly well drawn, and the performances of Mare Winningham and Alison Lohman were wonderful. I think what I like most was that they made them specific and clever, and there was no reason for Beth's bulimia (it wasn't a diet that was out of control, caused by the pressure on media girls, pressure we are not going to address ... "). Her mother was not completely clueless - too often on television they will have a problem that everyone is aware of and trying to tell us that their protagonists are the last remaining people on earth is what not doing (Diabetes? What is it? Oh, my world is all that, doctor, explain it all to me as if I was a small child, etc.). It was brilliant that her mother was psychological and even she didn't see the signs. And the scenes where Beth got up were not overly melodramatic and sensational, and focused more on the need for secrecy of bulimics and their out-of-controlness. The scene where Beth told her mother she was bulimic would have made me cry if there were no other people in the room. Okay, so I kept those pieces. What didn't work so well for me was the end, which ran back to the TV movie area we know and didn't really love, but I think they had to upload it. "You can also cure your child's eating disorder, if you have a lot of money and live in America ..." <br /> <br /> And can I just say I really like Mare Winningham. She is wonderful.
