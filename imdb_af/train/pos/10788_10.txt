Big rock candy mountain is wonderful. I watched it when I was little, and still to this day. (Senior in high school). If I could imagine heaven, that's what it looks like. I wish I could live in a big rock tuck mountain where candy grows on trees. Zach Hyman is a pros and my best friend. small bunny foo foo is the man. It is so vague and colorful that I dream about it at night. In fact, my 18-year-old friend recently watched it and loved it absolutely. I recommend people of all ages to watch this movie. This weekend I had a big party with all my friends watching this amazing movie. We're going to order pizza and watch the teddy bear giggle. I always wake up and see if I was the little girl I had to visit. thank you. bye.
