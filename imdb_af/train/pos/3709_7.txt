Any screen customization of a John Grisham story deserves a mainstream Hollywood approach, and Robert Altman is about the last director I'm going for a mainstream recording. But this acid-fried pot kettle is pretty good. Although it's not under Altman's best, it's definitely not among the films he made that left you up and wondering what he was thinking. <br /> <br /> Altman typed his hat against the mystery griller with noir overtones before, in his 1973 film "The Long Goodbye." "The Gingerbread Man" is nowhere as good as this movie, but it keeps pretty good on its own. Kenneth Branagh is an avid attorney who finds himself murdered after becoming involved with a client (Embeth Davidtz) who used his help to protect her from her cuckoo father (Robert Duvall). The film is in Savannah, Georgia, while tackling a tropical storm, giving the film an oppressive atmosphere that I really wanted. The turn and turn to the end of the movie becomes clinker and clunkier, and Altman does not prove himself to be anyone skilled in blasting, but the film is generally not a bad addition to Altman's cannon. <br /> <br /> Also starring Robert Downey, Jr., Daryl Hannah, Tom Berenger and Famke Janssen. <br /> <br /> Degree: B
