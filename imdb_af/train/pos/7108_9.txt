You like to solve puzzles? You like complex narratives? It's for you. Brilliant, clever film by Francis Leclerc (son of a legendary French Canadian signer Felix Leclerc). Flashing photo and clever editing is the word of Leclerc, strongly supported by Roy Dupuis, who starred in dythirambic. <br /> <br /> The plot is about Alexandre Tourneur, a veterinarian in his 40s who has just woken up from a coma. Tourneur struggles to remember who hit him because he ended a deer's suffering on the road. By struggling, he has strange behavior and something seems to have taken over. <br /> <br /> Not ghostly, but very mysterious and well-played movie. I have my hypothesis in the end (I think the Indian caused the accident), but this end was open to any explanation. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend 9.5 / 10
