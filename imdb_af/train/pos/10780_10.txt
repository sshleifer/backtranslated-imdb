Passed my second favorite cartoon, Spielberg, after Animaniacs. Even though the ratings were low, so what I still enjoyed and loved was so funny and I worshiped the cast, wow Jess Harnell and Tress Macneille were there and were just fantastic, the whole role was brilliant, especially the legendary Frank Welker. <br /> <br /> I'd like to see this cartoon again, was so fantastic and the jokes were brilliant. Also, I can remember the hilarious moment the brain came in, you heard his voice and it played the PATB theme instrumental, it was just fantastic, I love it in those cartoons when it comes in. I wish this cartoon and Animaniacs came back, I loved them
