As Alan Rudolph's 'Breakfast of Champions' in the theaters slips with little fanfare and lots of spotting makes it back to 1996 when Keith Gordon's Mother Night came out. Now that Kurt Vonnegut speaks as "onfilmable", it is surprising that he received two wonderful film treatments. The other is "Slaughterhouse Five". "Mother Night" is definitely one of the most undervalued films of the decade and I can't understand why. This is brilliant! It is almost entirely true to Vonnegut's book (without being stilted or too literal) and adds a poem to pure film. How many movie adjustments to any author's work can it claim? Vonnegut even brings a como appearance to the end of the movie, and can you ask for a better endorsement than that? Not only is it a beautiful movie, it is a beautifully written, written and directed film, and it is one of my picks for the top five or so American films of the 1990s. It is a sad, inspired, surreal masterpiece that is not deserved to be neglected. I encourage anyone to see "Mother Night" - it doesn't even get to know Vonnegut's work to fully appreciate it (such as "Slaughterhouse Five" sometimes). It's a powerful, influential piece of cinema.
