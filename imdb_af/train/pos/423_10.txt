I just read the plot summary and that's the worst I've ever read. It doesn't matter to this amazing movie. For an example of a good summary, read the list at "Turner Classic Movies". Anyway, this was one of my favorite movies as a young child. My sister and I couldn't wait until every April when we could see it on T.V. This is one of the best horse movies of his time. This is one of the great classics that the whole family can watch. The romance is clean and engaging. The story line is interesting and the songs are wonderful. They no longer make movies like this. Good acting and not over. Pat Boone and Shirley Jones are at their best, along with many other great character players.
