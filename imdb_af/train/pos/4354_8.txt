I returned this movie to the 2005 Palm Springs International Festival and out of the 14 movies I saw I would arrange this # 4. The 900+ theater was full and at the end it got a standing ovation. It was classic Peter Falk if you were a Falk fan and showed a lot of chemistry between the Peter Falk and Paul Reiser characters. The title of the movie seems to me long and strange. I'm surprised it's not made in general release. It was much better than most of the rubbish that the big studios throw at you. Perhaps it is too adult aimed at the baby boomer and senior audience. Many people can relate to situations in this movie. It will probably enjoy a revival of many years when people look back at this movie and consider it a kind of gem. I would rate this 8.0 to 8.5 on a scale of 10 and definitely recommend it.
