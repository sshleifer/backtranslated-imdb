I couldn't look my eyes off this movie when it appeared on the cable. The dialogue and costumes are of a quality that is more easily associated with softcore pornography. In this case, the appropriate plot as a vehicle does not serve for sex, but for serial thrashings with nunchuks. (Maybe also for sex, but not on Indian TV.) <br /> <br /> Not a fan of the genre. I couldn't place Jeff Wincott and have no clues to look for. Only once did Brigitte Nielsen trade in her futuristic nurse coffin (so mayoralism) for the high fade we remember from Beverly Hills Cop II. I made the positive ID on her. <br /> <br /> This movie will not entertain any admirer of the early 90's couture or snip-and-peel slap Ã  la Paul Verhoeven. Can we add a genre tag for "so-bad-it-good"?
