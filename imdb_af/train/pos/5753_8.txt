*** 1/2 Out ***** While I am not worried about being an English version that some reviewers have mentioned, it should be noted, as it appears in many Quebecois native hearts. However, it was a movie as a child where I was a fiery fan; Keep in mind that it is now made for children, I judge it relatively. The story is about children about the winter break that creates a huge snow fort, and moves back for control with weapons such as snowballs and other collisions, as empty hands and free time equal winter break lessons. If I had kids, this is definitely a movie I will try to interest them, because the snow fort has woken me up when I was young, and I think even children will agree today, even with Pixar and all the computer animation , maybe I'm outdated and don't realize it. In addition, the message of the movie is wonderful and also positive for children (and adults).
