B movie? Yes. DIY? Yes. First movie? Yes. But Aestheically A +. This movie definitely had bad sound / editing / lighting / acting / etc. etc. problems. However, this movie has many positive things about it. First, the most annoying character dies first! Secondly, it's a parody / funny B joke. The comments our murderer made to his victims made me and my friends roll on the floor. <br /> <br /> The problem is that many people are trying to take every independent film and expect it to be a masterpiece. Take it for what it is, a lot of kids right out of high school made their first movie. For what it is, just that, it's really good.
