As a former 2-year-old Okinawan Karate world champion, I like movies about sports sacrifices. But this movie is about so much more. This movie is so good and so deep. I was recently plagued by very serious injury and almost a disastrous lack of passion. Almost out for me. And this foolish little movie touched me so deeply that it lost sight of me, reminding me of what life would mean. It's a movie about life. Live your life for yourself and respect for others. Empowerment. God, bless "Bend it like Beckham" I believe it's a real gem.
