The secret of KELLS is perhaps the most beautiful film I've seen since the Trips or Belleville. Although stylistically very different, KELLS shares with TRIPLETS and (the jaw-fold opening 2D series of) KUNG FU PANDA, incredible art direction, production design, background / layout and a colorfulness that is a feast for the senses. KELLS is so cute - almost Gothic in its layout (slightly reminiscent of Klimt), wonderfully flat in general overall perspective, decorated in its Celtic and enlightened design, but the characters are so simplistic and attractive - and it all works beautifully. You fall in love with the characters from the moment you meet them. You are so drawn to every detail of the story and to every stroke of the pencil and brush. What Tomm, Nora, Ross, Paul and everyone at Cartoon Saloon (and their extended teams) achieved with this small budget / VERY small crew movie is absolutely amazing. The grounds for support among our animation community are phenomenal. This movie is breathtaking and the buzz among our colleagues recommending this movie spread like wildfire. Congratulations to KELLS on his many awards, his Annie nomination as well as his current Oscar qualifying race. They are all very well-deserved nods, indeed ...
