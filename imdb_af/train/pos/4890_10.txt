Superb cast, more please. <br /> <br /> If you're just about anything else written by Plater (or the lead roles of these great actors). For anyone who doesn't know Plater, it's a real jazz feeling. I plan to see the Beiderbecke trilogy when you can. <br /> <br /> "There are three kinds of jazz - Hot, Cool and What time does the song start?"
