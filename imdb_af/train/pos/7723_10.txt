A number of factors make it easy for me to state that I still think it's the most important science fiction film ever made, despite some of the acting, outdated dialogue, etc. <br /> <br /> First, there is the scale of imagination in the description of the Krell, a humanoid race native to the planet, now all dead, which was 1 million years more advanced than Earth humans ( us), and their technology, especially the 8 000 cubic mile machine. <br /> <br /> Second, there are the music and sound effects, which are inseparable from one another. <br /> <br /> Third, his "monster" is not only the most powerful and deadly ever intended, but it is also based on real science. and do not break the laws of physics and biology. <br /> <br /> Finally, and above all, Forbidden Planet is the only film ever made that makes efforts and unbelievably successful honest, intelligent, and merciless logic on the boundaries or ceilings of human development (or any other biological entity), no matter how long we survived as a species. <br /> <br /> In other words, it predicts our inevitable destination.
