People forget that there are several King Kong ripoffs Congo, King Kong Vs. Godzilla, King Kong (1976), all ripoff each other, but YETI stands alone. It only borrows one element from King Kong and it is the animal's attraction with one woman. <br /> <br /> The YETI myth is based on Bigfoot (not like King Kong) and archaeologists are fascinated, at once, but there is no scientific evidence to prove it. <br /> <br /> This movie is hard to find, but it's worth watching. The first time I watched it was in the early 1980s on "Elvira's Mistress of the Dark Shows". It pushed cold fever as a kid for my spine, especially when the YETI got mad. I saw it again, about 1:00 at ABC about 2 to 3 years ago. When I saw it again, I appreciated it more, it has overall good effects (for its time) and the story involves a dumb boy and his dog and an evil businessman who wants to kill the YETI for his own purpose. Also the music is pretty cool, it doesn't look like that. :-) <br /> <br /> Gianfranco Parolini and the Yetians create a great monster like atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Vote 7 and half out of 10.
