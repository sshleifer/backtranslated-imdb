The film was okay, quite entertaining. The role play was pretty good, and I will find out what the commentary has mentioned before me. Glenn Quinn was excellent and he alone is reason enough to watch this movie. He played brilliantly the egoistic "evil" friend and manager of the band. <br /> <br /> There are many songs performed by "Beyond Gravity" in this movie, but it doesn't really come as a surprise. The film is a VH1 production. However, if the soft rock / pop music is not for someone's will, one can also flash the scene. <br /> <br /> The plot of a band tries to make it to the top in LA, but must overcome many obstacles on the road not too original but very entertaining, with some surprising plots turning here and there.
