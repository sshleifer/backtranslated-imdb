Over the years I have watched a number of cold case episodes, starting with Season 1 episodes in 2003-2004. And while the most good, this episode was not only the best of the best, but there are few competitors in the Emmy categories. Although some may not agree with the story content (that is, the male-male romantic relationship), I doubt anyone can see it without moving deep into their minds. <br /> <br /> The story is essentially about a reopened case based on the evidence of a dying drug dealer. The two central actors are two police officers in the 1960s, called Sean Coop (aka, the cold case victim at his nickname, Coop) and his partner, Jimmy Bruno. <br /> <br /> The story is a Vietnam war veteran, Coop Ankle, with a deeply troubled past. However, Jimmy is married, with children no less. Both are partners in the police force and not just a friendship, but a secret romantic relationship that they both must hide from a deep and clear homophobic culture that prevailed at the time. <br /> <br /> The backspins of their lives are mostly in black and white, with some color occasionally sprinkled throughout. Examples are their red spankar, the yellow curtains gently blowing at the window in Jimmy's bedroom, where Jimmy's wife Coop and Jimmy watched, fight and kiss each other while in an alcohol-induced condition. I found it interesting that only selected items were colored in the flashback scenes, with everything else in black and white. I still haven't figured out the color scheme and rationale. <br /> <br /> The clear homophobic tension between co-patrol officers and the two central actors only increases the intensity of the episode. One important emotional scene was when Coop confronted his father after the baptism of Jimmy's baby. In this scene, Coop's father, Sarge, who was a respected co-officer, confronted Coop about the rumors surrounding Coop's relationship with Jimmy. One can feel sorry for Coop, right now when Coop's father's shame and shame was hoped for. "You're not going to embarrass our family ... and you're not my son either." - Clear indication of the hostile views of the same gender relations of that era. <br /> <br /> Additional tensions can also be seen in the police vault room where Coop and another officer go after Coop and Jimmy are labeled "Batman and Robin Homos". <br /> <br /> Regarding the relationship between Coop and Jimmy, it is clear that Coop wanted more of Jimmy in his life. Once the tension in Jimmy's face can be seen, he must choose between his commitment to his wife and children, his church, and yet his ominous dedication to Coop. In the end Jimmy runs away from Coop, realizing he can't have both Coop and his family at the same time. Unfortunately, Coop is murdered, perhaps because of his relationship with Jimmy, but Coop can also be murdered for his knowledge of drug money and police corruption that has come higher in power. <br /> <br /> The most moving scene In the whole episode, Coop lost his gunshot wounds to the gun. He quietly talked his last words about his police radio: "Jimmy ... we were the lucky ones. Don't forget." <br /> <br /> The soundtrack selection was outstanding in the episode. I enjoyed the final scene with actor Chad Everett, who plays the increasingly sad Jimmy, much older, and still misses his former partner, Coop. <br /> <br /> I recommend this episode and consider it the best. This is without a doubt the most well-written, well-intentioned, and well done of all the Cold Case episodes I've ever seen.
