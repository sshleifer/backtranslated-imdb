The film is very complete in what it is, keeping one constantly interested in flashbacks into childhood and growing with such a bizarre father, and interspersing it with the tails of the murder, one simply cannot go wrong. The plot itself, the whole story and essence of the movie, is entertaining. This is the kind of story that director (Bill Paxton) can do so much, and in this case he did a lot. From beginning to end you are increasingly expected to do more. and more about what's happening and where the movie goes, and the creativity behind this story is first class. I felt as if this movie had been chosen from start to finish, and one of those rare jewels that seemed to be boring without lulls - the action flowed neatly, quickly and stiffly from one scene to the next. <br /> <br /> It just shows how far people can go: doing such horrible things to their loved ones and doing such acts of evil, in the name of God when they are disillusioned as in this case. It is also sometimes interesting in its "twists and takes the concept of morality as a whole. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is the kind of movie that one easily watches, but I recommend you not to and to watch this movie - it is very much appreciated your time.
