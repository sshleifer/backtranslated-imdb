I really like 101 Dalmations when it came out in 1996. Now 5 years later I saw 102 Dalmas in 2001. I thought it was fantastic, but I think 101 is better because I think it's more funny, more humorous and also that movie. was based on the same story as the cartoon version (one hundred and one dalmations (1961), I wonder if there are plans for 103 Dalmations. I hope there might be yes, maybe no, we all will have to find dalmation fans if in there The future will be 103 Dalmatians.
