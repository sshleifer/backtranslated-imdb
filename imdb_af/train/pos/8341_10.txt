Bottom line - Best romantic comedy ever. This movie brings after all great movies strive: the creation of a world and time that we want to visit again and make us happy to be part of humanity. If I am blue, this movie increases my spirit and lets me laugh (and it is still true to many - always fresh). <br /> <br /> All the actors are in the best shape. The characters are so dead and the characters are so good that you forget the actor (usually hard to do with Matthau, Robbins and Ryan). The support casting is consistently brilliant: Fry ("Agae", "a total pack"!), Jacoby & Saks & Maher (the three theoretical physicists as "Greek choir" - "but time does not exist"), Durning " something we can start from NJ "), Shalhoub & Whaley (Robbins boss and co-worker at the service station) and Curits (Eisenhower - how many comedies does Eisenhower ??). Don? Don't miss this judged treasure.
