A higher fan of Bette Midler, I must say her recorded live concerts are my favorites. Bette boasts us with her jokes and brings us tears with her ballads. A literal rainbow of emotion and talent, Bette shows us her best from her solid repertoire, as well as new songs from the album "Bette of Roses". Tens of generations of people she offers something for everyone. The only Divine Diva proves here that she is the most intensely talented artist.
