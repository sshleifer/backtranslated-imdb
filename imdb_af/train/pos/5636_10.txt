In "Brave New Girl", Holly comes from a small Texas town, sings 'The Yellow Rose of Texas' at a local competition and is listed at a prestigious art college in Philadelphia. From there, the film grows in a colorful story of friendship and loyalty. I loved this movie. It was full of the great singing and acting and characters that kept it on a very good fit. Of course, the acting was wonderful. Virginia Madsen and Lindsey Haun were excellent as well as Nick Roth. The camera work was really well done and I was very happy with the end. It seems like a successor in the making. Kudos to the director and everyone else who participated in this production. Totally a gem in the movie archives.
