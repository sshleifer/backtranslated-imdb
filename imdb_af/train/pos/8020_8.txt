I found it to be the most beautiful Muppets movie, because I felt it was the brightest and had the best cartoon on most of its lines. The Muppets are trying to go on Broadway to sell an original music they've written, but on the go they're in the common trouble, including Kermit's memory loss. While there aren't many big cameos here like in the original "Muppets Movie", there are a few including Joan Rivers and Dabney Coleman. The timing and delivery of so many lines is simple, and the situations in which the Muppets find themselves are hilarious. The original songs are also good here, and the end is satisfactory. There is not much more to say about the movie, but Muppet fans should surely see it. This is the funniest Muppet movie and will surely be enjoyed by everyone. <br /> <br /> *** 1/2 from ****
