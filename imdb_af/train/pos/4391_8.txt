You wait to see if the remake is better or worse. I classified the Audie Murphy movie as a 3, the second lowest I've ever donated to Audie (the worst is "Battle at Bloody Beach" if you're curious). I give this movie a score of "8" (and I'm a loud grader). This is the Civil War story of apostate "soldiers", if you want to call it, to the north. People like Quantrell, and the men who drove with these unbelievers. <br /> <br /> The original was a watery version, very clean cut, while still portraying the horror of what these men did. Actually, movies like the older version are best seen by adult audiences, which can distinguish the story. I would be more inclined to evaluate the original "R" and this one, with an abominable nature, a general practitioner, because the newer movie gives a very honest version, a message that is easier for a youthful than the older version decrypted. <Br /> <br /> Filmmakers have been talking about "Realism" since the early sixties, but few of them deliver. Instead, they just give up the deadly landscapes, wear costumes, and kill events, but with stereotypical characters from comic books, the weakness of the spaghetti era. <br /> <br /> Modern filmmakers realized this error. This is evident in a superior Western style that we usually see today. This movie is an example. It gives the realistic settings, but also gives us characters we can believe in that era. <br /> <br /> It has a few lulls, which make a complete sit door a bit difficult, and it has some inexplicable situations. But inexplicable situations are okay as long as the whole movie holds, and the characters are intriguing enough. <br /> <br /> It starts out a little champion but really improves. The main character is one that we can identify and at least have some sympathy. The Audie Murphy character of the early film really does not sympathize, and is too self-righteous without motivation. <br /> <br /> The character in this movie follows the lines of a true anti-hero. There is motivation, and a method for his madness. We never feel he is really right, but we can understand where he came from. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of action in the movie. There is also humor. One good scene is when the heroine tells the hero she won't lie to him and he kills it. <br /> <br /> This movie succeeds in doing what filmmakers have been trying to do for decades. This director and writers team is right. <br /> <br /> Recommended. Complete success.
