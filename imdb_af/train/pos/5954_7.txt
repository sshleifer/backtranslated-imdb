I feel a mix of confusion and different degrees of personal taste in the reactions to this movie. Yes, there are vampire stereotypes. Yes, there are scientific stereotypes here. Even martial arts stereotypes. All good and good, and certainly, not all done perfectly. However, I feel one important point about this movie is overlooked ... the cultural significance of its location. The film is in Pensacola, Florida, and doesn't try to say that. It is a brave movement in the film world today and a rare surprise to fans of indie movies. And indeed, this should not be the last. Pensacola is known worldwide as a naval village, an aviation village, a wooden shed, and sometimes even a fraud for political controversy. It is rarely seen as a growing movie town. But it is already changing. More movie companies are coming in to shoot. And more native Pensacolians discover the power of the theater for themselves. This film is part of a growing trend of Pensacola-based Indy movies, and more is underway. Pensacola is making a big noise in the global film community, and through and through the world takes more knowledge. Look and listen, world. The Pensacolians come. Like a virus.
