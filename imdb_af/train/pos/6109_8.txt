My Tutor Friend is a well-written romance comedy film that has something similar to My Sassy Girl. There are no kisses / sex scenes. Hollywood needs to learn more about Korean productions. Sex is not always needed in a good romantic movie. <br /> <br /> The movie is light hearted with occasional cartoon CG scenes mixed into the movie. I like the part when Ji-Hoon kissed almost Su-Wan. The funniest moment is when Ji-Hoon Su-Wan's first love pushed because he plunged Su-Wan to another girl and he will soon be a father. How he became a father, was revealed in the next scene, bringing smile to the audience. <br /> <br /> Mao points: 8/10
