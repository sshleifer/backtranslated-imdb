This is undoubtedly the scariest game I've ever played. It's not the average shoot-all-move type fps (which I don't usually care much about) but the acceptable gfx, interesting weapons and magic, great surround effects ("Scryeeee, scryeeee ..") and above all incredible atmosphere. I love the Scrye, which allows you to see or hear events in the past in certain places in the games. The only game that I had to interrupt regularly after a few minutes of play was just because of the intensity of the atmosphere. I am a great horror lover, especially of Clive Barker's stories and movies, and participate in a horror story like this, and I long for more games that emphasize atmosphere and a more relational story. 9/10 (-1 because I'm not a fps fan, and maybe the game is a little short?)
