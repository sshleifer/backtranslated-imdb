What I love about this show is that it follows the life of modern witches and it's an explosion to experience their daily love, humor and adventure. The magic of magic is so diverse, depicting the ideas of classical, medieval and modern magicians, such as Harry Potter and Sabrina. With Sabrina the Teenage Hitch, this show is so nice and unique, because it makes us feel a lot of that modern wizard, worth seven seasons! This show has so many good features and it is a joy to see Sabrina live her daily life in the mortal and "other" empire. I would recommend it to any family because the television series is clean, funny and adventurous. Classic!
