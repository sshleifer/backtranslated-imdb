If only Eddie Murphy was born 10 years later. Then we all want to remember it. But even I was just 4 when it came out. If you haven't seen it yet, Dr Dolittle, Showtime, I hire spy, Pluto Nash and all Eddie's family comedy films - look here. Hands off, you will laugh 90% of the time. The other 10% you will wipe the tears from your eyes. <br /> <br /> It should really be watched more than once to understand all the jokes. From raw humor to joking for kids! (If you've seen it, you'll laugh here) - you'll love her well. If you can, (or is a big fan) try to download clips from Eddie's acts. Allot of the shows is different from what you can imagine and he has even more funny jokes. <br /> <br /> But it's like Eddie Murphy's "X-rated" if you like. <Br /> <br /> And all I can say, please don't look Delirious if you don't like comedy, don't have a sense of humor or don't like hanging out. You will just lay down this great Eddie Murphy classic and possibly miss someone. <br /> <br /> If you want to know how Eddie Beverly Hills Cop got and became known, Delirious is it.
