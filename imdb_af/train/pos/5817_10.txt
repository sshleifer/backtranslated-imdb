If you want to remember MJ, it's a good place to start. This movie has sweet songs, MJ as a robot, and a crazy, devastated plot. I remember, one night, passing on to this fine feature film in college, thinking of the sheer awesomenes whose green light of this ridiculous piece decided. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of singing. Lots of dancing. There is a lot of singing while dancing. MJ strikes it as you would expect when it comes to these things. But there is much more to this movie. There is clay. There are fat children (clay). There is an anthropomorphic rabbit who must fight Michael Jackson in a dance (of course also clay). There is also Joe Pesci (not made of clay). <br /> <br /> RIP-we love you Michael! It's a sad day for all of us.
