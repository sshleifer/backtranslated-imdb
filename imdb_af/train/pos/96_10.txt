I was reviewing some old VHS tapes that I had and have a Christmas about John Denver & The Muppets. It made me go to my computer and see if I could find a DVD version of this show to buy. I was disappointed not to get it on DVD. The show aired in 1979 and was a beautiful show. I have the record and the CD, but I'd like to buy a DVD version of this show. The tape is old and the picture quality is pretty good, but fading, the sound is not as good as the CD. There are also some other songs that are not on the CD. As a fan of John Denver and of the Muppets, a DVD of this show would really be a good seller. If you don't have the CD, it's a wonderful Chritmas collection of songs taken from the show. The album is also great if you can get it and has another record player to play it.
