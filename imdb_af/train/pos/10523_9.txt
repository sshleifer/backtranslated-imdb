Emma is a true romance. If you love the stuffy stuff, laden with white and folly, you'll love this movie! Its true to the novel, which is very important, with a few twists added for pleasure. Gwen is not one of my favorites, but she does justice to a role that needs everything she had to offer in spades. She shines in a role, I think no other actress could have done proper justice. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Northam, the hero. how shocked are you? I never saw him as nice, but completely! What the right role can mean to you! He looks as good as the sensible, right-wing man. K, that I literally look at him in a new light. He makes and excellent romantic lead. The charm and character he brings to his role is wonderful! <br /> <br /> Ewan McGregor, Greta Sacchi brings in the rest. a good throw. A good movie. If you're a fan of Jane Austen, watch this movie with Pride and Prejudice - AND IMPORTANT, buy the books. This raises the film to exceptional heights
