This movie is not your typical horror movie. It has some humorous and deadly scenes that can be so comical. I personally liked the movie because of its down-humor. This is definitely not a super scary movie, which is good if you don't want to be scared and paranoid afterwards. I like the performance of the mountain billy man and van Lester ... very credible. I think I'm going to color my hair red like this girl in Scarecrow-very cool! Anyway, the total worth of renting for the campus humor and non-typical horror experience.
