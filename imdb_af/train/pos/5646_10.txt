Recently, when I was shopping, I saw the boxing set of American Gothic, and I thought "I remember it!" I set my alarm on fire to get it back and see it when it was 1:30 on CH 4 (I was 14). I mostly remember it because it was very scary and strange, no one could ever be as scary as Lucas Buck (with a B !!) Nobody was ever anyway. <br /> <br /> However, what irritated me was that they did the same thing in the box than when it was on TV. Episodes in a funny sequence, I thought dr. Matt ?? - They made it so confusing. <br /> <br /> However, it is not the authors, producers or directors' fault (his TV people in the background are the moneymakers. They still do the same. Just look at shows like Carnivale and Farscape, they don't like originality. studios. !!!!!) <br /> <br /> To finish - If you haven't seen it and you call yourself a Sci-Fi Fantasy, Horror, supernatural drama. From = YOU MUST. They even said in SFX when they reviewed the box.
