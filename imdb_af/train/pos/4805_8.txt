When I first heard of this movie, I thought it would be like The Duchess (2008), but when I saw The Young Victoria for the first 30 minutes, I knew it would not just be a solid movie . Almost everything in this movie is great, the costumes are really great and the settings are also beautifully shot. <br /> <br /> The only thing that really drops me is the performances. Emily Blunt (the devil wearing Prada) is the star of the movie that brings Victoria to life and with this movie she shows that she is a great actress and may choose a first Oscar nomination for her performance. Rupert Friend is almost like Prince Albert, but he has good chemistry with Emily Blunt. Paul Bettany is also solid as Lord Melbourne, although I expected more from him. Jim Broadbent and Miranda Richardson both have roles, but are forgotten. <br /> <br /> For me, the movie feels like unfinished. Perhaps the screenwriters have changed too much in the script, but I don't know, but that's how I feel about the movie. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a good movie over the early years of Victoria with a good performance. by Emily Blunt.
