An oddly pleasing effort, combining an appropriate far-fetched plot that includes Adam and Burt and flashbacks to the original TV series. Most of the flashback scenes were lifted directly from Burt Ward's book "Boy Wonder: My Life in Tights" and I think his book was the inspiration to make this movie. Like the book, it left the fans of the original series behind. <br /> <br /> If you missed this broadcast, it is definitely worth a loan from a friend who might have recorded it. Now I'm making a copy for my kids.
