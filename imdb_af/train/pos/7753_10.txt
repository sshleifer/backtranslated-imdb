This Belgian film, led by Tom Barman, singer of the well-known group dEUS, will not be favored by everyone. For the simple reason there is no clear story or even a plot. This movie shows just 24 hours in a city (here Antwerp) and allows you to talk, direct, humorous (Dario!, Osteopath Bruno!, ...) and tragic (Windman, Paul Garcin, .. .) characters. <br /> <br /> There are several memorable scenes: the Windman on the beach, the dance party at the end, the KISS fan, Windman visits the osteopath, ... <br /> <br /> Clearly that some other viewers do not understand what is so beautiful and interesting in this movie. They complain that this movie has no story. But this is the atmosphere that keeps you watch. It will pull you into it. <br /> <br /> If you haven't watched it yet, listen carefully. the music. The soundtrack is extraordinary, just like Tom Barman and his band dEUS. <br /> <br /> And "ssst, mouth shut." (don't tell anyone)
