The question is, can a movie this reception really be considered a "bad" movie? My husband and I picked it up on a used video store for 99 cents, simply because the box had the words "Vestron Pictures" on it. Since my first high quality, Vestron has received the legendary films "Suburbia" and "Class of 1984". We didn't expect a movie to be as full of victory as this one was. Your basic plot as follows: Grange, this Goomba villain of planet Earth, robs "the moon bank" and is sentenced to a penal colony on a remote planet (I don't even remember the planet's name) to mine for bauxite. and other minerals. The "governor" of the colony and the owner of the mine use the prisoners for labor. Walker, a bounty hunter (apparently one of only three on the whole planet) reminds the prisoners that there is no escape, because there is only one shuttle from the whole planet and they want to handle him. Then there is the nameless "Colonel", a retired bounty hunter suffering from a haunting nightmare. Many of the movies are centered around "futuristic" car hunters (thin-sided pansies folded on the sides) with huge explosions. The planet itself looks suspicious like Hemet, CA or one of those other dusty inland rich outposts. But what the film really looks like is a surprisingly immense soundtrack with several LA punk bands from the mid-80s. I seriously doubt that this soundtrack was ever printed on vinyl, but it is definitely worth buying the movie just for the soundtrack. I can't even remember the names of the tapes (they are called in the credits), except the exploration of white mice, because that was the only one I heard before I saw this movie, but I definitely look at them. Basically, the movie is definitely not a waste of your time and will be best enjoyed with a 12 pack of beer and some of your closest friends.
