I have to be honest, I expected a failure so badly because it really sounded like they were trying to milk the original movie to get money. But this was not the case with this pretty funny (sometimes strange) movie. I loved how they told the story of Timon and Pumba, the story with Simba and he had trouble sleeping. The jacuzzi bubble, and when Pumba leaves, stops the call. It's harmless fun, good for kids and some adults. I think this movie will take a while because it's pretty good for a straight video and DVD movie. While the movie looks a bit strange and kind of trails, it's right. 8 out of 10
