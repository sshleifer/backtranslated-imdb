I just watched all of Miyazaki's movies, and they're all beautiful and engaging. But this one stands above the rest. This movie impressed me completely! <br /> <br /> I fell in love with Pazu and Sheeta, and their sweet, caring friendship. They were what made the movie for me. Of course, the animation is also fantastic and the music captures the feelings in the movie perfectly. But the characters are the highlight in this movie: they are so well developed and full of personality. <br /> <br /> Now, let me explain: I'm really talking about the Japanese version of the movie (with English subs). While the English dub is good (mostly), it only sticks to the original language version. The voices are better, the dialogue, everything. I suggest watching (and hearing) the movie as it was originally.
