These first two seasons of this comedy series were very strange and they were not very funny and have a drama element where Bill (the mother) struggles with all the common problems in life, but the element was slightly depressed and had not mixed up Well with the comedy elements probably why it dropped. Then it soon became one of the funniest comedy series the BBC has ever made! The chemistry between Bill and Ben's character was very funny and there were always so many brilliant and memorable sketches in each series. The Christmas offers were hilarious and a real surprise for Christmas. <br /> <br /> The show came to an end when chief actor Gary Olsen passed away, Bill, who was very sad because he was a brilliant actor in films like Up 'n' Under and a lot of funny man RIP <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this underestimated performance has disappeared from our television screens and it should not be repeated so often - Although it appears on UKTV Gold at one time or another, but it must the BBC is being shown to show. this brilliant comedy for a new audience
