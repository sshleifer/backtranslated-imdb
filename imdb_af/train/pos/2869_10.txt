First, I want to say, "Thank you, Disney, for finally dropping the" Cinderella "movie on DVD! Now you have all the Disney animated movies on DVD (including the 1999 Limited Edition)! What are you going to do next? go to Disney World !!!!! "Well, technically (I mean, look at the castle !!!!!) Anyway, Disney stays magical in his 1950s animated classic movie" Cinderella ", the movie featuring fairy tales place the card. We are all familiar with the story of Cinderella, her step-sister, her date, the glass knob, the pumpkin in a car, just to say "Bippity-boppity-boo!", And of course, try to go home at midnight. go! <br /> <br /> What I like about this movie: This is a great old fairy tale that kids love, now in a movie (as well as on DVD) !! <br /> <br /> "Cinderella" - thank you, Disney !!!!! 10 stars.
