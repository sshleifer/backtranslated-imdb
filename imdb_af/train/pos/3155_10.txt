I wish a 70s show would come on television. It was the biggest show ever !!! They should make episodes between the other episodes, but that would of course be confusing. But I wish it would come back and make more episodes. Please come back ... The show was absolutely hilarious. You can't laugh without seeing an episode. There is a very funny part in every episode and plus the performance was so much better when Hyde and Jackie went out with each other. These were the best episodes. "It's a 70's show is the best" .... It will be and will always be the best show ever. It was very sad when the show ended. They have to make new episodes.
