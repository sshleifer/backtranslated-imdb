I've seen this movie several times and for my life I can't understand why some people compare it to BABE. This movie is not about the secret life of ALL animals that can talk secretly. Instead, it is about a parrot learning to help its owner, a serious descendant, overcome her speech constraints, to be separated from her early on in time. Then the big journey begins. Paulie the Parrot sits out to find one of her good friends, Marie. <br /> <br /> Along the way he meets several wonderful people and numerous nasty people. He falls in love with a girl's parrot and loses her. He is caught in the life of crime and then caught by a bad scientist who wants to exploit him. <br /> <br /> He tells his story to a sympathetic Janitor in the Lab who agrees to help him escape and find his loved one. Marie. <br /> <br /> Tony Shaloub shines like the friendly Janitor who has an open mind and heart and who decides to help Paulie despite the risks. Jay Mohr plays the voice of the Parrot AND one of the seedy characters he comes to. <br /> <br /> There is a little suggestive language, but this movie is suitable for most kids and even more than the parents join. the fun and look too. It's a witty, clever, epic animal adventure story and ultimately a great love story about a bird and its little girl. He looks for Marie ends with a special surprise for most people who don't know much about Parrots. <br /> <br /> Children who saw the wild green parrot tribes in Los Angeles and Pasadena will benefit from the view of this film and the notion that birds, especially parrots are not disposable pets. All children everywhere will see that pets form in-depth attachments and that the love and loyalty of a dog or parrot is a gift to be valuable. <br /> <br /> So no BABE here, more of an amazing trip with a twist. <br /> <br /> Enjoy and try not to tear during the sad parts.
