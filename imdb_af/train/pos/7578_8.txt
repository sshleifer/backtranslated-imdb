Shintar√¥ Katsu, who has played blind swordsman "Zatoichi" in a total of 27 films, ends the Hanzo trilogy with this excellent movie in which he will get a ghost, Mako Midori (Blind Beast). <br /> <br /> The big stick, often used in the pursuit of justice, has retired forever. <br /> <br /> Katsu was his usual ominous self because he lived out to steal those who were from the treasury to those who couldn't afford to pay. <br /> <br /> The usual great sword play and skill of the great man was present, along with the blood. <br /> <br /> I'm going to miss him.
