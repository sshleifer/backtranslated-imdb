Really the story of a recruitment camp in America, where young men are prepared for the Vietnam War. The human study has always appealed to me for war films, because it translates personal, subjective opinions on the war, against war campaigns where action and technical data are analyzed at the expense of the human factor. <br /> <br /> The movie can put a new twist on an already ancient subject, and manage it from ordinary war movies, especially by focusing on an anti-hero from the standpoint of traditional standards. The film focuses on the tragic character of Bozz, who is carefully avoided by the dehumanizing war machine, and refuses to give control over his fate and fight for something he does not believe. He spends his energy searching for ways to avoid overseas shipping, both for himself and for comrades, and ironically, his own justified reason to finally go to war. Perfect irony. <br /> <br /> The acting is truly exceptional, and the documentary style almost shoots you into the movie. The film will also cater for those who are excited about the action in ordinary war movies or war team enthusiasts. Hopefully some thoughts of a generation are awakened that have escaped the terror of happiness.
