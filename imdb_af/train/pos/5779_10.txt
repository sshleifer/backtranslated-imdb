For starters, I didn't even know about this show since a year or so because of the internet. I've never seen it in my country before on TV, and many people don't usually know about this show. However, this is a pity, as it is easily the most original and clever animation I've had for years. <br /> <br /> I don't care much, but it's one show that really earns everything. 10 points. Although it may look like a typical cartoon at first glance, remember that it is not a children's show. When the full story unfolds, you know it's a real story, with a spiritual message. This spiritual part of the story is based mainly on spirit animals, an ancient Indian faith that has been preserved for many years. This gives the display an original twist that you can't often find in animated shows. <br /> <br /> The overall design is also quite different. Sometimes it seems a little in terms of eager design, and other times it takes a more cartoon approach. I believe David Feiss, who also created and arranged Cow and Chicken, animated a segment in the show. (As he also drew the segment in the cartoon). <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a sensible twist, show what different topics such as reality, suicide, spirituality, life approach, then don't miss it. As soon as you start watching, you'll probably see it in the end. One small fact may be that the show takes up less material from the cartoon, but it's not too annoying. However, the only question remains where is the DVD?
