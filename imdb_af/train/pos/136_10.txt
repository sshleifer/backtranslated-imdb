This movie is a great way to end the series. Peter (the son of Poppet Master III) is all great and is now the Pope Stud. Well, this girl comes to destroy the dolls and teach Toulon's secrets, but instead she listens to the story about the dolls. Most of these movies are footage of Poppestudder II, Poppestudel III, Poppestudel 4, Poppestudel 5, puppet master and Retro puppet master (sorry ... But I think Paramount doesn't allow them to use scenes 1). Personally, I wish Puppet Master Vs. Demonic Toys would eventually be made, but the way this movie ends, they basically say, "This is the final movie in the series ..."
