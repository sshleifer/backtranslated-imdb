The fourth in the "Dirty Harry" series is one of the most despicable, ugliest, unlikely, ominous, disgusting women I've ever seen on film: "Ray Perkins," played by Audrie Neenan. She is the modern, nasty, low-life version of the 1945 detour, Ann Savage. <br /> <br /> My dirty mouth and gutter stance scared me so much that I never watched this movie again before I got it. a profanity filter that locks her up ... and the least of her! Then I can enjoy the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Everywhere "Harry Callahan" (Clint Eastwood) goes, violence immediately follows ..... within minutes! It happens so often, it's almost laughing, but it makes a fast-paced, entertaining movie with a satisfying ending, as all the bad guys are eliminated one by one. <br /> <br /> It's a very sophomorical movie that calls on our basic instincts ..... and committed, sad to say. Most of us would like to see these bullets eventually get it, and who does it better than Dirty Harry?
