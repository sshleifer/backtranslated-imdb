An American in Paris is a showcase of Gene Kelly. Look as Gene sings in any number of situations, acts and dance his way through Paris. Some pure majestic, other pure maize. One can only imagine what Kelly made, because he made this movie just a year before "Singin 'In The Rain". He is definitely one of the all-time greats. It's interesting to look at the parallels between the two movies, especially in Kelly's characters. The only big difference is that in Paris, the other in LA. <br /> <br /> Some said that Leslie Caron's play was less than pure. Maybe Cyd Charisse, originally intended for the role, could have done better, but Caron is very credible in the role and chemistry with Kelly. Oscar Levant's brief role in this movie just gave it what it needed, someone who doesn't look like Gene Kelly. The role of the allman is not an easy task, but Levant did it with as much class as any other advantage. <br /> <br /> The song and dance routines are perfect. Even the oblong ballet at the end of the movie makes it a better movie than that without it. Since there really wasn't much screen time to make such a loving relationship credible, Minnelli used this sequence to make it look like you've spent four hours with them. Ingenious! <br /> <br /> I will be reviewing this movie with Singin, as it closely resembles story and song. Singin 'will hardly get the nod because of Debbie Reynolds' exciting show. <br /> <br /> Full recommendation. <br /> <br /> 8/10 stars.
