My roommate bought this documentary and invited me to see it with her. She is from China and only heard about 9/11 and wanted to know the cold hard truth and she wanted me to tell her more after the documentary. I looked at this documentary terribly, it was like reviving the nightmare and it still tears in my eyes. <br /> <br /> But I am very grateful that I watched this documentary, because on the day of September 11, I'm sure we remember everyone we were and what we did when we heard, we all could just think some questions: "Why?", "How?", "What's going on?", "Oh my God!". Almost all Americans were grateful for the brave firefighters and policemen who dared to save their lives. But I don't think we thought about what they were really going to do. It wasn't really a documentary about 9/11, but the cameraman just filmed a typical day at work and they just overtook a few blocks from the World Trade Centers and everything, outside and inside. <br /> <br /> On September 11, I thought to myself, "It's okay, the policemen and firefighters will get the survivors." To be honest, I thought it was an accident, I was in my junior year of high school and changed gym and got ready to go to my science class. Someone came in the locker room and shouted, "Some buildings just bombed in New York!" We all dressed quickly and ran to our classrooms when we watched the first tower on TV. Not only 15 seconds later on TV, the second plane remains in the other World Trade Center and we knew it was no coincidence. A few minutes later we heard from the Pentagon and there was a plane that went to Chicago but was shot down. So many thoughts ran through our heads and I thought, "What are the firefighters and policemen doing?" But this is the procedure for those I thought, they will know what to do. <br /> <br /> The first tower collapsed, we knew, so many lives are gone now, the second tower has crashed, things will never be the same. The firefighters in this documentary showed courage, confusion and strength, the true raw human emotions. They didn't know what to do, they were just as scarce as the other people in the towers. They heard the bodies fall to the ground while people jump out of the windows. And here I was in a classroom and just crying to see everything that was going on on TV. I was surprised at this movie and just wanted to go to New York and tell them how grateful all the Americans were for their help. I know they feel like they just do their job, but they did more, they were heroic. Every day after September 11 for 3 weeks they stopped knowing that there were no survivors, but they kept hoping and praying. May God bless their child and brave hearts. <br /> <br /> As for my roommate, she cried and conceded that it was her first time crying at these attacks. She saw the truth of the tragic day. She asked, "Why?" I didn't know what to say, it broke my heart that people could be that evil. "It sounds clickable," but it was an ordinary day for everyone, "one of the firefighters said in the documentary document. No one expected this to happen. Not so, the people in the World Trade Centers or the Pentagon or The hijacked planes are only doing their job, or there was only a second time, they were not only murdered, they were slaughtered and the hijackers did it with a song in their hearts. all the people in the Middle East, why do people do it? They celebrated death and loss of: mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, friends, grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, etc. Why? <br /> <br /> So, thank you to the people for making this documentary. You really think of the firefighters, policemen and troops in Iraq and it is hoping that there are good people in this world. you are our heroes. <br /> <br /> 10/10
