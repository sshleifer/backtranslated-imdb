I have no idea how a Texan (director, Douglas McGrath) and American actress Gwyneth Paltrow ever drew it, but to see it again will remind you what all the fuss about me. Paltrow was in the first place! I've been to the woman for a long time and still feel she's duller in her Oscar-winning Shakespeare In Love performance, but she gets all the beats here - she's almost perfect like Emma Woodhouse. She may have won her Oscar for Shakespeare, but she must be remembered. <br /> <br /> Of course she's surrounded by a great supporting role, including Toni Collette, Greta Scacchi, Juliette Stevenson et al ... Jeremy Northam is very attractive as the love interest, even though the writing is a bit in his love statement to Paltrow (in the process, so that all the tension can drain from their relationship); A few years later, Ewan's hair is a little easier to take than in 96 and personally, I find Alan Cumming a turbulent presence in anything. But the lookout is without a doubt Sophie Thompson (sister of Emma Thompson, daughter of Phyllida Law) as Miss Bates; What this version needs is a scene where Emma is reconciled with Miss Bates because she is the character for whom we are drawn. The movie is worth checking out for her performance again. <br /> <br /> All in all, it is wonderful to have charm to save and more than enough to sort out the British class system. Worth the rent (because it is unlikely that Paltrow will ever be so good again - but we will always have Emma).
