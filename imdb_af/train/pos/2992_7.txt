It seems the director doesn't like this movie, but to me I think he's tough. <br /> <br /> Sure it's not perfect, but there are some atmospheric shots, and the story is good enough to keep your interest. <br /> <br /> It's shot in what seems to be a pretty village that also adds to the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> If you like horror movies in England, give it a go. <br /> <br /> I've just seen a trailer for these directors, the latest movie 'The Devil's Chair', which looks rather incredible. <br /> <br /> There aren't enough English horror movies for me, so everyone who comes together deserves our attention, and this one is not as bad as you might think
