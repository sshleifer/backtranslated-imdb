I think this movie was probably much more powerful when it only started debating in 1943, but it seems a bit too precious and static to elevate it to greatness. The film was in 1940 - just before the entry of the US into the war. Paul Lukas plays the very serious and decent head of his family. He is a German who spent seven years fighting the Nazis and avoiding catches. Bette Davis is his very sensible and long-suffering wife who has educated the children from time to time without him. As the film begins, they cross the border of Mexico to the US and for the first time in years they will relax and stop. <br /> <br /> The problem for me was that the family was also perfect and too decent - to make them look as obviously positive propaganda rather than a real family suffering from real problems. While it was a very noble purpose at the time, it just seems ominous today. In particular, the incredibly strange and extremely written dialogue used by the children has not only been made true. It sounded more like anti-fascism speeches than the voices of real children. As a result, they were very extremely annoying - especially the smallest one that sometimes ran out. About the only thing that sounded was Bette Davis and her extended American family, as well as the Scumbag Romanian who lived with them (although he had no noticeable accent). It is really hard to believe that ultra-famous Dashiel Hammett wrote this dialogue because it just doesn't sound true. The story is based on the play of his lover, Lillian Hellman. And the basic story idea and plot is good, but the dialogue is sometimes bad. Overall, an interesting curio and a movie with some excellent moments, but it's really about everyone.
