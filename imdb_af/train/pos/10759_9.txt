It is true that you always remember what you did at a point when a disaster or tragedy ceases. And no more, as of September 11, 2001, a date that changed the entire global landscape in its fight against terrorism. <br /> <br /> No, this documentary did not portray the events that led to 9/11. The filmmakers, brothers Gordon and Jules Naudet rather have a documentary on the trials and tribulations of a fire New York firefighter done. They went to the academy and did some shoots of training and plucked their proby (fireman) to join them in a NY fireplace, home to Ladder 1 and Engine 7. But their production had been developed at that time and time, believed it was the only shot of the first plane in the World Trace Center. <br /> <br /> I was back with a friend on the train of a night of LAN games, and got a call. 850:00 local time of my dad, who informed me of the above. A few minutes later he told me that there was another and that the WTC was under attack. By the time I got home, the upper floors of the twin towers were abandoned and smoked, and to my horror they collapsed within an hour. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers had two cameras running that day, one that followed a team on a routine call, and who immediately rushed to the WTC when he heard and saw the plane crash in it . We follow what is possibly the only filmed sequence of events in the WTC1 lobby where the first respondents of firefighters, paramedics and police had to make sense of what had happened and to quickly develop a plan of action. The other camera, held by the other brother, took his way to WTC to look for his brother and sister. On the journey he caught the many expressions of New Yorkers, as well as the sense of chaos in and around Manhatten. <Br /> <br /> During the documentaries, there are numerous interviews with the men of Ladder 1 and Engine 7, who had no miraculous casualties. But survivors have also caused their own set of psychological unrest, as they struggle to talk to the event. Through the unfolding events, we learn about the strong companionship of these men who dare to save their lives every day, to save lives. We started with what the documentary was supposed to be for events of the day completely moved in and became the focus until the rescue phase where the hope of finding survivors under the rubble is kept alive by the men who watch the whole bell work to make sense of the collapsed steel structures. It's not a movie produced, and what you see here can't be recreated in any other documentary (and heavenly, not good stages for Hollywood blockbusters). It's as close as you can get up to that day, the safety of the event going on. <br /> <br /> Code 1 DVD has a separate extra hour of 4 sets of interviews with Ladder 1 and Engine 7 men.
