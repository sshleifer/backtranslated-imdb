This movie was great and I want to buy it. The boy goes with his grandfather to catch a young eagle. the boy must feed and care for the eagle until it is old enough to be sacrificed to the crops. the boy saves the eagle to kill and walks away from the tribe. The eagle helps him feed him by catching a duck from a small dam that scares the boy. Later, the boy shoots a deer claiming a bully kid because their arrows are very close. Only until they check the thickness of the red lines will they determine who actually has the deer. But it was a pity, because it made the other boys even more cruel and in the end he was chased on a cliff, but if you think he would fall from his pure love for the eagle, he turned into a golden eagle with just a necklace as a reminder of who he was.Please if anyone knows where i can buy this movie let me know. I haven't seen it for more than 30 years, but still remember parts of the movie.deniselacey2000@yahoo.com
