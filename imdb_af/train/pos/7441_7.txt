Personally, I despise the Jerry Springer Show, but I found "Ringmaster" as the funniest movie I've seen this year. The never-ending satire of Jerry Springer "guests" starting in the opening scene, keeps you laughing at the whole movie. Despite a short scene in which Jerry Springer made a poor attempt to justify his existence, I definitely recommend this movie for pure entertainment.
