With all the violence on television and in the local news, it is refreshing to have a show that has no violence or adult language, but is still entertaining. My kids watch each week watching with us. Each one of us has a favorite chef and favorite reviewer. We all enjoy Elton Brown. We enjoy the background of the main ingredient, unique vegetables and spices. We play together at home to guess who will be the winner. <br /> <br /> It's a great time of entertainment as well as information. Best of all in our hussle, bussle life, it's an hour the family spends together.
