Yes, it gets the full ten stars. It is clear that day is this filling genius. One day, the universe sent Trent Harris a young, wonderfully strange man, and Harris caught him on the band, in the truly worthy glory that you just can't fall into. Badly, it ended in the tragedy for the young man, if only an alternative end to the fellow's story could be written. The other two steps in the trilogy do the story again, with Sean Penn and Crispin Glover in the roles of the young men respectively. The world is expanding and the strangeness is contextualized by the re-enactment, which gives us a broader view of being excited in Vanilla America. Recommended for everyone and everyone!
