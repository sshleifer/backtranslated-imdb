I could write a big enough comment on any of the characters in Gundam Wing, they can each lead the series with their internal conflicts. Instead, we get 8 big clues that we take through 49 golden episodes of Anime Bliss. <br /> <br /> It contains a dialogue that can roll you into your head for months and then go back and analyze. New meaning of a masterpiece in writing (though it has the typical Anime feature of a difference between subtitles and English dub). It has an abundance of concepts and philosophies that make you think about your own views. <br /> <br /> The relationships between the cold relentless men and loving female characters are a stand-alone aspect of this series. The relationship between Heero and Relena, and Milliardo and Noin are happy to look. The apparent rejection of the male is supported by an inner turmoil that makes love (a word never mentioned in the series) by the women who are needed for them in their harsh soldier environment. The women are looking for aspects of the men that we seldom see, even though the leading men become enigmatic. It takes Heero all the 49 episodes for caring, but he comes there and when he does, it's a big discount. <br /> <br /> Then there's the giant robot fighting. Nice to see fantastic rows as good as any Hollywood epic battle scene. Any less clued up person would see giant robot fighting as a silly cartoon feature for kids, as it became apparent when I recommend this series to my friends, but they are wrong. Many of the giant robot battles in the Gundam wing contain a solid dose of pathos, usually about young rebels fighting for what they believe in an oppressive society that ages their beliefs. <br /> <br /> The constant shifts in tone and emphasis Through each episode, Gundam Wing makes it impossible to be boring, it's a fascinating, thought-provoking study of the potential of human mind and body.
