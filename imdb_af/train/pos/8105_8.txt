SYNOPSIS The future as seen from 1939 England. As a war on Europe threatened, the salvation of man would not be found in the politics of the past. It is up to the brave new science world to overcome man's past mistakes. <br /> <br /> UNDERSTANDING THE VIEWER Beware of your leaders and what you are told. Thinking outside the box can lead to a better tomorrow. There will always be descent and fear, and learning to overcome it is our only hope. <br /> <br /> PROS EN CONS. I saw this movie long ago and recently downloaded from the internet (it's in the public domain). It's a fascinating work on many levels. As this is a story about the future, as seen from 1939, it has clear errors. This vision of the future is both frightening and erratic. This film was the forefront of his day. The special effects are very good as the story line. The play is a bit in the British scene because it can lean slightly against Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> One of the underlying themes of the movie is that science and technology can solve all our problems, what we now know is not always true. The films of the other plot line are that charismatic leaders are a curse of human existence and will probably always be with us. <br /> <br /> The underpinnings of almost all later science fiction films can be seen in this film. The sophisticated design and wardrobe of "Forbidden Planet", the shortcomings of technology in 2001: A Space Odessy, even the sumptuous landscapes / city scenery of Star Wars, is a little inspiration for this movie. /> The end of the movie leaves the viewer a little confused. Although it is optimistic in its end range to reach the stars, we are wondering if man can ever make it. Even when we reach, there are those we are trying to keep us back. This movie vision of the future while it is interesting is also a bit humorous according to today's standards. Big flying machines and guns that can shoot people into space never responded to the real world, but in 1939 they were considered the next logical step. <br /> <br /> Many great British actors are in this movie as young men. Cedric Hardwicke and Ralph Richardson are the most recognized and their oratory skills are clear here. Raymond Massey is a peculiar choice to play the main character, Cabel. His character almost emerges as the new Christ sent to save the world from his own destruction with the new religion of science. <br /> <br /> It's a good piece of biosphere history whose topics are still relevant today, though its vision of the future has gone missing.
