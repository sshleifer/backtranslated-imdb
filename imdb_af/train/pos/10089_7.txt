. . . or tap on a computer keyboard, they will probably give this eponymous movie a "10" score. After all, no elephants are being murdered during the film; It's not even implied that any pain is. On the contrary, the master of ELEPHANT WALK, John Wiley (Peter Finch), complains that he cannot shoot one of the pachyderms - no matter how threatening - without the permission of the government (and his tone indicates that such permits are not the realm of probability). In addition, the elements - in the form of an unusual drought and a human cholera epidemic - conspire to make the Wiley plantation house vulnerable to the total destruction by the Elephant people (as the natives obscured) to close the story. If you see the current release EARTH, you will find the Elephant People, today is less good.
