Famous words from the strange nightclub owner Roman Maroni, that "bad cork cleaner", who spends the whole movie not only as Johnny Dangerous's rival but also kills the English language. <br /> <br /> Another underrated classic you can only find at noon or late shows, Johnny Dangerously is a terrific satirical hit about a kind-hearted boy secretly living a life of crime lead to help pay his mother's medical care and place his brother through the law school. br /> <br /> Yes, there is a story, but what cares? A cast that includes Joe Piscopo, Dom DeLuise, Marilu Henner, and Alan Hale Jr. will be waiting to see what happens next. <br /> <br /> There is too much laughter to put on this. Like airplane, you need to pay attention or you'll miss something. Highly recommended to anyone who can use a good laugh or two !!!
