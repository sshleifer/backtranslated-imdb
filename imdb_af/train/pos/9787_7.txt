This story was beautifully performed. It is a pity and sadness about a young girl's journey to discover where she came from and where she went. Stephanie was adopted by her mother's best friend after her mother and father were murdered in a car accident. Since then she has been called the "miracle child", she is dyslexic and finds life a little difficult. Her findings on the way affect her closest. Her relationship with her guardian and her guardian's former boyfriend is treated very delicate and sensitive, and the whole supportive role is real, 3-dimensional and credible. Set up a press-selling factory in a small Australian village. It's a hot, soft, erotic film and makes you feel comfortable when the credits are close. After reading some of the other pretty comments about Hugo Weaving, I would like to add that I think he was brilliantly thrown and was very sexy. No, he's not Brad Pitt, but that doesn't mean he's not attractive.
