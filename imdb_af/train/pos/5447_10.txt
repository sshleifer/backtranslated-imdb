Personal taste rules when it comes to talking about movies like these precious jewelry. In the early eighties, I discovered this movie, as so many released at that time, "Night Patrol," "Bad Manners" or even King Frat, the artwork and blurbs on the back of the envelope that were tempted and bullied. you. <br /> <br /> Of course, of an age, such a movie as I already mentioned, as well as things like "Screwballs" and many others, have captured the imagination. Many years later I still remember a few with love and some with contempt the many movies that help to maintain my love for such a genre as parodies or pasties. <br /> <br /> Many years after the great success of "Animal House" and seeing how it has gone down over the years, I now know that this movie will ever darken the boxing money mentioned above or remind it like that of National Lampoon's Vacation. <br /> <br /> Honestly, not all that the National Lampoon logo wore, was a wild success my Class Reunion remains one of my favorite movies, with immediate recognizable characters, such as the separate Bob Spinnaker, played perfectly by Gerrit Graham, so well in Charles Band's "Terror Vision" that is still in the past of his youth's glory. Or how about Stephen Furst's brash and ballsy turning when high school rang six crazy bum Hubert Downs. <br /> <br /> Sweet as. What makes me think. As I have already said, personal taste does not resist. People can be so cruel, so it will never earn or be compared to the similar of its peers in the comedy world. It does have merit. To be one of John Hughes' earlier writings, which will later do one of my own favorites of his work, "Weird Science", as well as a wonderful theme title sung by the great Gary American effects . <br /> <br /> What more can I say, it's a movie that's just waiting to be rediscovered, time and time again.
