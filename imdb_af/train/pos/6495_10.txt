10 out of 10, this brilliant, super-documentary is a must see, with movie clips from the war that people have not seen for years, until it was sifted in 1974. The movie clips in this documentary out of the war do not miss Anything, some of the cuts left my dumbstuck. The whole series is over 20 episodes long, and Sir Lawrence Olivier is the narrator and tells a wonderful story of war. Simply this is still probably the best documentary war, and now the age of 25 is still a tremendous punch. You should watch it at some time, even if it's a few episodes. Even so, you will still be blown away by the impact this documentary means for those who suffered and died in the name of the WAR, in a WORLD AT WAR.
