A Scanner Dark, Minority, Blade Runner, Sin City and Sky Captain and Tomorrow's World ?? If you are a fan of any of these, it would be worth checking out. <br /> <br /> The French animation project, 'Renaissance', took seven years to make a budget and tonight I finally made it to a private show for the International Film Festival in Stockholm. My spontaneous response is awesome; My further reflection is 'huh, neat' and unfortunately analysis gets a resounding 'meh'. It's a great science fiction triumph on the surface, but it scratches it or even a bit of bump and its unnecessarily complex plot is sharply clear, just like the flat characters. <br /> <br /> However, it is clear that the people of Onyx films have done something spectacular with the aforementioned surface. The visuals are staggering. They used vibrant action motion traps that were fitted into keyframe animation, with sleek black and bright white contrasts and a strong shadow rotosi background. For those who aren't with the technical lingo, the movie looks like a full-fledged Sin City. Its liquid, transparent, dark and stylized template is complemented by large, blue lightning. This is a vision. Yet, much credit is also due to the sharp sound effects that break the shape of heavy futuristic weapons, exciting music, heavy raindrops and glass screens. It is every technology's wet dream ... <br /> <br /> The movie zooms in on an honest, dark, futurescape Paris in which a large corporation called 'Avalon' in the lives of citizens watched (think the liquid transparent screens of minority report) and genetic engineering. The latter leads to a mysterious kidnapping of young researcher Ilona (voiced by the beautiful Romola Garai). Cut to our hard-boiled cop-on suspension and protagonist Karas (Daniel Craig)? a man who takes the law into his own hands? who is assigned to find and recover Ilona. In this case, he is assisted by Illona's sister, with whom he also began a love affair. A very half love affair, if I can say that. <br /> <br /> The world of Renaissance is remarkable. Director Christian Volckman takes a fair jab on the melting of the noir themes and the result is an urban jungle full of cats, rats, femme-deadly and lonely detectives who hide in the shadows of the cunning slum. The problem is that the creators undoubtedly had the need to have very clear and elaborate archetypes in the story, or the movie would have been too "for surrealistic" for mainstream audiences because of its slender animation format. It then follows that we have a variety of clich√©-like characters, such as bad-laughing villains, messy crime bosses and slaughtery chicks who get smoking every chance. It kicks noir in our faces, and it's not necessary. <br /> <br /> What's worse is that the dialogue is a bit. It seems that every line exists for the sole reason to drive the plot. It's nothing deadly, because the plot is so complex as it goes, that it needs a clear direction. Daniel Craig also helps by bringing a no-nonsense attitude towards his hard-headed son. At one point in the Renaissance, he is seen in a lively car hunt that is surely one of the most adrenaline-pumping and top rows of the film. Unfortunately, the novelty of the sci-fi games chases the car, and 'Renassaince' can benefit from something shorter. In summary, a very interesting but erroneous, futuristic comic book experience. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
