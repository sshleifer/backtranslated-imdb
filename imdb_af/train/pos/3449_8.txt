TACHIGUI: THE WONDERFUL LIFE OF THE FIXED FOOD CHAPTER Japanese title: Tachiguishi Retsuden Director: Mamoru Oshii With: Toshio Suzuki, Mako Hyodo, Kenji Kawai, Shinji Higuchi, Katsuya Terada Tell by Koichi Yamadera - ----------- --------------------------- <br /> <br /> Going back in 1995, Mamoru Oshii unleashes its brilliant animation feature Ghost In The Shell, which helped consolidate Anime's international acceptance - has also grown into Andy and Larry Wachowski's overall concept for The Matrix. <br /> <br /> The film's successor, Innocence (2004). ) was the first Japanese animated film to compete for the Palme d'Or in Cannes, and it made the heads turn so much for its style and innovative effects than for its often incomprehensible plot. <br /> <br /> Always the trendsetter, Oshii has now presented us with Tachigui: The Amazing Lives Of The Fast-Food Grifters? which has absolutely nothing to do with Ghost In The Shell, or Japanese anime for the case. <br /> <br /> Say hello to Oshii's creation "superlivemation": not really animation or live action. Instead, the role event endured somewhere around 30,000 photos, digitally processed and reconstituted in a deceptively simple paper cut fashion reminiscent of Balinese puppetry. That movement itself is a quiet-silent style containing sequences of Shinya Tsukamoto's experimental Tetsuo: Iron Man (1988). <br /> <br /> "I couldn't think of any method, but this one," said Oshii. in a recent interview with The Daily Yomiuri. "I realized that this project is not suitable for traditional animation." <br /> <br /> The cast choice is equally mysterious. Kenji Kawai - who also compiled the superlative soundtrack - appears as a ruthless civilian fanatic, while the well-known Studio Ghibli manufacturer, Toshio Suzuki, miserably kills his screen-time. Others include Katsuya Terada, which featured Oshii on Blood: The Last Vampire, and Shinji Higuchi - a special feature that worked on Godzilla movies. <br /> <br /> Koichi Yamadera's story sounds like the stuff of a dry NHK documentary ?? which promises the comic undertones as well as Yamadera's extensive career-setting stoic anime characters such as Spike Siegel in Cowboy Bebop. <br /> <br /> And the plot itself is a bizarre reminiscence of World War II Japan in the context of various fast food shoots - from soba windows to gyudon stand; American dogs in the warm-up baskets of convenience stores to McDonalds-inspired civic chain restaurants. "Food is a primary root of desire," Oshii claims, for explanation. <br /> <br /> Thrown into the mix is ​​a new breed of consumers: the fast food rivals, people who don't like paying for their tucker and constantly refining their connoisseurs to sign up for free munchies. <br /> <br /> Oshii said his appearance was the honor of "art" eating food on the streets ?? something that is still a bit of a taboo in this country, and which somehow means explaining the use of "tachigui" in the title. <br /> <br /> The director of live-action films (Avalon, Stray Dog) as well as animation, Oshii has often blurred the definition of the two mediums. The celluloid result is deposited somewhere in the gray area between both formats. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the visual experiment is so exciting here, as it can be irritating. Just ask what it really is supposed to mean; Oshii's films, which are equally cerebral and innovative, are often not very clear stories. Where Oshii succeeds is via a liberal dose of black humor? Here are Kentucky Fried Rat, the death of hula hoop, the world's fastest Samurai Burger chef? and in the film's nature of surrealism. <br /> <br /> It is a man who defends the influence of filmmakers such as Godard and Truffaut, and perhaps so much to Andrei Tarkovsky as he does to David Lynch. So it shouldn't be so surprising that at one stage a B-52 bomber does a breakthrough in a Yoshinoya-style franchise. The 54-year-old writer-director was of the opinion that it was natural. "The Japan I portrayed in the movie is not necessarily true to reality," he suggested. <br /> <br /> Of course. -------------- <br /> <br /> By Andrez Bergen
