And my kids love it! Granted, I can see it now and realize that the animation was not so good and that the plot is tough. Hi, if every village introduced itself by saying, "I am mmmmm DAAARRRKK HEEEEAAARRT" I think they can laugh, but for young children this is a moral story with catchy music. <br /> <br /> Music so striking, you think I still remembered the words after I didn't see this movie in twenty years. I would definitely suggest this to younger children.
