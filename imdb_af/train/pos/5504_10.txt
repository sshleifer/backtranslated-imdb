I only saw it last night, it was broadcast on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's Passionate Eye series. It was recently screened (Sept. 2003) at the Toronto International Film Festival as well as many others. It's a very remarkable movie. The filmmakers literally stumbled into the story, making a documentary about Chavez himself. Instead, they found themselves in the middle of the events when the coup unfolded. They have unprecedented access to events and people and, for the most part, the story unfolds as it happens. Of course, they have their own ideological perspective (which they make clear), but they keep themselves in the background and rather try to draw attention to the events, the people and the background and history leading to the coup. As a movie, it's not in a stylistic or aesthetic sense, and that is the way it should be. What we get to see what embedded journalism should really be. What we see is a remarkable version of a country struggling to reach democracy. A charismatic leader (Chavez) who actually cares for his people ... a story of power and greed as a coalition of corporate / military / media interests. combines to lead a coup of democratically elected leader ... and unprecedented access to a historical event as it unfolds. <br /> <br />
