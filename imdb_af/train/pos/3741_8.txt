War drama that took place in Louisiana in 1971. It follows a lot of recruits through basic training and then Tigerland - an accurate portrayal of Vietnam on American soil before being transferred. It focuses on two men - Booz (Colin Farrell) and Paxton (Matthew Davis) ... how they meet, become friends and with a critical squad leader (Clifton Collins Jr.) and a border psycho (Shea Wingham) go. br /> <br /> A surprisingly non-commercial film directed by Joel Schumacher. He uses a handheld camera in most of the movie and uses digital video for the fighting. It works very well - the movie looks unnecessary and uncomfortable realistically. <br /> <br /> Farrell successfully covers his Irish pants and accepts a fairly convincing southern accent. His performance is just fantastic - he is a very talented young man. Unfortunately, Davis is not that good. He is tall, muscular, very beautiful - and very thin. However, the rest of the role is just as good. <br /> <br /> This movie was thrown away by his studio. It had no stars in it, a family story and was considered another war movie. It just played a week in Boston! It is also worth catching on video or DVD. <br /> <br /> Also, Farrell and Davis have a long nude scene.
