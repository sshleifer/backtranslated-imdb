The usual cat and mouse mats flow to Jerry in a bottle of invisible ink jumping. He gets the bright idea of ​​torturing Tom without knowing. The cat is showing and trying to do things to show him, even if it is not foolish. Of course Jerry Butch aka Killer aka Spike gets the dog in action (even if it is late in the short and his contribution is minimal) Brilliant animated short what kind of reminds me of the one with the white mouse that scares Tom so terribly. . Most of the gags work and everyone is violent like any good tom and jerry short must really be. This hilarious cartoon can be found on the disk one of the Spotlight collection DVD of "Tom & Jerry" <br /> <br /> My Grade: B +
