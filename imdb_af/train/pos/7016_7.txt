Although I can understand the bad things anyone can understand about this movie, I still found it to be absolutely incredible. It will affect you, and unless your critic looks deeply into the mistakes and accidents of every movie, or you simply aren't touched, it's worth seeing. Don't expect anything in the movie, just a box of tissues and an open mind. It is beautiful and the acting is brilliant. I think Will Smith, despite playing another lonely depressed individual, is incredible. I believe a good actor is someone who can truly portray the feelings and emotions that we all have on our worst / best experiences, in such a way that it comes to you and makes you feel something. And that's exactly what this movie does. Give it a chance.
