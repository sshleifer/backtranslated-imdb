I have a thing for old black and white movies of this kind, movies by Will Hay and Abbot & Costello, especially since it's my favorites. I chose this movie on DVD because it uses the same idea as Will Hay's "Oh Mr Porter", which is one of the best comedies ever made. I just watched this movie less than ten minutes ago (the movie finished at 12:45). I find that such movies, what about Ghost Trains, etc. Used, the best night vision with the lights off. This way, you get the storyline more and the night watches this movie well. <br /> <br /> The one-liners in the movie may look a little dated to some viewers, I think it depends on the viewer. However, they are not dated to me. I'm 28 and although I'm not old enough to walk around when this movie is released (my dad was already). I still have much appreciation for some of the old movies of this kind. Sit in the room in front of the TV with some sweets and drink and kick back and relax at night while watching these movies, and not many things can get the feeling you get while doing it. It's a while of reality. <br /> <br /> I noticed that one of the men in the movie (he has a black mustache) appears about three quarters of the way through the movie after his car crashes. and he was looking for a woman he had followed to the station. This man was also in the Will Hay classic "The Ghost of St Michaels". Just think I'll point it out if nobody noticed. <br /> <br /> The pieces in the movie are very atmospheric. Outside the abandoned station looks good and as if there is no soul for miles in any direction, and the inside of the station is very cozy to look away from the rainstorm that is outside. I felt like I'd been there in the movie with the movie. The atmosphere in this movie is now something that is missing from many movies. It keeps you from the moment the movie starts until it's finished. <br /> <br /> Today, we need more of this type of film. But unfortunately it could be over in favor of movies with nudity and curse and rough humor. This kind of movie makes me (The Ghost Train, oh Mr Porter, etc.) the golden age of the theater!
