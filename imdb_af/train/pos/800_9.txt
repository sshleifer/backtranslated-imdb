I could no longer be excited; Just eight years back in 1983, I'm going to see a Star Wars movie at the theater! The best day of my life was to happen. Until then, my only Star Wars experience was a few HBO shows of Star Wars. I haven't seen the Empire Strikes Back yet. <br /> <br /> And that day, son gave me less critical eyes. Jabba. Great Rebel spaces. The Emporer. A green leaf! Wow! Since that magical day I had to watch this movie hundreds of times. I can't even make an accurate estimate at this stage. Of course, with these multiple shows, I noticed that this movie - the real episode III - has its faults. <br /> <br /> Of course in the context of a Star Wars movie, those "bugs" are more like "quirks". <br /> <br /> Millions had their magical day in 1977 and 1980. In May 1983 I had mine. And that was my Star Wars movie.
