How can you summarize exactly how good and right and this movie touches? For a few weeks this DVD jumped into my shop every time - I saw Steve Carrell in a few movies before, I didn't want to push my thought process out of him - and I resisted and resisted it until finally I grabbed it with a "What the hell!" attitude! And how surprised I was! I just wish I bought it earlier. After watching three times over two days, I still smile at how depicting a widower with three daughters struggles and longs for what has been missing since his beloved wife, who meets such an intriguing woman and so loves her. deep and interesting (dare I say booky?) way, throw a whole different light on life that makes him realize she is what he is looking for. <br /> <br /> The snare of the woman complicating his brother's girl - which Dan shamelessly portrays and portrays with a sad chagrin and sees her "someone special" who has so much fun and enjoyment in the family home as well bring brothers' life. You just start to feel for him. <br /> <br /> When the blind day occurs at Ruthie Draper, it's the turning point in Marie's estimate of Dan !! The look she gives him when he repeats her comment, not Ruthie - pure Green Eyed Monster! To create an absolutely hilarious scene as the two couples compete on the dance floor! This series is one of the most well-made as Dan begins to detach with regard to Marie. <br /> <br /> Other gut-wrenching scenes - Then come back from the book and suit store, confronted by his brothers to describe what just happened. If Dan's face drops, it is a sharp intake of breath! <br /> <br /> His youngest daughter, Lilly, celebrates the gift of love for Suzanne, his late wife. little warmth and a little yellow as Dan only realizes what he has lost in life. <br /> <br /> When Dan plays guitar and sings at the Talent Show .... his voice cracks slightly as he reproduces the song. ... absolute jewel! <br /> <br /> The acceptance of what is happening late in the film by his daughters ... they all love their dad and want to see him happy, will not allow him to deny his love for Marie; the desperation of Dan not to fail his daughters because he is their rock, their fortress ... and tells him so much more than that with just a few words. <br /> <br /> I can go on and off, but I'll leave it now - maybe come back and add more comments here in the near future .... but I'll finish by saying .... < br /> <br /> .... if you want to watch a movie It's just as damn good, with comedies to relieve the drama, which never feels compelled or scratched. It comes across as a true portrayal of a man who is discovering new life - not only with a woman but also with his extended family, then you look no further. <br /> <br /> THEN IN REAL LIFE - 9 out of 10 for such a well-educated movie experience with a score of Sondre Lerche, which meanwhile takes you well while it's never intrusive. performances by the ensemble cast. I can't wait to watch it again!
