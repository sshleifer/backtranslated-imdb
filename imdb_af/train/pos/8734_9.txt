The movie was totally awesome and cool. The graphics were great and it was wonderful. Especially Flik was wonderful and wonderful in the movie and he was funny and he was and sometimes he was intelligent. The circus insects are colorful and they are excellent in the movie. The locusts were also fantastic and cool in the movie. Hopper was a pure and perfect villain. Even, Dot was cute. When the bird came to eat the bugs, the scene was excellent and good. Even the last scene was wonderful and cool. Even Flik's inventions were good. Building an artificial bird was a good idea to scare the locusts away. When the ants build the artificial bird, the scene was good and nice, and I would greatly appreciate the creators of "A Bug's Life".
