The best of times is one of the great sleepers of all time. The setup doesn't burden your patience, the development is steady, the very intertwined relationships are lovingly fixed, the gags and bits work everything and everyone is funny. There is a lot of sentimentality. Kurt Russell plays Reno Hightower sits in one of his best performances, and Robin Williams plays Jack Dundee's sure-footed as ever. The film also includes many good supporters. Jack's wife is played by Jack Palance's daughter, who is beautiful, like Reno's wife, who is a good comedian. I can't tell you how many times I watched this movie, how many times I enjoyed it and how often I wish more people could see it.
