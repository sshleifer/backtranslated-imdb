I hired this movie from a flu swimmer. I love Alan Arkin and the cover caught. I read the back and immediately knew it would be the best or worst movie I ever saw. I think I'm happy. I laughed from start to finish. Alan Arkin brings a great character to this movie. I've since bought a used rental copy for my own collection and watched it all the time. I revived this movie to many people and everyone enjoyed it as much as I did ... I see complaints about the menus and DVD's features ... but it doesn't take away from the movie. The disk is written for Blockbuster exculsivley. Therefore, they did not allow you to skip the previews. In addition, you should not watch the features of the DVD to scare you into watching the excellent movie.
