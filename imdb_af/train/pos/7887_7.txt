If you're a hard core Freddy fan then you might not like it. It looks like it's a ghost of the nightmare series. Not much to see here. The only reason to keep it yourself is the story of Freddy. <br /> <br /> The one thing that is always great in Nightmare movies is the death. But the screenshots were very crappy in this. The visual effects were great and the acting was OK, but the back story was excellent. Basically Freddy's story is full of circles here. <br /> <br /> I've read bad reviews for this, but I actually enjoyed it despite its many mistakes: <br /> <br /> 1. A nightmare on Elm Street. (8/10) <br /> <br /> 2. Freddy's death: the final nightmare. (7/10) <br /> <br /> 3. A nightmare on 4 Elm Street: The Drumester. (7/10) <br /> <br /> 4. A nightmare on Elm Street 3: The Dream Warriors. (7/10) <br /> <br /> 5. A nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child. (6/10) <br /> <br /> 6. A nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge. (3/10) <br /> <br /> I recommend it if you enjoy the series. That's where Freddy is fully explained, but that's all there is. Next on my list, West Cravens New Nightmare. <br /> <br /> (7/10)
