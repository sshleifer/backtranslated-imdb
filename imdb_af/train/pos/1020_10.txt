"Stargate SG-1" follows the intergalactic explorations of a team called SG-1 through a device called the Stargate and all the surprises waiting on the other side of the wormhole. <br /> <br /> This series has been seen sporadically for It's the first few seasons when it first came out, I didn't know how good this series would be, 10 years after I last saw an episode has. My old impression was that the series was big, but my impression was far from the truth. "Stargate SG-1" is more than just a simple sci-fi series. It is one of the most well-made, interesting, long-running, exciting sci-fi ever made. And why? Because it runs on a wonderful premise. <br /> <br /> This range value far exceeds that of the movie on which it is based and I think it is a very good example that television, as a medium, with a suitable premise, is able to provide something that not working on movie time constraints. The sense of familiarity created by a long-running series looks at the characters and their circumstances that progress in time, is stunning and adds to the ability to suspend unbelief. This is all the result of tremendous writing and a lot of dedication by the entire crew to The Show. <br /> <br /> "Over the past 10 years, Stargate SG-1 has shown great adventures, but has never been afraid of the challenge of moving the plot, and has made way for quite a few different periods of performance. : <br /> <br /> - The first few seasons, maybe up to 4/5/5, have focused much more on exploring planets and different situations, keeping the episodes fairly unrelated to each other threatening Goaul'd threat. <br /> <br /> - From 5 to 7, there were increasingly more episodes aimed at fighting the Goaul'd and preventing attacks on Earth. After these seasons, exploring the planets was almost an excuse to place sg-1 in a place of Goaul'd / replicator / ori conflict. <br /> <br /> - The 8th season is probably the most mixed. It has a stream of episodes that include minor terrestrial issues in which the stargates are almost even mentioned, but the last episodes contain some great replicator moments. <br /> <br /> - The 9th and 10th travels together because they have the same new enemy and not Jack O'Neil. They are both good continuations, although the first few episodes of the 10th season are a bit poor, as they seem to lose about SG-1 and man / Jaffa after the Ori. <br /> <br /> Basically after season 7, exploration has been pushed to the background, which was in many ways a shame because of the potential and mystery that each planet (episode) offered; On the other hand, it has made so many great episodes of the ongoing conflicts that changing the scenery of the show still worked and showing how big and fat the writers were. <br /> <br /> Even hard, I believe the range has a high quality finish that makes it rest, the feeling I have is that it can continue; The people involved were all good professionals and the series story has a lot to offer. A last season that was the beginning of the series was very feasible and would have been very welcome, but eventually things are like them. <br /> <br /> In the end, due to the fact that I enjoyed everything, it's a little difficult to find that it ends. The big picture, the one that has been drawn by hundreds of people over the course of 10 years, is, however, a glimpse of beauty and true proof of the dedication of the crew, the outstanding actors and the characters we will always have remember. as a collective name of SG-1.
