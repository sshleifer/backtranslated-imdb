I saw this with my boyfriend at the New York International Film Festival in November 2005. We were both very impressed with the complexity of the plot and found it moving emotionally. It was very well aimed with strong images. The visual effects were wonderful - especially for a short one. It had an original fantasy approach to a very real and serious topic: This film is about a young girl who is visited by a devil offering to help her situation with her abused father. There is also a surprise turn at the end that turned me down. It leans towards the Gothic feeling. I'd love to see it as a complete feature film. - Carrie
