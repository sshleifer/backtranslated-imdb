Greetings again from the darkness. Beautiful photography highlights this Disney documentary and looks at some of the harshness of animals living in the desert. For anyone over 40, Disney and Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom have given much of our insight into wildlife since our childhood ... when no channel is dedicated to National Geographic of Nature or Animal Planet. <br /> <br /> What is always fascinating is just how difficult the circumstances are for many of these majestic creatures. To watch the elephants, because it is almost delirious of the lack of water, so it is so painful. But their night struggle against the lions is exciting. <br /> <br /> Some of the underwater shots are breathless. The mum and baby tubers are beautiful and look at the huge whitish attack. His prey is as cold as 'Jaws'. The most wonderful landscape for me was the breathtaking view of the Himalayas. I have never seen so much detail about the range of the series. <br /> <br /> Don't think that most young children will be excited today, but surely one of the finest photographic documentaries I've ever seen.
