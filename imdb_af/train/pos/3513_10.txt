Actor Herman Jos√© plays the role of a soccer entrepreneur who is the pace of two African players and tries to sell it for very little money to the competitive club of the Benfica (club of his heart), FC Porto. These players did not play well and wanted the FC port qualified. But what happens is that these two players are good and FC Porto sells them for a lot of money to a foreign club and makes a good business. The film, for a small country like Portugal, without big antecedents in big movies, is a very good and funny comedy that shows all the rivalry between the North of Portugal (FC Porto / Benfica). Highly recommended
