Nice idea ... saleswoman Linda Smith (Yolande Donlan) inherits a small small province of Lampidorra. The country, which was not even in North America, was made 49th. (Of course there were only 48 states then, as it was made in 1952.) Linda travels to the country she inherited and we follow her as she tries to find out what to do with this strange land and its even more peculiar people. At one point she sings a song she claims to be of her people, the Navajo, and it is becoming more and more sore from there. Although Yolande Donlan's heavy lipstick and ubiquitous smile never gets overwhelmed or stifled. There are other songs that are distributed by the citizens singing to welcome their new princess. Filmed in a glorious British version of technicolor, or such an equivalent, the only big name here is Dirk Bogarde as British subject, Tony Craig, cheese salesman. Bogarde made a big blow in the British film industry after serving in the war, and was even criticized by QE II. Craig and the "new princess" hold each other together, and their adventures become more entangled as Lampidorra's financial problems exacerbate ... Fun little farce .... according to Marx Brothers movie. Also note that Donlan later married Val Guest, the author and director of our small project, and was married for 50 years! Guests were better known for writing and directing their sci-fi flicks, in both the United Kingdom and the USA.
