"The Groove Tube" was one of only two Ken Shapiro movies, the other being the same zany "Modern Problems". This one is just a full-scale parody of TV. Apart from Shapiro - who apparently did nothing to "Modern Problems" - the movie also includes Chevy Chase and Henry Winkler's cousin Richard Belzer. The three cast members (plus some other people in smaller roles) appear in different sketches. One of the funniest children has Chase in a Geritol spoofing commercial, in which he describes the medicine as his wife's gowns, and it ends with her humping. There is also a pornographic news program, an annoying cooking program, and the epic story of some drug dealers. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the whole thing is just a real hoot. In my opinion, the three best TV spoofing movies are the one, plus the "Tunnelvision" and "Kentucky Fried Movie" (although I also include the Truman Show). Really funny. <br /> <br /> I wonder what ever happened to Ken Shapiro.
