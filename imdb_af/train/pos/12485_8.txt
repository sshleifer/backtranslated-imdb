I just watched this movie and had to say, I was very impressed. It is very creepy and has many moments that will make you jump! I had to smoke several "emergency" cigarettes along the way to calm my nerves! If I had to criticize, I would say that there were too many jump moments. It has come to the point where every new scene has jumped with a leap and it has gradually worked away the surprising effect, because you have a new kind that comes. <br /> <br /> Although it contains virtually every clich√© in the ghost genre, they are all so well done to maintain the terrible fear factor. It has elements of The Shining, The 6th Sense and The Changeling (especially the soundtrack reminded me of The Changeling). <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good old-fashioned scare!
