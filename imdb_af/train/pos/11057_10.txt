I was 10 years old when this show was on TV. It was by far my favorite. The actors were very credible. Alexandra Bastedo was just beautiful .... I just order the DVD (15 episodes). They didn't have superpowers. They only had better human skills (strength, hearing, sight). The 3 actors were very good at their roles, very credible. There was a good story in every episode. At that time, there were no special effects or explosions, so the writing was supposed to be good, and the characters performed were wonderful. There were no fancy things like in other shows. They didn't try to joke every 2 minutes to make a light show. I recommend this TV show to everyone who likes good things.
