I first saw the movie in the theater when I was 8 years old and it still breaks me. The Muppets are so cool and approaching them in a refreshingly naive way show business. My favorite scene is when the rats start a whispering campaign on behalf of Kermit at a fine restaurant. This is a clever and funny movie for kids and parents. Long live Kermit, Miss Piggy and the rest of the gang.
