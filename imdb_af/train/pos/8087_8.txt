There are only two reviews of this movie on the internet. Those who hate it and curse Ralph Bakshis's name and those who love it call it work of genius. I tend to be in the middle. I was forced to agree with the most criticism of this film (eg, the cruel cut of the story, bad rotoscope characters, acting etc.). But upset that I still like this movie. The rotoscoping (when done properly) adds an ominous lifelike dimension to the charecters and the last battle scene at the end of the movie is fantastic. The surreal scenes when ninja hunting is Frodo are stylish and well executed and the musical score ... magic. Unfortunately, the bad points are out-of-the-way movie, but if you can bring yourself to ignore them, it's a good movie. <br /> <br /> (No doubt, I will be hated by a fierce gang of people who hate this movie after I wrote it review, ah well, so is life)
