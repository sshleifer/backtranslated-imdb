First, nobody can understand why this movie is so badly rated. Not only is this the first real horrible movie, because I've been cooking for a long time with decades of horror experience starting with dark rides (ghost trains) as a kid. Secondly, the main actress Cheri Christian has a vision that hopes she will be the leading actress in the great pictures of the future. Third, this woman is so wonderfully beautiful that I suggested that the directors retire all Cameron Diazes, Eva Mendezes, and how the names of these ephemeral light bulbs are. Mrs. Christian is not a light, but a sun. <br /> <br /> But "Dark Stay" is also of considerable metaphysical importance. They think pictures see the creatures of the intermediary between reality and the "imagination" that is not visible to their own eyes, not new. But I've never seen in a movie, those creatures are just on some photos on certain photos and only at certain times. This means that the picture is not just an iconic picture of reality (with which reality becomes a sign), but becomes an alternative form of reality that can change as the "real" reality can. To be a sign, changing the image means that it affects the photographed objects, ie the character behaves like an object. Now, in our ordinary world of perception, it's common for objects to change signs. For example, if someone grows a bird, his photo will show him with beard, not without, as it did before. But the opposite, changing objects with signs, would mean that the photo with beard is first and only then the beard grows on the man. It is very simply expressed, the case that happens with the photos taken by the main character in prison, in this movie. It's new, and we need to be grateful for everything new in horror movies that usually repeats and rearranges effects and features that are already well known, mostly since the silent time.
