He is friends with an isolated parrot during the performance of common law duties of an attorney at a behavioral science laboratory. <br /> <br /> The chief doctor is a bitter man, like Paulie, who can understand and understand language and learning, giving the doctor, who later banned him from the lower levels of the building, where Mikail ( Tony S. found him. <br /> <br /> Paulie restored his life with Marie and how they lost each other. The quest begins to reunite Paulie with Marie. Just over 20 years passed. <br /> <br /> The movie ends, some will say predictably, while Mikail Paulie reunites with Marie.
