David Duchovny and Michelle Forbes play a young journalist who wants to go to California, but can't really afford it, so they travel with another young couple (Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis) to save expenses. for them to stop at various murder sites along the way, places where serial killers did their thing, since Brian (Duchovny) is author and Carrie (Forbes) is his photographer. What they don't know is that Pitt (Earley) and Lewis are a serial killer and a girl who just agrees with whatever he says. I don't care about Pitt, but he does justice to psycho roles. The frightening thing is that he is doing them so well, I actually knew people as he did before, no, not murderers, but with almost the same attitude. Anyway, like the road trip, Carrie advises that the other is about money, but Earley always looks somehow. ..this thought that he is going to die here and there to do it already. Lewis does her role The one she excels at, a non-bright waif that has a good heart, but doesn't understand that she doesn't have to be beaten by Earley if she does something he doesn't like no. As things start to become unacceptable, Carrie claims that the other couple are exhausted at a petrol station and unfortunately it is at that point where she is inside. She sees a news bulletin telling her exactly who they participated with, after which things go on a quick clip for their downhill. It's not the biggest movie in the world, but it's not bad. I looked at what the "unrated" version would be, but I wonder how much was cut out of the graded version, because it made me pretty tame, really ... not that family or something, unless it might be the Manson is family. 7 out of 10.
