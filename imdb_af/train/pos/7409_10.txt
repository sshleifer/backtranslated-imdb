If I expected to see a "cute little movie" from China, I was badly prepared. Family dynamics, community and the inevitability of change are seldom explored so professionally on film. Every character is solid and I was completely in the story. The organization is much more complex than American audiences will be accustomed to. Yet there are no problems following the progression, even if you read subtitles. Jiang Wu, as the delayed brother, is a constant shining light. Leave your cynicism in your locker room. It will be there when you look.
