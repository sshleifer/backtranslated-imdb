MISSOURI'S GIRL arrives in New York to know exactly what she wants: to establish something by marrying a millionaire - without losing her virginity. With her knocked out good looks quickly the eye of the playboy son of a magnate, but by her truth will she also discover true love? Jean Harlow says in this great little comedy. With her platinum hair and beautiful accouterments she is a dazzler. But her beauty should not hide the fact that she was also a very good actress. She really earned her place on top of the Hollywood pantheon. <br /> <br /> An excellent throw gives Harlow good support: Lionel Barrymore as the old old tycoon, points to Harlow's ways; beautiful Franchot Tone as his son, defeated with love; Patsy Kelly, who steals her plays as Harlow's sidekick; debonair Alan Mowbray, as a well-known English Lord; elderly Clara Blandick as Barrymore's festive secretary; warm Hale Hamilton as a rich man with an eye for the ladies; muscular Nat Pendleton as a lifesaver who catches Kelly's flirtatious eye; and Lewis Stone, memorable in a small role as a bankrupt businessman. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that this movie was soon produced after Hollywood's Production Code was set up. A comparison with RED-HEADED WOMAN, made two years earlier, would be fascinating - in which Harlow's character goes to the same ends but uses many different means.
