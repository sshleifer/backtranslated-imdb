It's not a bad movie. It follows the new conventions of modern horror, it's the movie in a movie, the well-known actress running for her life in the first scene. This movie takes on the old convention of a psycho-killer, and he managed to do something new and interesting with it. It's also always nice to see Molly Ringwald back for the attack. <br /> <br /> This can be an example of what the genre has become. Cut hits all points, and are actually scary in some parts. I liked it, I gave it eight.
