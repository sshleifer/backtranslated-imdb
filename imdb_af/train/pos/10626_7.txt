It is a decent little movie made in Michigan, about a man hunted by his past, with his battered stepfather (Gunnar Hansen) and is not so well adapted. In fact, he is absolutely bonkers, but doesn't try to be obvious. He also has an entourage, his own little devil and angel pursuing him. The demon never says a word, but really, it doesn't, and he is Max Schreck-creepy. Let's just say that the angel almost turns his wheels, as Eric is doing things that make him feel better, like freeing people he has decided, mostly beautiful young women. It's a decent portrayal of madness, and you're at some point of your own in one way or another, but overall I have focused very much on the movie from beginning to end, because it definitely kept my interest has . It is a bit lacking in some areas, but nothing can really lie to me. A decent effort and worth seeing if you like a series of killer flashes.
