Well, this movie probably deserves 7 out of 10 stars, but I chose 10 to help offset the deceptive rating of the handful of Bozo's who gave this movie zero or 1 star reviews. Each of the segments for this anthology shows great potential and promise for the talented filmmakers. Three of them achieved remarkable success in the major Hollywood productions. Performances range from rough to totally impressive, with striking turns by Bill Paxton, James Karen, Vivian Schilling and Brion James. Martin Kove can be a great melodramatic as the psychotic hypnotist with the bizarro strobe lamp, and Lance August seems deliberately relieved as an unsuspecting laboratory victim. But overall, it has some big laughs and a few really scary moments. Definitely worth seeing, so judge for yourself!
