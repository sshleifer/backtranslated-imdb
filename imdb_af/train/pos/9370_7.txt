I have never heard of this movie, I wondered if it was an independent film, and I was right, but with a good role I decided to punch it. Often, driver Michael Williams (Nicolas Cage) is in the town of Red Rock, Wyoming, looking for a job, and Wayne Brown (Pleasantville's JT Walsh). He gets a lot of money, wrong for a hit he has. hired to kill his unfaithful wife, Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle). He did not improve him, took the money and went to warn Suzanne, and after making an offer, he decided to leave. When Wayne knows his true identity, he chases Michael and shoots a big gun until he arrives with Lyle from Dallas (Dennis Hopper). But things get complicated when Michael realizes that Lyle is the hit he was wrong with, and he makes a quick relapse. He goes back to Suzanne and knows they're both in danger. They plan to go with the town and add another complication. However, before leaving, Suzanne claims to go and steal a large amount of money in the safe. Of course things are not going to go away, and Wayne and Lyle catch up with them, and Lyle is forcing them and now Wayne is committed to fetching the buried money. In the end, Lyle and Wayne get everything they deserve, Michael and Suzanne join in on a train, but it's obvious that she cares more about the money and she gets what she deserves. Also Craig Reay as Jim, Vance Johnson. Johnson, Timothy Carhart as Deputy Matt Greyck, Dwight Yoakam as Truck Driver and Robert Apel as Howard. The performances, except perhaps a lame Boyle, are all good and dandy, and it has quite a good film noir feel to a black comedy thriller. Very good!
