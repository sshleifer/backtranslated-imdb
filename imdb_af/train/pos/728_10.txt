The Ramones, which I consider the founders of modern punk rocks, give their unique sounds to a terribly distorted movie about a rough rock fan (PJ Soles) who faces a ruthless, joyful princess (Mary Woronov) for law about rock. <br /> <br /> With a soundtrack with incredible music, RRHS is fascinating in concept and performance. It is a bunch of turbulent sight-gazing (such as the mouse experiment), teenage spirit (probably my favorite movie recording in everyday life) and bizarre, on-the-wall moments (the straitjacket scenes). If you're looking for a movie that looks pure fun at a molecular level, look no further. But if you are looking for a beautiful, dignified, dramatic epic, you may have to look a little further. <br /> <br /> "Hello everyone, I'm Riff Randell, and it's Rock & Roll High School!"
