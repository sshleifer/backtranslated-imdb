Steve Carell comes in his first movie in the 40-year-old Virgin. He only had supporting roles in movies like Bewitched, Bruce Almighty, Anchorman and his work on the Daily Show. We only have a small taste of the comedy that Carell really makes his own. You can say that Will Ferrell influences his "comic air", but Carell takes it to another level. Everything he does is innocent, sweet and hilarious. I would not hesitate to say that Steve Carell is one of the next great comedians of our time. <br /> <br /> The 40-year-old Virgin is two hours without laughing (or 4 hours if you see it twice as I did), a perfect supporting role and great leaders captivate the audience through the whole movie. The writing was perfect with so many good lines that you want to see the movie again just to remember them all. The music suits the scene of the movie, and you can tell the director knew what he was doing. <br /> <br /> Filled with sex grabs, a little nudity and a lot of language, this movie is not for everyone, but if you like the Wedding Crashers, Anchorman, or any movie next to those lines, you'll absolutely love The 40 Year Old Virgin.
