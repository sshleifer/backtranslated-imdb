This movie will tell you why Amitabh Bacchan is a one-man business. This movie will also tell you why Indian movies are sharp buyers. <br /> <br /> Amitabh was at the height of his Bollywood rule when his one-time godfather, Prakash Mehra, decided to re-use his image. Prakash has the habit of choosing themes and building stories from them, and adding liberal doses of Bollywood sensitivity and clich√© to it. Zanzeer saw the making of Angry Young Man. Lawaris was about a bastard and Namak Halal was about the loyalty of the master servant. <br /> <br /> But then the theme was limited to moving the script through the regulation three hours of song, dance and drama. The movie is a caricature of a Haryanavi that goes to Mumbai and changes into a regulation hero. Amitabh's vocal skills and density have earned this movie its big money, thanks to its flawless supply of Haryanvi accents. For me this is the biggest draw in the movie alone. The rest are all typical Bollywood screenwriters. <br /> <br /> Amitabh now had to have typical comedy screens in each of his movies. Thanks to Manmohan Desai. This movie had a good dose of them. The shoe creator in the party, the monologue about Vijay Merchant and Vijay Hazare's considerations. The mosquito challenge in the management room and the usual drunken scene that has now become a standard Amitabh prize. <br /> <br /> Shashi Kapoor has an extra mile for the movie with his moody, delicate character (remember he asks Ranjeet for "Shaada Monkey" after the poisoned cake incident.) She was the important role of the master while Amitabh loyal servant was. But Prakash Mehra knew the Indian thought ... and so Shashi had to combine his action with the rest of the movie. It was a character that could be developed to make a serious movie. But it's a caper, remember? And as long as it stays So the people came and Amitabh got a new hat and is fortunately back. The end is always predictable, and the good guys get the bile and the bad people go to the gall. The ages of loyalty are once again emphasized and everything is good that ends well. <br /> <br /> What is it that makes this movie a classic? Amitabh Bacchan as the Haryanvi. Prakash Mehra created another icon in the name of a story. Grab the story, the characters and the plot. My points are for Amitabh alone.
