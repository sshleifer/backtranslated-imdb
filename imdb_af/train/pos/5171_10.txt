If I could go back, even if an adult and relive the days of my summer spend at the camp, I would be so quick there. The camps I went to were not even that big. They were in Texas where the mosquitoes actually carried people, but we had horses and fish. The cinematography was amazing, the characters funny and credible, especially Perkins, Pollack and Arkin. Sam Raimi's character and sub-antics were invaluable. So who ever thought this movie was paralyzed ... I am very sorry for not being able to suspend their unbelief long enough to represent the camp life as an adult, or they never went as children. The whole point was that these people had the opportunity to return and to be young again and so did at every opportunity. I wish I could. It was funny, intelligent, beautifully written, brilliantly thrown and the works of art take me back, so I just want to look it over and over again, just for the scenery. Sorta like Dances with Wolves and LadyHawk ... good movies, but the desert becomes a character as much as the actors. Hire it, see it, buy it and watch it over and over and over ... never get old. ; 0)
