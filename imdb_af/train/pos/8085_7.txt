One thing I can say about this movie is long, very long! I recently bought this movie a few months ago, as a new version comes out. I was delighted to find that it was made in 1978 because the 70's (though I never lived in them) are actually one of my favorite decades, especially for the music! When I watched this movie, the story was really good at the beginning, but then after about 50 minutes it became very boring and repetitive. I will allow the animation to impress me! it was nothing I have ever seen and was very nice to see. but the movie could have been a little better, but it could talk a lot more and story about it than just 15 to 20 minutes of scenes that had only terrible fights. then for the last 5 or 10 minutes the movie has been recorded and recovered, but ended unexpectedly. in my opinion I thought it was very long. I know its 13 minutes in 2 hours and it's still a long time for a cartoon but since it was boring for most of the movie, it looked like it was 4 hours !! but overall it is a good movie i think and i'll see it again on one of those "nothing to do days". I'll see the new one and I hope it's better!
