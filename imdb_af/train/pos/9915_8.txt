I had nowhere to go. I was on a flight to Vancouver. I would probably have missed this movie if I didn't choose Air Canada. Found on a small screen in the back of the front seat, I found this fascinating and captivating. I drove away in a few places and had to hit it back, but I had to watch it. Now I look forward to the DVD edition in Europe, whether or not I have gone as far as I can go the door is still discovered! <br /> <br /> The photographic composition is stunning and the film gives so much insight and 'fills in' the story that tells the photos. <br /> <br /> Recommended (if you have time on your hands).
