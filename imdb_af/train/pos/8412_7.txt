Those who took part in the filmroom so early in the century have had to test their potential very early. It's a good story of a playboy type of money that needs money and accidentally sells its soul to Satan for a lot of money. Unfortunately, the soul is double and he must often confront him, tear his life apart. There are some wonderful scenes with people challenging and of course the scenes when the two are on stage at the same time. The middle part is a little dull, but the Faustian story is always in the minds of the viewer. One thing I must mention is the general unapproach of the people in the movie. Also, they pretty much chased away lots of action that would have given at least a little life to the thing. I was aware of this movie about 25 years ago and could finally see it. I was not disappointed.
