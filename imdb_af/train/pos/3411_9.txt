It is easy a 9. Michel Serrault, who is more known for the comic roles in the early part of his acting career, does an amazing, even worrying, work to dr. Petiot, a legendary French serial killer, set up. <br /> <br /> He's just as credible at any moment in the movie that the actor disappears completely behind the character. Only the very best can achieve this achievement, and when they do, it is only in a handful of parts at its best. <Br /> <br /> The whole story (a true story that happened in the 20th century France) is so powerful, so sinister - it makes for a very strong film that one has long remembered.
