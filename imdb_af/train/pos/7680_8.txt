"Holly" is a problem-driven movie, but it's not manipulative or too sentimental. In his heart, it is a character-driven film, which would not be as successful, without the depicted depictions of Patrick (Ron Livingston), the lost soul with the gradual awakening conscience, and Holly (Thuy Nguyen), like, but eventually over-matched young Vietnamese girl. From live places and photography to effective editing, everything is done straight and well. The contemporary classic score can only be abolished, but it is a composition and emphasizes the admirable restraint that occurs everywhere. This film, which produces many issues but gives little answers, ultimately succeeds in raising awareness and compassion for Holly and the many who share her destiny. Kudos to those who did it.
