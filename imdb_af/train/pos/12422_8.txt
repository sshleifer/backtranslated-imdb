With the mixed reviews I didn't expect it too much, and was pleasantly surprised. It's a very entertaining little crime movie with interesting characters, excellent portrayals, uncomfortable writing, without being, and a good fit. It also looks good, in a funky way. Apparently people like this movie or just hate it, and I'm the one who liked it.
