I didn't see this movie in the theater. I confess to an anti-Vinnie Barbarino bias. Who was John Travolta making movies? I remember the Oscar broadcast that year, with Travolta completely destroyed when he didn't win. How did he dare when there were "real" actors in the running? I'm sorry John, you had to win. After catching this movie years ago, I fell in love with the whole movie. Bud, Sissy, Uncle Bob, West, all done great. I also confess that I never pass it by when navigating the channel. I have to stop and watch. Over the years, I learned to do the most of the dialogue, dance with my thumbs in my waist, and I appreciated Travolta. The only disappointing thing for me was supervising the soundtrack of some of Urban Cowboy's music. "Looking for love" defines the movie, but Urban Cowboy was full of classics that didn't make it to the soundtrack. It had to be a double CD ........
