Woah! Is one thing I can say about this movie. Personally, I am one of those people who love cats, so that would have been a big part of the movie, but I liked how cats of each one got revenge at the end. <br /> <br /> I like The movie, but I have to admit it was because I found Brian Krause what Charles Brady played very irresistibly. I think lust got me better while watching this movie. <br /> <br /> There was one thing I was disappointed with. I watched Charmed and Brian Krause is married to Holly Marie Combs, his kissing scene was O.K. in Sleepwalkers, but really badly compared to his kissing scenes with Holly Marie Combs, I don't know if it's because Krause and Combs have good chemistry or maybe it's a little more, it's the only disappointment in the movie, but I think it was with Brian Krause in those tight ass jeans he wore in the movie. <br /> <br /> If you were used to seeing Brian Krause as Holly Marie Combs's heavenly man and her son's father, for a great surprise with this movie, he was nothing like corner boy. Although I think about it now, it would be great to see Krause's character on Charmed, which is taken over by the evil that she was like in Sleepwalkers. <br /> <br /> I also have to say the music was BIG in this movie too!
