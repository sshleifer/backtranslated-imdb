This review is dedicated to late Keith Moon and John Entwistle. <br /> <br /> The original threshold and bass. <br /> <br /> It looks much earlier. That's more if we can do it. Now it tends to be a very different kind. Who is altogether a parody, a shadow of their (much) better years. To be honest, none of them should prove to anyone any more, they deserve their respect and overtime. <br /> <br /> This concert material for me is one of their best. To recommend an audience of about 400,000 plus strong crows, take skill, charisma, white and very bloody good music. <br /> <br /> We all know the other bills on the account, The Doors (their last weeks before Jim Morrison's death), Moody Blues, Hendrix, Taste, Free and many more. The point was that everyone who was there was the one who came to see the majority. This show was one year after the Great Hippie Fest of the 1960s; Woodstock. The movie and record came out and so The Who's biggest work so far has had, Tommy. The ever-hungry crowd wanted a taste, to experience their own unique opportunity, to be able to bear "Grove and Love" knowing that this gig was their own. To do this, you needed the best of what Rock 'n Roll had to throw at the hungry crowd. <br /> <br /> At two o'clock in the morning of late August 1970, the M.C. announce, "Ladies and gentlemen, a small Rock and Roll band from Shepherds Bush London, the" OO. <br /> <br /> John Entwistle's body suit is of black leather, the front is the outline from a human skeleton from neck to toe, Roger in his traditional stage dressed up in long tights and long flowing hair, Keith in a white t-shirt and jeans, Pete had his white kettle pack and Doc Martins he chose has to carry. <br /> <br /> The Who has never stopped their High Energy Rock attack for more than two hours, they have their and other artists 'best songs like Young Man Blues, Shaking' All About, and then, as in the queue, Keith Baiting the crowd to "Shut up, it's a thriving Opera" with Tommy, the Rock Opera. The crow has become wild. That's what they came to hear, and those who did not disappoint, straight in Overture and never coming to the final note of Tommy you can hear me? Amazing. <br /> <br /> Getting a bond of this stature at their peak at a festival that would be the last of its kind in the world was a fantastic piece of cinematic history. <br /> <br /> The English DVD comes only in a soundtrack of English / Linear PCM Stereo, as in the United States, I think, you can at least reach it with 5.1, "See local press for details ??" All right, okay. <br /> <br /> The duration of the DVD is 85 minutes without any extras, which is a disappointment. Yes, for a piece of rock and festival history, this DVD will send you in a nostalgic ride in the memory avenue as soon as you play, for some of the best concert material it was meant to live, mourn and in your face <br /> <br /> I would have given this DVD ten if it wasn't for the lack of 5.1, and some extras would have been nice. <br /> <br /> Thank you Roger, Pete, John and Keith.
