"Someone at the door". OHHH, How do I miss this show so much .. but we're happy to have Invasion now. Thank you, Shawn Cassidy. American Gothic, has it all. If I had to choose one thing I liked best about the show, it should be its "not predictable plot lines". Favorite actor was Lucas Black. I adore the southern accent. I bought the DVD as soon as possible, and my kids are also supporters. There are some hot and steamy scenes. Some demons too. So, if kiddos will look, you might want to change (fast forward / switch). It has humor, at a Joss Wheedon level, lacking so many performances. Mature white and mature situation, which is handled with finese. The DVD has a few extras, but I wish it had much more. If you want to enjoy and enjoy a good show, check out "American Gothic"!
