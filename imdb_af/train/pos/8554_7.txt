Wow, it was another good turn of the original American cake, not as good as tire camp, but definitely much better the naked mile. Dwight and Erik Stifler lead the comedy in this one, but I actually prefer the dialogue in this one to the naked mile. The writing is much better written and the comedy has gone more smoothly, but most of the comedy came out of sex, but that's good because that's why we really watch these movies? <br /> <br /> The midget Rock also had a very good cameo, given the intense effort he had made in the bare miles, his scene with stifler was wonderful and made me laugh my ass I saw it. /> <br /> The movie was a definite improvement in my opinion compared to the naked mile. If you like any previous American Pie movies, you should have a beta home unless you have all the American pie-spin-offs a waste of money.
