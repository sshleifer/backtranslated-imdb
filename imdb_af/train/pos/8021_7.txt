The third Muppet movie is perhaps the most relaxed and enjoyable, with the gang using their modest university music to fill the bright (but fleeting) lights of Broadway with typically naive optimism. Of course, their first attempt failed and Kermit (leader of the group and writer of the show) blew his top; So, the others all go their separate ways so he doesn't have to be responsible for them. Kermit befriends a young wannabe fashion designer who finally meets by serving food at her father's dinner (the old man has a line in especially turbulent non-sequiters!). We get the usual cameo appearances by a variety of stars: Art Carney (as a producer), James Coco (as a victorious dog owner), Dabney Coleman (as a trusted trickster), Elliott Gould (also in THE MUPPET MOVIE [1979]), Gregory Hines, Liza Minnelli (as herself, with her portrait in a classic restaurant, replaced by Kermit's sporting mustache, like a seemingly celebrated entrepreneur in a rush to get acquainted with the Muppets show), Brooke Shields, and even director John Landis (possibly in the film's funniest scene as a Broadway producer before whom Kermit appears on white and chummy and donates hilarious shades and an Afro wig!). The other Muppets go more or less through their typical steps, with (unfortunately) less space given to Gonzo this time; while Miss Piggy is something of an acquired taste with me, the scenes in which the latter spies on what she takes to be Kermit's romance with the waitress? and especially her violent reaction to this? is undeniably funny. However, what is disappointing is the climax display itself (after a fairly redundant mid-section in which Kermit gets memory and eventually arrives on Madison Avenue), which, rather than the anticipated splashing routines, has nothing more original than the marriage ceremony of Kermit and its eternal flame Miss. Piggy!
