I love this movie a lot. The story jumps back and forth and is not easy to follow. There is no solution to the story whatsoever, and you shouldn't wonder what really happened. Since I like that kind of movie, I enjoyed it. I especially like the "dating" scenes between the boys and I have been drawn to their lives. And of course, any movie with a naked Staphane Rideau will get some extra points. ;-)
