I think it's a good movie. because you see Diana's life at home. she had so much aggression, and she wants to prove that girls can also fight. I think she and Adrian were good actors. Because of this movie I am also boxing. It really impressed me. The only negative part I think. Is the end. because it is good between Diana and Adrian. But you can't see how it is at home. And I didn't really like you seeing how her dad was doing, nor her brother. but I think it's a good movie and I think I'm going to look a lot more :) I recommend it to anyone, even if you don't like boxing, you get much more than just boxing. I had a good time looking at it.
