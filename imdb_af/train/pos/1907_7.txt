8 Simple Rules is a funny show, but it also has a life theory, especially a mature lesson to move to a loss that was the episode where Paul died. It was the first episode I ever watched on the show coming on ABC. The Hennessy Mother Mother Cate (Katey Sagal), the daughters Bridget (Kaley Cuoco) and Kerry (Amy Davidson) and son Rory (Martin Spanjers) - look at each other for guidance and support after Paul's death (John Ritter), the family patriarch. Cate's parents (James Garner and Suzanne Pleshette) lend a hand. I'm staying later in the 2nd season of this show, they decided to place David Spade in this show as he did with the NBC series, Just Shoot Me! But all and all of these shows are pretty good. This show reminds me many of the classic family sitcoms from the 80s and 90s that were earlier on ABC.
