Oh, true memories. I lived in Holland at the time and eagerly looked at it every Sunday evening and later on Tuesdays. I saw it during my 14-16s. Very good for me (then school) English, since Dutch TV offers subtitles for other languages, except for children. So you would hear the original voices and language. - The best series was the first three and then after the third series the great character Nazi Von Gelb, who was such a formidable enemy, disappeared from the series. I don't think they ever caught him, he always escaped, so he made him appear in another story again, because the series has also been distributed to Germany and a Nazi enemy will not overflow very well! Too bad, because Geoffrey Toone did such a wonderful convincing job of portraying the intelligent Nazi aristocrat. He took revenge on this continual obsession with England. It was a great pleasure to see this kind of high quality performance in a youth series, but Ronald Leigh-Hunt was a good counterpart and the youngsters were so normal. They were very credible at the time, and as a child I could only imagine being part of these young people, who at that time were about four years older than me. It was a very exciting series for me, and I also exhibited in this memory as a special show with the prisoner. I hope they will publish a good quality DVD of the series, it will be great. Even the bad copies are still nice to watch. The later series was not so good, watered and just not as much fun as the first three. Hopefully they also find the other series with Von Gelb on DVD.
