Well, that was a good surprise. his trailer didn't predict a good movie, it was even a bit misleading. Particularly the part of Jeff Bridges was a positive surprise, well written, sardinian and funny. Less real, I don't think a man who got where he got would show signs of such indifference to everything his current company stands for. One does not become a headache to just doubt it. The end of the movie, during the show of Dolce Vita, was too crowny, clich√© and pretty disappointing. And of course, a man like Pegg's character won't be past his first week in a hot New York magazine like this one. I hope one day I will see a decent role for Megan Fox, here she has chosen a poor actress playing a bimbo. And by the way, I don't see why she's the "sex symbol" of the year, I see called girls on almost every cover of every magazine.
