Bartender directed Any way the wind blows as he would sing a DEEUS song. Anarchy governs a logical and general mindset. The story behind this movie is just like the wind blows. And it can be really refreshing to watch, if you are willing and willing, it is. Viewers who say there is nothing to keep the story lines together is right. Who is the Windman anyway? Yet I really enjoy this movie. Antwerp is a beautiful, bustling place and Any Way takes the feeling. It also makes the sotiness, racism, bureaucracy, addictions and the violence that survive unnoticed in a seemingly friendly city. The movie is entertaining, funny and a little level. Barman's screen debut will not have as much impact as his music debut. In the light, some may be disappointed. But then the worst case scenario will be a subtle subtitle for any wind blow.
