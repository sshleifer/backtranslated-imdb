I saw an American in Paris when I was still in school and immediately fell in love. I came back to see it the next day and lost the number of times I've seen, both in the theater and on TV. It makes fantastic use of some of the best music and songs by the greatest popular composer of the twentieth century (George Gershwin) and features the greatest male (Gene Kelly) and female dancers (Leslie Caron) in Hollywood history. The supporting film by Oscar Levant, Georges Guetary (why didn't he make films anymore) and Nina Foch (brilliant in an unsympathetic role) are at the top of their form. The closure ballet, excellently choreographed to the title music, makes excellent use of the sights and sounds of Paris and of the images of impressionist and post-impressionist artists. All the Gershwin songs are beautifully performed, but the most memorable is: "It is very clear" (Caron and Kelly on the banks of the Seine) and "I Got Rhythm" (the children of Paris at Gene Kelly in "Une Chanson Americaine "joined). . If you like Paris, see this movie. If you've never been to Paris in your life, see it. But see it!
