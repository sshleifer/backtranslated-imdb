Tears of Kali is an original but flawed horror film that exists for the purpose of a cult group in India, consisting of German psychologists who have learned how to control their wills and their bodies to the point that they can others let them heal by radical techniques (which can cause nightmare hallucinations and physical pain and torture) to drop the suspended demons within them. <br /> <br /> The film is shown as a series of vignettes about the Taylor-Eriksson group - the above-mentioned cult group. The first segment is a bit slower than the rest, but is good for setting the rest of the movie. The rest of it plays like a mindf @ ck movie with some key clips thrown into the mix (full-face nudity, some gore) to keep you happy. <br /> <br /> I say it's going out. May not be spectacular, but the concept is pretty neat and delivers in the right places. 8/10.
