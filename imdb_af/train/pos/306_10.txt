Well, I saw how they all laughed when it was in Europe <br /> <br /> in 1982 and kept a vague but sweet souvenir of it. I saw it on tape just over twenty years later. Bogdanovich has a real sadness about his characters and a kind of sympathy that is hard to feel. Excellent comedians and actors, good lines everywhere and for everyone and pretty good editing. I laughed and smiled all the time. Just as we all do, at times. Go get it.
