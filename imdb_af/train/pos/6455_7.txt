I was drawn to this movie when I saw a preview of it on Oscar night. When I read about Kay Pollak, I was addicted. Our Americans are suckers for a return child. <br /> <br /> I understand this movie was a big draw in Sweden. As a very provincial American, I can only speculate on the reason. Perhaps it is because of the challenging joke that makes the Lena character at the beginning of the movie and other social commentaries, but perhaps it is because of the central message I believe has everywhere in affluent communities the same speech. <br /> <br /> The message of this movie to me is the same as the movie Titanic. Life is short people and as far as anyone knows this is all we have. It can be taken away at any time. So it's not a pity that we spend so much time behind walls that separate us from other people, because we're so scared to get hurt? Tear down the walls, are painful, but feel lies on the other side of the wretched walls. Feeling life is worth taking the risk. Give and you will receive. So start now. <br /> <br /> Many people criticize this movie because it lacks characterization and other errors. I say you are all pseudo-sophisticated. Grab people, this is a parable, a fable for our affluent westerners who are essentially rich, but whose souls are in poverty. <br /> <br /> Connect to a choir or a group or help build food or spread food for those who are less fortunate than you. Bring a little joy and make the world a better place as long as you come out and socialize with your fellow man. Writing a check is not enough. Among other things, we are a social species. Even the humblest of your fellow human beings can influence you in ways you never thought. <br /> <br /> Raw individualism has its place, but it's overestimated.
