one of the best ensemble acting movies I've ever seen. There is not much on the plot, but the acting - incredible. You see the characters ever change so subtly, affecting the influence of the rented villa in Italy, and the love. And luck. The movie casts an enchanting game on you, as the villa does on all the women. Actually "enchanted".
