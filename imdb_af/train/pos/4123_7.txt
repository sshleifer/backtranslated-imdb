The freedom to have your own Sea Going Power Boat, the thrill of cruising underwater adventures, a man of an adventurer, and lovely (and well-equipped!) Bikini's fine assistants were all the definitive points of sale for SEA I. 1958-61). <br /> <br /> Exactly what was the reason for producing a kind of victorious "rifle for rent" * range. Let's look carefully. There must be some clues. <br /> <br /> If we look back a bit, we see the RKO Radio Pictures production from UNDERWATER! (1955). It played Jane Russell, Gilbert Roland, Richard Egan and Lori Nelson as a quartet of many attractive divers working in the Caribbean, including a Pre-Fidel Cuba. The film was moderately successful and was not unforgettable for his story as for the appearance of school principals in swimsuits. Beautiful, beautiful women's people in some very fine 2 bathing suits (Woo, woo, woo, woo!) Are always a plus for the guys; And the presence of raw, athletic men who "pretend" their best beef is just as enjoyable for the Gals. <br /> <br /> And there's one element that is a true legacy of this old RCO feature. It is on the sound track between the musical ropes and themes. This is the recording of "It's Cherry Pink and Apple Blossom White", written by Louiguy and Jacques LaRue and performed by Damaso Perez Prado and his band. <br /> <br /> Anyone who hears this institute or song (with lyrics) will not forget it soon. His Carribbean Beat is so much alive and his rich use of the Brass Section of the Orchestra is powerful and instantly gives immediate impression and memory. The 45 RPM recording of this song made it the top 10 most popular songs of the week for many Saturday nights on NBC TV's "YOUR HIT PARADE". We can't just remember how many weeks or just how high it is. (Maybe someone can fill us in on that one item, please!) So, we came back to "SEA HUNT" and its own Odyssey to get on the "Tube". The public took to UNDERWATER! Okay, but would they go for a TV show. <br /> <br /> ZIV TV Productions gained a reputation for exporting a type of product that for the most part was not signed by the Networks. for multi-station hook-up treatment. But they have achieved great success with Television Indication. ** By this we mean to offer a series of stations for shows at one TV station per market area. (As the various newspaper syndicates sell "Strips" to various papers on the country and the world, even. <br /> <br /> So we have "Mike Nelson", himself, in the physical presence of Lloyd Bridges Mr. Bridges was around 15 years old and turned into some very memorable performances in mostly supportive and highly varied roles in a few Boston Blackie movies (along with Chester Morris) to their stud to CONGA (3 Stooges 1943), SAHARA (also 1943), HOME OF THE BRAVE (1949) and THE WHISTLE AT EATON FALLS (1951). <br /> <br /> Lloyd has brought a very convincing way to his characterization, along with a fine convincing athletic body, with the appearance of a man who lives with his physical abilities, he did very well as the Diver's Diver, or performed duties aboard the ship or fake it under the sea. <br /> <br /> And Lloyd is rapidly gaining momentum, but unlike many out-of-the-box information, he was not familiar with SCUBA e. *** before landing this Mike Nelson gig. But the athletic Mr. Bridges was a fast learner, as so many of the close-up shots revealed underwater that there was no doubt that it was Lloyd with the mask, the bubbles and the pinball fins. . <br /> <br /> Stories were almost always involved in helping a client pay, just like a private detective. So, if the client was a lovely woman who looks good in the bathing suit, the better. <br /> <br /> Like so many other ZIV / UNITED ARTISTS TV Productions, SEA HAD had a fine, <br /> <br /> At one time, I believe "SEA HUNT" syndicated the top TV series was a success that the ZIV series had previously known with "SCIENCE FACTORY THEATER" and "MAIN PATRICK". As for the showroom for this underwater saga, it is here in Chicago late night (after 22:30) on WNBQ TV, Channel 5 (our NBC Affiliate, now known as WMAQ TV). <br /> <br /> And I can only remember who the original sponsor was in this particular market. And there were even commercials done by the Star on the scene! How well can we remember and visualize Lloyd as Mike Nelson, who is driving his boat. And if we are invited to return the next week and look at ..... another adventure from SEA JAG, sponsored by the G. Heileman Brewing Company of LaCrosse, Wisconsin 'The Creators of Old Style Bearer Beer!' , Although Mike was making us an old style bottle. (Shame on you, Mike! Drink beer on your moving boat! We're the coast guard!). Then the boat will leave the quay, accompanied by the Sea Hunt Theme and the Credits roll. <br /> <br /> NOTE: * More figuratively than literally, Mike was on hire and things ran like a Deterctive Story. NOTE: ** ZIV's syndicated successes include "SCIENCE THEATER", "POINT" (and its clone "PEOPLE OF ANNAPOLIS"), "SEA HUNT" and "HIGHWAY PATROL". <br /> <br /> NOTE *** And of course, SCUBA is an acronym for Self Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus.
