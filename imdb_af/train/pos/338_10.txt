I watched this film at the International Documentary Film Festival of Amsterdam and was privileged to meet both the directors and Tobias Schneebaum, all of whom are vibrant and outspoken New Yorkers. The film's title in Amsterdam was Keep the river on your right, which makes the sensational aspect of cannibalism slightly less prominent. Just as important was the love and gay relationship, Tobias Schneebaum, with members of the groups he studied as an anthropologist. His reunion nearly 80 years old and inevitable leave is moving a lot. I can only recommend this movie to anyone looking for a moving story that is nothing but pedestrians.
