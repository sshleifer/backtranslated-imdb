OK, here's my personal list of top Nicktoons like today. <br /> <br /> 1. All Grown Up / SpongeBob Square Pants <br /> 2. My life as a teen robot <br /> <br /> 3. Invader Zim <br /> < 4. CATSCRATCH / Rugrats <br /> <br /> Note a word with only uppercase letters? That means it's the Nick show I'm going to talk about. <br /> <br /> "Catscratch" is basically a simple but big animated comedy about three rich cats - Mr. Look, Gordon and Waffles - who get into strange and VERY surrealistic situations, from the attempt to join human Kimberly's slumber beer party to save a planet of evil spaceship snails. This is one Nick show that will tickle you sooner or later with your funny leg! The theme song is tempting and memorable. Voice actors - including Wayne Knight of the Seinfield franchise - bring the characters to fresh life with many peculiar personalities. The stories are enjoyable (fans' episodes will be "King of All Root Beer" and "Gordon's Lucky Claw"). And the humor is all in some style of Earthworm Jim. <br /> <br /> Finally, "Catscratch" is one of the Nicktoons series, such as "Invader Zim" and "MLAATR", which become popular in just 3 seasons or very much.
