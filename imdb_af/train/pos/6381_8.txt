"Atlantis" is a new and real step for a Disney feature. It's a good choice to make a movie through such a mysterious legend as 'Atlantis'. I didn't have any expectations for this movie, but after looking at it, I didn't quite understand why this movie had such bad reviews. Even in my country, the judges were not positive. <br /> <br /> "Atlantis" is not a perfect movie, but still one of Disney's biggest. I even doubt that this movie will ever get Disney classic reputation. Well, that's another case. It's funny to think that this sci-fi movie is directed by the same directors as "Beauty and the Beast" and "Hunchback" (so Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale try to get away from their monster movies reputation, he he, me is "I'm just joking." <br /> Well, enough nonsense. "Atlantis" is a viewable, exciting and very enjoyable movie. Even this movie is a PG-rated action feature, it's also suitable for kids, in my opinion (parents who mean the opposite, don't kill me for writing it, he does). <br /> <br /> The story is a bit predictable, but it doesn't spoil the movie. The comic book-inspired animation is suitable for the film and the set is a deviation from the usual Disney style. This is colorful, dark and detailed. The Deep Canvas rows are pretty impressive. The movie is also funny sometimes, even I have giggled more than laughing at the movie. (SPOILERS) The characters of this movie are also very nice, but unfortunately there is not enough screen time to get to know everyone, so there are characters behind. (Spoilers). <br /> <br /> James Newton Howard's score is absolutely amazing. It's daring and exotic. (SPOILER) The most impressive of these films is how they make the Atlantic language sound very natural, ethnic and authentic. It's really fantastic (SPOILERS OVER) <br /> <br /> The writing is stiff and well written, but still there are questions that are unanswered in the story. But fortunately there aren't many of them. <br /> <br /> So, you're yourself a favor, don't listen to the judges and watch "Atlantis" because it's waiting for you ...
