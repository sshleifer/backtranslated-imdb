The Writing Word <br /> <br /> What you see is what you get. Not really! What Madhur Bhandarkar's brave and brilliant 'do' is the myth associated with the glamor and glitterati that the pages of our newspapers hide and whose lives (read some habits) follow us with such maniacal fervor that can only explain our intrinsic voyeuristic streak. <br /> <br /> The phenomenon of page 3 is as regrettable as it is mysterious. How exactly did it get control over the printed word and when it started to enter the cover, there is another debate. Bhandarkar avoids it smartly. He is only concerned about the mechanisms of this grotesque existence. And with that he does the various elements of this lifestyle together. Like Robert Altman (although I don't compare Bhandarkar with Altman's genius), Bhandarkar uses many characters to promote his motive. Whether it's a page 3 wannabe NRI, the holes crashers, the new rich, an upcoming model, a socialite politician or an erotic novella author. All the characters are entered with an objective and each has a separate character sketch, even if their parts are miniscule. And in that lies the film's appeal. <br /> <br /> Konona Sen Sharma plays Madhavi Sharma, a young and talented journalist covering page 3 for Nation Today. Initially satisfied with her work, she soon begins the ugliness of this abdomen covered by his false and cosmetic profigacy. But Bhandarkar resists the temptation to make this subject into a moral police film and avoid concentrating on one character alone. Hence the movie is not just about Madhavi, but also about Deepak Suri (Boman Irani) - Madhavi's editor who passively assumes his role as a boast of a bigger machine, Anjali Thapar (Soni Razdan) - a social suffocation of the social pollution, Abhijeet (Rehan Engineer) - a homosexual makeup artist and Madhavi's roommate Pearl (Sandhya Mridul) - the sassy airhostess and Gayatri (Tara Sharma) - an aspiring actress. It seems like an impossible task to assimilate so many characters (and more) into one story, but full credit to Nina Arora and Manoj Tyagi to make a sharp script. The dialogues of Sanjeev Datta and Bhandarkar were written with great attention to detail. <br /> <br /> Any narrative, no matter how good, can fall flat with the lack of true action. Fortunately, 'brims' with actors and not stars. Through her author-supported role, Konkona goes with ease with ease. Ditto Boman. Sandhya Mridul gets the best written part, but almost overdo it. However, Atul Kulkarni is wasted with an underwritten character. Sometimes the director seems too eager to include as much as possible (pedophilia, homosexuality, etc.). But the contexts in which they are used do not let them see quickly. <br /> <br /> Eventually, Bhandarkar's effort is to saturate our voyeurism, but he takes it a step further. He takes us into the photos and exposes us to the horrific realities of this sect of mankind that seems strange in another and remote world. These are the same people who entertained in the New Year's fairy tale, while destroying a few hundred kilometers from their compatriots through nature's rage! Smart writing, skillful songs, performances and a sincere sense of sincerity are what make this movie worthy of its lack of finesse and poor production values. 'Page 3' is an optimal way to enter a new year of theater. <br /> <br /> - Abhishek Bandkar <br /> <br /> Valuation **** <br /> <br /> * Poor ** Average *** Good **** Very Good ** *** Excellent <br /> <br /> January 29, 2005
