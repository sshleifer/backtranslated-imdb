I watched it many times and I plan to buy the full feature. I love Jason Steele's comedy. It is very different and unique and is very pleasant. I love indie movies and this one is just wonderful. The plot is strange but very funny. This short film is about a Spatula called Spitel, called Edward. The sequence of events is a bit jumbled, making this movie very interesting to watch. First you see Edward fighting the spoons, but then the focus changes earlier in his life. It's a silly movie, but of course it's still good. I recommend watching this movie at www.spatulamadness.com or www.filmcow.com. It's very funny. The humor may not suit everyone's taste, but look anyway. It will take just 16 minutes of your time, and it's free. GO WATCH SPATULA MADNESS!
