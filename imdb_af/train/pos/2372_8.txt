I just looked at it after my mom returned it to me from America. I was afraid to look at all the negative comments here, but I have to say, yes, the acting is cheesy, some of the effects are laughing. <br /> <br /> But remember that it was meant to be 1898 in 2005, and for such a low budget I thought it was pretty good. I enjoyed this version much more than the Spielberg version I saw last week. <br /> <br /> I have read the book so many times and found that I "ahh yes in the book, almost all the time with the other version has virtually nothing of the book. > <br /> So well done to at least try a real version.
