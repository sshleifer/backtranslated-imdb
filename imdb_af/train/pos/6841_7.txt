It's probably one of Brian De Palma's best-known films, but it's not his best. Body Double, The Fury and Carrie are better movies, but this movie is better than Blow Out and Obsession. De Palma is heavily influenced by Hitchcock and this movie kicks off at Psycho. Angie Dickinson is a bored housewife who thinks she has a relationship and has rejected an offer to her psychiatrist, played by Michael Caine, meets Dickinson a man in an art gallery and she beats sleeping with him. After this point it is best not to know what is happening, but there is a murder and Nancy Allen is a call girl who gets a look at the murderer. Dennis Franz is the detective on the matter that Allen really doesn't trust and she must find the killer herself. It's a good movie but it's not one of De Palma's best.
