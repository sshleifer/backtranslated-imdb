After 'Aakrosh' it was the second film for Govind Nihalani as director. Until this film was made, there was no audience for documentary programs in India. This movie has proven that a documentary can fulfill the requirements of a commercial film without its being. It was one of the successful movies in the year it was released. This film fought in 1983 against the big banners of the bollywood like 'COOLIE', 'BETA', 'HERO'. <br /> <br /> SmithaPatel, in this movie, acted more like a conscience of the hero when he drove away or lost his tranquility, she was there to remind him. She was not like an ordinary heroine to walk around the ordinary things of the trees and shrubs. At one time she even gave up her love when the hero's reluctance touched the roof. <br /> <br /> There was another character in this movie, played by Om Puri's contemporary, Naseeruddin Shah. He played as an inspector-turn-alcoholic character. The role conveyed the message of the end result of an honest police officer who threw the wrong side of the system. gave the viewers a chance to predict the hero's end. <br /> <br /> In his debut film, Sadashiv Amrapurkar captivated the audience with his cameo role that eventually won him the best supporting actor in the film. The policeman in the movie was not a complete straight forward personality he was able to fit to some degree with the system. The rage that left half-handed continued in Govind Nihalani's other film, Drohkaal. Even after two decades, this movie is remembered only by the director and the entire crew. Everyone played their part excellently.
