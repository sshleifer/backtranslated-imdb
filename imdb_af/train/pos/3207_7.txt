Of course, according to any normal standard of film criticism, Soldier is, of course, a very poor film. Kurt Russell is a futuristic super soldier who has been raised since birth, but has become obsolete after having disappeared through a lot of really super soldiers on a dangly hoop. It looks like a Gladiators game without the crash mats. <br /> <br /> Leaving on a junk planet, he is befriended by a community of nail space hippies who teach him about gardening, family life and, um, breasts. Kurt doesn't talk much. Eventually the really super soldiers show up and kill the hippies by shooting them in the back as they run away. Kurt gets angry and kills everyone. A planet is picked up. The end. <br /> <br /> Unless the Academy starts a new "Best Explosion" category, Soldier will not win awards. But as ridiculous as it is, it remains a pleasant experience. The military hardware is the coolest since Aliens (especially the APC) and for 90 minutes it is not happy. Please note that the item below is a guide only. Beat five points if you want to take it seriously and get one-off discounts if you don't like mini-games. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
