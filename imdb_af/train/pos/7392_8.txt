I love this movie a lot. It has a wonderful chemistry between the actors and tells a story that is fairly universal, the story of the lost son. The one thing I liked best, however, was the way the bathhouse was more than just a backdrop to the story. As the father told the boy's story of his wife's family in the northern deserts of China, the element of water and bathing became an almost holy ritual. Water was so scarce that a simple bath had deep depth and meaning. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie was very effective. However, there were moments when it went on "too". But overall, I recommend this movie.
