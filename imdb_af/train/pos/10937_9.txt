For all the hopla, respect and recognition, this film of Kung Fu historians is missing, it is still lacking in some critical areas: action and fighting scenes. But I have to say that the plot is probably the best and most original I have ever seen in a martial arts movie. Five Deadly Venoms Without a doubt is a must see, not just that, a movie you can watch again and again; But I also have to say that after watching it, you feel it could have been even better. It somehow makes you want something, you want more. The manufacturer Chang Cheh presents the storyline beautifully for a potential masterpiece, but does not follow and gives us more of the action we want. The fighting styles in the movie really hit the viewer (Centipede, Snake, Scorpio, Lizard, Toad) and they are shown, but battles are noticeably short. The Toad and Snake styles are particularly intriguing and had to be displayed much more. Indeed, the Toad is being killed in the middle of the film. Interestingly enough with this movie, the absence of ongoing action or struggle leads to the development of a large plot. This is one of the few kung fu movies where you are really interested in the storyline and caring for the outcome. This movie has a dark and ominous tone and you are drawn into the atmosphere. Sinister weapons and torture tactics are used throughout the film and add to the movie feel. To start the movie and set up the poison class producer, Chang Cheh changes us to a grim dungeon. The final scenes are definitely good, but look dull and somehow you expected more. Yet this film is one of Shaw Brothers' best and is quite nice. My overall impression of the movie will be: The styles used by the fighters are simply shown to us and not fully displayed. Sadly, the director had the goods for something extraordinary right at his fingertips and didn't expand on them. . I'm still wondering what could have been with this movie, still one of the best though. 8 out of 10 on the scale.
