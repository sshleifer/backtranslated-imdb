It is a comedy of moral values, and sometimes there is a gentle bitterness of bitterness, but a gentle softening of all sarcasm and irony flows to a moment suddenly your heart stops and everything changes. <br /> <br /> Wonderfully written and directed, this movie is a perfect jewel, with beautiful plays by everyone. Jean-Louis Trintignant is usually chosen, and Romy Schneider is a pearl, perfect and glowing, which should not be missed. A wonderful movie !!
