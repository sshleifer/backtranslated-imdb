Una giornata particolare is a film that made brilliant use of closed spaces. It is in these dull, empty spaces that the audience sees the emotional turmoil and fascinating eruptions of Ettore Scola's two leading characters. Marcellello Mastroianni and Sophia Loren play two frustrated individuals who decide to come together for a few short moments of their lethargic life. This is the element of sadness related to the story that makes us believe that people take sides with characters near them. All the people will really feel sorry for Sophia Loren's character. All women will surely eradicate their hearts at Marcello Mastroianni's existential condition. Annealed sexualities are also one of the key issues of this dismal, sad movie. Most of the characters struggle with issues related to their own sexualities. Una giornata particolare can not be a pro gay movie, but it is well depicted that a homosexual chap mixes well with women. This is a film made by Italian director Ettore Scola a pretty good combination of fact and fiction. His idea is to show how Hitler's arrival is changing the destination of ordinary Italian people. A word about the courageous personality played wonderfully by great Marcello Mastroianni. He acts as a real man who doesn't apologize. He gladly accepts his fate and readers himself to experience the worst time of his short but meaningful life. A real masterpiece of the theater !!!
