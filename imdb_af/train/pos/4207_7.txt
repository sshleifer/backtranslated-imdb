Save McCoy (Richard Widmark) pockets Candy's (Jean Peters) purse containing an important microfiche intended for the Communist cause. She is followed by 2 federal agents waiting to push as soon as she hands over the microfiche to her contact. However, Skip puts the purse on the subway under everyone's noses and so starts a hunt for him by both police and Joey (Richard Kiley) and Candy who want the microfiche. Ship can only be found by Moe (Thelma Ritter) who sells information about criminals. It is made clear that what he has stolen switches over and that both parties want the movie, but he intends to keep a high price. This leads to Joey hunting behind him and a conflict between Joey and Jean, who fell in love with Skip. Joey has a deadline to deliver the microfiche to his boss. <br /> <br /> It's a good movie and it has a good start to get you involved right away. It's a little unrealistic how Jean Peters immediately falls in love with Widmark, but this point is needed as otherwise, why she would love Joey later. It's a good movie.
