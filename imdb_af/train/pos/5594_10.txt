Ecstasy (1933) (USA 1940) With Hedy Lamarr (as Hedy Kiesler) <br /> <br /> The world's first look at a 19-year-old Hedy Lamarr occurs in the early moments of this 1930's treasure while she across the screen in an angelic wedding dress. It was the beginning of a legendary career. It was our glorious introduction to the most beautiful woman ever to get the silver screen. <br /> <br /> This is Eva's (Lamarr) wedding day and her older husband looks unreliable in her romantic progress. She goes back to the lonely bed, and in a beautiful scene she falls over with her wedding ring as the realization of her marriage war conquers her. The man looks more interested in neatness and order than he does in love. Gustav Machaty uses beautiful camera angles and pristine shooting frame to capture Lamarr's considerable talent and beauty. With no words spoken in the early part of the film, she can understand our sympathy, our hearts and our support. This is the combination that the 1930s audiences have prepared for what they were about to see while the film unfolded. 'Ecstasy' was considered shocking for his time. Some thought it was shameful. <br /> <br /> She returns to her father's estate and divorce files. The next day she woke up with a complete sense of freedom and happiness. She should just go outside and feel the freedom of the countryside and fresh air. Eve goes for a horse riding and happens over a beautiful lake. And in one of the best-known scenes in film history, Hedy Lamarr became the first person to ever appear in a big movie. Her hair in the bush and her skinny-dip adventure in the lake were legendary scandalous. But the audiences couldn't stay away. As with many of today's movies, the controversy has made it a must-see movie. <br /> <br /> Eve's ominous adventure introduces her to an attractive young man who helps her find her horse running down her clothes. After an awkward encounter, they finally fall apart. Their first romantic rendezvous was almost as controversial as the naked scene, with its blatant waves of eroticism. However, Machaty does beautiful work in these romantic moments. Machaty creates a wonderful moment when Eva literally sinks into her new lover, with a beautiful early camera trick. <br /> <br /> It can't be overstated, the brave this action was on Lamarr's part. Many people suspected it was career murder. Instead, it gained her worldwide fame and caught eye on Louis B Mayer, who signed her for a contract with MGM. There are a few erotic moments in this movie, even against today's racial standards. It is impossible to imagine how they were received in the 1930s. Again, Machaty was very clever with his images, and left much to the imagination. But we all understand very well what we see and that is done extremely well. <br /> <br /> The encounter of Eva's former husband and her current lover may be inevitable. However, the consequences of that meeting are not. The film takes a few unexpected turns in its final act, making it a great story and a great debut on the big scene of Hedy Lamarr's film scene. <br /> <br /> I once recommend it to controversial, now easy movie and encourage you to search it out in its restored form on DVD. It's easily worth it, if only for the pleasure of seeing Hedy Lamarr. But the story is also compelling and the direction is ahead of his time. 'Ecstasy' is an unforgettable early treasure. <br /> <br /> www.tccandler.com - TC Candler's Movie Reviews !!!
