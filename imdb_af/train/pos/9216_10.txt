Stupid, Stupid, Stupid. I think Angelina Jolie is probably one of the most talented actresses today, but a movie like this is not just worth the time. She deserves better, and so does everyone in this movie. Talent is just wasted. Sorry, but I don't want to write a review. <br /> <br /> I don't give it stars *****.
