Its Hollywood-mimicking Daytiem soap operas at its best! It's the fun we never see. Great characters and good lines. Whoopi is hilarious ..... Sally Field is so over .... Gary Marshalls lines is a riot .... that's what I love for good comedies. Never be afraid to make fun of themselves !!!!!! The sets were wonderful .... wardrobe was about and the rear "Montana Morehead" was a devilish delight. Terri Hatcher as "Dr. Monica Demonico" did not have enough lines, but still fun and fun when it appears on the screen. I would like to know how the idea came up for this movie. I have never seen a cast that has so much fun making comedy work! Soapdish is a must have and I'm waiting for the DVD !!!
