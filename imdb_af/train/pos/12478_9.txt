What a beautiful heart warming television movie. The story tells of a little five-year-old girl who lost her father and finds it impossible to handle. Her mother is also very concerned. Just a miracle can relieve their unhappiness. What all viewers will realize. Samantha Mathis is brilliant as the girl's mother, as she was a nanny in Jack and Sarah, worth watching if you like both Samantha Mathis and happy; year tears fuck movies! Ellen Burstyn is, as always, a beautiful grandmother in this soft and wonderfully filmed movie. Jodelle Ferland (the little five-year-old) is charming and a most convincing young actress. The mermaid is a tribute to the milk of human friendliness, which is clearly illustrated and clearly still around us in this difficult world in which we live. "Mermaid" gives us all hope by realizing that there are many lovely people in the world with lots of love to give. James Robson Glasgow Scotland, U.K.
