It's one of those movies / pilots that, if you knew BattleStar Galactica, help it, but it's not necessary. What makes it even more credible of a story like SCR is that it's not so far in the future. It has such a depth that it is very surprising that it has not been released theater. The leaders could not be better selected in such experienced and reasonably talented actors. Eric Stoltz is wonderful as the father who does everything to reconnect with his daughter, but really whether or not she is and he will do it, no matter what the cost. Paula Malcomson of "Deadwood" fame is also wonderful as his wife. You don't quite know his motives whether it is love or money or both, but it makes this pilot even more intriguing. I see a star in making Zoe played by the relatively unknown Alessandra Torresani and her show. Esai Morales is terrific in his desire to once again see his beloved again and just how wrong to even consider what he wants more than his moral objections. I didn't think it would be a good idea for it to be announced, but from the pilot alone I was excited to see how we got to the SCR stage story. It is wonderful to see Adama as a child who is already affected and influenced by the different types of robots that are beginning to penetrate life at this stage. I just hope they can keep up the stories so we can find out more about how they got the Humanoid typed robots. It's an almost perfect pilot and I hope they can keep up with the fantastic storytelling. Even the visual effects are better than most of the garbage you see on the big screen. If you didn't get in BSG, @ try the least, and I'll bet you're a fan and want to see how the SCR story came.
