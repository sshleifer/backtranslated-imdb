Made by French brothers Jules and Giddeon Naudet, told by Robert De Niro and Fireman James Hanlon, this is a compelling and heartbreaking story of how New York's best has the darkest day. I only saw it when I was a young naive who was 12 years old and at that age still touched me. To know how serious 9/11 really sees it, the whole effect of 9/11 has expanded. We found out who the heroes were, how everyday lives were composed, and how they put their lives on the line in a situation where most people would just run and save themselves. These brave men have put their lives on the line and it just looks to increase my admiration for them. See if you can, it's the best documentary I've ever seen.
