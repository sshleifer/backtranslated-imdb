In my opinion, this is a good example of the movie that could have been much better if it was short ten years ago. I doubt it would benefit from modern technology, but it would look better if it was at least 90 minutes instead of 70. <br /> <br /> The artists and animators have done a good job. In my opinion, this movie boasts the best background art and one of the best character designs. Animation is extremely smooth and realistic. For the duration of the movie you believe in the world you see, everyone has done a good job. It also boasts one of the sexiest female animated characters, if not the sexiest, who is comfortably comfortable with anime girls. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there are a few bad ones about this movie that won't make it. so tempting at the moment. First, the plot and performance are comparable to contemporary adventure movies, and are actually old-fashioned with modern standards. Secondly, due to the duration, it will greatly benefit from extra 20 minute dialogues. Finally, the institution is not so popular at present. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: A good alternative to another short story about Conan the Barbarian, but not to a novel.
