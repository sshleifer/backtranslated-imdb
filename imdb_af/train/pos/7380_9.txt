The three main characters are portrayed very well, especially Anisio by rock musician, who first changed actor Paulo Miklos. He is extremely convincing as the lower class breaker / intruder. The film shows very well how the snowball effect engages in increasingly shady issues, the contrast and similarities between the lower and higher classes. How everyone is taken away by greed and ambition. 9-9.5 out of 10.
