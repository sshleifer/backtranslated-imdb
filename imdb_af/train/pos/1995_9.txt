I saw it recently, after an interval of nearly forty years. It does well, especially Lionel Bart's outstanding songs. ("Who will buy" with his magical counterpoint, just one of the many standouts.) <br /> <br /> I disagree with the other post that forfeited its G rating. The classification system, brand new at the time, never meant that the G (General) rating meant "completely without conflict". <br /> <br /> Reminding me of this as inappropriate for children reminds me of the description I once saw The Wizard of Oz: A girl comes in a foreign country and kills the first person she meet. She then goes with three male companions and dies again.
