Jammin 'the Blues is an Oscar nominated short of 1944 that basically plays 10 minutes of improvisational jazz in a long jam. Marie Bryant sings "The Sunny Side of the Street" at one point for the movie's highlight, and then it's jitterbugs with Archie Savage to bring this most exciting "jam session" to its thrilling end. Director Gojn Mili was a photographer and shows the experience in some of the double exposure shots of some musicians who make this one of the innovative corners of the 40's. According to some notes I read one of the musicians was white and had to be filmed in silhouette because of the social attitudes of the time. What a pity. Yet, this most unusual movie of the time is available on YouTube, so if you love jazz, I suggest you find it there.
