I started looking at The Apprentice about 4 years ago (maybe 5) and I really enjoyed it. The first thing that strikes you about it is the refreshing format, which is similar to many other reality displays in its core, is still very entertaining. Donald Trump is also wonderful as the host and chief judge of the show. The decisive coup with intelligent people with good looks who are chosen as participants is also appreciated. But the best part of the show is New York. Mark Burnett may have made a lot of shit in his time, but his handling of cinematography is excellent, as he looks NYC like himself. The jazz songs, along with some fantastic camera work, make New York extremely spectacular. <br /> <br /> The pupil will easily make my best 3 reality shows of all time. (The Amazing Race, however, is No. 1). But just like the incredible race, this show is always best viewed in moderation. If you keep watching it for a while, the originality of the display will be fast (the same as with TAR). Star World, the broadcasters in this country, made an effort to present the show. The first three seasons were shown in a row, and then after 2 years the next two seasons were shown, keeping the concept fresh. <br /> <br /> Finally, you'll love this show, especially the first 2 seasons. But if you constantly look at the performance, then its charm will be faster and faster.
