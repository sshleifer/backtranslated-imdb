I'm surprised no one has mentioned that there are two versions of the same movie. The lion's share of the footage in both is identical, but here's where they differ. In one version (the version I saw the most on broadcast TV), the group of clerics guarding the gate consists of the "Fraternity of the Guardians", a (fictional) cluster of priests and brothers who the Church is wiped out. In the other version, which I only saw on TV once, the clerics guarding the gate are portrayed as priests of the official Church, meaning the Archdiocese of New York (or perhaps Brooklyn). Also in the previous version, the clerics are referred to in most of the relevant scenes as "brothers" (and in some scenes you can see where the lips so and so say, but the sound of the sounds says "Brother" so-and-so) In the latter version, I believe that everyone is referred to as "Father". <br /> <br /> In any case, it appears that one of these two versions is more or less a partial shot of the other, with all screens of the "Brotherhood of the Protector" shot again as "Archdiocese" scenes, or vice versa. (Kind of reminds me of Raymond Burr screens in Godzilla) versions of TV broadcast, so no, I imagine. shed more light on the story behind these two versions of the movie?
