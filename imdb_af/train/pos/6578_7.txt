Ironically for a play not so long available, ARMS AND THE MAN has been fairly available since the debut in 1894 on stage since its debut in 1894. It's not as old as it is, as it is as good as a solid satire on the nature of heroism and the affairs of war. When the world is in doubt, ARMS and MAN seem increasingly timely and relevant. <br /> <br /> It's the play that Oscar Strauss has transformed (leaving most of Shaw's best ideas) into the successful operetta, THE CHOCOLATE SOLDIER (when Hollywood reached it, * they have the last remnants of Shaw left out rather than paying for the rights - he was an Oscar winner in his own right at the time. While the best of Shaw has always been his ideas and dialogue, rather than his mere plots, in ARMS AND THE MAN, the plot is so fine and the master manages happy ends for everyone involved. <br /> <br /> Young Raina (Helena Bonham Carter), daughter of an officer and the richest man in her town, was caught in the Bulgarian cavalry and it looks good to a fraudulent Swiss mercenary (Pip Torrens) of the other side climbs onto her drainage pipe which flies out of battle where his army is turned away. As is usually the case in a Shaw satire, nothing like it first occurs and community conventions are on the head in light of simple - and not so simple reason. There are no "good guys" or "bad guys", only people of different classes get the best of their minds - just as life is better - and of course with Shaw, the white is fine of all stakeholders. br /> The early (1932) movie version (from Shaw's own screenplay) of this most traditional and traditionally funny of Shaw's stage satires, and one of his first to hit a real hit on this side of the Atlantic Ocean, has long been among the missing. Shaw did not sell the screen rights to his plays - they only licensed for five years and it appears that with the rapidly changing sound technology that 1932 movies just a few years later look like, Shaw did not renew the license to show it not. As a result, we are tremendously blamed by the BBC to finally run their 1987 broadcast version in a DVD box with nine other brilliant plays. (Sometimes, PYGMALION, which is widely regarded as Shaw's best, is well on this set in a production featuring Lynn Redgrave and James Villiers.) <br /> <br /> Even paired, as it is on the DVD, with Die less impressive one action, a MAN OF DESTINY, ARMS AND THE MAN, make for a real treasure. <br /> <br /> Helena Bonham Carter continued after she cut her teeth on television roles after a big movie career. This will bring many viewers to this early role. They should not be disappointed because Mrs. Carter gives a show in line with the low innocent audiences expected of her, but under James Cellan Jones' somewhat pedestrian direction (and despite the BBC's uniformly beautiful and well-observed physical production) The role of the ominous fire (and her indignation to be underestimated in the last law) is blocked at only about 80% of its potential. <br /> <br /> Much the same can be said of the true star of the piece, Pip Torrens, as Bluntschli the "Switzer." It is a fine, attractive show but doesn't imply in the early stage, but the young soldier can hardly stay awake despite his death. <br /> <br /> These discussions are despite the fact that it is a solid production of a wonderful play that is transferred to the small screen with the aplomb. It deserves to be widely spotted, and ideally, quickly create an even-live big screen with the style and senses of the recent remake of Wilde's AN IDEAL HUSBAND. Almost any * ARMS and the man should be cherished, and with luck we might even see the original 1932 version. 'To some surface this production will please anyone who loves good Shaw.
