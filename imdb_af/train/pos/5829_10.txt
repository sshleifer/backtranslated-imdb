It's one of my two or three favorite Stooges shorts, and undoubtedly Christine McIntyre's best performance with the trio. She is good at a number of other shorts, but here she is absolutely brilliant. Her song is not funny at all, it's actually pretty, but the plot is so constructed that the song improves the humor rather than harms it. We listen to McIntyre singing the whole Voice of Spring not less than three times, but it never gets old, partly because we don't tire of her voice, and partly because it mixes so well with the Stooges antics. The use of operational soprano in a comedy reminds Kitty Carlisle's role in the Marx brothers' A Night at The Opera, but the song is much more part of the comedy than in Opera, and McIntyre (perhaps more in other performances than here) has a comic talent of her own that Carlisle never did. The Stooges buffoon, McIntyre's song and a well-composed plot combine for 5 out of 5 stars.
