For a movie that had little publicity, and few people heard, it was pretty good. This is yet another of these contemporary British crime films that are weird ("Snatch," "Sexy Beast", etc.). It's not wild like 'Snatch', but it's interesting and it has some rough characters. <br /> <br /> It also has a wavy and somewhat predictable end but early in the show - not late - it has been neat to make it very interesting for the first time viewer. Actually, it's about a low-key British man who sends away a Russian "mail-order bride" who excels with two Russian male friends, who offer some great surprises. <br /> <br /> Ben Chapin and Nicole Kidman co-star, and are great as Vincent Cassel and Matthieu Kassovitz as Kidman's Russian cohorts. It's a different kind of movie and well done. Kidman proves she is much more than just a beautiful face.
