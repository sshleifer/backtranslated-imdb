I totally disagree with the other comments posted on this movie. For example, the movie is based on the book and if the author had a gay character in it, how can 'Hollywood' just throw a token gay character in the movie. And besides, there were two gay characters and I thought they reflected each other largely. One was normal and the other was more feminine, but it was not over. And Diane Keaton donated a wonderful performance and if the other reviewer had the thoroughness to watch the whole movie actively, they would have seen that her character was developed by the movie by interacting with the other characters. For example, when she and Adam looked at the car when Sara crashed into the junk, you could see the mother's side coming out of her and later in the movie you saw that she was also invincible. But I think if you're too worried about gay characters and characters that are faulty then this movie is bad. But if you're more open-minded and I don't really know a bit of what's good, you'll enjoy this movie.
