If you're a fan of Altman's great ensemble casts, as evidenced by great movies such as M.A.H., Nashville, Gosford Park, and lesser-known movies like a wedding, then surely you'll be entertained by HealtH. Based on a health agreement where two women run for president, HealtH contains many of Altman's latter 70-year-olds, such as Paul Dooley (who helped the movie), Carol Burnett and Henry Gibson, while also Altman newcomers like Lauren Bacall, James Garner, and Glenda Jackson. Like many Altman ensemble movies, there are many subplots in this movie, but it's not nearly as overwhelming as films like Nashville or a wedding, but rather a centering feeling, perhaps like M.A.S.H. or Gosford Park. The whole thing is a clear satire on the health movement, filled with exaggerated, outrageous, contradictory characters, with guest stars like Dick Cavett commenting on the whole thing. Underlining the entire election process, Altman's distinctive pessimism about politics and public appeal, but what is most appealing about this film, is the fun that most people look. It would be one of Altman's latest movies like this!
