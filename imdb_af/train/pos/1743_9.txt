Having seen many Greek movies, I feel very suspicious of most of them. But after watching it, I was surprised. The movies are good without a big test. You can't claim that the script is so great or photography is perfect or something technical. This is a true story and it happens in Greek rural areas in forgotten places of God. The movie is like a punch in the stomach and I really wish things were not so. Of course it talks about the strangers hate the Greek people (the ignorance) for anything else. The problem with this man is not that he has been found ex-convicted. The problem is that he is not one of these people. He is different and they do not want them (therefore all the good things he does to him are boomerang). And also talk about the apathy of the people, because there are some who are against the hunt of the King, but they dare not express their opinion. Ultimately, you can clearly see that the hypocrisy of society is religious and tries to act as God says, but at the same time acts so unfairly to the King. It shows how easily people rationalize their feelings or beliefs according to the established system. Ultimately you can have a positive lesson from this very bad story, which means that you can only understand and be part of this society if you want to become one of them. If you want to stay different and even alone, you are lost (and this is not far from reality). I think it is tragic that the story is real and it must be a clock for everyone. No comment for the main actor because he has already received an award and I believe his play was great. Little comment for Hatzisavvas (playing the policeman), he is like a dinosaur, he played a lot of roles and I'm sure this role was very easy for him, but he plays so well you can't make him a big bravo deny. . I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a good Greek movie.
