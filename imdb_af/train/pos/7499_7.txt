But it's a bit hilarious, at least if you've grown up on Weird Al, as I did. It's a mockery of his life and career, starting with superstars and going back to track the origins. It is uneven in places, but some of the segments are still very funny, especially when traveling to Japan. Although not quite as emotionally textured as Lost Translation, and he does not find love fleeting, in a bottle he takes the absolutely bizarre cultural blend that is Tokyo's street life. <br /> <br /> Maybe Weird Al is not recognized as the informative cultural commentator he is; Maybe a rose with any other name will smell just as nice. Still, it's a funny movie.
