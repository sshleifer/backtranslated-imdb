I love this movie a lot. It really made me wonder how Deanna and Alicia became friends about such a tragedy. Alicia was just a troubled soul and Deanna was so happy to see anyone after being shot. My only complaint was that it was initially slow, and it took a while to get the base. Other than that, it was wonderful.
