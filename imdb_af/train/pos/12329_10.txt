Before you look, please make sure you've seen Night of the Living Dead ... It might be the best 7 minute parody I've ever seen! Absurd, crazy 'special effects' (the rope, the rope !!!), and cut slices of bread ... what more do you need ??? <br /> <br /> (Don't see this movie while you're not eating bread ... you may be scared!)
