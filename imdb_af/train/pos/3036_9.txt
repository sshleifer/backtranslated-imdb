Name just says it all. I watched this movie with my dad when it came out and served in Korea, he had great admiration for the man. The disappointing thing about this movie is that it only concentrates on the man's life in a short time. Interestingly, the whole human life would have made such an epic bio-picture that it is surprising to imagine the cost of production. <br /> <br /> Some posters evoke the malfunctioning of the man, which is inexpensive shots. The theme of the movie "Duty, Honor, Country" is not just mere words blown out of the lips of a high-blooded official. This is the deep explanation of one man's total commitment to his country. <br /> <br /> Ironically, Peck is the liberals that he gained a better understanding of the man. He did a good job tempering the fearless general with the human side of the man.
