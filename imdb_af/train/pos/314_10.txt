This show is a good story story. It has everything from slavery, the way they are treated, religion, the way Jews are rejected, the inquisition, the belief in the Orisha African gods, the way women are treated, including the girls. Even to homosexuality. The way the characters are interwoven and that Violante, that character, makes me sad. She is so desperate to be loved that she destroys all around her. I'm so glad they decided to abandon it again. again. Although I like to see the unedited version. Xica became my heroine. I look at the way she uses her power to help anyone looking for it. I love all the characters and have found that they can now connect with many people in this century. Every night I look forward to my Xica. It would be great to link it in English so that the Americans can also love her.
