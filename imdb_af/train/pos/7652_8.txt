The acting - fantastic. The story - wonderful. The script wonderful. <br /> <br /> Just a few ways to describe this movie. Yes it is slow and it mostly speaks, but the whole story of all their lives and how it is told with the flashbacks that are thrown in and out, lets you listen to every thing to learn more about this haunting and tragic story. I read the book on which the movie is based and it showed me even more light in this story and answered questions left unanswered in the movie. I also read the Exectioner's Song, which is the "other" half of the Gilmore story. This movie made me think so much about the phrase "saucer on the other side of the sight glass". You hear a song in the movie called Gary Gilmore's Eyes, which is by a punk band that wrote a song about how it would be to have Gary Gilmore's eyes (which is one of the things that Gary as a transplant when he died) and as you listen to it, after the last time Mikal ever sees Gary, you look the whole situation a little different if you were just the song here. This movie opened my eyes that way and in many others. I highly recommend this movie (and the book).
