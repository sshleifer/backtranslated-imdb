Daniell Steel's Daddy, which is a refreshing story. This film glorifies the importance of the family and the importance of parents in the lives of their children. How rare is this? In these times of "Heather has two Mommies" (or anyway, you fill in the spaces). It's easy to see why this theme isn't for everyone. With the father's roles prominent, I hoped it would be another Daniell Steel Saga. How disappointing to end it. Each character was important and did a wonderful job. I would like to see every character developed over the years. I loved this movie, it's one I will see every time. Good story, good acting, and I hope it's not a devastator, but no striking sex or bad language. Yes, it touched my heart. Warning, get the Kleenex ready. What I find sad is that this side of family life is rarely portrayed in our entertainment, whether it be Television or. Movies. Daniell if you listen, you go girl, give us more.
