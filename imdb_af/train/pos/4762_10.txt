I thought "The River of Souls" was a very good Babylon 5 movie, with exceptional performances by Martin Sheen, Tracy Scoggins and Ian MacShane. If it was an episode of the series (without the humor), it would probably be one of my favorite stand-alone stories of the series. <br /> <br /> Personally, I always preferred Scoggins to Christians, although neither did JMS write to many of the series and she had to endure the Byron / Telepath plot. If you take out the bad humor about the brothel and the "poorer" actors in those scenes, then this movie is solid stuff. Probably my third favorite of the four movies, but not bad at all.
