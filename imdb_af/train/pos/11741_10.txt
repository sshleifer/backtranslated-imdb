This soft, beautifully crafted production has been deeply bitter in my essence. The inexperienced pupils, the banned bus driver and the teaching staff offer a subliminal debate as the story reveals. The adult characters are all familiar, my teachers, my bus driver, each of their opinions is so plausible and familiar. When a key incident occurs on the bus, we are sent to a circle of vantage points. All the time the chatter of teenage energy is only controlled by the organizers of the trip. Mr Harvey is experiencing great pain. He reminds me of war damage teachers I didn't understand when I was an inexorable student. <br /> <br /> Rhidian Brook and the producers deserve a lot of praise for this well-formed British film. The acting illiterate, the screens that are appropriate, should be widely available, but do not seem to be the right opportunity.
