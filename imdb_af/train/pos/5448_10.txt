This movie is probably my favorite movie of all time. Miriam Flynn is excellent as Bunny Packard. Zane Buzby as Delores is comic genius. The rest of the movie is great, and the movie is really funny. A definite satire of horror movies, with a zany twist. If you enjoy a fun, adventurous evening, go for this classic rental. You will pass all the way!
