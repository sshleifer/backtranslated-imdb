Vivah is by no means a classic. But in the days of hardcore action, groundbreaking special effects and complex plots (of which Bollywood hasn't yet mastered), it's quite refreshing to see a simple movie like Vivah. The story we all know is a journey from a couple's first meeting to their eventual wedding after some fine moments and test times. Nothing more, nothing less. The music is not quite in the same league as MPK or HAHK, but also not your senses. Two songs stood out for me - Mujhe Haq Hai & Do Anjaane. While Milan was abhi aadha & Hamaari shaadi hummable. Shahid sincerely performs and shows great potential. It's good to see him play, unlike the "cool man" he usually does. Amrita is very sweet and plays the role of a brave little town girl to perfection. Alok Nath, Anupam Kher & Seema Biswas are wonderful supporters and the rest of the team do a reasonable job. Suraj's direction is simple but effective. The movie's biggest mistake is the slow pace that can test the patience of many young viewers. But all in all, a good, clean, decent family movie.
