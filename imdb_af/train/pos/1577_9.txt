SPOILERS INSIDE. <br /> <br /> It seems that von Trotta was much more at ease with the balance of personal story versus the history of events than in her previous film Versprechen, Das (1995). /> <br /> The direction looks carefully controlled, and I visually felt that it was very attractive - especially where the visual narrative was involved (the title collection and the illumination of a new candle in modern times that killed various characters have remembered in the past). <br /> <br /> To explain two points that many people have been confused with: <br /> <br /> First, Lena didn't sleep with Goebbels. Although it may have been considered, it was not the intention. Von Trotta told me so myself! (And she's a very good lady, incidentally!) <br /> <br /> Secondly, the timeframe of events was actually historically accurate (the actual dates are shown on the density of the memorial) and the prisoners are so sudden released as in the movie. There is evidence that Goebbels has hurt to do so and has planned to eventually recover those he has released. <br /> <br /> Overall, who impressed me most, was that it was an original story of a very 'obsolete' era. It is a pity that it took so long (for several reasons) for this movie to hit our screens. <br /> <br /> More the same, please, Margarethe!
