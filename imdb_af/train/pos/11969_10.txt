I loved this show and today I watch the first season DVD at the age of 19. What can I say? I grew up in a house, like the one at Full House. I had a father, two sisters and a dog. I think the only difference was that I didn't have my best friend with my uncle and my dad. Also, I grew up with my mother in the house. I don't know what to do without Full House on television. I think Stephanie (played by Jodie Sweetin), D.J. (played by Kirk Cameron's sister Candace), and Michelle (played by Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen) are my favorite characters. I can relate to everyone, because I'm the middle child of my family like Steph, I'm a younger sister like Michelle, and I'm an older sister like D.J. I really like how the show always has moral values, because I don't really like any of the O.C performances today. I also like the comedy of Full House. Uncle Jesse (John Stamos), Joey (Dave Coulier) and Danny (Bob Saget) are hilarious as the girl's uncle, father's friend and father. The story is that, after the girls' mother dies, Danny's best friend, Joey and his son-in-law, enter Jesse to help raise the children. Three men try to erect three young girls = hilarious. Every character at Full House is full of heart, funny and truly credible. Joey is an aspiring comedian with a child's heart and soul. Jesse is the cool, biking, cute uncle who is softened by his three cousins, and later his wife Becky (Laurie Laughlin, of Summerville). Both children and adults will love this show. Guaranteed.
