If you like film, don't miss this one. If you prefer action, or horror, or romance, then you will wonder what is going on. Everyone here stuck in a gangster movie. And what happens is transcendental murder. <br /> <br /> There are few similar films. No doubt, it will see a limited release and be hard to find. But the search will be worth it. If you want to study a mule as a potential symbol, it is indeed a film to study. <br /> <br /> You can't see it once. If you do, you'll never see what happens. Dark City is better. Joe Vrs. The volcano is more fun. But Mad Dog Time can turn the gangsta crowd into symbolism. . . Think at least twice before shooting again.
