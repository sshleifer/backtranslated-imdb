This very strange film is different from what was made in the west at the time. With its turbulent emotions and only visions, dreams and surprising images, its effect is beautiful and disturbing. The actors are choreographed more like dance as choreography. It contains the only dream sequence I know of what actually looks like a real nightmare (sorry, Dali fans).
