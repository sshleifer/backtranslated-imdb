The Scots perform at storytelling. The traditional kind. Many years after the event I can still see an elderly lady, my friend's mother, in the battle of the Battle of Culloden. She makes the characters alive. Her passion is that of an eyewitness. One of the events on the bare heath, a mile or so from where she lives. <br /> <br /> Of course, it happened many years before her birth, but you won't guess as she tells you. The same story is told in the size and length of Scotland. As I booked with a friend in Mallaig one night, he had a local entry to give his version. The discussion continued until closing time. <br /> <br /> Stories that are so transmitted become part of our being. Who doesn't remember the stories our parents told us when we were kids? They become our invisible world. And as we get older, they may still serve as inspiration or as an emotional reservoir. Fact and fiction blend with aspiration, role models. Warning stories. Archetypes. Magic and mystery. <br /> <br /> "My name is Aonghas, like my grandfather and his grandfather before him." Our protagonist introduces himself. And also introduce the story that is being withdrawn by generations. It produces stories within stories. Stories calling on the impenetrable wonder of Scotland shrouded its rugged mountains in villages. The legend of the legend. Yet Seach'd is rooted in reality. It gives it its particular charm. It has a rough beauty and authenticity, tempered with some of the best Gaelic songs you'll ever hear. <br /> <br /> Aonghas (Angus) visits his grandfather shortly before his death in hospital. He burns with frustration. Part of him wants to be in Glasgow in the twenty-first century. But he is on the western coast under a Gaelic-speaking community. <br /> <br /> Yet there is a deeper conflict within him. He longs to know the truth. The truth behind his grandfather's ancient stories. Where does fiction end? And he wants to know the truth behind the death of his parents. <br /> <br /> He is drawn to make a last fateful journey to the top of one of Scotland's most inaccessible mountains. Can the truth be told? Or is it all in stories? <br /> <br /> In this story about stories, we look back at bloody battles, poison lovers, the folklore of the old and the sometimes more treacherous census of accepted truth. Hereby we each connect with Angus, as he lives the story of his own life. <br /> <br /> Seen: The Inaccessible Pinnacle is probably the most honest, unpretentious and truly beautiful film ever made in Scotland. Like Angus, I was a little annoyed with the excuse to hang stories about stories. But, like Angus, I forgave it if I saw the 'bigger picture'. Forget the cash office of Braveheart and its will. You can even leave the just famous dramatization of The Wicker Man. To see a movie that is true in Scotland, this one is probably unique. If you may meditate well enough, you can even reconsider the power of storytelling, and the age-old question is whether there are truths that cannot be told but only experienced.
