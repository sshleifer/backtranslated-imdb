Big Woody Allen? No, good Woody Allen? Definitely. I had myself, with the audience, laughed loudly and regularly at some of the best Woody Allen lines we've heard for a while.

She plays Woody's dialogue, which in his comedies always felt a very similar one. Like a Woody Allen comedy. It's good for our Woody observers. She definitely did Woody's dialogue better than the young movie From his latest comedy, Melinda / Melinda, some may find Woody's humor exhausting, but for those of us who like it right, we look forward to the next.
