Definitely one of the best movies I've seen for some time. Beautiful direction and flawless acting make it a very entertaining and often moving movie. To date, Denzel Washington plays one of his most engaging and emotional roles and plays the rest of the role beautifully. Of course, Christopher Walken is wonderful in his part, though he hasn't appeared as often as I would have liked. A story of ultimate greed that goes back is offset against a child's innocence and love. It is also a movie for action movie lovers, as it has its fair share of bullets, rockets and revenge. The location of Mexico City adds a sense of boredom and corruption that is in itself an eye-catcher. All in all, a really enjoyable movie from start to finish. Highly recommended!
