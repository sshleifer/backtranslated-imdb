The original DeMille film was made in 1938 with Frederic March. A very good movie indeed. Hollywood's love for remake brings us a pretty interesting movie with Yul Brynner. Of course, he was brilliant because he was almost always in all his movies. Charlton Heston as Andrew Jackson was a stroke of genius. The movie, however, tends to get a bit long in places. It does not move against the pace of the 1938 version. Yet it is a fun movie to be seen at least once.
