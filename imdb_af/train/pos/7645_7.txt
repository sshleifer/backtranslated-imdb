Belushi at his most impressive and Courtney Cox for Friends has a small role. I think Belushi is often used under Hollywood and this movie reel is one of his best. For those watching his TV show, it's a very different and similar character. The movie itself is not an earthquake, and the message is not new, but rather sweet and engaging. The supportive company of well-known faces and unknown names is a perfect balance, although Lovitz's groans can be tiring, and Michael Caine's beautiful spiritual guide has a slightly sinister as non-significant edge. Hamilton, if Belushi's wife is unfortunately two-dimensional and one wonder why he married her. In addition, Renee Russo was wasted and not very convincing at the prom queen who got away. Nonetheless, a nice way to spend two hours.
