The show is about two sisters living together. Holly is the youngest one has teenage problems on the other hand her sister Val has been working, son friend, fiance problems like most women on the planet. They try to support each other, they sometimes make mistakes, but they do not give up and continue. And the show is also about friendship. The priorities in life. I loved this show so much. It's funny and the actors are so good. I'm very sad that the show is over. I still look at the reserves :) Amanda Bynes is very talented. Jenny Garth can be new to comedy, but she plays very well. She is one of the actresses I love to watch. I love Vince and Holly's relationship, they are very natural. Gary is a natural talent and lets you laugh every time he acts. With Tina Holly found a real friend and I really like them to hang out. Lauren's character is so funny and she's a natural talent. I'd like to see her more. This show really takes you in and lets you laugh. I wish the show wasn't over.
