Valued R for strong language, violent content and a little nudity. Quebec Rating: 13+ Canadian Home Video Rating: 14A <br /> Fear of a black hat is one of the funniest, most original comedies I've ever seen. It's basically a gangsta rap version of the movie This Is Spinal Tik. It is a pity that not many people have heard of this jewel of a movie. If you can get this movie, don't hesitate to buy it, even if you don't like rap music. There aren't too many comedy movies that I give a perfect 10/10. The only thing I can think of now is this movie, Clerks, The World According to Garp, The 40-year-old Virgin and Chasing Amy. This film is a hilarious stereotype of the gangsta rap culture. The film is about a woman named Nina Blackburn, who makes a documentary about the fictitious rap group NWH (N **** z with hats). They are basically the stereotype of a rap group that makes many controversial rap songs about murder and being a gangsta. Fear of a black hat is an excellent comic movie and I even recommend it if you are not a fan of the gangsta rap scene. It is a pity that this movie is not in the Top 250. <br /> <br /> Roundtime: 88min <br /> <br /> 10/10
