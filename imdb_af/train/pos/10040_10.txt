For me personally, this movie will be in my top four of all time. No exceptions. James Cameron has repeatedly proved that he is a master storyteller. Through films such as Aliens, The Abyss and Both Terminators, it is clear that he was a brilliant and trusted director of action and science fiction. He sees a story and adds a strange quality to the film. But Titanic is so different from his other pursuit of brilliance. The film has been particularly moved and offers space for surprises, plot development and interesting character developments in a story everyone knows. The story of the famous voyager who sits on her maiden voyage is legend, so Cameron's challenge was to make a truthful, interesting and entertaining movie about it. The play is wonderful as Leonardo DiCaprio who plays Jack and Kate Winslet who play Rose, became superstars overnight with the release of this movie and in most movies I am annoyed if the supporting characters are not much given, but in this movie is It is more purposeful because, as an elderly Rose (Gloria Stuart) tells her story, it's quickly clear that it's Rose's and Jack's story alone, nobody else. Emotionally, it is completely satisfactory and cannot leave a dry eye in a theater or home. The music has become iconic and legendary. This is the best soundtrack of composer James Horner ever and calls so much from the film and the audience. The song after so long has become annoying, but I still appreciate it for the phenomenon it is and this movie is. Only one problem, the ordinary James Cameron problem, is the unforgettable dialogue, but in a bad way, as in how cute it is at points, but everything that sets aside. James Cameron delivered a masterpiece and a romantic epic that took you on a journey of a lifetime. My heart will not continue from this one.
