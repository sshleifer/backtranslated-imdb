Cuban Blood is one of those sleep movies that has a very traditional way to say about life. I actually watched it as I sailed in Cuba on a western Caribbean sea. It describes the life of an 11-year-old boy in a small town in Cuba in 1958 and 1959 during the revolution. There is not much time spent on the revolution until the end of the Socialist regime and taking possession of the boy's father. The majority of the film is the boy's age and the relationships that arise in a small town, where everyone knows. There are some powerful scenes that everyone can link to. A Class A movie with fine acting and directing. This is a movie that tells a story without special effects or big schemes or real twists. It's a movie about people and their lives, their mistakes and their victories. A good movie is worth watching several times a year.
