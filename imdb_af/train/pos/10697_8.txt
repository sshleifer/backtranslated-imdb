Modern, original, romantic story. <br /> <br /> Very good acting from both Nicole Kidman and Ben Chaplin. <br /> <br /> Miss. Kidman does a good job of imitating a Russian accent. Ben Chaplin is also good as the shy, dull clerk. For the men (and some women): Miss Kidman looks great and is very sympathetic. I forgot what a beautiful woman she is. It's not hard to think that John falls in love with her. Some unexpected turns in the story are good for the tension. Although I was hoping for a happy ending, the last part of the movie was a surprise to me. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Good movie. <br /> <br /> Les Pays-Bas: hot spots.
