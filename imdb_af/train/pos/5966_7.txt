Actually, I never bought in the metal was satanic and stuff, but this movie kind of played on the idea. Although it is definitely not a movie to take seriously or to upgrade very high, it serves its purpose by entertaining while it is playing. The story has a metal band set alight in their hotel, one of their supporters has a dream in this regard and said the band started on a death buoy from outside the grave. So yes, a bit of the "Nightmare on Elm Street" plot going on here. Granted Freddy has never molested a girl in a car. There was another movie with a heavy metal band in it, but it was very different in how it played, as it had a band that took over such children and made them crazy. This one simply has one fan of the band who initially tried to stop the killer spirit initially. Nothing to be horrible in there, because I don't remember everything that kills a lot of gory. Honestly, the scene I remember most is the scene of the girl wearing the headphones and being molested by some of the band's creature incarnation. Nothing good, but a nice time filler.
