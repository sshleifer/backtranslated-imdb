This is the best indication of what I think Jesus really was. Most movies show jesus effect, lobotomized, or tortured. This Jesus laughed, played, and was serious when needed. it is the kind of jesus that can be attracted to people, not the ordinary Hollywood version. <br /> <br /> The movie took some freedoms and tried to fill the spaces. but the fillers do not seem impossible, or even unlikely. One thing I could argue was that it never really explained what the Romans had against Jesus (film depicted that the Romans were the general manager of Jesus' death, not that the Jewish authorities were against the idea). <br /> <br /> It seems the movie has been well researched. One example was the remarkable comment of a teenager called "brand". It is believed that the mark (or John Mark) is called the boy at the garden of Gethsemane, whose robe was pulled down and ran naked (paragraph 14:51). I get the feeling they were trying to make the movie so accurate (even in the spirit), was very possible.
