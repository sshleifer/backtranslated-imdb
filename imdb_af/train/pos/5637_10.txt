I just want to say I've seen this movie twice and I love it! The acting is wonderful and although it is a similar plot to increase your voice. I think the plot never gets boring for people who want such things. It has some good lessons in it and shows us that we can do anything when we try. An amazing movie. I'm sure this is one I will look for for a long time to come. Although Britney Spears writes the book, it is quite a realistic plot, perhaps not in love, but the part of being different and struggling, but ultimately the best, is true for real life. The only small criticism is why is the main girl in these movies always beautiful? Do you really think Holly would have met the perfect guy of her dreams if she was ugly or average? I doubt it.
