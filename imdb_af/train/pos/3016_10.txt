For those who love their murder mysteries, it is definitely the one to watch, as it is very full of interesting and suspicious characters. Most of them are rich in Long Island socialite. As the star detective, William Powell is alternately starchy and inspired, sometimes behaving as if he and his suit are going to the cleaners and being pushed together. Mary Astor loves it very much. <br /> <br /> Powell has made a career of playing the main character, Philo Vance, in a series of movies made over a few studios at some studios. Between these films, he developed into a somewhat extravagant romantic lead, sometimes even gentleman's gangster roles. Already in the middle age, he held a little of a career, by the time this one came together. As with so many early talkie stars, it seemed that his time had come and gone, that he was good for the early Depression prohibition-era films, but with changing times he might be too mature and dandyish to endure. <br /> <The Kennel Murder case, led by criminal neglected Michael Curtiz, is one of the last of the "old Powells", while next year the first of the new The Thin Man would be his leading players in the Hollywood stratosphere catapulted. In Kennel we can still see the movies in a somewhat tight ritualized pattern, as the camera does not move much, with the play, like the performance, to the theater. However, there is no harm in this approach, which she has charmed. It gives the film a baroque quality.
