It helps if you understand Czech and can see it in the original language and understand the Czech obsession with 'The Professionals', but if not, 'Jedna ruka netlaska' is another good Czech movie. It is funny, dark and extremely enjoyable. The highest compliment I can pay is that you never know what will happen next and even feel good in the second and third performances. <br /> <br /> For a small country, the Czech Republic has an incredible amount of world-class film and literature, from Hrabal, Hasek and Kundera to the films of Menzel, Sverak and many others. Czech humor by its very nature is dark and often uncompromising, but often with a naive and warm sentiment behind it. This film is the same, it is ignorant and deals with the less sweet sides of people, but there is a beautiful story full of promise, good intent and optimism. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it and most other projects are Trojan and Machacek involved. Enjoy it, it's a movie made for that reason - anyway, it's as close as the Czech will ever come to writing a truly happy ending.
