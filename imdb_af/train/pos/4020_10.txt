Pinjar by Mr dwivedi is a wonderful movie. It's definitely the roughest and best of 2003. There are many good achievements in it. Dwivedi knows what he can withdraw from MAST Urmila. she's been like you've never seen before. a great show. with her is a good actor Manoj bajpai, who showed Bollywood what he is with Bhiku Mhatre. The movie is about a girl (Urmila) who lives in Pre-partition Pakistan. she is from a punjabi family in a small town. She was kidnapped by a Muslim man as part of an annual battle with the Punjabi family. and then follow a series of twists and turns, as urmila's regular marriage arose within days. this movie is really a great movie. the storyline is solid with a wonderful script. All the performances like lillete dubey, isha koppikar (you won't believe, but she can also act except jus dancin on Khallas), kulbhushan kharbanda and many more. These sets with pre-partition pakistan, costumes, cinematography, sound, background score add to the positive points. From the beginning to the end you stick to your seat with the following question: This movie is not worth seeing but deserves to be part of your movie collection. The ultimate scene is the end of the movie. I would suggest to all those who are not Kabhi-Khushi-Kabhi-Gum-and-No-Dil-To-Pagal-Hai to see this wonderful movie. my rating: 10/10.
