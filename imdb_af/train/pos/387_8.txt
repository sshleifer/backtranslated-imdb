This movie is good. It's not the best of the big CG kung fu flicks, but it's pretty good. First thing first, the story is actually good. The whole idea of ​​gods vs. fallen gods dealing with superpowers is pretty cool. My problem is that there are too many characters! It became very confusing when they switched screens! The special effects were immaculate! The fighting tones were very fast and complex. This movie generated virtually all computer. The acting is excellent, as is always expected of such high-profile players. Ekin Cheng makes an excellent protagonist, single person character. Zhang Ziyi did nothing to me in this movie. I thought she would have a bigger part, but she did one battle scene and a lot of japping. The bad man, the whole skull force and the whole blood thing is very scary. The music is also excellent. For me, this story deserves at least a mini-series and not just one movie. There is too much story to bump into 2 hours. Perhaps if there was a book or something, I would be able to keep up with all the characters and details. This movie offers story integrity for action. I recommend Storm Riders about this any day.
