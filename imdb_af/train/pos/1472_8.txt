Lots of information to digest, and if you've seen Zizek, you know its fit. <br /> <br /> Even if you didn't see most of the movies or at least some other movies by the same directors mentioned in this document, you'll be slightly lost. <br /> <br /> And the movie list is long. Director includes Hitchcock (Psycho, Vertigo, Birds), Lynch (Lost Highway, Mullholland Falls, Wild by Heart, Blue Velvet), Tarkovsky (Stalker, Solaris) and The Conversation (Coppola) <br /> <br /> There is some segway movies like, Star Wars: Espisode III, Matrix ... but I guess I'm bait. To be sure, Zizek is never boring, but if you don't buy the psychoanalysis (or not) then you won't end up. <br /> <br /> But you shouldn't be, as the setting, cuts, the way the movie collapses with these clips, Zizek's points are never boring.
