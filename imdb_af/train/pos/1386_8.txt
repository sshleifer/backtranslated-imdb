Three teenage girls in an incomplete triangular relationship. The base of the triangle is barely there. At the point is Marie, a serious, short and thin tomboy with a Belmondo-like face structure. Her best friend is the physical and psychological opposite: coquette, plump - I dare say fat - and longing for her first kiss with a boy, but not really ready for her first sexual encounter. Because of her chubbiness, the boys don't seem interested and it gets hurt. <br /> <br /> The other leg of the apex is a beautiful "fille fatal" blonde vamp. She is deeply involved in the sport of synchronized swimming at competitive level. Marie sees her during a competition at the local public swimming pool. Marie insinuates herself in the life of the vamp with the desire to become a synchronized swimmer as an argument. The vamp has a reputation for being a whore, with a young male orbiting her. Marie is not being phased out by that reputation. Stress on reputation. <br /> <br /> The first half was set up. We see very synchronized swimming as we get to know the three girls. Eventually, the narrative leaves synchronized swimming behind and concentrates on the topsy-turvy relationships among the three. This is when unexpected things start to happen. <br /> <br /> It is a trademark of French films to drop nuggets of wisdom on the viewer. This one is no exception. Here it is about ceilings and death. See the movie to learn more. <br /> <br /> The director says the use of synchronized swimming is purposeful. That female-only sport is a metaphor for a girl's life: beautiful and feminine on the surface while hard-working and competitive. A number of scenes drive this point: elegant moves and smiles to the public, legs kicking evil under water. The title in French is also suggestive: "prieuve" or octopus, suggest that an individual should simultaneously suppress much pressure.
