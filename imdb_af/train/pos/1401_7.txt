Okay, we have tremendous Verhoeven violence (Although not as extreme as other Verhoeven flashes), we have a lot of sex and nudity, but something is missing ... Oh, yes, the intelligence is missing what Paul Verhoeven is known for. for his sci-fi movies. I admire the way Verhoeven puts the characters and how they have a sense of humor, but unlike most Verhoeven films, the film itself doesn't have enough humor to fall into the comedy genre. The acting overall was above average compared to most slasher films. <br /> <br /> What makes Hollow a good movie is not the story, not the role or the characters, but the wonderful special effect that would otherwise make a movie so impossible. The crew really made an invisible man, without the use of things like a swinging hat that piano wires and other practical effects (effects on the set). The most amazing effecton is not seen, while Kevin Bacon is invisible. This is when Kevin Bacon becomes invisible and visible. <br /> <br /> The problem is that this invisible man's tale is deserving to be more imaginative. Here it mostly occurs at a laboratory. I'd like to see the invisible Kevin Bacon robbing a bank and getting away with it, or stealing something from people's wallets, or something. But what is shown is decent enough to make Hollow Man an entertaining movie. Degree: B
