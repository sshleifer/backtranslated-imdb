An unattractive, subtle and thin film, "The Man in the White Suit", is another fresh air in cinematic format of Ealing studios. While I suspect some modern viewers may initially find it unclear, I doubt that many will be captivated by the expert way in which the plot is lost, the themes and characters lost during the film's course. <br /> <br /> The truly amazing Alec Guinness gives another fine character in a movie, perhaps not as distinctly virtuoso as Ealing's inspired "Child Harts and Coronets". This time he only plays one character rather than eight, but as the worldly inventor and scientist Sidney Stratton, he always finds the right tone and expression. Along with Guinness's subtle, expressive performance, the rest of the cast is effective. Major players, Cecil Parker and Ernest Thesiger stand out. Thesiger is compellingly absurd as the mutilated but influential business ground, while Parker is reliable as the ineffective but pivotal mill owner and father. Father, that is, from Joan Greenwood, the sly delightful comic actress, who is at her insurmountable peak in this movie. Striking and seductive of aspect and diction, she is quite sublime in this movie, a fine contrast to the similar, but more maladroit Guinness. The scene where she seems to be trying to tempt him is played by the couple so that they are both very pleasant and amusing. <br /> <br /> The themes are handled very effectively, with no easy morals drawn. The complexity of the relationships between science, business and the workforce is insightful and pleasing. This film has been expertly assisted by Alexander Mackendrick and is technically skilled in all areas. enticing photography, appropriate sound effects and music and a capricious script, impress everyone. A thoroughly satisfying film, with Guinness and Greenwood magnificent. <br /> <br /> Rating: - **** 1/2 / *****
