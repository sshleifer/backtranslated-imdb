It's about time that Gunga Din is released on DVD. I can't say exactly how many times I watched this fine movie, but I never tire of it. The lead actors worked so well together. Victor Mclaglen (Sgt McChesney), Cary Grant (Sgt Cutter) and Douglas Fairbanks Jr (Sgt Ballentine) are an unbeatable team. <br /> <br /> I just can't come across their exploitation in India. Your first glance at the sergeant Three is when you see them catching up with other soldiers over a so-called treasure map. The three sergeants are sent on an expedition to find out what happened to the communication line, and they enter a mostly deserted town - or so they think. <br /> <br /> They involve the necessary repairs and soon find some "residents" in the hiding. Shortly afterwards, they are attacked by a group of evildoers and barely escape an escape to the base. <br /> <br /> Later, they are sent on another mission, giving Sgt Cutter a chance to hunt on the Gold with Din. They find the temple of gold and are trapped by the evil Kali supporters. Din has been sent to get help and cutter is caught. Soon, McChesney and Ballentine arrive at Din, and they are also imprisoned. <br /> <br /> Faced with, they are looked helplessly, as their regiment saves them. The evil ones watch and go over their surprise attack when a wounded din climbs to the golden dome and blows his bug which then warns the British to the ambush. Din was shot dead. <br /> <br /> The soldiers attack the evil people and soon defeat them. At the end, Din is honored for being an honorary Corporal in the British Army.
