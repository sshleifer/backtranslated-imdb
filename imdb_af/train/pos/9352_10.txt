Most people, especially young people, should not understand this film. It looks like a story of loss, if it's actually a story to be alone. Some people may never feel loneliness at this level. <br /> <br /> Cheadles character Johnson reflects the total opposite of Sandler's character Fineman. Where Johnson was caught up in his blessings, Fineman tried to forget his life in the same perspective. Jada is a wonderful addition to the throw and Sandler pulls tears. Cheadle played the comic role and was a good supporter for Sandler. <br /> <br /> I see somewhere somewhere here. A very fine movie. If you've ever lost and felt, this movie will assure you you're not alone. <br /> <br /> Jerry
