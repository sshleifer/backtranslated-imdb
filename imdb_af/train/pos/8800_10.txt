First, I don't understand why some people find this movie so American. Certainly, there are moments when the US is directly accused, such as the segments of Youssef Chahine, Ken Loach and, to some extent, Mira Nair. But come on, they're not naive accusations; Instead, they are based on actual and documented facts, and all the documents released by the CIA on Chile, for example, confirm this. <br /> <br /> But returning to the movie itself, which I enjoyed most of it, is the various moods we find in it. We find children educated for the respect of all the people who died in the case; we find an unhappy couple that will be changed by the tragedy of that day; we find general people who have downgraded their feelings on the shadow of September 11 events and react differently with dignity or frustration; We even find someone in the movie for whom the towers fall for a moment of true happiness. <br /> <br /> All these visions and others - as powerful as this or even more - make a consistent blend and help the viewer have a look at how different people around the world have spread on the events of September 11 reacted. So, what we see is a panorama that is much more complex than whites and blacks, and that can upset some people. but this is the world we live in and there is no place for manichaic ideologies, regardless of what presidents or priests can tell us. <br /> <br /> Finally, I find it a pity that there is not even a release date for this movie in the United States. This is a pity because most Americans are asking why this disaster happened, and this movie can give them clues. This film makes it very clear - unlike some of the people in this forum - that everything we do today will determine our future and that the mistakes of the past will affect how we live today.
