A great movie. Lansbury and Tomlinson are perfect, the songs are great, the dances, with a specific mention for the "Portobello Ballet" are beautiful. Regarding the animation section, the game between animals has become an immediate classic; the climax with the attack of these fixtures is cool and fascinating. I recommend watching the restored 134 minute version or at least the 112 minute video. Here in Italy we only have the 98 minute version, although the movie was presented in the original version with 117 minutes. If possible, also watch the German video cassettes: it was generated from the 98 minute run, but it is missing from any reference to World War II and from all scenes between English people and their Nazi invaders!
