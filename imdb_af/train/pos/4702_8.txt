If this movie proves only one thing, it is what Keaton is and will always be a cartoon, even when the bullets are deadly, going on the electric chair and coming to the wrong side of an information line in jail. <br /> <br /> But "Johnny Dangerously" is going to prove even more. In the 80's, the ZAZ boys (Zucker, Abrahams, Zucker) were the highlight of the world of genre spoofs. But there were several previews on the throne. This time, Amy ("Fast Times at Ridgement High"), Heckerling is trying her hand, with an incredible amount of television writers behind the ministry (go and watch). <br /> <br /> This slap-happy slapstick spoof of the 1930s cops-and-gag star movies throws about every click for just about every click and even adds a few cliches that have not returned. . And not only is the always trustworthy Keaton at hand as the Johnny of the title, but also such funny guys and dolls as Piscopo, Henner, Stapleton, Boyle, Dunne, DeVito, Walston and just about every other actor in Hollywood walking in the immediate vicinity. You will be amazed at how many faces you will recognize. I know I was. <br /> <br /> And the jokes? Well, when they start, they come to you quickly and furiously, like a machine gun. There is too much to count in the beginning, with a crazy theme song by Weird Al Yankovic. But you need to look when they recharge. And they have to recharge a little too often. <br /> <br /> Everybody tries, they look fun and I laugh a good amount of time. In the end, however, there was enough time to think about how some scenes could have been cleaner - usually not the best thing to think about a comedy. <br /> <br /> But for a slow night when there's nothing good on television, pop in "Johnny" and get ready for a "Dangerous" serious laugh. <br /> <br /> Eight stars. Check out "Johnny Dangerously" ... don't be a "bastidge".
