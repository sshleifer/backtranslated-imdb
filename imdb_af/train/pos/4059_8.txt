The first of the official Ghibli films, Laputa, is most similar to its predecessor Nausicaa, but while Nausicaa was an SF epic, it is more of an action comedy adventure with a fairly poor SF premium. <br /> <br /> For the first half hour of the movie, I thought I'd love it. Once again you find yourself in detail in Miyazaki's attention and its ability to evoke an imaginary world in meticulous, beautiful perfection. The animation, but still not in the league of later Ghibli movies, is a little better than in Nausicaa. <br /> <br /> In my review of Nausicaa I mentioned that one character is drawn in a more 'Lupinesque' anime. style. Here are a lot of them: the pirates. They present the comic element in the movie, but that's why it's a comic element I'm not sure about. There was nothing funny about Nausicaa, and I think it was better for it. Still. Dola, the pirate leader, is easily the most memorable character in the movie (even if she is actually a female Long John Silver. Don't be surprised if you are sometimes reminded of 'Treasure Planet') and is well-spoken by Cloris Leachman in the American dub. <br /> <br /> The English voice throws itself for the most part, actually. But something about me about this movie started over the halfway mark. I think the best way I can describe it is that the characters are devoured by the wide range of the story. I'll come back later. <br /> <br /> There is so much to admire about Laputa, and so many people love it, which I almost feel as if it's just 8 out of 10, but I admire the operative word here. . It was more impressive than personally influencing, and in just two hours it just started to drag. <br /> <br /> The critical thing for me was this: I really found that I didn't do much about any of the characters. Disney would have taken care of developing the characters, so you would really fall for them, rather than moving them as relatively two-dimensional pieces while sitting on the incredible movie views. Even if there was a hard SF in the story to make it up, it would have been tolerable, but it was basically a bunch of gobbling over Princess and magical crystals. That's where Laputa is as far as I am concerned, and that's what keeps us from potential 10 out of 10 movies. To say this, it must be acknowledged that in 1986 Miyazaki was generally a league for Disney. If you think their movie of the same year was the modest Great Mouse Detective. <br /> <br /> Laputa is a good movie in some ways a great movie, and you should definitely see it, but I feel it's overestimated. I definitely prefer the earlier 'Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind'. <br /> <br /> VAT, if you see it in chronological order, look for the Nausicaa fox grain that appears shortly in Laputa.
