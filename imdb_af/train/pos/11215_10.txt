I watched the Walking Tall movies for the first time when I was about 8 years old and I thought both Joe Don Baker and Bo Svenson did a good job. Anyway, they have to, because since I watched the movies I tried to learn so much about the right Sheriff Buford Pusser as I can. All 3 parts of the movie gave me chills and Buford Pusser was a real hero, I just wish he was alive today and there were more people like him. I'd like to thank him for getting rid of the crime and being so brave. I'm very sorry that his family had to go through such an abomination and pain. My heart goes out to them. So, from a 30-year-old fan of Sheriff Pusser and from the 3-part Walking Tall movies and the actors who portrayed him, don't be negative about these movies and actors. They just tried to let us know what a wonderful man the real Buford Pusser was and what a great family he had. And to all the young people who haven't heard much from Buford, I suggest you look at the Walking Tall movies and learn more about him.
