Suggesting Anton Newcombe from Brian Jonestown Massacre can also use some therapy to soften it. In You! who won the Grand Jury prize at Sundance, we see him and his band self-sabotage over seven years, while former friends and contemporaries. The Dandy Warhols rise to comparative quantity (a cellphone ad anyway). <br /> <br /> What elevates you! above its contemporaries, the immense biblical comic tragedy is played out: a depressed honest treatise on art versus trade and compromise. For all her "look at me, I'm a bloody genius", Newcombe has indeed been revealed to be a very talented, very upset musician - much more talented than his rival, the Dandy's Courtney Taylor who tells the picture. If Newcombe is Dennis Hopper, Taylor's Peter Fonda. <br /> <br /> It's even sad, Taylor seems to realize it, through his tired, self-rejecting voice judgment: he knows his band has won the battle - but at what cost? In fact, they sold out, made Indian Lite records, kept their teeth clean and tidy, and probably brushed their hair twice before bedtime. They therefore won record contracts and a large tour bus. And all the credibility in the process. Newcombe, on the other hand, lives in filth, is constantly handcuffed, beat fellow students on stage, kicks hecklers in the head - and is the last time in Dig! is being chased away by the police, losing the right to see his child. <br /> <br /> Two of the best films about rock's subculture were directed by women: Penelope Spheeris's The Decline of Western Civilization and this one ?? a moment classic the moment it was released.
