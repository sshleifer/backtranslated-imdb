Directed by Brian De Palma and written by Oliver Stone, "Scarface" is a movie that will not be forgotten. A Cuban refugee named Tony Montana (Pacino) comes to America for the American Dream. Montana then becomes the "king" in the drug world as he ruthlessly manages his empire of crime in Miami, Florida. This gangster movie is very violent, and some scenes are unpleasant to watch. This movie has about 180+ F words and is nearly three hours long. This movie is entertaining and you will never get bored. You encourage the Drug Lord, and in some scenes you find that Montana is not as angry as other criminals. This is a masterpiece and I recommend you see it. You won't be disappointed. 9/10
