While the supposition of the movie is pretty lame (Ollie is diagnosed with "hornophobia"), the movie is a lovely and enjoyable little movie. It's also a little better than the movies they made after that - probably as it was the last Hal Roach-made Laurel and Hardy movie. In fact, it won't be a bad idea to watch any of these latter movies, as the whole chemistry in these movies is lost and the boys play their part purely for pathos - something that Laurel and Hardy films will never do. They had a bit of all the later movies. <br /> <br /> Stan and Ollie work at a horn factory. It sounds pretty funny, but it's not. Not surprisingly with all the racket, Ollie is about to have a nervous breakdown and needs time off. The doctor (James Finlayson - in his last film with the team) recommends an ocean voyage. However, they don't like sailing and Stan has an idea to just catch a boat on the cabin - then they can get all the sea air they want without all the hassle! Once they are on the boat, a dangerous escaped criminal picks up the boat and accidentally gets them to the sea. Luckily this part of the movie was actually played well and the end worked out very well. <br /> <br /> While not a great Laurel and Hardy movie, it was much better than many of them since it had no annoying and distracting musical numbers (as in DEVIL'S BROTHER or BABES IN Toyland). In addition, there is still a decent amount of physical comedy - something you will almost not see from this movie. Part of this was due to the falling health of the boys (and Ollie's increasing perimeter) and part of it was due to the overall incompetence of these later films.
