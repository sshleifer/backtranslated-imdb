There is a spectacular, staggeringly beautiful photography here from a variety of scenery and animals, from north to tropical and everything in between. The camera techniques are varied and range from close to aerial work. Editing is great and the comment is also about, with just the right tone and some dramatic and telling facts about our world. Where the film falls, we try to cover and integrate four themes - seasonal patterns, climate change, individual animal stories, and hunter-driven interactions across various environments. Eventually, it gets a bit bitter and incompatible. Overall, especially worth seeing especially the issues covered, but don't expect Oscar material.
