Excellent political excitement, played much quieter and slower than other, higher-ranking films in this genre. When people talk about Pacino and Cusack, how do they manage to beat this incredible career top? A story of friendships, daddy relationships, corruption and fraud. The two actors listened incredibly well, and Aiello and Fonda fans are equally impressive, although Aiello is brilliant, especially when the newspapers run. Instead of focusing on an over-complex corruption scandal, it creates wonderful characters that show the human side of failure a political bribe. The final scenes with each of the main characters were wonderfully written and performed.
