Impressive film of four city lickers in crisis in Appalachia has become synonymous with rural depravity. Each of four businessmen is confronted in their darkest fears as they tackle a challenging white water ride, on a river replaced by a dam. When locals decide along the way to make themselves with the interlopers, this leads to several deaths and many trauma to the survivors. Each of the travelers is excellent, although Voight is leading and delivering the best performance. The rural scenery and culture are well captured, including the breathtaking pioneering range. I saw it on a date when it came out, not exactly the perfect date movie (although we both enjoyed it). I remember it as an outbreak dramatic performance for Burt, Voight was already established. Not the kind of movie you can see every week, but it has a strong punch and is beautifully filmed.
