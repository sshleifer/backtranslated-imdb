Berlin-born in 1942 Margarethe von Trotta was an actress and now she is a very important director and writer. She is described, perhaps even unfairly discolored, as a director whose commitment to bring a woman's sensitivity to the screen weighs her artistic strengths. "Rosenstrasse", which received mixed and even strange reviews (the New York Times article was one of the most negatively aggressive reviews I've ever read in that newspaper) is not a perfect movie. It is a fine film and evidence of a rare conspiracy of successful opposition to the genocide Nazi regime by, of all people, generically powerless Germans in a Berlin street. <br /> <br /> Co-author von Trotta uses the real Rosenstrasse incident in the context of a young woman's search for information about her mother's life never disclosed as a child in the German capital during World War II no. <br /> <br /> The man of Rut Weinstein (Jutta Lampe) died and in a surprising reversal to an orthodox Jewish lifestyle that has long been in the distance, Ruth not only places Shivah (the Jews but she insists on following the strict requirements of her faith. Her New York City apartment reflects the prosperity guaranteed by her late husband's labor. Her American-born daughter, Hannah (Maria Schrader) and her brother, are slammed a little by mum's assumption of restrictive orthodox Jewish practices, but they stumble. The mother coldly rejects the presence of Hannah's fianc√©, a non-Jew named Luis (Fedja van Huet). A domestic crisis may erupt, as Ruth warns that she will renounce Hannah if she doesn't stop dot, pretty Luis. Be quiet. <br /> <br /> A cousin arrives to pay her respect and leads clues to an interested Hannah about a war-like mystery about Mom's childhood in Berlin. Hannah is intrigued - she asks her mother who definitely refuses to discuss that part of her life. It is very, very realistic. I grew up with parents who fled Nazi Germany just in time and I knew many children whose families, wholly, escaped the Holocaust. Those days are simply not discussed. <br /> <br /> So, after learning that a German gentile woman saved Ruth's life, Hannah pushes him to Berlin and hopes to find the rescuer still breathing. If she wasn't, it would have been a very short movie. But Ruth, who pretends to be a historian, places 90-year-old Lena Fischer (Doris Schade) now a widow. As the happy interrogator, but driven by repressed memories, Lena tells her story. The scenes move fairly seamlessly between today's Berlin and the wartime capital. <br /> <br /> The 1943 young Lena (Katja Riemann) was a good pianist who was married to a Jewish violinist Fabian Fischer (Martin Feifel). With the arrival of the Nazi regime, he had to use "Israel" as a middle name, just as Jewish women had to add Sarah to their names. (By the way, I wish IMDb did not include Fabian's name on his character list with the false "Israel" included - it remains just a name applied by Nazis as a sign of classification and decline). <br /> <br /> While Germany has deported most of its Jewish population to concentration camps, those who were married to "Aryans" were released. For a while. Until 1943, when the regime decided to take them too (most were men; a minority was Jewish women married to non-Jews). The roundup is shown here in all its terrifying intensity. <br /> <br /> The young Lena is trying to find her husband. All she and many other women know is that they are limited in a building on Rosenstrasse. The crowd of anxious women builds up, some seek help from German officials who are predictably refusing help and also verbally abusing them (a Jewish love listener is one name). As a subplot, Lena adopted more or less eight-year-old Ruth who hid her when her mother was seized. (Remember, Ruth is now in Manhattan in Shiva). The child Ruth is quickly depicted by Svea Lohde. <br /> <br /> Increasingly, angry protests finally win the women. The men and a handful of women are released. As in the true story of the Nazis, one of the rare, almost unprecedented times when the men acknowledged their defeat in their manslaughter agenda (another was the end of the euthanasia campaign for the spiritual kingdom). to get rid of defects and chronic injustices, but that's another story). <br /> <br /> Von Trotta builds up the tension and every woman's story is personal and universal. Hannah continues with the aging of Lena, who slowly, collects one, begins to suspect she is not dealing with an ordinary historian, but rather someone with the need to learn about the girl she saved, the child whose mother murdered. <br /> <br /> The contrasts between Rosenstrasse of 1943, a set, and the street today in a vibrant, rebuilt, united Berlin offer a recurring thematic element. Today's Berlin carries the heritage, but not the scars of a monstrous past. Von Trotta makes it very good. <br /> <br /> The protagonists are uniformly impressive. Lena's husband, while strong, is also shown to be totally helpless in the trap of giving birth to a probable view of deportation (which is clearly seen by all characters - including local police and military - as a one-time voyage to oblivion) . The older Ruth is being forced to suppress demons who are suppressed long in her happy New York life. Hannah is very credible as a young woman whose father's death has a need to discover her family's past. These things happen (although the Times' critic doesn't seem to know). <br /> <br /> Von Trotta's hand is sure, but not perfect. A scene with Goebbels on a soiree enjoying Lena's violin play is unnecessary and distracting. The suggestion that she went to bed with her propaganda minister, the most fanatical Top-Hitler worshiper, detracts from the marvelous performance of the protesting spouses and family. Most of the German officials come from central castings and are formed by the Erich von Stroheim "copy and paste" school of Teutonic nastiness. But this is understandable. <br /> <br /> The Rosenstrasse story is the subject of books and articles, and some claim it is a paradigm case to argue that many more Jews could be saved if more Germans protested. Unfortunately, the argument is nonsense. The German women who occupied Rosenstrasse were deep and understandably important. Most Germans were somewhere between passive and virulent anti-Semitism. Therefore, the Rosenstrasse protest had almost singularity. Whether one buys or rejects the Goldenhagen thesis that most Germans were willing to be willing with the real killers, it cannot be denied that pre-Nazi endemic anti-Semitism from 1933 broke out on an ominous tribe . <br /> <br /> The elderly Lena remarked that what was achieved by women was a ray of light in a bad time. Most of the men and women who jumped out of a nearby death journey survived the war. Such a ray of light was it and von Trotta's movie is a beacon of enlightenment that shows that some have been saved by the courage of largely ordinary women and for every life that saved an occasion for celebration. And always will. <br /> <br /> 9/10
