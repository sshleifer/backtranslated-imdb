I got this movie from Netflix after a long wait, so I was expecting it a lot when it arrived. My worst fears were that it would be plowing, as well ... Well, you know what all the screaming girls struggled with? GACKTnHYDE = Do you love? That kind of thing? Dreading it. I was very, very pleasantly surprised. The film was surprisingly visible, even though the filming and music made it feel that every two scenes broke out some nun-chucks, and the acting on Gackt's part was pretty good. Hyde, being, um, Hyde, acted as a quasi-romantic friend / gangster character that anyone who saw him on stage would be almost surprised. He is one of my two big beef with the film itself. But the rest of the role players (including the child actors in the openingstone) were very good at doing what they did - mostly shot and screaming. But my second problem was very small, with greed. It was too exciting for me - like any scene shot, either they fell off, really really dead, or a little long. But Sho just ... take the shots, repeatedly, cold ear, bubbles a lot while talking, and cry Hyde. All in all, if you're a fan of any of the actors or just a j-movie fan, it's definitely worth a watch.
