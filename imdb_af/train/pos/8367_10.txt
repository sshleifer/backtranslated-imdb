Having seen this excellent movie more than 100 times, I still find new things blowing me off with this movie, great special effects, incredible acting and a plot full of inventive twists making this movie an excellent portrayal of capitalism towards communism. everyone ends up happy and everything is fine. best movie ever !!!
