I saw this movie a week ago and still think about it. I was very moved by this movie. I have the characters very credible and look like almost a mistake. As in real life, people sometimes type, as in Leo's case, even though I was of his character, I couldn't have been disappointed when he was prepared to have unprotected sex, even though he was fully aware of its HIV status. I was also disappointed with Leo for the rejection of the medicine he had available and the terrible way he treated Marcel when he decided to send him home by train. I think this movie showed in a very correct way why HIV numbers are in young gay men. It is by no means meant to be bash-gay (I'm gay) and movie is very good about a young straight person who makes bad choices and unaware of the consequences for himself and others. The only part of the movie I couldn't understand was why the (gay-friendly) family was not prepared to include Marcel in Leo's disease so he couldn't go to the funeral. <br /> <br /> I think the biggest message of this movie is that gay or straight has no sex!
