I just don't understand why this movie comes here. Jeez. It's pointless, it's not polished and it's (as I read) on some mess. The movie of this movie plays their characters to the 'T' (If you've watched Permanent Midnight and become a Ben Stiller fan, then yes, you'll be disappointed). It is misunderstood, with good intent to try to save the city / world, with nothing but eagerness and determination. The problem is they don't realize their limits until the big riot and that's the point! It's 3 times the movie that The Spy Who Shagged Me still got through the same demographic, probably the same people who feel the first AP movie compared to the sequel. I just can't get it. The jokes work on more than one level; if you didn't get it, I know what level you are.
