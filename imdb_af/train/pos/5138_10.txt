Back in 1994 I had a very long holiday around the fourth of July - something like 17 days in a row that paid two weeks holiday, weekends and the holidays themselves. During that time I stayed in the village and hung a lot from my parents' home. <br /> <br /> I didn't have a TV in my apartment, so I watched my parents' tube. I just watched a segment of the X files when a program on personal FX was selected. I was immediately addicted. I have always been fascinated with items in our home that came from my parents' family homes, and through the heritage of family estates, and have often wondered about their history, value, and so on. <br /> <br /> After my long vacation, I went to my people's home to catch personal FX on my lunch. <br /> <br /> I can remember one episode during which co-host Claire Carter announced that the New York apartment in which the filmed series was being refurbished and once said that the renovations were completed by Personl FX to the air would return. <br /> <br /> It never did! Personal FX was the first and best of the collectible apps. And it disappears from the sky! Almost fifteen years later I'm still hurting. <br /> <br /> Get away, FX.
