Lensman is a rather lesser-known Anime jewel of Toho and MK studios. It is loosely based on the novel, but it reminds me more of the game "Metroid". <br /> <br /> See it in Japanese with Subtitles or Japanese. The English printed version is almost cut and edited. <br /> <br /> Not much new, despite being the first animated feature to combine CG graphics. With hand-drawn animation, but it's nice to watch.
