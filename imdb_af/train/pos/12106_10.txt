Antonio Margheriti's "Danza Macabra" / "Castle of Blood" is a terrible atmospheric chiller that succeeds on all fronts. It looks absolutely beautiful in black and white and it has wonderful, nasty gothic vibe. Alan Foster is an English journalist interviewing visiting American terrorist Edgar Allan Poe.Poe races. Encourage him not to spend one night in the abandoned mansion of Poe's friend Thomas Blackwood. The show is locked in the house and the horror starts! The film is extremely atmospheric and it scares hell out of me. The crypto sequence is really ominous and the tension is almost unbearable. Barbara Steele looks incredibly beautiful as a sinister haunt Elisabeth Blackwood. "Castle of Blood" is easily one of the best Italian horror movies made in the early 60's. A masterpiece!
