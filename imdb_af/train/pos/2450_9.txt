I watched this show since I was 14 and I loved it already. I love this show because it's simply funny! You will enjoy much of this show because it shows something new and trendy every day and my favorite part is when Benny always has her last comment on George after every punchline about his thick giant head. * Laugh * I'll laugh and I'll see it with my friends at home it would be as if we were watching a funny movie, but short. Love George Lopez. Funny, talented, funny, spectacular. It's a cool-funny family-comedy series that is enjoyable for everyone and you will definitely enjoy it - I've done it! And if you haven't looked at it yet, I suggest you look, because you don't want to stop watching it. Although there are no new episodes, I still enjoy the re-runs. Even more funny. Never turn away. <br /> <br /> 9/10
