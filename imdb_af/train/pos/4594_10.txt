The best martial arts movie ever made. This one movie is better than anything Bruce Lee ever did. A classic with a thorough entertaining and brutal climax. Jackie Chan is the king of martial arts movies and the real king of kung fu. It is a pity that Bruce Lee was so overstated, it became Jackie Chan an eternity to become popular in Europe and America. Jackie rules !!!!
