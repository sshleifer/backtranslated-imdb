this dolph lundgren vehicle is a fun die hard throwback action movie, it is not going to win any awards and it is not very original, but it delivers the goods you want to see from a dolph lundgren movie. our man dolph is an ex soldier now a teacher at a difficult city center high school and when taken over by terrorists, it is up to him to save the day. sure the script won't win any oscars, it's a great fun and it has its random action. dolph lundgren performs well, but he is more in action scenes, and the rest of the actors are not the best actors, but they do well. Overall detention is a pleasant action movie, but you have seen it a million times before.
