An Emergency Damsel is a joy because of the great Gershwin songs, Fred Astaire, Joan Fontaine, and a tremendous support roll cast by Gracie Allen and George Burns. <br /> <br /> Typically, a stupid plan for an Astaire movie made him an American dancer in England with Burns as his publicity and Allen his secretary. They confronted a story about being a love bug with women who were left and right victims. He runs in Fontaine, who is being held in her castle by a dominant aunt and brave father. Silly plot. <br /> <br /> The big songs include a foggy day, things are looking for, nice work if you can get it, and I can't be bothered now. Fontaine does not sing, but does a short (and decent) number with Astaire. Surprisingly good in a few dance numbers with Astaire is Burns and Allen, including an inventive and fun skirt through an amusement park. <br /> <br /> Also in the movie are Reginald Gardiner, Constance Collier, Montagu Love, Harry Watson (like Albert), Ray Noble, and my favorite - Jan Duggan as the lead madrigal singer. <br /> <br /> Jan Duggan is in the middle of the swoony trio that Nice Work sings if you can. Her facial expressions are hilarious. She was also a playmaker in the W.C. Fields comedy, The Old Fashioned Way, plays Cleopatra Pepperday. <br /> <br /> There was a lot of abuse on this movie due to the absence of Ginger Rogers, who, as noted elsewhere, would be terribly missed. The TCM host points out that Ruby Keeler and Jessie Matthews have been considered. Yikes. Two more would be disasters. Fontaine is fine as Alyce and the dynamic leaves the music numbers to Astaire, with a generous comic relief by Burns and Allen. <br /> <br /> Fun movies, good songs, good cast and Jan Duggan in a rare spotlight!
