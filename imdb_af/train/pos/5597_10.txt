Le Locataire is without a doubt one of the most important horror movies ever made. Polanski stars as a Trelkovsky, a fraudulent file clerk living in Paris, answering an apartment advertisement, just to find it The previous tenant tried suicide by jumping out of the apartment window. Trelkovsky is obliged to visit her in hospital and he meets Stella (Isabelle Adjani). Trelkovsky instantly moves in when the previous tenant dies and is only satisfied with the fact that he found such a beautiful apartment. His luck is soon replaced by waves of paranoia, as he is increasingly suspicious of his neighbors, who are trying to try Trelkovsky to repeat the previous tenant's suicide. This movie is wonderful. Polanski manages a surreal atmosphere of anxiety and paranoia. Many brilliant moments like the classic scene where Trelkovsky discovered the previous tenant's tooth in a hole in the wall, or the chorus dream where he wanders into the building's bathroom to find the walls with hieroglyphics. The photography by Sven Nykvist is really beautiful. "The tenant" is a neglected jewel. It can be hard to find, but it's worth it.
