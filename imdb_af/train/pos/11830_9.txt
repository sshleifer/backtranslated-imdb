It's a great movie with the whole thing done in just six or seven colors. When it came out more than 15 years ago, it helped audiences with its color scheme, which is so different from anything else ever put on film. Those colors, at least for me, make it an absolutely fascinating movie to watch. There are literally thousands of scenes that I wish to freeze and somehow turn into a painting to study for their artwork. <br /> <br /> The characters and story don't match the greatness of photography, but they are all over the top, especially the villains. The well-known actors they played here have a lot of fun on the play "Flatop," "Pruneface," "Lips," "Mumbles", etc. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Warren Beatty and Gleanne Hedley are good like Dick Tracey and girl Tess Truehart, and she's as soft and gentle as her name. Another good addition is Charlie Korsmo as the criminal young boy, Dick and Tess, sitting under their wings. The colorful other characters are played by Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, William Forysthe, Paul Sorvino, Mandy Patinkin, Madona and other names you know, but are too much to list here. Check out the full credits on the main page and you'll be surprised. <br /> <br /> The only negative I found was Pacino's voice that grew to you, Madonna's singing voice and the fact that the movie would be cut about 10 minutes better. The "bugs" are all minor, because overall, it's a fun movie .... a comic strip that comes to life in an incredibly colorful way ... like nothing you've ever seen.
