The Ancient Mariner is a truly classic piece of work, as was the original poem. The context / institution with the old marketer himself is fine, clear and without pretext. The artistic work associated with reading the poem fits in perfectly with the time / period of the institution and the work itself, and carries the audience in the period with a quiet but moving accompaniment. Use excellent, quiet motion strategies that are only well-won by pre-MTV era producers and far less apparent in more current works. (MTV has brought a static motion on television and video that, through, often irrelevant cuts, from theme to theme without forward movement and without clear relationships with theme or storyline.) The voice, intonation and vitality of Redgrave's reading brings this touch's poem to life. with all his fear, strife and pain. In addition, the smooth motion of the video emphasizes the cadence and sometimes the monotone (in this case a positive mood under the theme of the story itself) of the author's version of the ancient mariner's sad and haunting story. It's a must have for any love of classic poetry, the sea, a long story, which is almost true and a story that has a lasting impact on our world and culture. Who doesn't understand the meaning of an "albatross"? or the concept of "water, water everywhere and not a drop to drink?" A very good experience. Thank you, Mr. DaSilva for letting us live, never forget.
