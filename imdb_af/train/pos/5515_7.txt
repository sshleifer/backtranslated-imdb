I read a bit on Che before watching this movie and you want to know something, he was a real hero to the people because he just wanted to see equality for everyone and he hated what the oppressive powers did to his people has. as well as all other Latin Americans in general! Now I don't know about others, but for me he did the right thing by having socialism so everyone had to pay their fair share. But of course the powerful elite would not go for it. So, rather than understanding what Che Guevera wanted, they had to kill him to suppress the revolution. It didn't work, because there were too many of his other followers who just picked up where he left off. A good example of this was when Castro continued his leadership in Cuba. As for me, and as Che did it himself before him: "If you kill me, it's good. But you just kill a man, you'll never kill the case!" I couldn't have said it myself better. <br /> <br /> But ... ANYONE .... that's why I give this movie a 7 out of 10.
