Absolutely wonderful drama and Ros is moreover. I recommend this movie. Her performance was, in my opinion, the Oscar material! The only real sad fact here is that Universal didn't see that this movie was ever available on any video format, whether it's tape or DVD. They ignore a very good movie. But Universal has little regard for his library on DVD, which is sad. If you get the chance to see it somewhere (not sure why it rarely even runs on cable), see it! I won't go into the story because I think most people will rather have an opinion on the movie, and too many "judges" spend hours writing the story, which is available everywhere. <br /> <br /> A 10!
