I bought, "The Feast of All Saints," and it's not really a terrible movie, but many things could have been better. It has had much historical value, played by many talented actress / actors, and it is not an everyday occurrence that actors can play such a role and it can be a bit credible. There were some parts that were a bit mediocre and confusing, but I wouldn't say the whole movie was terrible. When you think about catching 1800's New Orleans and making something out of it, it's pretty difficult, and much harder to get actors who can strongly indicate the parts. But the only major problem I had with the movie was that most of the actors who played the free people were mostly light blacks, not very universal to cast other light-skinned people. one of the old Creole stereotypes that still exists. Who has already chosen a larger variety when it comes, despite the fact that many Creoles are color-conscious. While posters actors in a sense seem almost white, it can be more thoughtful. The actors did a good job, the writing could have written better, and overall I found the performances were very credible.
