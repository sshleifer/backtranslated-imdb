Lavish production values ​​and solid achievements in this straightforward adaptation of Jane Austen's satirical classics about the marriage match within and between classes in provincial 18th century England. Northam and Paltrow are a salutary mix of friends who must go through jealousy and lies to discover that they love each other. Good humor is a sustainable virtue that goes a long way in explaining the accessibility of older source material (which is somewhat tinted in its harsh skepticism). I like the look of the movie and how shots were set up, and I thought it didn't depend too much on follow-up shots like most other 80's and 90's movies. Very good results.
