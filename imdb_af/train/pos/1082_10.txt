Mr. Blends Build His Dream Home can be the best Frank Capra / Preston Sturges movie, not even a man ever made! If You Love Baby, The Philadelpia Story, The Thin Man, I Was A Male War Bride Or It's A Wonderful Life - Movies Made With White, Taste And And Sometimes The Tongue Stuck In The Cheek, Watch This One . After World War II, life is simply and idyllically portrayed. <br /> <br /> Grant is at the very top of his form and plays the city mouse who is in the life of a national battle. Loy is beautiful as his former wife. The cast of supporting characters compared to You can't take it along and contains an early bit by future Tarzan Lex Barker. Art direction and operation is much higher than that. <br /> <br /> The movie never pushes on the low rent, at-the-numbers window of the later adjustment The Money Pit.
