Since September last year, I have borrowed four to six films from the Harold Washington Library every week, boasting an impressive DVD collection. (The HWL is really a circulating library: three quarters of its films are at any given time!) Recently, I was excited to find The Short Movies or David Lynch. Yesterday, when I knew little of the animated series, I picked up Dumbland. I'm here to report it. For David Lynch fans, the eight episodes look half an hour. <br /> <br /> The most remarkable feature of these short pieces is their soundtracks. Each episode has its own rhythm. Respiratory and digestive systems provide percussion. Outrageous voices accent breaks' ends. Physical violence provides the beat. Shrinking birds and vibrant sockets brush along the edges. Many other elements fill out the orchestra. The pacing of the rough animation often holds on to the sound, but the soundtrack itself struck me as Lynch's primary interest in creating and distributing this work. In this way, these eight shorts are unique Lynchic rhythms. <br /> <br /> It is said, the situations are strange, ugly, deep, silly and funny like hell. And there is plenty of room in them to reflect on how absurd we can be. I can't say I will see the collection again, but for everyone in the movements that the Inland Empire is, Dumbland is worth half an hour of your time.
