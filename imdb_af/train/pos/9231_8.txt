FLAVIA THE HERETIC is a strange entry into the nunsploit genre - equal parts sleaze, feminist travel and 'history' as we follow Flavia on her strange journey. <br /> <br /> We start with Flavia in a monastery. She's not too happy there. Cuz doesn't believe in all the man-ruling rules and macho-ism of the world around her and escapes from the monastery with her Jewish palace, Abraham. They are both finally caught and Flavia is brought back to the monastery where she is involved in another Muslim invasion with another "non-believer" nun. Flavia hangs with the Muslims who take over the monastery and "become" busy with the nuns in a strange set of scenes. Eventually the Muslims roll out and Flavia is punished as a traitor to Christianity in another, stupidly brutal scene. <br /> <br /> This one has pretty much all the things I would like to see in a 70-year-old mining film - some good gore, including nipple removal, and a nice leggings scene, a decent nudity including the required front, and also a decent story. I will say that it is dragged in a few points, but not enough to really get bored. I would definitely recommend this one to nunsploit / 70's emerging fans ... 8/10
