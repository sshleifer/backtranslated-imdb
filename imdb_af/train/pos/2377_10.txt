I have been waiting for someone for a faithful version of H.G. Wells' classic novel, "War Of The Worlds", to be filmed. Timothy Hines finally did it! I just couldn't believe how good it was! From the acting, to the costume, the extraordinary special effects, I just can't say enough! It was wonderful! Dramatic, intense, full of first-class performances by a top-notch cast! It must be seen to be believed. I'm not sure. And I've read all the negative comments by the others and can't believe what they said. We have to watch another movie, huh? And those real bad comments by the guy, old man, whoever he is, well, he just doesn't know what he's talking about. <br /> <br /> Keep up the good work, sir. Hines.
