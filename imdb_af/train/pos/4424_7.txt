As incredible as it may seem, Gojoe is an anime and Hong Kong-inspired samurai action movie with a pacifist message. This single of the film is effectively portrayed by the main character (a great working work by Daisuke Ryu), a killer-bordhist monk Benkei. Benkei never swore to kill again, but he still takes up the sword to fight what he thinks is a devil's invasion. <br /> <br /> Gojoe is a movie that is difficult to rate. Its visual images are beautifully crafted and beautiful, but it uses too much trickery (circular and high speed drives, expressionist shots, colored colors, digital effects, etc.), so the end result is somewhat tiring. It says, the beginning and the end of the film is elegant and powerful. If only director Sogo Ishii would have been sensible enough not to use his pocket tricks. <br /> <br /> Another problem with Gojoe is the amount of violence. For a movie with such an anti-violent message, Gojoe wastes too much energy and screen time to portray the endless battlefield. The way violence is shown is always on the verge of self-forgiveness; In fact, a massacre against the night sky seems to be one of the films' signature images. Fortunately, Ishii is wise enough to show the ugly, tragic side of violence. Yet it seems that Ishii is not sure whether he is making a traditional action film or a deep moral allegory. The audience can't be sure until the end of the movie. The powerful (though cynical) end is what Gojoe saves; it clearly emphasizes that this film is something more than a mere gore festival.
