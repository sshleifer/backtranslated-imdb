SHANGHAI'S LADY is proof that the great genius Orson Welles can direct a "mainstream" movie if he wants. Compared to his other, more artistic works, this film has only a modest amount of austerity and almost no esoteric elements. <br /> <br /> Of course, the exception is the final scene in the mirror hall, broadly agreed to be one of the greatest scenes in the history of the movie. That's just the cost of a rental. <br /> <br /> The sweet surprise was the wonderful play of the beautiful Rita Hayworth. Her play in the beginning and middle of the film is so excellent, she showed the other actors as caricatures instead of characters. Even the great Mr. Welles.
