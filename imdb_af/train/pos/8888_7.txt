This movie started slowly and gained momentum in the middle. But the fact that the movie ran in two nights broke the momentum at its peak. The second part really got interesting, but then it made room for a just pathetic end. Soccer in the garden? Really, can it get even more juicy and maudlin? Now I hear plans for a similar movie based on the 70's. I will not make a big effort to vote in one if it is something like the '60s.
