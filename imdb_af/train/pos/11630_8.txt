Red Eye is a good thing to watch on a Saturday night. Intense acting, great villain and unexpected action. <br /> <br /> Some people may not want to watch this movie because it is a very short 85 Min's and 88% of the movie is on a plane and just speaks. Don't worry, they pull it out very well with the smart and witty dialogue. <br /> <br /> A PG-13 movie looks new grounds for director Wes Craven. But sure enough, he has as much violence as he possibly can in this excitement. <br /> <br /> This movie's strongest point is its role. This movie needs good actors to deliver the dialogue and excitement. If they didn't have those actors, the movie would have been lost. We had Rachel McAdams from Mean Girls and Wedding Crashers. Cillian Murphy of Batman starts and 28 days later. Finishing this role is Brian Cox of X-Men 2. <br /> <br /> The pacing in this movie was great. Just when your thoughts get bored, they throw a twist on you. Fortunately, it's not a long movie and it doesn't feel like that either. Much better than the other airliner. <br /> <br /> Here are my Flight Plan comments: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0408790/usercomments-578 <br /> I recommend. Not too long and not too loose. <br /> <br /> 8/10
