Oh, the best and funniest movie about female soccer fans, just slightly better than the 1982 saga of teenage fraud in North London (qv). By the way, I just watched it on Film 4 [2008-12-21] and I reject my inability to set the PVR. <br /> <br /> It's easily my second favorite football movie after Mike Bassett: England Manager ", but this time with the extra twist to look like a guerrilla movie maker of a team that still seems to be making movies banned in the country in which they are made (just think of the little where the girls are taken from the stadium just as the sun gets up: quick reactions everywhere. <br /> <br /> It's rare for a movie to run me out loud, but when the rural soldier escorted one of the girls in the lavvie while forcing her to wear an impromptu mask made of a Ali Daei poster, I couldn't stop wake the others in the house with my strings, especially when the young soldier understood the grandfather's calls for help ... <br /> <br /> I'm talking about the toilets, I just wish I could Farsi so speak, that I could work out the writing on the toilet walls (yes, there were a few scribblings in Roman script, but they did t mostly refers to shaky American rock bands). <br /> <br /> Also on the rural Farsi theme, don't you think Omid Djalili sounds like a yoke if he speaks Farsi? Listen to the surveillance sergeant in this movie and then go "Yup." <br /> <br /> I'm not going to run over Iran's sexual politics, and I'm not about the dubious acting; my love for this movie comes from the writing and editing: top notch things. <br /> <br /> Here is a list of my favorite football movies: 1. Mike Bassett, England Manager 2. Outside 3. The Glory Glory Days 4. A Shot at Glory 5. The Arsenal Stadium Mystery
