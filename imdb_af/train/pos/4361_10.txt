It was probably one of the 40's most sophisticated films - Warner Bros. up to date on their style. Photography by Sol Polito is probably his best performance - beautiful compositions and lighting with delicate shade. Max Steiner adds one of his most complex and beautiful scores - the hallmark of his classic search motif. The music adds great emotion and excitement to the plot and is beautiful and memorable. It is interesting to note that the same production team that made this movie went straight to "Well, Voyager" later that year - a fine film that won honors and awards and came down as a historic favorite. because it played Bette Davis. According to me, "The Gay Sisters" is a much better movie - made better in all sections, and more interesting, complex and enjoyable. A most unusual film that entertaines those who take it for what it is, rather than projecting their own modern creative sensitivity or their advanced and demanding standards of hyper-critical perfection. Every thing must be judged in its own time reference and for what it tries to achieve in its own terms. Most of the complaints I've read in these reviews are so childish and miss the point. If you're hungry for a perfect filetmignon, don't go to the pickup counter and start to sound and complain about the fluff dough. The art of film criticism is really lost on much of the population. Sorry - maybe if this movie had a Rolling Stones score and a hundred intricate and psychological subplots, you would all be happy. I'll take an old movie without modern intellectual pretensions a day of the week!
