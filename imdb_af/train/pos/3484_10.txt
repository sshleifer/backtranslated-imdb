It's just the best movie of all time! Sorry, Hollywood! I saw it in the early 70's, as soon as it appeared on the Bulgarian TV, and I loved it immediately (I was 14). 25 years later I bought it on a videotape, and a few months ago it finally appeared on a DVD here in Bulgaria. I have been living with this movie for 35 years and so do all my friends and family. My son was a teenager when he saw it for the first time, and he also loved it immediately (and this is the generation that grew up and watched almost all Hollywood movies and didn't speak or understand Russian at all) !). What makes this masterpiece of Danelia so special? It's hard to say because it's hard to describe what the beauty is ... But the fact is, you can see this movie dozens of times with the same pleasure as it was the first time. I can't remember any other such movie, no matter how many millions it costs or how big the cast was ... Chapeau, Maestro Danelia! Bulgaria loves you!
