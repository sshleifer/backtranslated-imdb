Garde à Vue should be seen a number of times to understand the sub-graphs it contains. If you are not accustomed to French word movies, based on conversation and battle of whites rather than on action, do not even try to see it. You just get bored and reassured you that French movies are not for you. <br /> <br /> Garde à Vue is a contemporary film, predominantly based on dialogues (written by Audiard by the way) and it cruelly cuts the appearance of the look. <br /> <br /> Why does Maître Martineau (Serrault) prefer unnecessarily accusing him of being a child killer, rather than telling the truth? Because at the time of the murder he was with an 18-year-old girl with whom he had a sexual relationship of 8 years. His wife knows this, she is jealous of it and he prefers to be executed (in 1980 in France there was still death penalty) rather than revealing the only "pure and innocent" aspect of his pitiful life.
