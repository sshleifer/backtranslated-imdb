It is the best and most original show ever seen in years. The more I see it, the more I fall in love with it. The throw is excellent, the writing is wonderful. I personally love every character. However, there is a favorite character for everyone, as there is a good mix of personalities and backgrounds, just like in real life. I believe ABC has disregarded the authors, actors and potential audience of this show, canceling it so quickly and not advertising enough and also not having a real chance to get another one. There are so few shows I watch, because most TVs are terrible. This show was right there with my favorites Grays Anatomy and Brothers and Sisters. In fact, I think the same audience for brothers and sisters will like this show if they even knew about it. Why is it always the loser who gets so much extra time and the winning programs with great potential are immediately dumped. I'm so sick of reality programs, I'm not looking at any of them. It was so refreshing to have a new idea for a show and then to hire great actors. This show had so much promise. The recent episode was the best one, but everyone started to really get into their parts and make the show so real. Please check out this show on ABC's video and let ABC know you want this show back.
