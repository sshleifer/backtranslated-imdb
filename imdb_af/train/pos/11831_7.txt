Despite beautiful and breathtaking animation, it's probably one of the most uninspiring Disney movies I've ever seen, and I often don't shoot Disney movies. Spirit is a wild stallion who is repeatedly caught, either by the cavalry or by Indians, both of whom try to break him. Spirit ends a bond with the Indian, and it is in a nutshell the story. Except for the beautiful animation of the horses, I or my five-year-old was not very inspired or excited about this movie. It is ironic that it is titled "Spirit", as spirit is what this movie could use a little more. An extra point was given for the soundtrack, which was nice, with songs by Bryan Adams and Hans Zimmer. And although this movie is G, you will probably have to end up explaining what a horse means to you five years old. I did. <br /> <br />
