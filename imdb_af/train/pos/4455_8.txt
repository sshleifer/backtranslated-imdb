Although I liked staying in town, I really liked it. I'm a new arrival when it comes to Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly. Although I heard from them, I haven't seen anything with them until recently. The first one I saw was Singin in the Rain who made me a Gene fan. I think it's better too. But I thought this movie was good and like all the movies, there are some parts that are better than others, but in my book it's a fantastic movie and I love it. Frank and Gene make a good team. I still saw them together. Take me out to the Ballgame. But I stick to my guns and say I really enjoyed it and love it!
