Bellocchio refers to this as a mainly political film, a description of the revolutionary movement in Italy, but it looks more metaphorical than reality. Well, almost everything in the movie looks like metaphor. The revolutionary, whom we see and about whom we learn very little, may also be mafiosi. Out with the old and the new. <br /> <br /> Andrea's Papa, a psycho-analyst, stands for the usual traditional bourgeois values ​​- morally upright, untouched, clean and neat, thoroughly ritualized. <Br /> <br /> Giullia, a friend of a revolutionary, seems to represent what can happen to someone who is badly needed to support, but is unable to make such a commitment such a commitment. to claim. (I guess here.) Andrea, the adolescent boy, seems to be the only man in the movie who is not "upatz" in an undisputed way. He is respectful of his father, but also disobedient. He loves Giullia, or we accept, although he is not really old enough to learn how to manage his reflexes optimally, but he leaves her to appear at school and finish his final exams. His course between these contradictory lifestyles can be described as "media". He is the man in between, who knows the meaning of gradualism, who can keep her cool while those shouting over him. <br /> <br /> Most of these are summarized during the oral part of his final when asked. to translate and comment on an excerpt from "Antigone", which contrasts the traditional authority of the gods with the idea of ​​secularism and free will. <br /> <br /> This brings us to no specific course I am not aware of - to Marushka Detmars. A few years ago, she remembers a New Yorker cartoon. Two hippos are neck-deep in the river and staring at a gazelle drinking from the couch and one hippo telling the other: "I hate her." She's a good actress. (Let me get it out of the way.) But so everyone else in the movie. She carries with her, in her speech and manner, the rich glitter of absolute lunacy. And it also comes from the actress, not from legal aid. Detmars are not utilities like Catherine DeNeuve neut was in "Repulsion." The walls do not turn to rubber and grow hands. Instead, we see her animated - sometimes animated. And she gives us shocking jolts when her mood suddenly changes and threatens the way a threatening thunderstorm threatens. <br /> <br /> A critic has described her so sultry, but it's probably not the word he's looking for. She is compellingly beautiful with her soft brown hair, her wide white greens, her impulsive giggles. And her eyes are like the eyes in the paintings on the walls of ancient Egyptian tombs. The sexy parts are pretty erotic, not so much, because one of them is explicit, but because we know the characters involved. (It is more interesting to spy along the honeymoon couple than to go to a skin spot.) Actually, there is not so much sex. There is only one scene of simulated intercourse, but the director plays it in what really looks like. At least real time for an eighteen-year-old boy. <br /> <br /> The young man Andrea plays is also good, which is an essential thing, because the film is almost entirely on him and Giullia. They have to carry it and do it. If it wasn't for their performances, I'm not sure it will be as interesting or as admirable as it is. It could easily have turned into a rather slow, boring romance. <br /> <br /> It's worth it.
