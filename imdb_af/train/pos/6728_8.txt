I stumbled across this movie on the cable and was totally addicted. The story of a group of surfers driving the big waves, waves that are vastly large, waves that make a rational person fly into terror is one that is spectacular and lets you understand why people spend their lives. There is nothing special about the movie, except that it brings along some very interesting people who fall in love with what they do and let them talk. Sure there are scenes of them surfing, but what makes this movie so special is the people. Here are a lot of guys who are so enthusiastic about what they do that cross it to the people who look. Halfway through this movie you will want to go and learn to navigate. Few documentaries have ever created the passion that these people have, and it is the film's ability to make us feel what makes it a good movie. See it.
