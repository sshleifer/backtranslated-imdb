My personal opinion is that this movie did not have a true story line for the first journalist's vampires, but I don't care, I love it. Jon Bon Jovi (Derek) was wonderful in this movie. He's really angry with me that he's the person you'd never think he was a well-known ROCKSTAR. There were some bad things about this movie. As the story line, there had to be more to the movie. There had been a sequel to the movie that followed the movie story series and they had to keep the same main characters in all three vampire films. I love many of the clothes that people wore and the environment they choose in Mexico. I love how old Mexico was and not Mexico. with the clay houses and the old fashion churches. I was a little confused with the vampires and how they could walk in churches, but it was cool how they didn't follow the Dracula vampire rules.
