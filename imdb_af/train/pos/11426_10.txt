I think this movie would be nicer if everyone thought of it as a picture of colonial Africa in the 50's and 60's rather than a story. Because there is no real story here. Just one vignette over another like little lights that doesn't mean much until you have enough to paint a picture. The first time I saw Chocolat, I didn't really get it until I thought about it for a few days. Then I realized there were many things to "get", including the end of colonialism that was just around the corner, but no plot. Anyway, this is one of my all-time favorite movies. The scene at the airport with the short shower and beautiful music was pure poetry. If you like "exciting" movies, don't see it - you'll tear your tears. But for some of you ... you can thank me later for the recommendation to you.
