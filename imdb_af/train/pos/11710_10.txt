Long before Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins shook the world of the Christian subculture (and millions in the process) with the LEFT BEHIND books, Christian IV distributor Mark IV Pictures, we gave it. masterpiece. What I love most about this genre is the incredible attention to detail in a lounge. Instead of taking us to the dramatic scenes of this "after-rapture" tribulation, we sit in the lounge and hear about the news because the filmmakers can't afford to show it. The film's premise is based on the Pre-Millenial Pre-Tribulation eschatalogy, believing that Christ once comes for the secrets of the true church and then again at the end of the seven years of hell on earth. What frightened me earlier in high school now makes me laugh. The intriguing adventures of Patty and her journey throughout the tribulation (and two of the film's three pursuers) tell her remarkable story of unbelief and ultimately damnation. I hate to admit it, but I still enjoy it thoroughly. It even has the same exact score of Monty Python and the Holy Grail. I think I'm the only person in history to make that observation.
