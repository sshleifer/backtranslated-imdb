'Gray Gardens' (1975) is the Mayeles brothers' bizarre documentary by Jackie Bouvier Kennedy Onassis'ccentric aunt and first cousin living like piglets in a 28-room mansion on East Hampton, Long Island. "Big Edie" Bouvier Beale, 78, spiritually and dryly and her daughter, Little Edie 'Beale (56) (emotionally about 13), a quiet woman who once had a promising future, lives in isolation from the rest of the world, except for their many cats and washcloths in the attic. They entertain themselves through the whole day, listening to the radio or singing to each other (They don't even have a television). They fall out of society is wonderful to learn and the viewer is drawn to these two particular, though naturally dysfunctional people. One of the better documentaries ever made and today a cult classic.
