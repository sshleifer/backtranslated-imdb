First I hung this movie on VHS as I just had to buy it on DVD, this is my favorite movie of all time. I read the book, but I really think the movie is much better. I loved Gwyneth Paltrow as Emma and Jeremy Northam since Mr. Knightley was an excellent choice. He was brilliant! <br /> <br /> It's a 10/10 movie !!! <br /> <br />
