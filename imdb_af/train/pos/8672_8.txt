WWE's last 2006 PPV was a hit with the fans, but one of the reasons, the learning match just scheduled to be Paul London and Brian Kendrick against William Regal and Dave Taylor. But with the recent crap PPV being December to Dismember, WWE knew it had to do something to talk back to the fans. It was useful when it launched MNM and The Hardy Boyz and announced that the game was a learning game. <br /> <br /> The game was brutal and one of the best learning games I've ever seen, but Joey Mercury's face was a total mess. Johnny Nitro didn't even look at his friend, they just went on as nothing happened, and Taylor and Regal didn't do anything during the match, except to hit people with some shots. In the end, London and Kendrick kept the titles. <br /> <br /> Elsewhere on the show, Kane defeated MVP in a decent inferno match when he set fire to MVP's dumb costume. Chris Benoit succeeded Chavo Guerrero in a decent match, Gregory Helms defeating Jimmy Wang Yang to keep the WWE Cruiserweight Title in good stead. <br /> <br /> But the main event was a total mess, King Booker chatted with Finlay. take on John Cena and Batista. <br /> <br /> Overall results: Kane defeats MVP in an inferno match. <br /> <br /> Paul London and Brian Kendrick have retained the WWE. <br /> <br /> Chris Benoit defeats Chavo Guerrero to keep the US title in a decent game. <br /> <br /> Gregory Helms defeats Jimmy Wang Yang to retain the Cruiserweight championship. <br /> <br /> The Boogeyman beat The Miz in a terrible match. <br /> <br /> The Undertaker has Mr. Kennedy defeated in a final rally. <br /> <br /> John Cena and Batista beat King Booker and Finlay in an unfortunate match. <br /> <br /> Overall Grade - B
