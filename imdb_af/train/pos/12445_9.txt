I saw this movie and I have to say I'm very impressed. There aren't many movies I like, but I like this one. You should see this movie and comment on it, because it is one of my favorite movies. I'd love to see it again. Action merged with a fantastic story. Very impressive. I like Modesty's character. Actually, she is very mystical and mysterious (I DO AS ^ ^). The bad boy is also beautiful. Well, actually this whole movie is rare in 'movieworld'. I thought about the voice of this movie, I thought it should be a very popular movie. I think wrong. It was ME that was very impressed with this movie, and I hope I'm not the only one who just takes the cost to watch this one. See and vote.
