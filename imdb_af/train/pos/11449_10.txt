It's by far one of the most beautiful portraits of a person I've ever seen on the screen. Andy Goldsworthy is a kind of man who is extinct. He sees the earth and nature with such admiration and respect that it is primitive in good sense. His purity, honesty and kindness are evident when you see him working in such a simplistic but full-fledged instantaneous artwork. I was amazed at how patiently he created his pieces and how patiently he accepted his end. sometimes early, but his Scottish sense of humor brilliantly covers his disappointments. the film is elegantly shot and contains the same flow that Goldsworthy's art has. It combines nature and art in a minimal way as it is. Fred Frith's score is organic enough to mix everything together without interfering with the natural sound. It is generally a huge piece of work in every aspect. It has no limits as far as age is concerned.
