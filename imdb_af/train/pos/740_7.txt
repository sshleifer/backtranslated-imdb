"Foxes" is a serious look at the effects of excessive growth in the 1980s. And unlike the teen sex comedies that overshadowed it (Porky's, Fast Times at Ridgement High), the movie keeps going well over time. <br /> <br /> Today, the theme of teenage anxiety is as relevant as it was 25 years ago. and Jodie Foster and Scott Boio (remember him?) lead a fine young role worth watching. <br /> <br /> The movie follows four South California girls as they move through a rootless existence of sex and drugs and without parents. The teenagers spend their days in and outside the school and their nights at parties, concerts or on the street. Rarely are they at home because immediate gratification is a pill, party or boy. <br /> <br /> But rather than condemning them, the film is sympathetic and blames the absent, unconscious adults forcing the teenagers to grow alone. And the charismatic cast is impossible not to keep. <br /> <br /> The movie's opening ?? a long and sweet pan - set the tone for what follows. We see the girls asleep in the midst of the teenage girl's objects, from Twinkies to a photo of a young John Travola, while Donna Summer's "On the Radio" is recorded below. <br /> <br /> From there, the movie speeds up when the girls go to school and to life. Annie (Runaway rocker Cherie Currie) is the wild child who lives for the next party or pill. Deirdre (Kandice Stroh) is the boy's crazy drama queen. Madge (Marlilyn Stroh) is the shy girl in her head. And foster parent is the one with the plan. It is her job to keep this team together for a long time to complete high school, as well as her divorced and desperate man in search of a mother in line (Sally Kellerman). <br /> <br /> It's an almost impossible job and one that Foster eventually fails. at. <br /> <br /> Despite his age, "Foxes" remains a pleasure to watch. Dated hair, clothes and references to Olympic skater Dorothy Hamill did not hurt the movie. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is simply stunning, with awesome filtered shots from the L.A. bowl in the morning, dusk and night. Giorgio Moroder adds an 80s soundtrack like Donna Summer and Janis Ian. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the movie's biggest disappointment is that the young stars around Foster never broke out like the straws of St Elmo's Fire. 1985) or "Empire Records" (1995). "Foxes" shows why they should. But maybe like Bowling for Soup's song "1985," they just hit a wall.
