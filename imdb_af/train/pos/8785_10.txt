Some say "The Play is the most important thing," or something like that, is attributed to that old Bard of Avon, himself, William Shakewspeare. if it wasn't old, it might be our own super veteran movie director, Mr. Raoul Walsh. There are a large number of his films that will support this hypothesis. No one is more appropriate than GENTLEMAN JIM (Warner Brothers, 1942). <br /> <br /> The Film also makes another award, which is called Errol Flynn's favorite of his own main role cars. It clearly shows on the screen that it will easily lead viewers who are in the dark theater, whether to watch it on their TV or DVD, to make the same. <br /> <br /> The story is surely a semi-serious Biopic, which contains a portion of factual material and mixes it with a liberal dose of the old imagination to give us a very satisfying, though somewhat fictionalized ( what is Biopic?) to prevent. <br /> <br /> The casting is excellent, as it makes good use of the natural athletics of our head, Mr. Errol Flynn. Although not a Swashbuckler, a Western or a War image, this GENTLEMAN JIM may be the lead that is best suited to the rough Australian. <br /> <br /> Errol was a member of the Australian Olympic Bok team in either 1928 or 1932. His training and skills in "sweet science" are evident in the film and especially in the Great Battle for the World 's Heavyweight Boxing Championship with the Big John L.Sullivan, Himself. by Ward Bond) The role-play reads like a duty schedule of Warner Brothers supporting players. It features Alan Hale as Jim Corbet's father, a Livery Wagon operator *. His two brothers are Harry and George (Pat Flaherty and James Flavin), the two 'blue collar' men of the family, called their careers as Longshormen. <br /> <br /> Big Jack Carson does his usual masterful serio-comic performance in support of Jim Corbett's friend and fellow banker. The rest of those we can recognize and remember are: John Loder, William Frawley, Madeleine LeBeau, Klein Watson, Rhys Williams, Arthur Shields, Dorothy Vaughn to name but a few. <br /> <br /> Director Walsh also used a number of Pro Wrestlers in roles of several Boxers. That's why we saw Ed "Strangler" Lewis and an unknown Grappler * as the 2 waterfront in the opening scenes. Others were Sammy Stein, Mike Mazurki (ever heard of him?) And "Wee Willie" Davis. These guys had a powerful but unpolished look over what the old Pier 9 brawlers would possess. <br /> <br /> We didn't forget the front lady, Alexis Smith. She is powerful in her characterization of an "independent" woman, but retains enough truth as a comic player in many of the scenes. She has a large variety in her part as a poor, small rich girl, Victoria Lodge. <br /> <br /> With all these ingredients at hand, the trick is how to mix the elements in good relationships to make it the "right" blend. Well, director Walsh does this with a reckless abandon. Because he is especially looking for a good movie. His treatment shows all the skills he created with a fine tuning that starts with his days as a player with D.W. Griffith. Mr. Walsh seems to have a special love for that period, the 1890s. *** Mr. Walsh's direction moves through the writing on a fairly fast clip, and breaks out the spectacular scenes with a humorous punch line. it again! "He can thus maintain a light, even humorous touch to a story that can become too deadly and serious. <br /> <br /> In addition, in an almost unnoticed element, Brother Walsh gives us a true look. A San Francisco of the 1890s, and as a further example of his love for that period, he creates wide, dynamic images of historical pricing battles, with a lively, joyful mood that is conveyed to these boxing scenes. coronation of this large, perhaps underestimated film, director Walsh looked at the picture as if it were an illustration of The Police Gazette, which covered such events in those "Old Days". <br /> <br /> But there is only one thing to remember before you look, if it's for the first time, or if you see it again: <br /> <br /> "SHORT IS THIS BACK !!" <br /> <br /> * In my humble opinion as a historian of both film and pro wrestling, it looks like Tor Johnson, who was a favorite of director Ed Wood's years later. <br /> <br /> ** A 'liver' is a somewhat archaic term for a local rental vehicle. city ​​transport. <br /> <br /> *** That's true. Mr. Raoul Walsh was a Griffith veteran player. He was the actor to portray John Wilkes Booth in the birth of a nation (1915). <br /> <br /> **** In 1887, Raoul Walsh is old enough to have his own memories of the 1890s and of the Sullivan-Corbett Championship Bout and what it means for the sporting life of those days.
