When Jean Renoir's first movie "Whirlpool of Fate" takes us for the first time in the world of the countryside, the rivers, the lives of the farmers he is going to explore, will appear to be appropriate for his second film in general with the rich and privileged, the upper classes and those trying to climb their way up. Put the characters together from the first two movies and you have the seeds of his great "Grand Illusion" and "Rules of the Game." It is beautifully filmed, with the restless camera making full use of the incredibly large apartments and backdrops that dominate the movie's interiors, and the often-performed play also offers good moments, especially from Werner Krauss' Muffat. But the glamorous and sultry me. Hessling, who initially seems to give Louise Brooks a run for her money in vampiness, never goes beyond one note, selfish whore depiction. Perhaps this is partly a problem with the script, which mostly shines for high points and furious emotions; I didn't read the novel. I'm not really clear about whether the choices were made well or not. <br /> <br /> However, the differences between Nana's writers have been well drawn and I especially have the relationship between Muffat and Jean Angelo's Vandeuvres - the tragic relationships that each of his ultimate fate and sympathy have, especially in the scene at the bottom of the enormous staircase where Vandeuvres warns us, and we wonder if violence will break out - this and other aspects of the ridicule of the limbs help the film the depth it has. <br /> <br /> Far from his greatest achievement and probably just ashamed of the whole "Whirlpool of Fate", it's still worth seeing for Renoir fans or those interested in quiet cinema in the general.
