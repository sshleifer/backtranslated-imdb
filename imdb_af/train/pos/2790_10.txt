Gurinda Chada's semi-autobiographical film (2002) is a gentle, horrible comedy in the ethnically diverse community near Heahthrow Airport in West London. <br /> <br /> Like the constantly arriving aircraft and coming from overhead, we follow the ups and downs of the two main characters Jess Bhamra (Parminder Nagra) and Jules Paxton (Keira Knightley), as they are an unlikely friendship detecting their mutual passion for football and their technical imagination with David Beckham. <br /> <br /> Much of the comedy grows out of the misunderstanding of the families of these two talented girls because they break all the expectations and conventions of their very different family backgrounds. Somewhere in the middle, as a broker, peacemaker and blue athlete, Joe (Jonathan Reece-Myers) - team coach for the Hounslow Harriers - intercedes in times of crisis, while at the same time being the main goal of the love of both main characters. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, and not without many obstacles and triumphs on the road, we finally see our dedicated and beloved soccer heroes conquering their dreams. <br /> <br /> With great performances by American veteran Anupam Kher (Bhamra), Shaheen Khan (Mrs Bhamra), Juliet Stevenson (Mrs Paxton) and Frank Harper (Mr Paxton) this is really a movie which traps the urgent passion of adolescence and crosses all ethnic boundaries. Pinky Bamrha (Archie Panjabi) and (Taz) Trey Farley struggle with their own struggles, but still make a big contribution to our understanding of the main characters in the film. <br /> <br /> In its own special way, this movie tells an important story that happens to be the football. It celebrates evolution in understanding ordinary people in ordinary families and the innate ability of the young to teach the guy.
