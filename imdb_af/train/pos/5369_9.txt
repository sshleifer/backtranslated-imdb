Mild Spoilers <br /> <br /> In the near future, Arnold's stars like Ben Richards, a wrongly convicted man, threatened to play "The Running Man", a deadly TV game where people should keep moving trying to escape deaths in the hands of the 'Stalkers'. Of course, people are expected to eventually die and Arnold to prove the system wrong. <br /> <br /> I didn't read the Stephen King book, but it's a good movie, regardless of Arnold's best. He does what he does best in the action man role, delivering death with memorable one-liners. Classical is probably the 'He was a real pain in the neck' after strangling a man with a stave and 'He had to divide!' Referring to the place where he just turned vertically. Dawson is quite annoying as the TV presenter, and all the "Stalkers" are good campers. The action is violent, but it is an action movie. That's the point. The movie is fast, and at 90 minutes it is not welcome. <br /> <br /> With Starsky and Hutch's Paul Michael Glaser at the helm, and in the wake of The Terminator's success, this movie was probably considered just another senseless Arnold action vehicle. . But today, anyone watching a lot of TV can see how the movie comes closer to reality. I won't be surprised if I turn on the TV in the "near future" and see a show not far from this one. <br /> <br /> However, on that derogatory note, I recommend "The Running Man". to anyone who loves the 80s, Arnold, ridiculous acts or violence or just a good action movie. 9. 5/10
