Yes, I call it a perfect movie. Not one boring second, a fantastic movie of mostly little-known actresses and actors, a large variety of characters that are all well-defined and which all have understandable motives, I can sympathize with perfectly illuminated, sharp black and white photography, a fitting soundtrack, an intelligent and harmonious set design and a story that is alluring and working. This is one of the prime photos on which Hollywood has to be proud, the point that everyone must endeavor to achieve. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwyck is simply stunning. There was nothing that this actress couldn't do, and she always went easily on the melodramatic side. No hysterical outbursts with this woman. I always thought she was a better actress than screen goddesses such as Bette Davis or Joan Crawford. This film confirmed my opinion. Always as difficult as nails and at the same time transporting real sentiments. It is fair to add that she also had very good parts during her long career, and this one is by far the least interesting. <br /> <br /> The title fits this movie very well. It's about desires, human desires, I think everyone can understand. In fact, no one in this movie twilight, all characters work on impulse, everyone wants to be happy without hurting anyone else. The sad fact that it often leads to complications makes up for the dramatic content I am not going to get here. <br /> <br /> I like what this movie has to say about youth, about maturity and about the need to compromise. The movie I associate most with this one is Alfred Hitchcock's Shadow of a Doubt. It creates a similar atmosphere of idealized and at the same time caricatured small-town America. The story has a certain resemblance to Fritz Lang's significantly tighter film Clash by Night, which was made one year earlier, where Stanywck stars in a similar part. I can also recommend it.
