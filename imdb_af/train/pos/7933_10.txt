Good times work with the Quiroz Brothers, and throw the whole on this project as the "Guy on the Bench." I was amazed at how well they got to capture all the identifiable features of a real "B" horror movie. Hopefully I will once again have the opportunity to work with the Pumpkin Patch Pictures team again in the future. I moved to Detroit shortly after completion and have been recognized several times since the release. Once was in the video store and the girl lost damn near her mind. It was pretty funny and it was my 1st true signature moment when I signed her receipt. One day I asked the girl at Blockbuster if the movie was rented regularly, and she confirmed by looking it up in the computer. By then, it had rented more than Ring2, which was also a new issue at the time. The title really caught interest in the more urban markets. She also noted that the movie was not returned by the client on many occasions, which led me to believe the movie was just as good, people didn't want to give it back. Watch out for ZoMbIeS when they come in the canopy because they will get ya! Jaysun Barr (Guy on the Bench 2005)
