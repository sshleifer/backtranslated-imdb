I remember being scared of movie blood when I was younger, and gradually getting smaller until I loaded enough, because I'm sure many other viewers have become so the barrage of gory movies that has produced me over the past few years entertainment I didn't scare or curl up. "The dentist" turned it around. <br /> <br /> The set-up looks simple: a mentally unstable dentist is ruined on the inside of the mouth and perhaps also bodies. However, a clever twist is that the dentist is the film of the film. Instead of being a one-dimensional bad guy, without clear motivation, his development is the greatest of any character and he is very human and credible. So the viewer feels sympathy for him as well as his victims, and instead of hoping that he will come to him, I hoped he would somehow find a way to cover and return his tracks. a normal life. <br /> <br /> What really makes a horror movie is the violence. And "The Dentist" does it better than any other movie I can think of. First, the film has many tensions, which is something modern gore films tend to lack. In one scene () the dentist is emotionally distressed and for the first time he must see a young child patient. While in the child's mouth, you hope the conversation ends for the sake of the dentist and the child without injury. I won't spoil what happens. Secondly, when the gore comes, it hits all the worst, severe nerves. Again, I will give away nothing. <br /> <br /> Of course, to be a movie you've never heard of, it has errors. Most importantly, it is exclusively for horror fans. Also, as another reviewer mentioned, we only get a few days of background on the characters. And the tension falls a little in the end. But the fact that we even want background about the characters is proof of how good it is, and most of the film is solid enough that any small decay can be forgiven. <br /> <br /> It is strange, after years of getting used to movie gore, to suddenly cover my eyes at the face of blood. The dentist frightened me and was thoroughly uncomfortable, and this earned me my full approval.
