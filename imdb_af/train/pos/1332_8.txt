In 1594 in Brazil, the Tupinambas Indians are friends of the Frenches and their enemies are the Tupiniquins, friends of the Portugueses. A Frenchman (Arduíno Colassanti) is captured by the Tupinambás, and despite his trial to convince them that he is French, he believes he is Portuguese. The Frenchman becomes their slave and lives with Seboepepe (Ana Maria Magalhães). Later he used powder in the guns left by the Portuguese to defeat the Tupiniquins in battle. To celebrate the victory, the Indians decide to eat it. <br /> <br /> "Como Era Gostoso o Meu Francés" is another great low-budget film by great Brazilian director Nélson Pereira dos Santos. The script is very original and the story is spoken in Tupi. The film is shot most of the time by natural light and is very realistic. The actors and actresses play naked and Ana Maria Magalhães is beautiful, with a wonderful body and beautiful display. The sound is produced by the Brazilian musician Z Rodrix. This movie marks the beginning of the exploitation of my country by Europeans, who at that time focused in Portuguese and French, dealing with the Indians and exchanging combs and mirrors through our natural resources. This film was awarded in national festivals, such as the Brazilian Cinema Festival of Brasilia (Brazil's Cinema Brasileiro Festival 1971) with the best script (Nelson Pereira dos Santos), the best dialogue (Nelson Pereira dos Santos and Humberto Mauro) and the best cenographer (Region of Monteiro); Art Critics Association of São Paulo (Associação Paulista dos Críticos de Arte), with the best revelation of the year (Ana Maria Magalhães) and other prizes. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Como Era Gostoso o Me Francês" ("How Nice was My Frenchman")
