BABY FACE is one of the better of the "forgotten" movies before the code. It was shown last night to the 1931 version of WATERLOO BRIDGE on the TURNER CLASSIC NETWORK, so I could see the movie as it is now with four plus minutes of recovery. <br /> <br /> Stanwyck lives in East St. Louis (where she knew the drunken parents of "Myra" - Mae Clarke - in WATERLOO BRIDGE). Her father is Robert Barrett. She lived with him since the death of her mother, and (in the restored dialogue) he has been beating her since she was 14 years old. Now she is a resident waitress and part-time whore in his speakeasy, her closest friend is Chico (Theresa Harris), the African-American servant who pays Barrett. This is one of two good points of Stanwyck's personality that she surrenders to Harris for Harris, who threatens to leave when Harris is fired (and as it is the dirty workers like Nat Pendleton, who likes to see Stanwyck them serve, rather than The smell of the hooch he serves what brings it in, Barrett must obey her. <br /> <br /> The one who regularly comes to the speakeasy, who likes Stanwyck, is the shoemaker and intellectual Adolf Cragg (Alphonse Ethier), who sees great potential in the enthusiastic girl when she leaves her home. He also pushes Friedrich Nietzche's philosophy, and the idea of ​​the will to power. More on that later. <br /> <br /> After knocking out the local political force (Arthur Hohl), and arguing with Barrett about this, an explosion kills Barrett and Stanwyck can leave her hometown. She and Harris go to New York City and drive free transportation through a railroad truck by sleeping with a brawler (James Murray). They reach New York, after which they look at the Gotham Trust Company (established in 1873) and the friendly guard tells her where the staff office is. <br /> <br /> We watch Stanwyck slowly the corporate ladder to the top, similar (but sleepy), when Robert Morse ventured into how to get into business, without really trying. But Morse was a man in a man dominated. Stanwyck knows her sexual love is her weapon. She goes through John Wayne, Douglas Dumbrille (part of the movie I always felt was the most shocking - oddly enough - when I watched it), Douglas Wood, Henry Kolker, and finally George Brent. Everyone falls for her, and is either pushed aside when it is no longer useful or destroyed. Brent, the new president of the bank who founded his grandfather, eventually marries her - and the film's crisis is when the bank's economic situation is shaken (especially after Brent buys her a fortune in jewelery and her valuable ties give). Brent was charged. Will she get up for him? <br /> <br /> SPOILER COMES: <br /> <br /> The one thing about these movies that is not allowed is that the theater and moral conventions of the time still set ends. In the original end, Stanwyck brought in a ship for Europe that left Brent to his fate, but realized she couldn't do it to him, returning to their home and finding himself shot. She drove to the hospital with him when it ended. Now before the rediscovered footage has been found, the film ended with their apparently spending all their money on the bank to save it, and going back to East St. Louis to live happily if they are poor. <br /> <br /> Never are good ends of this. Stanwyck must continue her destructive course, with Brent the last of her victims. But even without the Breen office, the writing writers (one is Darryl Zanuck incidentally) are fit to find her a moral center. She has no - at least not for powerful men (who she hates). I don't think a depression would have endured the kind of conclusion. <br /> <br /> There are other problems due to the changing styles of public opinion and changes in society. It was a man's world in the corporate world in 1933, so Stanwyck poured out her work. Wood (when dismissed with an impudence) admits he doesn't want her to work. <br /> <br /> But in 2006, Stanwyck would have found a woman across the site. In the film, there are haunting remarks (of course based on jealousy) to Stanwyck from other secretaries and female employees at her fast-paced turnout. In 2006 she regularly confronted women's superiors, and she would quickly cut them off. Of course, if she gets one or two, lesbians are the ones she can try that way, but it is doubtful. And she never looks more like men who are gay. They have gay male managers in business who won't give a damn over her legs or breasts. <br /> <br /> Then there is her mentor, Mr. Cragg. Cragg is again made in the "bowllerized" version to try to find her a moral center. In fact, he pushes Nieztsche, but the way (in a broader sense) pushed the Nazis into Nieztsche - find your way to power and push it. While Nieztsche sometimes stressed, it was not the best and ended all his theories. Otherwise, nobody would read him today at college courses. Cragg is, of course, self-educated, but only half-educated. In short, if someone who confronted Nieztsche Cragg, he could make him look like a half-educated fool. And that's Stanwyck's mentor! A good movie, and it's worth the day to be 10 ... but seriously flawed.
