This game is the bomb and this is the 007 game of the year and should be the biggest hits. When I got Agent Under Fire, I thought it was a good game, but then Nightfire came and it was better, but now there's a new kind of James Bond game. This time it's a 3rd person shooter and there are over 12 missions, the graphics of the game are out of this house. It even has all the great actors and actresses in this game like Pierce Bronsan like James Bond, William Dafoe as the villain Nikolai Diavolo, and Judi Dench as M (forgive me everything if I play it wrong). This game will be the biggest James Bond game. <br /> <br /> I give it a 10/10
