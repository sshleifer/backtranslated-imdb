HUSBANDS BEWARE is a remake of the Shemp classic BRIDELESS GROOM. The movie's new cooking scene at the beginning of the movie is wonderful. The stooges are always funny when they cook. But after the first few minutes of cooking pictures, we cut into original BRIDELESS GROOM footage. One thing I noticed about this 1953 to 1956 remake is that they fit the new story. They do a shot if the old story line does not match. <br /> <br /> HUSBANDS BEWARE has a new ending, but I won't give it away to those who want to be surprised. <Br /> <br /> **** out of 4 stars.
