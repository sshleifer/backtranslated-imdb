The idea is a very short movie with lots of information. Interesting, entertaining and likes the viewer. The producer has produced a short, high quality film that cannot be compared to any other short film I have seen. I rated this movie at the highest possible rating. I also recommend showing it to office managers and businessmen in any business. What comes from that is the fact that people with ideas are never listened to, their voice never heard. This is a lesson to be learned from any office that wants to move forward. I hope the manufacturer will deliver a second part to this "idea". I look forward to seeing the order. Once again congratulated Halaqah media on creating a film of excellence and quality with a lesson in mind.
