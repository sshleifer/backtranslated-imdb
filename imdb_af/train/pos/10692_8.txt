Good, funny, straight story, excellent Nicole Kidman (I almost always like the movies she's in). It was a good "vehicle" for someone who was accompanied on comedy and drama, as there are both elements. A romantic comedy about two crime stories, good closing styles. Chaplin, very good here, was also good at another good but unpopular romantic comedy ("Truth About Cats and Dogs"). Perhaps they are too unreliable. Ebert did not even post a review on this. Of course, the big "screwball" comedies were completely unquestionable ("Bring Up Baby", etc.). If you saw one incredible comedy, did you see them all? Or maybe people are ready to continue from the 1930s. Strange. Birthday girl is a movie I have enjoyed several times. Nicole Kidman can be the "killer app" for home video.
