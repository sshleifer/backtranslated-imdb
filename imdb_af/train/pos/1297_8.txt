Faithful adaptation of a witty and interesting French novel about a cynical and depressing middle-aged software engineer (or something), relying heavily on first-person narrative, but not the worst for it. The best way I can describe both the film and the novel is that it is something like a more intellectual Charles Bukowski (no respect for the CB's intention). Hardly funny, but also a dark analysis of social and sexual relationships, the film's great achievement is that it reflects real life in such a recognizable way to ask you: why aren't there other movies like this? One of the rare examples of a good book that makes an equally good movie.
