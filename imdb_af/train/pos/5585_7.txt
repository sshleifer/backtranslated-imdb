It was a very daring movie for his day. It can even be described as soft core porno for the quiet era. It was a talkie, but dialogue was very limited, and in German. One didn't need it. <br /> <br /> The young (19) Hedy Lamarr gets caught up in a loveless marriage with an obsessive (stereotypical?) German and after a short while in a marriage that apparently never happened, come back to her father. <br /> <br /> In a familiar and funny scene, she decides to dip lean one morning when her horse is distracted by another. She is then forced to cross a field and dress up behind her as she leaves her clothes on the horse. An engineer retrieves her horse and returns her dress. After she had an eye, she sat for a while. <br /> <br /> He is sitting for a while and in a moment he offers her a flower with a bee sitting on top. This is where she remembers her honeymoon and the actions of her husband and insect. She knows this man is different. <br /> <br /> She returned home and eventually found our young man and found the ecstasy she refused. You can use your imagination here, but his head disappears from the eye and we see her thrill. Since he never carved out, you can imagine ... Certainly, a tribute to women by director Gustav Machat√Ω, and a shock to 1933 audiences. <br /> <br /> The only thing this beautiful film is filmed is the excessive debt and a strange ending.
