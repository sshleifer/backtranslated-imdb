"It wasn't me! It was, me, my twin brother Rupert!" Bobby tells Dugan when he is confronted with being at Sally's place. I've been using this rule for decades over the years (no one still needs to believe it). <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the all-time best for pure fun and disbelief. Steven Oliver was perfect for part of Dugan, so much so that he was the same character in 1978's "Malibu Beach" (not so much screenplay). <br /> <br /> "No one calls Dugan a fool!" is another line for centuries. This classic movie was definitely worth the price of admission.
