Where the pavement ends (1950) <br /> <br /> Where one ends, another start <br /> <br /> It's a prototype film noir, and as such, it's pretty flawless, from both view style and content points. Photography and night-time settings are the first time (film photographer Joseph LaShelle lets the drama break into the scene to the scene), and close-ups on faces pure expressionism. I can see this kind of movie for visual art alone, even when the actors struggle and the plot stinks. <br /> <br /> But the play is here for the first time, and contains the plot I consider to be the core of most noir films, the estranged male lead (representing many men after the war after changed United States return and feel lost). In fact, Dana Andrews is not really convincing, as he has a small but important filmmate, the chief (first) man, a decorated ex-GI, in difficult times and times. The fact that one man kills the other can be of monumental importance, overall - the ordinary man struggles through his inner problems to success while the medal-bearing soldier slips into his head in a casual death with a silver plate. The woman passed from one to another - we accepted their marriage and introduced children to the movie as before. Even if it insists on an interpretation, we can still see the path of one man with some psychic baggage care through a crisis of the highest kind of moral order - to set him up for a small crime just on the point he actually walked away with it. <br /> <br /> This movie belongs to Andrews. He plays a much more disabled and moving kind than Kirk Douglas plays in a similar role in William Wyler's detectives just one year later, and Andrews is definitely less theatrical. You can easily see both movies next to each other for a compare and contrast session. The fact that Andrews, as detective Dixon morally battles over, and Douglas as detective McLeod, can explain why one man gets his girlfriend and the other. Gene Tierney pulls out an extremely sympathetic, destructive and ultimately conventional and "beautiful" type of woman - not just a cardboard, but someone who wants Dixon should actually marry. <br /> <br /> The criminal plot is really secondary to the main drama, but is effective enough in its play with types and clicks. The little parts are kept funny, the small details (such as the portable craps table) are beautiful, far from the character factors or the glow of gambling in Casablanca. But then Curtiz's big movie is even in the details iconic - it makes no effort to be subtle and real and pervasive, but instead it is versatile and memorable. They are on the opposite side of the war and represent opposite possibilities for their leading men. Bogart begins his active duty, Dixon, and the man who killed Dixon is completely over. By, thorough, but not up to date. <br /> <br /> It is no coincidence that many, perhaps most, have movie fellows that you would call "happy" ends. The man overcomes his opponents and changes his inner self, and the film, then and now, just understands how beautiful it should feel.
