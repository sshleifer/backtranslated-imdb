I'm not a Steve Carell fan, but I love this movie about Dan, a column of advice that goes to his parents' home for a stay with his children and eventually falls in love with his brother's girlfriend. It's a story that's been told before, but not so. There are just too many small pieces that make the movie better than it should be. The role-play is wonderful, and even if Carell is not my cup of tea, he is pretty good as the widower who needs to know everything, but finds it to be different from feeling and sometimes it will surprise your life. In a temporary and sensible way in which an annoying Hallmark card can be, the movie is still how to grow on you and be a little more than a run of the movie. Worth to see
