This is a very funny movie! I have no idea if it translates well into other languages ​​or not. However, I think men can identify with some extent worldwide with Frank and his thoughts! These thoughts are very entertaining and women will also enjoy this movie. I'm sure! <br /> <br /> All the actors play well and this movie could have been a huge hit all over the world if it was made in England. or the USA. But for those of you who are fortunate enough to understand Swedish, you are a surprise! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
