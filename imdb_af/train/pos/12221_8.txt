It's a nice piece of work. Very sexy and alluring enough plot to keep my interest throughout. His biggest drawback is that it seems to have been made for TV: Fullscreen, and although there were several sex scenes, there was absolutely no nakedness (but the boy came close!). Strange as well, as Netflix proved it was rated. <br /> <br /> Still, very titillating, and I wish Alicia Silverstone made more movies like this. <br /> <br /> One Netflix reviewer said it was part of a series, but I couldn't figure out which series it is. I would like to find out, because this movie was so good. <br /> <br /> Walt D in LV. 08/23/2005
