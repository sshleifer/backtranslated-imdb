I really enjoyed the detail that went into the script. <br /> <br /> Jonathan Rhys Myers (wrongly spelled) and Jewel were outstanding in their support roles. Like Jeffery Wright. Toby McGuire did just as much work as ever, when he had to amputate his best friend's arm because he knew he would die without the procedure. <br /> <br /> Attention to detail, with good dialing coaching to catch the southern accent very well. <br /> <br /> Why this movie was thrown under Hollywood by the Hollywood promoters, I can only imagine. I have strong suspicions. What makes me more attractive. I have issued a dozen DVD copies for gifts. <br /> <br /> Completely stunted movie. Rent or buy it and give it your full attention for a few hours, then judge.
