Disney did it again. Brilliantly the way Timone and Pumbaa came to life to tell us how they met Simba when he needed it. I love this movie and watch it over and over. It shows how Timone lived with his family and fellow meerkats before he set up his dream home and adventure. Then he meets Pumbaa and changes things. Together they searched for the house that Timon wanted and repeatedly failed, which was funny as Timone became more and more crazy. Then Simba appears and we see more of his childhood than we did in the previous 2 films. You know the rest already.
