Perhaps this is not the absolute biggest entry in the Hammer House of Horror series, but it certainly wins the award for the most inventive title episode! "The house that blew to death" ?? I can cry out all day without ever getting tired of it! And besides the wonderful title, this short movie is also benefiting from a solid written script and a handful of really exciting moments. This may require an extra view before fully understanding the quirky twist, but it is definitely an original idea for an abomination short. The story begins with images of an elderly couple drinking tea in their middle-class home. The man kills his wife sadistically and a few years later the "cursed" house is still for sale. A young couple and their cherubic daughter move in and start repairing, but mysterious events occur and become especially young Sophie. Her beloved cat is killed even her birthday party is destroyed when one of the house pipes suddenly sprays blood over the guests (a very different sequence, this one!). Is the old house really haunting? Or maybe the seemly helpful neighbors cause all the horrors? The answers to these questions are provided in the original and fairly unpredictable climax and there is even room for a real shock at the end. The tension is masterfully built and the titular house is filled with ominous scenery, like the few rusty powers the man uses to kill his wife. However, there is little warning, the sequence with the cat is difficult to see if you are an animal lover. Finally, another winner for Hammer's short-running TV series!
