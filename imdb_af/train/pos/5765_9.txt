Zombie Bloodbad is a movie made by zombie fans for zombie fans with a real love for the Horror genre. As I understood from the comments and things I read, it was made during the great Midwest flood of 1993 when half of Missouri was under water. Buildings were underwater. cars and houses were under water. One article said that zombies and the crew of this movie would help the sandbag after they were shot every day. The fact that this movie is completely made is a miracle. It's like a huge mashing of every zombie movie ever made through a Troma filter. It's a party movie to enjoy with friends who love lots of fussy and goofy characters. And it's fast and energetic and very funny. <br /> <br /> A toxic nuclear accident in a nuclear plant causes people to collapse or turn into zombies. The local government covers it, drops the factory and builds houses there. Some landslide (?) Causes a cave opening and some new residents get the cave and free the dead on the newly built community. From there, it's just crazy and greedy and fun. <br /> <br /> I've read these reviews here a few times. And it seems obvious to me that the same person attacked three times as another reviewer using false names. They use the same words and sentences. Zombie Bloodbath is cheap. It's raw. It has some bad plays. So make half the movies too. There are many WORSE out there than this fun movie. If you hate this movie so much, don't buy it. There is no need for personal attacks and crew members or to throw Trailer Trash. And it is clear that you are not from Australia or England. It's just astonishing that this good service doesn't capture the IMDb people just use it to get others dirty. There are bad reviews and good reviews, and I don't care. I give both bad and good reviews myself. But it is painfully clear that some fools only want to use this forum to attack the director of this movie personally. Sad. <br /> <br /> Some of these so-called "Reviewers" even claim their "review" even to promote their own movies. One called this movie. Drilling - well, love or hate it. One thing you can never say about this movie is that it is boring. It is moving fast and never has a dull place. <br /> <br /> Oh and this reviewer from the Netherlands ??? About - LIAR. You tried to post the same review to Amazon and it was listening there. The END review alone said it was from Missouri. <br /> <br /> This nonsense must stop. Keep it or hate it - give it a real review or type nothing. Obviously you haven't seen the movies. <br /> <br /> But for the record I and even though this one is not nearly the best I have seen, it's far from the worst. And even the worst, I'll give a real REVIEW and not personally attack the director. <br /> <br /> Hope this review helps some people see the stupidity that is going on here.
