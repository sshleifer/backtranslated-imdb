I loved this movie. It was done so well! Great acting and drama and historically accurate. I love Romy Schneider movies. This one stone, not as big as Sissi, but still rocks! <br /> <br /> And Scorpiolina commented and told French dubbing. Well, it is originally a German film that is not French. So yes. Secondly, there was a plot, perhaps you are not familiar with history. Oh and her mother played the part of her governor, not her teacher. And the storyline wasn't really Cinderella, but Queen Victoria, maybe you missed that detail. <br /> <br /> But anyway .... yes, history in this movie is great, I love historical movies and Queen Victoria is very fascinating. ! I love all the historical stuff. Like the guy trying to manipulate her mother. And when she ran away and met her future husband, he let her "the new kind of dance" waltz. When rolling was new, it was considered disgraceful, because the couples dance so close. Yes, her governor was like oh my god! <br /> <br /> And also the clothes, I love the clothes. The styles are great, hoop dresses are great. And of course Romy always looks very nice.
