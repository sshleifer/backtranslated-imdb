I am a Belgian and grew up in the sixties. Most of the American series were shown here (original language with subtitles) and Batman was one of the first ones I wanted. Unfortunately, it caused a panic hysteria among the mothers because Batman was considered too violent. Geez, compares the innocence of the series to the crap children they see today. So because of me, the overprotective mothers of the 60's, I just had a chance to see two or three episodes! I got so frustrated that I started to compensate for the comics and bubblegum cards (still they!). I even got the View Master slides ... I had an urge to see the captain. All children need some kind of hero. <br /> <br /> Years later, I finally got the chance to see the races as an adolescent and I enjoyed it immensely. The tongue-in-cheek acting would have escaped me when I watched it as a child, but I understood it at age 17. Yes, I have watched them now and the occasional good soul on the internet episodes, because they did not release the series on DVD (to my knowledge) <br /> <br /> Tonight I enjoyed "Back to the bat cave "... it was a pleasure to watch because it was full of trivia and jokes. To see Adam and Burt was a pleasure and this TV movie is simply fantastic in every aspect. They play themselves if they played their parts in the series. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to the people who produced this great nostalgic "festival" ... I'm going to look again. My advice to all Batman fans is: see it !!! Rent it !!! Borrow it from a friend !!! Buy it !!! I'll never expect myself to evaluate it as 9/10. Well done!
