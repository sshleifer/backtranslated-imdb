Where the pavement ends is a good movie noir crime drama and is also well shot in black and white and on the spot. <br /> <br /> A buyer accidentally makes a bottle suspected of murder and protects himself, he covers it and blames it on another person he doesn't like who has committed many crimes in the past no. But by the end, he didn't own until he fell in love with a woman he met who loved the person he killed. <br /> <br /> The film includes Dana Andrews (While City Sleeping, Curse of the Demon), Gene Tierney (Laura, Spirit and Ms. Muir), Gary Merrill (Mysterious Island), Karl Malden (Die Street of San Francisco, Beyond the Posidon Adventure) and Craig Stevens (The Deadly Mantis). Good parts from everyone. <br /> <br /> When the pavement ends, it is worth checking out if you get the chance. Excellent. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 stars out of 5.
