please, future writers, producers, directors - learn from this movie! <br /> <br /> I have never seen such a bold and original story created for the big movie screen. fat, because the writing has always taken a step that has avoided so many fantasy flies safely - a step towards something new, creative and daring. just when you think 'oh, I've seen it before' or 'I'm sure it's what will happen now' - StarDust turns an unexpected turn and engages more and more in the story. <br /> <br /> The actors are great - even the smallest part is performed with such a talent, it fills me with awe for the creators of this movie. Robert De Niro is beautiful and performs with so much energy that he only steals the show in every scene in which he participates. Michelle Pfeiffer is the perfect witch, and Claire Danes is a great choice for the innocent and loving 'star', Yvaine. Other big names make excellent roles. I tried all the stuff to give his best for this movie. But again, the story of Neil Gaiman, all the little things he invented for this universe, is excellent. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie on a front screen today, a day before the official release, and hope it will be a great success. There is so much humor, but also tense moments, as well as nice tender scenes. The look in the eyes of Yvaine, the "frivolities" of Captain Shakespeare, the passion of Lamia's witch - impressive, memorable <br /> <br /> For me, this is the number one entertaining movie of 2007, watch it and enjoy it <br /> <br /> 11/10 - Outstanding <br /> <br /> peace and love
