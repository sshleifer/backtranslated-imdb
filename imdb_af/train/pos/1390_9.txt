If you like cult 70's Sci-fi as I do, or if you like movies like "Repo Man" or "Buckaroo Bonzai", than you would like this one. It is a stream of consciousness 70's Sci-Fi spectacular, including a 22nd century hideaway and Earth a million years from now. This movie is pure 70's. Sit down Steve Miller's "Fly Like An Eagle" or Pink Floyd's "Dark Side Of the Moon" and you're ready to go!
