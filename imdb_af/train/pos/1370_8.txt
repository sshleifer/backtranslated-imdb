I remember seeing this year when it first came out and I was flown by Parker Posey's performance. And the movie was also pretty good. For anyone who has spent a little too much time in the nightclub / after-hours scene, this movie will have a special charm for you. Not too serious, mostly funny, and Parker Posey blows her talented way through this very jewel. <br /> <br /> I especially like the Diaz character (remind me of every single struggling DJ I've ever known). And many other movies can give an indication of this movie about preaching the virtues of responsibility, without being too boring and drunk. <br /> <br /> Babaganoosh!
