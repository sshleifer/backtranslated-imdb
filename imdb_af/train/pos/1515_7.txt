Amicus made close to a good half-dozen of these horror anthologies in the 70's, which is one of the best-known writer Robert Bloch, one of their best efforts. There are four stories, all worth it, but two - "Sweets For The Sweet" and "Method For Murder" - distinguish themselves as highly effective journeys in fear. <br /> <br /> In "Sweets", Christopher Lee plays an impatient widower whose beautiful daughter (Chloe Franks) gets malicious from his neglect and brutal intolerance, and his shell is a voodoo doll she dislikes. expressing its methods. Franks is a beautiful figure of evil evil and has been one of the greatest acts of childhood in a horror movie since Martin Stephens in "The Innocents". This installment is aimed at great subtlety and the final indignation on the screen is a moment of pure terror. <br /> <br /> "Method of murder" is about a horror writer (Denholm Elliott) who is threatened by one of his own creations, the creepy pastor. This episode is striking for its simplicity and terrifying terror. Dominic may or may not be, so director Peter Duffell has a good time to play with our expectations. The short shots of Dominicus reflect in a pond or as a fleeting phantasm in a meadow. It's really ghostly. <br /> <br /> The original poster art, with a skeleton figure holding a tray holding Peter Cushing's cut head, was a rich dedication to pointers set on fear.
