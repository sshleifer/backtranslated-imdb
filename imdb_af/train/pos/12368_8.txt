I switched on the TV for a white sound card and heard a "$ 400 for a fully furnished apartment." So I ran into the TV room and expected another movie's 70's and more. Fortunately, I can rewind back to the start (DVR buffer) and press the record button to watch it completely. (Cinemax uncut and in HD, no less!) Besides some holes in the story and intermittent unlikely dialogue / events, it's an effective thriller worthy of your time to watch. Beverly D'Angelo's character masturbates before Alison Parker, played by Cristina Raines, Parker stabs, in a very gory way, her father, an explicit menage a threesome scene. (Don't allow kids watch) The movie is TOTAL 70's full of bad clothes (polyester suits and sticky ascot) and decor, bad hair, overblown music parties and famous cinematography. The movie is excellent, take a second on this homepage to watch it out. It was a surprise to see Christopher Walken, Jerry Orbach and Jeff Goldblum so young. Sylvia Miles - always wonderful creepy! ENJOY!
