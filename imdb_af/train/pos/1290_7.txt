Yes, I remember this one! Many years since I actually looked at it. The story was totally surreal, but wonderful! What anyone who writes and reviews movies should keep in mind is what the respective movie strives for. It's the same with 'First Kid', which follows a similar pattern. Certain movies - like this one - just strive for ordinary and comical nonsense. Such movies cannot be graded from the point of view of a hypercritical reviewer. Of course, these movies lack quality, lack of sophisticated storyline, very often not top-notch, but if they keep their primary point of departure - that's good. I don't have this movie here on my list of all-time favorites, but I still thought it was funny, has some very enjoyable rows and made a good story. Brian Bonsall is a clever actor anyway.
