It's a good movie, I've done the play a while ago. It had an extra singing. I loved Vanessa Williams as Rosey, and Jason Alexander also has a good voice. It was wonderful. The environment was also very good. Except for 2 hours and 50 minutes, it takes quite a while. Overall I give it 8.5 stars. They also added some parts, but it was still cool.
