Do you ever want to know how much Hollywood could get away before the Hayes code was officially implemented? Well, sorry, "Convention City" is lost, as well, just have to look "Tarzan and his partner" to find out. For 1934 there is a remarkable amount of sexual innuendo and even exposed flesh. Just look at Jane's naked swim. While Tarzan is often thought of as b-adventure films made for young boys and no one else, this photo shows that the series was originally very mature. More than seventy years later it was as sexy as it was when it came out. <br /> <br /> In addition to the envelope that captures taboo nature, it is a wonderful and exciting adventure story. I have always enjoyed the jungle movies that Hollywood has taken out in the 30's and 40's, but there is little of the genre I would call good movies. "Tarzan and Sy Mate" is by far the best movie from this long-forgotten subgenre. The sequels of the monkey or natives safari attacks can still create tension today. Also the animals are too cool (especially the monkeys that throw rocks). The acting will soon not win big awards, but is definitely more than adequate for this type of picture. The film is once again stolen by Cheetah, the smartest monkey in the jungle. One of the most entertaining examples of pre-code Hollywood out there.
