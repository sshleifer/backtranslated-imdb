Monstrous mother-son duo (Alice Krige and Brian Krause) suck the virgin power of life, and their latest target is beautiful but lonely Tanya (Madchen Amick). However, these specimens are allergic to cat scratches. I've never been a fan of sleazy, over-rated bestsellers such as King, Koontz or Barker, but this B-movie, written by Mr. Dung itself, is actually not that bad. Yes, it is sometimes jaw-sadly horrible, but there are actually some surprisingly impressive touches: good old-fashioned cemetery, ominous soundtrack and candlelight-gothic home scene, mirror depicting the monstrous form of the villains. The film was polluted by Mr. Dung's potjie-mouth dialogue and the all-tactic-of-toilet seat obsession to cheat fat, leading to a completely useless subplot of rapist teacher, but there are roses among the fog.
