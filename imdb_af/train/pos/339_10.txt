I read Schneebaum's book (the same title as this movie) when it was first published and was deeply surprised by his ability through the many ways of "differentness" (his own and the people of the Amazon with whom he lived and loved to see a way to live a decent life. His subsequent books were not as powerful, but showed his ongoing quest. His description of his sexual relations with the men of the tribe was far from his time in the early 60's, but his honesty and openness about it was welcome. This film beautifully gives both the peculiarity and generosity of the man, but also gives a glimpse of the inevitable destruction of innocence (which is not a morally positive term in this case) that occurs when "civilized" men enter traditional societies . Nevertheless, Schneebaum itself has changed into a kind of higher innocence which makes it possible to save mankind from its own destructiveness.
