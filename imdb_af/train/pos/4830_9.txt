Despite some reviews that were clearly Luke warm, I found the story completely over and even if some critics described the love story as 'Mills and Boon', so what? It is good to see a warm, pleasant story of true love in these cynical times. Many in the audience were sniffing their eyes. You really believe that young Victoria and Albert are passionate about each other, although it was a regular marriage for political reasons. I did feel that Sir John Conroy, who was desperate to control the young queen, might also have played like a pantomime villain. As it is rumored that he was actually Victoria's true father (due to a relationship with her mother, The Duchess of Kent), it would have been interesting to explore this theory. Emily Blunt is quite convincing as the young Princess, trapped in the suffocating palace with courtiers and politicians to manipulate her. She portrays the power of character and determination, which eventually made Victoria a great queen of England, who had never been successful in her long government. I believe that mouth-to-mouth recommendations will ensure great success for this most enjoyable and wonderful movie.
