The Rookie is based on the true story of a major 40-year-old school teacher in Big Lake, Texas. Jimmy Morris (Dennis Quaid) is a small town high school science teacher and baseball coach. His team lost terribly until the team discovered that their coach had played in minor leagues and could throw a high of 98 mph. <br /> <br /> After throwing the batting practice and making a bet, Jim agrees that if his team wins regionally, he will try the big leagues. The film tells the story that Jimmy is playing in the majors in his first game. It's a wonderful story and a very friendly family movie. Dennis Quaid makes the movie worthwhile, gives an emotional performance and is supported by an excellent supportive role that includes: Brian Cox, Rachel Griffiths and Angus T. Jones. <br /> <br /> The story takes a while to develop and some scenes are a bit slow, but it all works well at the end. The baseball scenes are fun, well-filmed and exquisitely portrayed. The movie is not about baseball, but about one man's pursuit of his dream. It's inspiring, it's emotional, and it's funny. I liked it, I hope you do. <br /> <br /> The Rookie. Summary: Dennis Quaid, Brian Cox, Rachel Griffiths, and Angus T. Jones. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 5 stars.
