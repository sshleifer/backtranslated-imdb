I had the pleasure of seeing this beautiful movie last night, with the wonderful addition of a quiz and answer session with the director following the show. I suspect that the first fan never lost a parent or someone close to them in death. I had many such losses, and this movie was talking to me. One of the most important themes is how we do not deal with questions / issues / stories with our loved ones until it is too late - they are too rude or dead before it happens. Talk to your loved ones, listen to and record their stories, tell people you love, solve differences. I loved the message that there were no mistakes. I love the director's portrayal of the relationship between the two daughters - as one of six brothers and sisters, it is clear to me that he understands how complex those relationships are. His history as a cinematographer is also hard and clear - what a beautiful movie! The casting is outstanding - a movie not to be missed!
