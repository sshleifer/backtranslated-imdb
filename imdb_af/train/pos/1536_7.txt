The stricter the drama, the better the movie of sister rivalry! This gem was promoted mainly as a comedy at its release in Sweden, so I'm glad to find it wasn't the whole case. Funny pieces in the small town are there to surely enjoy, but the drama takes the middle stage, as the story progresses. And not just a family drama, it also brings interesting questions about respect for the different lifestyle choices of different people. <br /> <br /> Great character ensemble with many beautiful and moving dramatic scenes giving credibility; And they're not just scattershot, but keep everything in place. It just takes me that if Ingmar Bergman made it (the drama would suit him!), International attention would probably be immediate. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 of Ozjeppe.
