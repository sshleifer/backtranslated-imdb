Sidney Franklin's "The Good Earth" achieved classic status thanks to a timeless story and great acting, especially from Luis Ranier, who won an Oscar for her portrayal of O-Lan. Rainers' performance is so complete, she is almost unrecognizable. With very little dialogue throughout the film (and it's a long one), Rainer rests rather on face and body language. She looks and trades Chinese to the point that someone who is unfamiliar with her work can easily miss her. <br /> <br /> Today, the film remains relevant because it explores the rags of wealth story and its universal themes. . When Lung and wife O-Lan eventually make financial success after years of famine and poverty, they find a life full of possessions, but they have no meaning. It is only when they return to the earth after they hit a swarm of locusts (the special effects used to create them are still incredible and beautiful to look at) that they find fulfillment again. A general formula that is told with the unique perspective of a Chinese family (especially in 1937) makes the film a classic. Money is worthless without friends and family, a point that the film runs perfectly in the last 10 minutes with an emotional fulfillment.
