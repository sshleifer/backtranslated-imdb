Brothers with psychokinetic powers (yes, really) do not only double for Debra Winger's passions, but really about a secret of their childhood that they have forfeited. <br /> <br /> There are surrealistic touches (the firefighter acting like a singing Greek choir), but there is also humor and romance. The soundtrack is very similar to the way American Werewolf in London used every big Wolf song they could get ~ but with fire ~ and I don't think I'll ever forget Dennis Quaid (mmmmm Dennis Quaid), and his own trailer a rockin 'to' She is a lady '~ priceless;) <br /> <br /> Best line missing from the quotes section VAT ~' Once you've had a clown, you'll never go back! '<br /> <br /> I love this movie (I ordered the DVD from the USA) and as the comments written by the kind of people who would be happier with Legally Blond 3, don't be terrified!
