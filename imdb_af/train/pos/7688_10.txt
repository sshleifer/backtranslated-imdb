Back in 74, Eric Monte made the classic T.V show Good Times. JJ has always been my favorite and I like to watch the Reruns on T.V Land. Jimmie Walker was always the star and not Ester Rolle. John Amos felt jealous of Jimmie Walker's popularity most of the time, winning millions of fans to sit down and watch Good Times. The show would have been dead if JJ hadn't been able to save it with his always Coal Aid. Drinking COOL AID was like his favorite thing on the show. I was 3 when it came out and 8 when it ended. Instead of 1974-1979, it should have been longer as in the 1980s when I was just growing up.
