John Waters gave us an enjoyable movie. It's certainly not without its shocking Waters-cute moments, but it's tamer than its older cult items, such as "Pink Flamingoes". "Pecker" rakes back to John's early mainstream stage by reminding the viewer of the same kind of humor found in Polyester. Overall, a very funny comedy with some fantastic moments!
