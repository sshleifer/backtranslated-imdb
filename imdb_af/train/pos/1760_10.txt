The 40-year-old virgin (2005) **** Steve Carell, Catherine Keener, Paul Rudd, Romany Malco, Seth Rogen, Elizabeth Banks, Leslie Mann, Jane Lynch, Gerry Bednob, Shelley Malil, Kat Dennings. Hysterically funny high-concept comedy about the titular Andy Stitzer (marvelously played by perennial second banana Carell in a truly extraordinary comic breakthrough performance, sure to stratosphere to the A list), a technical services representative for an electronic store in Southern California, which has invented its mysterious identity by a trio of well-meaning, but totally clueless, co-friends (Rudd, Malco & Rogen, each one funnier than the next) who were determined to thrive on their friend, whatever the cost. What follows is an unlikely, but very sad romance with a lively mother (the wonderful Keener has lots of fun here) which leads to more fuel at the Andy fires. A surprisingly benevolent and unapologetically raunchy romantic comedy; the funniest since "There is something about Maria" with a spectacular striking script by director Judd Apatow and Carell containing some amazing gut-busting rows, including a spectacularly accurate David Caruso joke, homophobic debunking ribbing, send-ups of "date-a-paloozas" and the destruction of the wars of the generations with a fiery aplomb. A true winner and a direct classic; the funniest movie of the year.
