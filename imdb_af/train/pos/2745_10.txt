I have seen many movies, but 'In Cold Blood' stands alone in a class by itself. It performs in every department. The fact that it contains some big stars helps to push it up, as you pay more attention to the characters and their story rather than the name on the market. Blake and Wilson turn in the star performances of the killer duo. The fact that many of the films are filmed in the real places where the crime took place, even inside the house, adds additional chills. The black and white photography illuminates the mood and photography is wonderful. There are many outstanding movie works out there, but if I can just vote for one to top the list, it'll probably be "In Cold Blood".
