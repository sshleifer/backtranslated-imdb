I'm on the opposite side of the previous comment. <br /> <br /> First of all, I don't think it was meant to be a straightforward follow-up of "The Jerk". I mean, it's not titled "The Jerk 2" ... it's "The Jerk, Too", which leads me to believe that while many of the character names are the same, it's actually a completely different person. /> <br /> Think about it: Virtually no relation to the previous movie except character names; a totally different story; different cast; and the fact that it is a partial musical. <br /> <br /> I say, give this movie some credit. It has a lot of laughter in it. Mark Blankfield at his first.
