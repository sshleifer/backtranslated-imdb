I have this movie available for streaming on Netflix and thought I'd try it. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around Ryan and Theo Taylor (Colm Feore and David Cubitt) who eventually saw each other their father died. Ryan and Theo first debate who did this. But later, Theo finds out that his brother Ryan is not only gay, but he is dying of a terminal illness. So, Ryan and Theo spend their time refurbishing their differences. <br /> <br /> It's such an amazing movie. I only saw Colm Feore in Season 7 of 24, but he was phenomenal in it. David Cubitt, an actor I've never heard before, also did a phenomenal job. <br /> <br /> I would recommend it to those interested in the Gay and Lesbian genre. It's a movie you don't want to miss. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 10 stars out of 10. Excellent movie!
