Strange erotic shock Gothic horror that will be loved by Hammer House or Horror fans worldwide. It seems to be an interesting sight about "Beauty and the Beast". It is certainly a look and a surprisingly well maintained one when considering the genre and the era. <br /> <br /> Corsets, castles, squares, disaster faux monsters in the bush, proving that no one had a Brazilian man. in the 70's, and more body fluids than you might shake a stick, the more you might have? <br /> <br /> It definitely relieved me on Sunday afternoon!
