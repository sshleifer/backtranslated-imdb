It's a great British movie. A cleverly watched script with many touchable lines, which perfectly captures what magic mushrooms can do to a man over a weekend. As usual, Phil Daniels is great with the most upset British actors Geoff Bell. Peter Bowles with a joint hanging out of his mouth is a decisive masterpiece and Gary Stretch with his breeding appearance brings something strange to the atmosphere. Although it seems to be billed as a biker movie, I think it will find an audience outside it, purely on the assumption that many people were there and got the t-shirt. Also a great original soundtrack with a blinding version of Freebird. It can really be a 21st century heir to the famous Ealing comedies. Like the weeds in the Welsh fields: it is a producer!
