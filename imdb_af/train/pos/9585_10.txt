Wonderfully composed. I wish there was a follow-up of this documentary to follow on the lives of some and lose the lives of others. There must be a part two. A real one. It was wonderful. The movie wasn't long enough. I want to know why the creator of the movie didn't follow !! This is so important for the community period. Well, if you read it, consider doing another documentary of this kind. I'm tired of hearing na√Øve writers how Aids and Men go together when they're not the heteros we have to investigate. This film didn't even bother to mention HIV or AIDS, and I was so happy about it. I also greatly appreciated the breakdowns and definitions. Thank you very much for the fact that this film exists.
