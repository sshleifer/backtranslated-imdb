I can't stop saying how much I loved this movie. This movie is one of the least known and one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. The movie follows the exploitation of a rap group, NWH (Ni # $% rs with Hats). It's from the beginning of the group to the end of the group after it's tragic. According to the group, documentary author Nina Blackburn. <br /> <br /> The movie is on a scant budget, but it doesn't seem important, it's a very well-crafted, well-crafted movie and the performances of all these actors and actresses are excellent. The main strength of this movie is the writing, there are so many brilliant lines and ascents on rap in this movie, it's unreal. <br /> <br /> SPOILER <br /> <br /> There are tasks on real rappers, such as MC Slammer, Vanilla Sherbert, Ice Cold, Tone Def, Tastey Taste and songs (Booty Juice, Grab your Dick , Etc. Rusty Condieff made an excellent movie. In the movie he plays rapper Ice Cold. The movie doesn't stop, it's funny from the start to the end. <br /> <br /> The movie works so well because it sometimes gets illegal, but it hits the line where it's funny without going too far. Listening to the three clues, trying to speak a kind of philosophy, was one of the best parts of the movie, such as Tone Def, who tells a record producer. If you take the bus, do you come there and the producer responds? it is deep! <br /> <br /> The group that NWH portrays has a kind of natural chemistry to them. They work so well together and they manage to move this movie to where there is not a week's moment in the movie. What really makes this movie so good is how true for some of the rap groups of the time this movie is. Many rap groups had problems with violence, with sensors, and like the NWA, the group only became popular when the business started making a big problem out of the controversial lyrics. <br /> <br /> I like this movie because it's offensive. There is something here to insult everyone in a good way. The movie also has a good number of people outside rap, the funniest creature of Spike Lee. Where they enter into this dialogue, I cannot imagine. The movie has line to line that will roll you on the floor. As I said, writing is just fine. <br /> <br /> I'm not surprised that this movie had such limited release. It is an intelligent, controversial, and even thought-producing film. This is too much for the mainstream, despite being hilarious and virtually flawless in its production. There are no big stars, but many well-known faces, including Marc Lawrence, who plays Tone Def. Look at this movie, at least you'll definitely have an opinion on it.
