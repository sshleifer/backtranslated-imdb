I just watched this movie and I can honestly say it's a work of art. I was very surprised to see the overall rating as 5.2. <br /> <br /> Not only does Guy ab list (ish) film together and make them into such glorious characters, he has given us a movie with a fantastic diverse story line with many links to the imagination. <br /> <br /> Too many people want movies with a plot that can be understood and given to them on a board. Yet it is the films that become poor reviews because they are too predictable. <br /> <br /> This movie is special. Get it now!
