This film is a beautiful piece that will even convince the most skeptical viewer that Gerard Depardieu is one of the best film actors of the past 50 years. His performance shocks, entertaines, reproaches and charms you while leaving you breathless. This film was shot in the early days of his film career and is very mournful, but can still take over Depardieu's mastery. A must-see for any Depardieu fan and by far his best early work.
