I recently discovered (May 2008) that this childhood favorite was available as a DVD. Although I've seen many high-quality movies since the late 1970s (I was 10 in 1978), this three-episode, low-budget is still strong. <br /> <br /> What's fun is I watched it with my ten-year-old daughter, and she's just the same as I remember from the back: The creepy music (she had to hold my hand, though she was educated is watching LotR and Resident Evil), the ever-changing theories of who the culprit is actually and also complaining about the plays of an era before Norway discovers the difference between acting and movie viewing. <br /> <br /> This is the only good science fiction movie (or series) ever made in Norway. And it's still worth watching.
