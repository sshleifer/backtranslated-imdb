Cassandra Peterson originally created Elvira as a television host of late-night horror movies, and when the character was unexpectedly popular, she made herself everything from beer sales to The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson. She reached the pinnacle of her popularity in the late 1980s, and the film ELVIRA, MISTRESS OF THE DARK was the result. <br /> <br /> The plot is flying weight. TV horror movie host Elvira dreams of success in Las Vegas. When her big aunt dies, she travels to New England in the hope that the estate will provide enough money to return a stage show; she is disappointed to find she inherited a house, a poodle and an old book. It happens that the town is puritanically above all description, and she lures righteous indignation wherever she goes. It also happens that her great uncle is secretly a wickedness and many plan to lay hands on the old book. Throw a couple of teens, a stud muffin and a hateful woman with fake items and you go there. <br /> <br /> No one will accuse it of being a movie masterpiece, and it occasionally carries. However, Cassandra Peterson shows a tremendous flair from start to finish: squirmy, sexy, and with a sharp comedy with a sharp comedy, she dances through the movie like a ringmaster in a circle of jerky and often self-joking jokes. From a FLASHDANCE disaster to witchcraft madness, she is never less than very entertaining. It's a great deal of fun, and the film's conclusion even succeeds in generating significant tension. Will Elvira handle her evil uncle and save the day? Well, I don't want to give anything, so let's say you'll have a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> DVD quality is good and there is little in the way of bonus material, but if you're in the mood for something stupid, this one will be sure to answer the urge. And if you've never seen it before, you're in for a surprise. Recommended. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Reviewer
