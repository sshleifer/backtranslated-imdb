Things to come is an early Sci-Fi movie showing an imaginary world, or "Everytown" by 100 years. You can divide it into about 4 different scenes or parts. The film stretches from 1940 to 2036 and deals mainly with how this ruler or "boss" would have the ability to fly into airplanes again after everytown was bombed and the war broke out. <br /> <br /> Only this movie has about 3 errors: the sound is muddy and video has some features, the characters are not deep at all and the overall plot is not quite solid. The plot is missing something I can't rub ... it just looks a little "fluffy". But if you like sci-fi and are interested in what H.G. Wells may happen in the next hundred years, this is a must see. It is worth seeing just to learn from what everyone is fearing: a long, protracted war, as they were about to fight with Germany, and there was a threat to biological weapons and everything. <br /> <br /> Upcoming things are a good movie that most people should see once.
