To judge this movie, you really have to think about the genre it is supposed to be: kids. They have more guidelines to follow to make this movie (which means it can't come with the humor and the language of the 1st way). Everything in this movie was nice and fun to watch. Follow-ups usually make me nervous, but this did well for himself. Knowing that it did not have the strength of Fraiser as George, they capitalized on the humor and I believe that Showeman did well as the lead. The plot is easy to follow and perhaps the campsite at times comes in handy to a younger audience, if you want to see a movie and hope for academic awards, it is not, but if you are a simple, fun, energy-filled movie look you will make a good choice with this one.
