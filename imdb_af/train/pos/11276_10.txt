Hard to believe, but this film was condemned as immoral from more pulp than any other film produced before the imposition of the bluenose Hayes code. Yes, priests actually told their flock that everyone who is going to see this movie has committed a mortal sin. <br /> <br /> I don't make it up. They have several reasons, as follows: <br /> <br /> Item: Jane loves sex. She and Tarzan are woken up one morning in their trunk. She stretches sensually, and with a biscuit look she says, "Tarzan, you were a bad boy!" So they didn't just have sex, they had kinky sex! A few years later, under the Hays code, people (especially women) were not supposed to be portrayed as sex. <br /> <br /> Item: Jane prefers a guilty, if wise and inventive, cruel (Tarzan) to a civilized, respectable nine-to-five-man (Holt). Once Holt raged her with a nice dress from London, she waved a little; when Holt tries to kill Tarzan, and Holt and Jane both believe he is dead, she swings a lot. But when she realized her husband was alive, civilization's attractions disappeared. And why not? Tarzan and Jane's relationship are egalitarian: he does not have the "civilized" insecurity that would force him to declare himself "the head of his wife". To start, he has many more "civilized" hang-ups, for example jealousy. When Holt and his friend arrive, Tarzan warmly greets them, knowing that Holt is Jane's old flame. When Holt drops her in a London dress and slowly dance to a portable phonograph, Tarzan falls from a tree and pulls his knife. Jealous? Nope. He's only careful about the strange music machine, as he has never seen one. Once explained, he is cool. <br /> <br /> Item: Divorced Holt is filthy. Savage Tarzan is innocent sexy. While Jane slips into Holt's lamp tent, Holt goes away and looks at her silhouette as she changes into the fine dress. In contrast, after Tarzan's playful dressing down, penetrated into the swimming hole and dived into her, the most tasteful erotic nude scene in all movies follows: the couple spend five minutes in a beautiful water ballet. filmed in three versions - dressed, topless and nude - the scene was cut before the film's release, but the new version is restored in the video now available.) And if Jane emerges, and Cheetah steals the chimpanzee's dress just for a pest, Jane makes it clear that her irritation is just because of the proximity of "civilized" men and their hangers. Where is the "universal wisdom" so fond of the hearts of seminars? Nowhere is this true. Another reason why the hanger saw this film as sinful. <br /> <br /> Item: The idea that man is the crown of creation and animals here only for man's use and comfort, takes a serious knock. Holt and his friend want to be led to the "elephant cemetery" so that they can pick up the ivory and take it home. They want Tarzan to lead them to the cemetery. You, reader, think "Opportunity!" And you're right. He's shocked. He cried out, "Elephants sleep!" who explained to him everything. Jane explains Tarzan's feelings, which the two "lords" find ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Item: Jane, the formerly civilized woman, is much more resourceful than the two civilized men she accompanies. Holt and girlfriend blow it and find themselves besieged by hostile tribes and wild animals. It is Jane who keeps her cool. While the boys are panicking, take his order, blow orders with them and knock out the guns. <br /> <br /> Item: Jane's costume is a kind of poncho with nothing under it. (The original idea was that she had to be topless, with leaves artificially blocking her nipples, which did happen in one short scene.) Finally, several men complained of the cloth because the film was called Tarzan and Sy Mate rather than Tarzan and his woman. No comments! <br /> <br /> Of course, Tarzan, who is backed by his monkey friends, comes to the rescue, stirs the white hunters and causes the elephants and African carriers to return the ivory. they went to the holy place from where it came. The end. <br /> <br /> So there you have it. A completely subversive movie. Like all the other films about complex and interesting women (see, for example, possession with Rita Hayworth and Raymond Massey) who were such a flowing genre in the early 30s and brought to such a sudden end by the acceptance of the Hays code. <br /> <br /> The joie de vivre of this movie is best expressed by Jane's soprano version of the famous Tarzan Yellow. A good contact, unfortunately left in future productions. <br /> <br /> Let's hear it for artistic freedom, feminist Jane and sex.
