This movie is great to lift up the spirits. <br /> <br /> Every time I see it, I see and hear funny little things I've missed before. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is incredible. Mick Jones (Foreign) and Chris Difford (Squeeze) wrote the songs and made Strange Fruit the best thing that hit today's music scene. <br /> <br /> Strange Fruit, unfortunately, is a strictly fictional crop from 60's to 70's band that was never good to start with because of drug use and inner struggle. One wonders what could have been while listening to their fanatical soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Inspiring the fruits of The Rolling Stones, Deep Purple, David Bowie and The Who. <br /> <br /> Every member of fruit is pretty memorable. Stephen Rea star, who was shot dead, broke Tony Costello, who was asked by a festival promoter to reunite his band for a reunion tour, hoping to reap financial benefits. Costello gets closer to ex-roadie Karen Knowles, played by Juliet Aubrey, to help him regain the flame of a dream long past. <br /> <br /> Juliet collects the bitter Jimmy Nail (Les Wickes), blundering Timothy Spall David 'Beano' Baggot, and exaggerated glamorous Ray Simms (Bill Nighy). Tumbling in is another ex-roadie, the hippie-toker-joker star Hughie (Billy Connolly), who never burns the flame. <br /> <br /> If Juliet is looking for the last member of their motley band, elusive guitarist songwriter Brian Lovell (played by bustling Bruce Robinson) has crucified reunited members, like older times about the tremendous talent of each. <br /> <br /> The group then gets the opportunity to prepare a small Dutch tour for the festival. With the young Hendrix-like Lukas Shand (Hans Matheson) taking the place of Lovell, the crew hit the road. The sparks fly like their memories flare forward and threaten to burn their unfinished purposes ... Be prepared to laugh, sing, courage and cry, as these unforgettable characters eat into your hearts. .
