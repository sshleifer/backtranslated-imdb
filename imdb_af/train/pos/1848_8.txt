Several years ago, the fleet had a distance from the men of honor, a film based on the experiences of the service's first black master's chief diver's struggle to overcome violent racism. Ever been keen to support films that make our Navy's best side the U.S.S. Nimitz and two helicopter attackers, with supporting beach installations, were provided to complement this invasive story of a young sailor's struggle with uncontrollable anger. Some of the movies were shot aboard the US. Belleau Wood. <br /> <br /> Antwone Fisher wrote the script for Denzel Washington's director's debut in which he died as a Navy psychiatrist treating Fisher, effectively and deeply by Derek Luke. <br /> <br /> Fisher is a clear clear man assigned to USS Belleau Wood (LHA-3), a pre-ruler helicopter attack platform. Fisher can't seem to start his own attacks on the least of his fellow-designated men. As part of a possible pre-separation process, Fisher is slowly being opened to the black psychiatrist, who reveals a terrible childhood of great neglect and movable brutality. <br /> <br /> The story develops as Fisher cautiously, but increasingly his doctor trusts and gets the courage to pursue a love affair, a designated sailor named Cheryl, played by an astonishingly beautiful Joy Bryant. <br /> <br /> Fisher reluctantly enters the doctor by asking long questions, but he soon realizes that the answers should be, but painfully, growing and moving away from conflict-seeking destructive behavior. <br /> <br /> While all the main characters are black, this story surpasses race while the ominous religion appears to be evil and associated hypocrisy in foster families. Viola Davis, a versatile actress seen in a number of recent films, is a picture of stupidity, but is nothing compared to foster mother, Mrs. Tate (Novella Nelson), who would deserve short but tearing scenes - if Oscar existed for gut-churning brutality. <br /> <br /> Movies about patient therapy interaction follow a certain predictability (all transfer and counter-transfer) but the seriousness of Fisher and his doctor / mentor is realistic. That's a good story, well said. Period. <br /> <br /> While being put in the Navy, "Antwone Fisher" is not really a service story like "Men of Honor", an excellent movie dealing with crushing racism against a real person . It's not really a movie about blacks either. It's about surviving terrible childhood experiences and, as Fisher says, in adulthood can say the victim is still "high". The persecutors shrink in size and meaning as a brave and strong young man, with the help of a caring doctor, claiming his right to a decent life. <br /> <br /> My only doubt is that Washington is a lieutenant commander, but addressed as commander. With all the Navy supporters listed in the final credits, someone told Director Washington that his character, like all naval officers under the rank of commander, is being addressed as "Mister". Not a big criticism, is it? :) <br /> <br /> I don't know why this movie is playing in so few theaters. It generates widespread distribution. Derek Luke may get an Oscar nomination. <br /> <br /> 8/10. <br /> <br />
