Pakeezah has a very interesting history (well documented in the 'Trivia' section) on how it happened. The fate seems to have conspired to test Kamal Amrohi (the director) while at the same time secretly wanted him to complete his masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Pakeezah rides on metaphors, poetry and visual elucidation. As a result, the intensity of emotions has a dimension that may not be very real, but very effective and impact on the viewer. <br /> <br /> Meena Kumari lives the tragedy of Nargis and Sahib Jaan as her own. The other stars of the film, except her, are Ghulam Mohammed (the music director), Lata Mangeshkar, Naushad (background) and Joseph Wirsching (the d.o.p). Their music and cinematography make you bound. <br /> <br /> Pakeezah is a classic in world cinema. It reveals new layers every time you see it again. Kamal Amrohi is one of the rare poets of the theater and he has left us all a gift.
