I don't want to endure everyone by repeating what has already been said, but this is one of the best series ever! It was a great shame when it was canceled, and I hope someone will have the good sense to pick it up and start the series again. The good news is that it is on DVD! I rushed to the store and picked up a copy and am happy to say it's just as good as I remembered. Gary Cole is a wonderful dark and creepy character, and all actors were very good. It's a pity that the network didn't continue. Shaun Cassidy, this is a masterpiece. Anyone who enjoys the genre and who has not seen it should do so. You won't be disappointed. My daughter who was too young to see it when it was on television (she is 20) is very interested and will soon be a fan. She found it "very twisted" and enjoyed the episodes she saw. I can't wait to see the episodes that haven't been broadcast. <br /> <br /> This show rocks !!!!
