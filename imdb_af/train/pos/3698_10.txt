I didn't know what this movie was before I put it in the L.A. Weekly reading. I generally agree with the reviews in the LA Weekly and decide to get a ticket for this movie. movie stars Molly Parker (of my favorite television program Deadwood) and Lukas Haas - who I suspect we'll see more in the near future. The film is funny, heart-warming, features great acting and beautiful photography. I don't know if the movie has spread, but I hope it will - or will do it soon. It is meant to be a true indie gem. it even has music by my favorite band, the silver jews! The only disappointment was that Molly Parker was not there at the show. even without her there ... it was the best movie I saw at the festival.
