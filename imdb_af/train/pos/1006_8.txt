Robert A. Heinlein's classic novel, Starship Troopers, has, in the past year, been squashed into a number of games in the film by Paul Verhoeven's 1997 film series. But none of these, to say the least, really caught the spirit of his novel. The games are usually not related, the TV series was more of a twist, and the less said about Verhoeven's film, the better. However, little does know that in Japan an animated adaptation has already been made, the year of Heinlein's death released. And, believe it or not, despite the differences, this 6-part animated series is the most faithful adaptation of Heinlein's classic. The obvious plus for this series is the presence of the exoskeletons of the armor, which we have deprived in Verhoeven's film. Like the book, the series focuses more on the characters and their relationships than on action and space travel, although we see a fair amount of each one. While events other than in the book occur, the feel of the book's plot is present. Rico and Carmen have a romantic entanglement, but it is only slightly more touched than in the book. While some believe the dialogue and character interaction is a bit inferior to the book (it gets a bit of anime treatment, but what did you expect?), But it's much better than the movie. Heinlein's political views are simply cut out, unlike the film, where they are overturned. The big payout of the series, however, is the climate battle over Klendathu between the troops and the bugs / strangers, which will have the kind of action from the powered weapon packs that we liked in a movie version. <Br /> <br /> Overall, I enjoyed this series because I wanted to see a vision closer to that of Heinlein. And I think they did it well. If you can find this series, give it a look.
