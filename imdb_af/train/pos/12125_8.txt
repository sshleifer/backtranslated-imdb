I saw this movie again and noticed how close it was to the novel if we ignored the part about Cary's [Leslie Howard] childhood. Since <br /> <br /> at the moment is not much on the screen, the character's obsession with Mildred [Bette Davis] is very well communicated to the audience. I recommend this movie to anyone who has ever fallen for another person and the other has tried to take advantage of him or her. I read that Maugham was asked to buy a recording of the novel, but when he started in the studio he started crying and he couldn't finish more than a few lines and eliminated the whole project . One can say the novel was written of the heart and the film is a good <br /> <br /> adaptation of part of it.
