How can I get the chance to see Orlando Bloom and Heath Ledger together? Well, I couldn't and if not, I rented this junk from a movie. <br /> <br /> I've never heard of Ned Kelly and was surprised at what I found out about this young man's legend. I was also amazed at how mediocre this film was. Perhaps the fact that it was very, very late and at the end of a 4-hour movie marathon, or perhaps because it was really a bit slow, I found this story difficult to follow. Not because the story is complicated, but because it is slow. Even with a slow story, Ledger and Bloom managed to create interesting, dimensional characters. <br /> <br /> Although I stuck to recommending it as a must see, it's a wonderful story of Australian history (considering how young the country is, it's very scarce and should be appreciated) and the movie does have some good actions. <br /> <br /> 6/10 sees it for historical value .... (yes right ... and that's the only reason to see it ...;))
