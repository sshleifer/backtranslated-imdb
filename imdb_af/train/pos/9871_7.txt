Back to the Lost World returned with the 1992 version of The Lost World. <br /> <br /> In this sequel, the same five people led by Challenger are returned to the plateau where a group started. drilling for oil threatening to destroy the land. Gomez has something to do with it. They manage to defeat the drillers and the plateau is saved, to the delight of the Natives. <br /> <br /> As in the lost world, which pair of dinosaurs we see is made of rubber and includes a T-Rex and Ankylosaurus. <br /> <br /> John Ryhs-Davies and David Warner repeat their roles as Challenger and Summerlee and three of the other actors are also back. <br /> <br /> Despite reading various bad reviews of these and the cheapest rubber dinosaurs, I enjoyed Back to the Lost World. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 stars out of 5.
