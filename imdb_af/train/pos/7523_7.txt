I watched this movie at the 2006 Palm Springs International Film Festival and it is a movie and not a movie, as it seems to have been shot by HBO, which is being shown on their cable network this year. This movie offers Page as a bondage and discipline fetish pinup and B & D stag film actress who had enough talent to become a true actress. Page was a bit more than that and the movie touches on some of its other roles in modeling, but not enough to balance the career of the 50's pinup icon. This film is probably based on the book "The Real Bettie Page" by Richard Foster. It was shot in black and white for that 1950's nostalgia feeling. I have the book called "Bettie Page The Life of a Pinup Legend" that contains very good pictures condemning the career of Page and I have to say that this movie is filmed on film, with Gretchen Mol as Page, much of that famous photos very accurate. Mole herself with the Bettie Page black wig and brown contact lenses is Bettie Page. Not only did she look at the Bettie Page, but she has the smile and characteristics of her personality that came perfectly through the camera. And her body is as close to a replica of the page as possible. Wonderful casting. The story is kind of thin and tabloid and could have been much better. But it's a pretty good TV movie. I will evaluate it a 7.0 of a scale of 10 and recommend it when it comes to TV.
