I like this TV show because it was his own thing. A girl who is on her sixteenth birthday finds out that she is a witch and that she lives with her aunts in the house. They are also witches. Well, it got used to it in a few weeks. When she used her power for the first time, it was so funny because she turned her enemy into a pineapple. She had to turn the time back and repeat a day. This series is really cool and it is a typical teenage series, but it was thin when she was out of her home and apartment with her fellow college friends and then it got boring and I stopped watching. I loved her aunts, they were so funny. and the other one was really ditzy. I loved Valerie and I hated Sabrina's enemy Libby. She was ugly.
