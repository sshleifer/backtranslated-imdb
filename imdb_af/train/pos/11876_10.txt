You know when you watch this Brian DePalma movie today, I'm sure there is criticism of how dated it is. Also about the violence. When I watched this movie on VHS when I was 20, I thought it was also violent and angry. But I didn't get it. <br /> <br /> A few decades go by and man, how do I know how much I haven't got in this movie !! This is a remake of an excellent movie made in the 30's / 40's. How can you improve on a classic? Ya don't. But you tell a story brought to the attention of the "new immigrants" during the most greedy decade, the surviving 80s. DePalma, Stone and the gang offer an ambitious, disturbing and darn good movie. <br /> <br /> Yes .... Disco died and New Wave / Punk took over but had to make these immigrants from Cuba. A new home in Florida could not tell the difference. It was exciting, it was what they wanted, but how to get it ???? For these immigrants there was only one way to get it in Florida, where they were. By having lots of money and getting the money, you had to take over a drug empire. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino was great to me as Tony Montana, the "little train that could". What a great way to have your main character look at America: to fight, kill, steal. lying, cheating everything to get - "the money, the women and the power." <br /> <br /> That's what Tony saw as the American dream. <br /> <br /> He wanted it, he wanted to live it and in his circle nothing was wrong with how he went to get it. Tony Montana's command of the English language was heavily saturated with the "f" word, but what did you expect, Emily Post's coaching school for him and his fellow shorts? See how they came to America, of which they knew what they were exposed to. This is the way Tony and his crew chose to be "everything they can be in America." It was all about the power. Tony Montana did and did something to achieve this. It's all his violent, lying, stealing, crooked, deceptive glory. <br /> <br /> The part of the movie that has been personalizing me for the 1980s is money laundering. Tony's crew bringing baggage to the bank. Did those around Tony and his crew take care? At the clubs where he spent and drank? Nope. Money was money and with money you get the power. Tony was high in the west. He and his pretty blonde American trophy he married played well by Michelle Pfieffer. <br /> <br /> Once Tony Montana's power came into being, he really finds it good. He's dissatisfied, he's drug addict, he's paranoid. He is surrounded by those who want to drive him into a bloody takeover. His American wife, Blonde Drug Addict 80, who he finds out, is a drill, he has to keep on top of his rich because ... he's going down. And off he goes in a terrible violent way, but again I ask, what do you expect? <br /> <br /> It's the distinctive 1980s movie that tells you about a cross-linked story of how some people misunderstand the American Dream ... for obsession. This is violent, bloody, excessive. But it drives the point home disturbingly. Not all Cubans who were thrown out of Cuba landed in Florida in the 80s, anything like Tony Montana. Give me a chance. But the show of how miserable the 1980s was with the emphasis on greed and money as the only measures in the US to be someone and power took its aid on these poor characters and their lives in America. <br /> <br /> Wondering - have you learned anything since - today?
