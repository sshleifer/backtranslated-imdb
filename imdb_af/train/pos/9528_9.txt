First, this movie went over the heads of most of its opponents. <br /> <br /> The opposite of salvation is salvation (being saved) and this movie is one of very few to deal with two concepts. The film also explores the love and disappointment of the father-son relationship. It should be mentioned from the outset that none of these fashion themes are currently. <br /> <br /> The assumption is that the fathers in the move, Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) and John Rooney Paul Newman, love their boys and will do anything to protect them. But Rooney's son Connor is even more angry than the rest. He killed one of Rooney's loyal soldiers to cover his own steal of his father. When Connor learns that Sullivan's son Michael saw it, he killed Sullivan's other son (and Sullivan's wife) in an attempt to silence witnesses. <br /> <br /> Sullivan decides he wants revenge at any price, even at the terribly high price of horse riding. Rooney, swearing in one scene on the day Connor was born, refuses to give up his son Connor to Sullivan, and hires a contract killer called Maguire (Jude Law) to kill Sullivan and his son. So Rooney goes with his son Connor on the Road to Perdition. <br /> <br /> For the rest of the movie, accompanied by his surviving son, young Michael, Sullivan follows Connor Rooney along the Road to Perdition, and Maguire strives for Sullivan. When Sullivan Rooney confronts in a basement and demands that he give up Connor because Connor killed his family, Rooney says: "Michael, there are only killers in this room ... and there is only one guarantee that none of us will see heaven. "As the movie ends, somewhat predictable, one character is rescued and one character remorse. <br /> <br /> I'm not a big Tom Hanks fan, but he stretches out of character to convincingly play the man Sullivan, a subtle and laconic show. Newman does well like the old Irish gangster Rooney, showing a hard edge in his face and manner, his eyes haunted by Connor's iniquities. Jude Law plays Maguire in a horrible way. Of course, Tyler Hoechlin plays Young Michael without affections. <br /> <br /> The cinematography continually played the light of darkness, including the themes of salvation and salvation. The camera pulled out of a palette of green and gray. The grays were of the fathers and urban landscapes of the Depression era Illinois. The green was from the younger boys and the country's rural rural areas. Thomas Newman's sumptuous, sounding and haunting music had vague Irish overtones and was played in Copland-like arrangements. The sets were authentic downtown urban factories, churches. The houses shone with shiny woodwork. <br /> <br /> The excellence of the film lies in the generation of a unique feel from its in-depth themes, distinctive acting and enveloping music and cinematography. The only negative was a slight anti-rifle message that went into the script, the film's only nod to political correctness. <br /> <br /> I give this movie a10 out of 10; in time it will be recognized as a good movie.
