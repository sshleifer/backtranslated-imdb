Hi, I was alanrickmaniac. I'm still a mad-holic. It was just another movie I watched on TV. Then I had to get the videotape to finally find out how it ended. Then I wanted the DVD, because the band showed some signs of decay after a few weeks. After the DVD I had to lay my hands on the soundtrack. Then on various film posters and the film. At the moment, it's so worse that I add people to addiction to my site and still crazy parties. <br /> <br /> How can this happen? What made me addicted? <br /> <br /> It's one of those funny but somehow sad and melancholic intelligent comedies just like the British can produce. <br /> <br /> Well, the movie is worlds apart from things like "This Is Spinal Tap", because of the characters, who are not childish or ultra cool, but really. It is a story that men also grow older. A story about men coming together. Or not. It contains some of the best actors possible. Tim Spall. Stephen Rea. Bruce Robinson. Jimmy Nail. A Bill Nighy. Bill Nighy watching one of the best shows I've ever seen in a movie. <br /> <br /> Well, the soundtrack is incredible. Foreigner Mick Jones wrote the songs for imaginary band Strange Fruit. Jimmy Nail, who plays bass man, plays Les Wickes and Bill Nighy who portray the egocentric but uncomfortable singer Ray Simms. We know about Jimmy Nail, but if you just heard Bill Nighy's song in "Love Actually", you have no idea how big and powerful his voice is. <br /> <br /> Well, you will have fever for every scene to come for the x-time, especially those concert scenes. You will die to really stand in the dancing crowd when Alien Fruits "All Over The World" do sing on top of your lungs. You want to celebrate the rebirth of the right Foreign Fruit at Wisbech's festival with thousands of people. <br /> <br /> It's hard, but ... I'm addicted to this movie. I'm addicted to Alien Fruits. If there is a world where this bond really exists, I'd like to move there. <br /> <br /> Still got mad ... anyone?
