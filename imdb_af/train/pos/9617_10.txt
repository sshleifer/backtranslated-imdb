It was a very entertaining movie and I really enjoyed it. I don't usually rent movies like this, but I was attracted to the movie because it had an incredible role, including Jamie Kennedy, whom I loved since the Scream trilogy. The movie director has a risk (and it is a risky risk) to tell the lives of many (and many different people) different people and change at different intervals. To take the risk was a good idea, because the end result is a very good movie. <br /> <br /> The movie has some MAIN characters; Dwight (Jamie Kennedy) - an unhappy fortune-teller writer whose relationship with his girlfriend is on the rocks because of an argument. Wallace Gregory (John Carroll Lynch) - an aircraft loader / technician who loves all living things (except maybe belly girls) and who, despite his good heart, has an increasing amount of crashes. Cyr (Brian Cox) - owner of a Chinese restaurant / donut shop who is a germophobe and due to his fear of germs, puts his assistant / chef Sung (Alexis Cruz) under pressure to keep up with his phobia. Ernie - (Christopher Bauer) is married to Olive - (Christina Kirk), whom he is convinced to try; stop him having fun, looking ridiculous, going insane, and not living a normal life. They start small and almost crazy arguments, and Olive seriously begs Ernie. Gordon - (Grant Heslov) is a man whose life doesn't go very well, as bad things start to pick up in his life, he decides to take it in hand. Mitchel - (Jon Huertas) is convinced that Gwen (Alexandra Westcourt) is the girl of his dreams and that they are destined for each other, although she is more skeptical. He tries to give her every chance, and he definitely makes efforts! Johnston (Michael Hitchcock) has just been fired from his job and has uncertainty about his role as a supplier. He still takes another job for which he is not fit. His wife Annelle (Arabella Field) comforted her work-loss experience until she learned that Johnston was not the loving man she thought. <br /> <br /> All in all, I definitely recommend this movie! <br /> <br /> -Erica
