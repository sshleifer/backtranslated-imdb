I have a six-month-old baby at home and from time to time his fight is really bad. One morning she had a particularly difficult time getting to sleep when the doodle bops theme song came on T.V. She was crying almost immediately and for the rest of the show was content. I sat her in her spot and watched her kick her legs, swing her arms, and actually laugh at this show. She entertained her all the time and happy. I also got a video of them so that I sometimes have something to calm her, sometimes when my little one is flustered. Given, late at night as she wakes up with colic to refurbish the doodle bops, she is not her cup of tea, but they are surely helpful when I need a while to do homework. The biggest surprise about the doodle bops is that my child doesn't even want to see T.V. She played in the floor with a toy or with our little toy herd. I don't know if she'll keep it in the future, but for now she's attached.
