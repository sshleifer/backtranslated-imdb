Greta Garbo's American film debut is an analogy of how our lives can, of course, be wiped out by fate and our actions, as in a stream of power, so that we can lose a part of ourselves along the way. <br /> <br /> Greta plays Leonora, a poor peasant girl in love with Ricardo Cortez's character, Don Rafael, a landowner. Ricardo is also in love with her, but is too easily influenced by his dominant mother. Leonora ends homeless and travels to Paris, where she becomes a well-known opera singer and develops the reputation of being a loose woman. In fact, part of her attitude is bitterness about Rafael's upliftment. <br /> <br /> She returned to her home to visit her family and eventually confront Rafael. Surprisingly, nobody knows that she is the famous La Brunna, and Garbo plays her role as the diva she really was and once again appreciated with such a cool pride in her later depictions. <br /> <br /> Ricardo Cortez reminds him a lot about Valentino looking at this part, and he was cared for by a Valentino clone by MGM, although he never thought he could be in reality and he was right . He is credible in an unsympathetic part as a poor-willed Mama's son, and allows himself realistically to come to the end of the movie. He fails to win Leonora when she returns home, and later, when he follows her, his courage is undermined. <br /> <br /> This movie is beautifully shot, with brilliant races and sets that Spain currently portrays are authentic. There are also some fine secondary performances by the old rally Lucien Littlefield, Tully Marshall and Mack Swain. <br /> <br /> Although it's a story of lost love and missed chances, I don't think Leonora and Rafael would have. was happy together, as he needed a more traditional woman and she was very much a career woman, and I don't think that would have been happy in a small town. The end is true to life and does not draw any bumps. <br /> <br /> See this one as Garbo's American movie debut and a precursor to things to come
