Eyeliner was worn in Egypt nearly 6,000 years ago. Actually, not so much of a stretch that moves around in the 12th century. I also didn't realize the series had swollen. There is a second season that is air, isn't there? It's amazing to me when comments are made by those who are poorly informed or not at all. It is a waste of space on the boards and of others' time. The first show of the series may have been a bit painful, as the role has begun to fall, but it is expected of any show. The rest of the first season is excellent. I can hardly wait for the second season to start in the United States.
