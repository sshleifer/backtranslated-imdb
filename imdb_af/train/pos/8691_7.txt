The formal nature of the relationship shared by these people is clear as even friends. They address each other using a formal you. In 1984 Resnais, while making L'amour à mort, had memory and space to unravel the mysteries of a fundamental question about human existence. Is love stronger than death? It was 16 years ago in 1968 that Resnais made a somewhat similar film, Je t'aime Je t'aime, which also deals with love and memories. People of this movie are hard and clear: true and deep love can even shame science as dead lovers get their lost lives revival to leave doctors to view their reputation. File is like a game that is not didactic at all. It's a movie in which the musical score is in perfect tandem with his images. This is one of the reasons why this film can be easily understood.
