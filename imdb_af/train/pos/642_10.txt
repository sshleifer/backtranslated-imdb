I was dragged by a French actress friend about four years ago. For the first half hour I sat in my awkward seat at the New Beverly Theater in Hollywood, which hated this movie, Hate myself and even hate the French actress. And then ... <br /> <br /> I don't know what happened, but I was drawn into the movie in a way I didn't have in years. And that was despite the fact that one of the projectors broke and had to do every action manually. I was in the theater for almost four hours, but it was worth it. <br /> <br /> I believe big movies are pulling you into a world, making you a part and then dropping to talk to your friends about coffee or a drink. This movie did it. It was one of the best film-story experiences I've ever had. <br /> <br /> <br />
