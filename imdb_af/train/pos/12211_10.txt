By Hook or By Crook is an incredibly innovative film of some extremely clever and talented filmmakers, Harry Dodge and Silas Howard. They can tell an original story in a distinctive film style, and it is beautifully shot by Ann T. Rosetti, and wonderfully written - truly poetic. <br /> <br /> The main characters are true heroes and serve as a rare type of role model / inspiration for butch dykes and trannies everywhere. This film has so much energy, so much passionate passion and sly San Francisco heart on it. I can't recommend it highly enough! <br /> <br /> The best butch buddy movie of all time!
