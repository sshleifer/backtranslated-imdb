That's how I feel about the show. <br /> <br /> I started watching the show in 2001. <br /> <br /> I enjoy the show, but it has too many errors. <br /> <br /> I hate the MICHELLE & JOEY CHARACTERS! <br /> <br /> Show story lines of old TV shows. They even stole from "The Partirdge Family". Then, in one episode, "The Partridge Family" was called. <br /> <br /> Actors play different roles in different episodes. MTV Martha Quinn is the most remarkable thing to do, especially when she played herself in one episode. <br /> <br /> The Michelle character can't take a joke, but then they made this little kid revenge on her sisters for joking on them. <br /> <br /> Story lines that came and went in 1 episode. Joey got the TV program with Frankie & Annette, after which he never heard of it. Danny suddenly plays the guitar. 1 episode he practices football, 1 episode, he studies softball / baseball. 1 game and you are from huh danny? <br /> <br /> Jesse & Joey really really stay without any experience. Just in a TV show. <br /> <br /> I like the D.J. & Stephanie characters. Wish Jodie Sweetin learned from Candace Cameron Bure and had a clean NON drug adult life.
