Will you all load the Todd Sheets!?! Let's give you $ 30,000 to make a movie and see what you come with! The man has 735 zombies and a regular cast to work for FREE! Sure, the acting is sometimes ridiculous. Yes, the makeup is not the biggest you will ever see. But it's also not the worst, if you want to see it, look at the Zombie Nation with its raccoon zombies. <br /> <br /> It's pure, good old-fashioned guerilla film-making! Todd is a perfect professional and a very good man. There are holes in the plot, yes. The plot seems far-fetched. But what the hell, I still love this movie. I wish Todd Sheets would come out of the hiding and remake these things he was going to do. If someone ever tried to make a movie, they know it's just done, a feat in and of itself.
