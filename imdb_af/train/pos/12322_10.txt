This movie is one of my favorites. It's a genre mix with ingredients from the Action / Horror / Romantic / Comedy genre. Some of the special effects may look outdated compared to modern standards. This slight error is easily ignored. There is so much to discover in this story. The romantic relationship between the two main characters is so beautiful that it hurts. The visuals are also beautiful. The action is wonderful, it's no surprise, it comes from Honkong, the birthplace of the world's best action movies. The humor sometimes looks a little silly, but in a good way. Somehow, this movie can balance the different moods and stay good. Absolutely recommended.
