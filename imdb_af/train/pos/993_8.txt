Actually, this movie wasn't that bad. It contains action, comedy and excitement. There are good actors in this movie, for example Doug Hutchison (Percy of "The Green Mile"), who plays Bristol. Another well-known actor is Jamie Kennedy, from "Scream" and "Three Kings". The main characters are played by Jamie Foxx as Alvin, who was good and funny, but the one that surprised me most was David Morse and Edgar Clenteen. He plays a different character from what he usually does, because in other films like "The Green Mile", "Indian Runner", "The Negotiator" or "The Langoliers" he plays a very sympathetic person, and in "Aas" plays the play almost The opposite, a man without any emotions, which was nice to see. The only very negative thing about this movie is the different pictures of the World Trade Center, which may seem a bit dated. Overall, I thought it was a pretty good movie!
