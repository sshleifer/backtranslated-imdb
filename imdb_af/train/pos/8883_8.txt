Film design is the alpha and omega of some of the major issues in this country (USA). We see relationships everywhere in the university environment for the film. Satisfactory, the obvious of student vs. teacher is present. But what the film adds to its value is its other relationships: male vs. wife, white vs. black, and the individual vs. society. But most importantly and in direct relation to all the other relationships is the individual vs. himself. <br /> <br /> I was surprised at how bilaterally a director gave a view to show the race relationships on campus. Most of the films typically show the injustices of one side while showing the suffering of the other. This film showed the injustice and suffering on both sides. It did not attempt to show how good it was, although I would say the skinheads were a lot more cruel and gruff (very clear at the end). The film also discusses sex and rape. Ironically, this is the injustice that somehow brings the two races together. Lawrence Fishburne does an over-the-top performance as the soft-haired Prophesor Phipps. He crumbles the idea of ​​racial favortism and rather shows the parallelism of the lazy and desiccated with the zealous and positive. Other stars that make this movie are Omar Epps, Ice Cube and Jennifer Connelly. Michael Rapaport gives an excellent portrayal of a confused youth with misguided anger seeking acceptance. Tyra Banks makes her film debut and proves that supermodels can act. <br /> <br /> Higher learning gets its name to show college than more than going to class and getting a piece of paper. In fact, I would say the film is almost a satire to show students interaction with each other, rather than a dry book, than the right education at a university. It's a life-learning process, not a textual one. I think you will find that "Higher Learning" is the key issue at many universities and even life in general. 8/10
