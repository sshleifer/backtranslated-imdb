Based on the preview I saw, I went to "Shower" and expected a lovely comedy. What I found was an in-depth drama of family life that in some of the most lush photographic images I have ever been privileged to see. In addition, I later considered that I appreciate the abrupt cuts to past scenes (in the dry countryside of North China and the high plain of Tibet): isn't that how memory often works? One moment I am here, the next I am in a landscape of the past, just like that. <br /> <br /> Not only would I highly recommend this movie, I would recommend it to the two. or three best movies I've seen in my 60 years. <br /> <br /> By the way, a few years ago, another Asian "comedy" was released in the United States as "Shall We Dance?" (Japanese). Just as with "Shower", the preview did not give the slightest indication of the depth of that film, which apparently was a subtle psychological study (though full of funny moments). Is there a fear of distributors making movies "important" or "deep" to look at your S. viewers?
