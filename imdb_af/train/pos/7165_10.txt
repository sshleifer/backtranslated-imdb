I recorded these centuries ago, but just came around to watch it today. I was sick, so things ran out of the closet to watch! I'm so glad I saw it, and I could erase my memory for the first time. This movie is so wonderful! This reminded me of Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistlestop Cafe. <br /> <br /> The story goes back in time and at the end of the movie we see what the connections are. Some people said it was a children's movie. I disagree - it may be made by Disney and many characters are kids, but I'm 23 and I love it! There were moments when my spine was tingling. The story is quite different today from any other movie, full of adventure. I just ordered the book from Amazon, can't wait!
