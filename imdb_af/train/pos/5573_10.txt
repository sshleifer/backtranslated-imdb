A MUST SEE! I saw WIPPED at a press screen and it was hilarious. We are talking non-stop laughing. It makes SOMETHING like a winding drama. Amanda Peet shouts star quality with her winning combination of beauty, brain, and serious acting ability. Peter Cohen, the director, made a foremost film showing the raw inside of men's egos in the urban dating world. For all his comedies, it succeeds with the intelligence. It's so scarce for a first time director, especially with a romantic comedy. He's a great talent. Judah Judge, Brian Van Holt, Jonathan Abrahams, and Zorie Barber make the dough with depth and very strong performances as it would be. You have to see these guys go to work and get caught in Peet's web. Look at the trailer at whipped.com, it's worth the 3 minute download.
