All the people who review this movie, and probably many professional film judges, just don't get it. This film is made with mattresses and art techniques, just like the works of the great Czech filmmaker, Karel Zeman. If you want to know what I'm talking about, I suggest you get any of Zeman's movies, like The Fabulous World or Jules Verne, Baron Munchausen, Travel to the Beginning of Time or Comet. If you can't find a movie, read the reviews in AMG. They will explain the processes used. Looking at Zeman's work and trying to compare it to any of the other sci / fi fantasy movies of the time, the viewer would probably not have found it either. It is unfair to compare one of these filmmakers' styles to the standard technology of the day, because both Zemen and Hines "do not calculate". They have a style that is unique to them and should only be judged for their creativity. Looking at this movie from a perspective where you KNOW that it has deliberately tried to make a pastiche collage of measures mixed with live action, you can easily conclude that it has done a masterful job . It's not easy to make a lot of computer expressions. I thought the creatures were also pretty good, and also about how they were made. Hines threw a big chance, and I think his movie won't be judged fairly for years to come. Someone who promoted the movie had to cut off the audience about what they would see, rather than blindly go into the theater expecting the usual CG work. Regarding the actors, I think Hines also took a page from Zemen's book, as many of Zemen's actors were initially a little expressionless, but became much more applied than film and action. It is quite refreshing for me to have this movie in my library. I'll see it for the coming year, all three of the great hours of it.
