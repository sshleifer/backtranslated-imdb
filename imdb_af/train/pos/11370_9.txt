Spoilers - as far as I describe characters and their relationship to the plot. <br /> <br /> It's a quality movie. The subject is immediately grim and gripping. The determined determination of Stephen Rea's character, Burakov, is simply fascinating. With any excuse to him, his hangdog, constantly offensive expression, the character serves well. He is bound to be grim, as we would say in England's Inspector Taggart TV series character, because he sees three murders a week. Well, it's not strictly accurate as Chikatila has been operating over a number of years. <br /> <br /> You get a real sense of the whiteworm resistance of the USSR bureaucracy, brilliantly portrayed by Joss Ackland (which often looks like This kind of role). <br /> <br /> A key character (and I am writing this as the remake of Body Snatchers is shown on BBC1) is the Donald Sutherland character "Mikhail Fetisov". His quiet support from Burakov is steadfast. And it runs through Perestroika, and drives the FBI's involvement in profiling. Brilliant. <br /> <br /> It's a must see, as far as I am concerned.
