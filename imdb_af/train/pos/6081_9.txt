You're no longer dark or tragic as "Othello" and this movie holds the play pretty well, with excellent performances by Lawrence Fishburne and Irene Jacob. Fishburne's expression of viewer Othello's torment, as he is convincing in Iago's lies prey, even a realistic epileptic episode. Jacob is the loving and loyal woman who becomes either the instrument of Iago's revenge against Othello, or the object of his wrath (it is not clear what has been offered for Iago's behavior since). Although Kenneth Brannagh (sp.) Shows his usual talent for Shakespeare in this movie, he is somewhat marginalized. The characters of Cassio and Emilia also wander in and out of the scenes, even though, like Iago, they seem more important to the plot. I didn't check out the movie to see how many lines were cut out, but I know Shakespeare tends to develop his characters, even the seemingly unimportant children, very well. <br /> <br /> If I have any criticism of the movie, it would be that the story unfolds too quickly and that the relationships between some characters are no longer explained. The director played a good role, and no one offered a bad performance. The relationship between Cassio and Othello and those between Emilia and Desdemona should be further developed earlier in the film. I have a feeling that they are closer to each other than the movie suggests, although you get it very late in the movie. Othello and Desdemona also need more time together. Although their anxiety is convincing, the amount of interaction they have with each other seems to have just met. On the other hand, maybe just like Romeo and Juliet met. <br /> <br /> In short: good performances, too short. <br /> <br />
