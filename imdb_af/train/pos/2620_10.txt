What a pleasant surprise: a Disney DTV (Direct to Video) prosecution that is actually good. "The Lion King 1 1/2" is a comedy affair involving everyone's favorite meerkat and warthog, Timon and Pumbaa. It starts with watching the original movie and commenting, until Timon complains that "we are not here yet". After climbing over the remote, Timon and Pumbaa decide to tell the audience "their story". They start the new movie, and the laugh begins. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I lost hope in Disney. Most of their direct-to-video rates are aggressively terrible, with the story lines desperate to cash in on the original. "1 1/2" decides to try something else: it tells the original story from a new point of view. Well, it adds a few things, as Timon comes from and how he and Pumbaa met, but it's an interesting concept. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella regain the band and friendship we love in the first film. There are also some neat movie parodies (including one scene that simultaneously spoofs 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' and 'Cool Hand Luke'), and the writing is filled with funny memorable lines. <br /> <br /> Added to the movie is Julie Kavner ("The Simpsons") as Timon's worried mom, and Jerry Stiller as Timon's slightly crazy uncle Max. Matthew Broderick appears as Simba, and his "teenage" scene reminded me of Ferris Bueller. Everyone is doing well, especially Robert Guillame (is that how you play it?) Like Rafiki, who speaks more and more Yoda in this movie (Timon's comment on this). <br /> <br /> "The Lion King 1 1/2" is a perfect alternative for those who get tired of the Shrekification or animation. 10/10
