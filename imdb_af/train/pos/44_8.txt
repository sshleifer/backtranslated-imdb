When I was told about this movie, I thought it would be another movie. I was wrong. This movie sends a powerful message about the rating of others. I was deeply moved. Everybody I experienced recommended this movie. No one came back and said it was bad. Working has also done a good job with her role in this movie. I don't know much about her acting career, but wow, the way she pulled down from the end of this colt was wonderful. <br /> <br /> At first, it was a bit slow. But after going to hospital .... wow, the movie picks up again. I have no idea why this movie was not in the movie world. My wish would be that this movie be released again and be advertised more ... because it sends a powerful message within half an hour.
