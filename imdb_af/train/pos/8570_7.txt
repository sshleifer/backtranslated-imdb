I immediately noticed that this movie was not really based on Dodie Smith's novel. In any case, it was a good idea that Pongo and Perdita's son now had their own puppies. Of course, the cutest of the Dalmatians was a small snowball that was completely immaculate until the end of the film. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I didn't know what to think when Cruella de Vil changed everything completely. In fact, I often thought of the possibility that she might be friendly, but now that she has changed herself so soon and announced that she was Cruella again, I almost started to really worry about Chloe's Dalmatians. <Br /> <br /> The scene in which the puppies looked at Lady and the Tramp while Chloe and Kevin had their dinner was much better than I expected. I also loved the parrot that played to be a dog, and it was incredible that the dogs learned so many tricks for this movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, I was satisfied that at the end the Dalmatians were rescued, but I would like to know what Cruella would do after losing her entire property. And what on earth can the dogs do with such a large amount of money? <br /> <br /> Finally, it was astonishing that Snowball also had the very end of the movie.
