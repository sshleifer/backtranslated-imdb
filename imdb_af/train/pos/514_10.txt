Certainly one of the best British films ever made, if not one of the best films ever made. Essay, cinematography, direction, and acting in a class on their own. This movie works on so many levels. So why is it completely unavailable on tape, DVD. Never be shown on TV? Why is it hidden when it is regularly shown at the National Film Theater in London for packaged homes?
