The performances of each actor and actress (in the film) are extremely NATURAL, which is the movie acting; and the direct skill is handled so brilliantly on every detail that I am never tired of seeing it over and over again. However, I am quite surprised to see that this film is not included in some of the actors and directors, Attenborough's credits that challenge me: they are not proud of a claim that they are such an excellent, long-lasting film for the audience ? I hope I get some answers to my puzzles (possibly one of the film's "knowledgeable" staff).
