As a popular sport, many people were surfing. Just after I watched the documentary, I realized how dangerous it could be. In fact, the surfers were also scared of big waves. Even someone killed them. But they still navigate and enjoy themselves. Only brave people can do this. <br /> <br /> According to what the surfers said, we know clearly what they felt when the big wave came to them. You need to adjust your best fit and avoid direct attack from the big wave. When you win it, it will of course bring you great satisfaction. <br /> <br /> Wonderful filmmaking cannot be overlooked. This is absolutely visual pleasure. <br /> <br /> An excellent sports documentary. 8/10
