Parker (Johnathan Schaech) is an aspiring writer still looking for his big break. Meanwhile, he works as a telephonic adviser to a Manhattan psychological hotline. One day, unfortunately, his apartment building was burnt. Parker and his cat make it alive, but are now stuck with the difficult task of finding affordable housing in the Big Apple. Word comes to Parker that a woman, Samantha (Alison Eastwood) is looking for a roommate but will only accept a gay man. As Parker is straight, but the price is right, he decides to pretend he's gay. Samantha keeps him from the beginning and welcomes him as her new co-resident. But, poor Parker. Sam is beautiful, intelligent and very desirable. How can he keep his true nature under control? In addition, Sam doesn't have a successful businessman boyfriend? This is a lovely, fun and humorous movie featuring two very attractive stars in Eastwood and Schaech. Of course, the plot is a string of 'how can I keep these ruse' scenes, with Sam asking Parker for shampoo while she is bathing or pleading to keep her in bed when she receives bad news. It is also necessary that Parker should produce his own "false" gay partner, Boris, when Sam insists on solving him with a man she knows. Hopefully the gay community will not find it too offensive, as this viewer thought most issues were dealt with sensitively and subtly. For a small-scale film, the costumes, sets and camera work were also quite nice. Therefore, if you love the funny stories of love, get this one soon. You will love what you see, I know it.
