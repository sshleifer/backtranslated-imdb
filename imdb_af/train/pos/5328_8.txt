I still remember watching it on TV first. I couldn't believe TVNZ didn't let it go! I had to own it! Lots of humor will be lost on non-NZs, but give it a go! <br /> <br /> Ever since the back of the Y series, Matt and Chris have gone on bigger and better things. NZ's biggest devil stuntman, Randy Campbell, has often appeared on the British TV series Balls of Steel. Yes, he still makes all his stumps because he's too drunk. <br /> <br /> Also, the 'house band' Deja Voodoo has since released 2 albums, Brown Sabbath and Back in Brown. The group consists of members of the Back of the Y team and singles such as "I would give you one of my beers (but I only have 6)" and "You were not even born in the 80's". <br /> <br /> The South-South West Film Festival also features their feature-length film The Devil Made Me Do It, which will be released in NZ early 2008. <br /> <br /> Everything up, if you don't find these guys funny, just F% ^ K OFF !!
