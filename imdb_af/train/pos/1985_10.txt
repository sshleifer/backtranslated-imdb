I'm not usually a fan of music, but if I had to choose what my favorite would be, it would definitely be Oliver. This film is made so good, the characters are well portrayed, the costumes on the play are good and the songs are wonderful, my favorite is' Reviewing the situation by Ron Moody reviewing a brilliant depiction of Fagin. I wasn't old enough to see Oliver release when it was released in the late 60's, but my sisters were so late for the end I had to sing them with the bloody songs, usually it was "Who will buy my wonderful roses", So I knew all the songs before I saw the movie. It's a timeless musical that you definitely can't repeat. stand on its own. It's not accurate for the book and I don't think it would work as well as it was. I don't think Charles Dickens will be disappointed, as he wrote Oliver to portray poverty in London. The orphanages, the workplaces and about what the poor had to resort to surviving, and the movie picture out you are very good. Another good reason to watch this movie is Bullseye, the old English Bull Terrier, marking its long thin legs, bred from the breed many years ago. They must have hunted high and low to find an example. He is exactly how an English Bull Terrier watched Victorian times. On his face, Bill Sykes had a scar. Bill Sykes probably used him for the battles or for the rock pits. A Victorian Bull Terrier killed a record number in a rocket. He is a beautiful dog in any way and sees that he hasn't heard Bill Sykes after killing Nancy. Of course, he has his standards. He is not the headline Bill Sykes who thought. It is a great musical to see if you like musical, and if you don't like musical, try it in any way, there's something for everyone in this movie.
