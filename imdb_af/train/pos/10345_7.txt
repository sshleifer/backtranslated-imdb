The only other review of this movie from this date is the stars and the movie itself really falling off. I usually read the users' comments to give me an idea of ​​what to expect from a movie I don't know much about. It is a pity if there is not much comment for a certain tile, because if there is only one review and it unreasonably rejects and throws the movie, you will not get an idea of ​​what to expect. I read the review before I watched this title and I don't know where all the poison came from for this movie and the stars. Douglas and Blondell were both very talented and attractive people who usually delivered, even though the material wasn't the biggest. I found the movie and the shows fun and enjoyable. It's not one of the wonderful classic magazines, but a pleasant and funny distraction - much more than you can hope in most newer movies. If you're a fan of these stars, you won't be disappointed.
