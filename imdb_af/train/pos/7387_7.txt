The events of September 11, 2001, at the Oscar awards created his shadow with a minute's silence before the memoriam montage and there was little in the way of the everyday dance comedy we expect from our award show, but it was smooth not a bad thing. Entertainment was more or less limited to a LOTR sent with Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson and that was it. The rest of the show was recorded with clips of the nominations and I have to admit it was actually nicer than the remaining songs and dance numbers we've seen over the years and Whoopi Goldberg was not a bad presenter at all. esoteric David Letterman of a few years ago and the one-minute silence for the 9/11 victims were haunting and dignified. <br /> <br /> New Zealand was completely robbed of the awards. FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING went home with four small awards while a BEAUTIFUL MIND picked up most of the big prizes, except for the best actor who had to go to a tough old New Zealander, but rather to a American American guy gone. The only Oscar awards that I concluded apart from those presented to FELLOWSHIP were the awards for the best supporting actress and best supporting actor, both correct calls.
