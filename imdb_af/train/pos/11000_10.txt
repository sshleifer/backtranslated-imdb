If you come into the movie with expectations, throw it away now, because no hype will do this movie justice. <br /> <br /> Categorizing this movie into a single genre will be criminal. It is a spy thriller, features elements of noir, pieces of action, science fiction and cyberpunk that are all bound together with a brilliant narrative, sensible plot moves and beautiful cinematography. The commentary here focused on distracting it, both in good and bad ways, from other movies. But as they say, every story cradles from Shakespeare, as soon as you get past it, you're in a nice ride. <br /> <br /> You will have to suspend your unbelief on some points, and while the set never becomes incredible, there are sections (read: the elevator) that suffer from a low budget and somewhat cheesy visuals. Don't get it wrong, because it's on the same level as the Cheesy Sci-Fi channel movies, because it's on a much higher level. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for action, turn away. This is pure psychology. But if you are willing to sit down and spend a good 90 minutes of your life on a new movie experience, do it now! Watch this movie now before it's cool to see it!
