Does anyone know the exact quote about "time and love" by George Ede aka, Father Fitzpatrick in the move, should it be you? He talked to Charlie and Annna in the church while they were away? If not, I'll have to rent the movie. It was a good movie. I also loved Serendipity! Great love story for the soul! <br /> <br /> I met one true love (my Soulmate) and although I had the experience to meet him when I least expected, I wasn't ready for that kind of emotional relationship. <br /> <br /> Although we were faithful, I wasn't mature enough to give as much as I thought. I became complacent and took his love for granted and he resisted it for 7 years. <br /> <br /> Eventually he was furious, but we are still hurting and angry and unbelieving about the way it turned out. I have some very difficult lessons to learn and we've been around for 3 years now. <br /> <br /> This movie has meant a lot because I am still waiting to reconcile with me one and only true love. I can now appreciate that the clear sense of me and the quotation from Father Fitzpatrick was true to me. <br /> <br /> I know when he has healed enough to trust me again, we will spoil again. <br /> <br /> DON'T NEED AND BE LOVED LOVE FOR ALLOWED! THIS IS THE HARDEST LESSON OF MY LIFE. <br /> <br /> The music in this movie is also outstanding and significant! This movie is DEEP and spiritually uplifting. TRUE LOVE is worth the wait, if it is meant, it will, no matter what it will happen! Nothing is impossible, even when it's the second time! Thank you!
