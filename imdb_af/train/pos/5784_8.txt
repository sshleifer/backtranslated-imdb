I noticed that many people are on the "Kerching!" Instead advice seems to hate this, which I find very surprising. I think this is one of the best British children's shows there. It's a shame that it ends up because it's very funny (if sometimes a little cheese) and with great characters. The main character is a bit like Del Boy, although it is much smarter. With his 2 best friends, he tried to make a million pounds for his mother by starting an online business and adopting a "rudeboy" pseudonym. His friends are Seymour (who likes to cook) and Danny (who is simply minded and the comic relief character). During the show, some characters left and new ones came in, but it was always entertaining and improving.
