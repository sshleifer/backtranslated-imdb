Rawhide was a wonderful TV western series. Focus on a group of trailmen led by the Gil Gil boss. Most episodes - especially from the first 3 seasons - were really character studies of Favor and his men. Guest stars came and went, but unlike Wagon Train, they rarely dominated the episodes that they appeared on. Rawhide was a real, eager western and Gil Gunst looked like an unforgettable character who should never be forgotten. Thanks to Eric Fleming's performance, the show has become a massive hit. Of course he is very much supported by a great role-players of good actors - Clint Eastwood, Sheb Wooley, Paul Brinegar, Steve Raines, James Murdoch, Rocky Shahan, Robert Cabal. All these actors left their mark in a television history. Rawhide caught the smell of the west of the west, so no other series succeeded in me anyway. Later seasons tended to divide the lead and give their individual story lines. For me it was a bit of the time, it didn't work - the cattle drive and the ordinary people delivered the best stories. However, there were a few classic stories and Rawhide remained the best tractor affair. The black and white photography added to a dark, realistic feeling that other Western ranges rarely managed to capture. Rustlers, Indians, Commanders, beautiful distressed dams, serial killers, all showed us our hero's problems. The end became silent for the series when the final season was less than half-way through. The reason - Eric Fleming left and Rawhide was now a head without a body. The eager realism was gone, Gil Favor commands respect and pronounced authority - he was never infallible and it made him more and more interesting. We will not see his kind again. Watch an episode when you can, they rarely disappoint.
