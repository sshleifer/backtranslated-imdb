I bought this movie a few days ago and thought it would be a beautiful movie. But when I picked it up in the DVD player, it surprised me very well. James Belushi plays very well like Bill The Mouth Manuccie. But especially Timothy Dalton plays a very good role as the Sheriff. The 'end' scene in Bill's house is very good, good camera work, nice dialogue and very good acting. Bill "The Mouth" Manuccie stole $ 12 million from the Mafia. Together with his wife he lives in South Carolina in a witness protection program. But the Mafia traces him and wants the $ 12m. Bill can only trust the only person he knows inside.
