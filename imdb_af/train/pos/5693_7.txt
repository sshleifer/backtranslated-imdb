The true story of a lot of junkies robbing a not so honest business man of drugs, jewelry, guns and money. Some would say it is the tragic story of America in the eighties where the high of peace and free love crashed into drugs and Aids sixties. Honestly, it's just regular people who have no purpose in life, moving around and deciding to rob a relentless man. What is the second part of their master plan? Once they have their stuff ... they sit down and get up again. Big plan. Even if you do not know the story, there is no tension in this movie and no surprises. The fact that Cox is trying to make these characters, with partytone and a montage of their booty, is a bad and insulting kind. The story was better off with a more straightforward approach. As it is, it's just a sad story of tiny drug dealers being murdered by big time drug dealers. The bigger story, in more ways than one, is John Holmes. He is at the center of this story anyway. This movie had to be all about him, his life. He was the one in wonderland, with the wonders to disappear. <br /> <br /> P.S. Although not official, Boogie Nights is a better version of Holmes life. It's not quite factual, but it's much nicer.
