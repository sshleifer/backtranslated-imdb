Thank God for Martin Scorsese and his love for the movies. <br /> <br /> This is the perfect introduction to the talented American artist who works in cinema today and I couldn't recommend it anymore. I was enchanted by the whole thing and you will be too. Just relax and let him take you on a journey through his world, you'll love it.
