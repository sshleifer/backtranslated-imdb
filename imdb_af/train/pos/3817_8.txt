If you had a drama in your life, either your own or someone close to you, the stages of pain that this woman (but in my opinion, was also easy to be a man) go through is very real. It's a movie about not dealing with your pain, not knowing what to do to go through yourself. Obviously, it's also a movie not to know how to help someone close to you to get through their pain. It's a movie that makes you realize that everyone is alone in their suffering. It's a movie that can push someone over the edge ... which seems like a recommendation. I'm not sure I would recommend anyone to watch this movie, especially someone close, but to me ... it's a movie that puts things in perspective, showing real pain and therefore very relevant to life . It makes you realize that hey, you, or the person who is near you, lived through pain, that hey, everything you worry about is of little importance
