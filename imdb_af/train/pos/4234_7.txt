ATTENTION, SPOILER! <br /> <br /> Many people told me that "Planet of the Apes" was Tim Burton's worst movie and apart from being much weaker than the original movie. So I decided not to see it. Another friend of mine who has not seen the movie yet has advised me to look at it, because "a Tim Burton movie is still a Tim Burton movie". I decided to do it, and I found it right. <br /> <br /> Clearly, a remake of such a well-known movie as "Planet of the Apes" is automatically influenced by commercial thinking. Yet Tim Burton managed his movie to portray his strange playfulness as "Beetlejuice" or "Batman". If you already love Burton movies, it's not hard to keep one of his movies, even if it's a few bugs: nerve-racking monkey squeals, over-dressed monkeys and a leading actor without any problems been by someone else. <br /> <br /> What the film gives us in the first place is an answer to the question: What is the result when Tim Burton is instructed to make a remake? First, Burton wouldn't be Burton if he didn't refuse to repeat it from the beginning; this is a 're-presentation'. However, Burton knows that almost every viewer of his film has seen the very first movie version Charlton Heston (as human), and he knows that a remake does not exist without his model and that the two films will not stop comparing. So he plays with this comparison at every moment of his film, e. g. by referring to quotes. As far as the story line is concerned, Burton does a brilliant job by answering open questions from the original first and then despairing the whole audience by destroying this wonderful clarity and ending the movie with? AND HERE IS THE SPOILER ?? Leo comes back to earth and finds himself in a world that is apparently already ruling by monkeys. <br /> <br /> Now it's the burtonese answer to people's expectations they hold because of the astonishing, shocking end of the first Planet of the Apes. An ultimately, even more unexpected, more astonishing and: totally confusing because? and here I disagree with several `Planet of the Apes' home pages and platforms ?? It does not make sense. There can be no meaning in it, or just as complicated as it becomes ineffective. Tim Burton plays his brutal games, he does it with a smile and he does it well. Burton fans will love it, others can be betrayed and complain about some way of life. Well, and I don't think producers will ever ask Burton to set up a remake again?
