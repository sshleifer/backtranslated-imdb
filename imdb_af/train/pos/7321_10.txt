Halloween is one of the best examples of independent film. It is very well made and has more psychological elements to it than you might realize at first glance. This is a simple movie that is very well-told. The music is perfect and is one of the most haunting scores. If you haven't seen this movie yet, watch it out. The throw is all good. I wish they had never followed. The first one was by far the best and had to finish as it did without having a successor. It was nice to see Jamie Lee Curtis in the movie. She didn't seem to be older (she's just as beautiful today, without the hair and the seventies). The screens by the mask are one of the scariest things ever!
