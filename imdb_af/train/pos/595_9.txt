When John Wayne filmed his Alamo story, he built a complete Alamo set in the village of Brackettsville, Texas, which is still there and the tourist attraction. As long as it stands, we will have a set for future Alamo interpretations for the screen. One of these with Dennis Quaid and Billy Bob Thornton was done in this century. <br /> <br /> But I'll say The Alamo: Thirteen days to glory is the best Alamo story I have seen filmed. John Wayne's film is a good one if he is overheated, but it is a John Wayne movie with the story to fill the parameters of John Wayne's screen character. Brian Keith plays Davy Crockett here and gives a good interpretation of the movie character he was. <br /> <br /> It is much closer to Professor Lon Tinkle's book on The Alamo than the Wayne movie was and read the financial years. since then I can testify. Tinkle's book was listed as the source in both films, but Tinkle was alive when the Wayne movie was done and he was not happy with the outcome. <br /> <br /> Alec Baldwin was about the right age for young William Barrett Travis, the idealistic freedom fighter who was incidentally a slave owner. Back in the day nobody saw the ironic contradiction in it. One thing that didn't explore and wasn't, was Travis's hyperactive sex drive. He was the Casanova of the South, even holding a rare diary of his liberal conquest. <br /> <br /> But the man who always gets the money laundering is Jim Bowie, who is played here by James Arness. He was probably a hero at the Alamo, but his career before the Alamo was that of a villain. He was a smuggler, a slave trader, an overarching man who sold land of which he had dubious title. But his heroic death certainly saved him. No idea of ​​this is in Arness's portrayal or anybody else I've seen of Bowie on the screen. And of course he designed the Bowie knife, according to its specifications. The man needs such a weapon. <br /> <br /> But the most important asset that The Alamo: Thirteen days after glory, is a full blown depiction of Antonio De Lopez De Santa Anna, the personal president of Mexico who emerges personally. puts the uprising picked up by the North Americans who came into Mexican invitation to settle in Texas. Unfortunately, the Americans came up with some preconceived notions of freedom that made it so far south, at least freedom for white people. Raul Julia plays Santa Anna who remains an even more controversial figure in Mexican history. He was also the best, but he was the best Mexico made until a real reformer Benito Juarez took hold. <br /> <br /> This film was the secretive performance of Lorne Greene who appeared briefly as General Sam Houston. Greene is not quite my concept of Houston, he was really too old for the part. Houston was in his early forties in 1836, he was not yet the patriarch of Texas. But within the boundaries that set him up, Greene does a good job. <br /> <br /> For a romantic tale of The Alamo story, you see John Wayne's version anyway, but for the historical content I strongly recommend this movie.
