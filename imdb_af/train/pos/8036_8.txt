Some guys think the sniper is not good because the action part of it was not good enough. Well, if you consider this as an action movie, this view may be fairly true as the action part of this movief is not really exciting. However, I think it's a psychological drama rather than an action one. <br /> <br /> The movie told us about the inside of two snipers that certainly had different personalities and different experiences. Tomas Beccket, who was a veteran and had 74 deaths, seemed to be cold. But after Beccket showed his Montana daydream, we can see his softness inside. It was the brutal war and its partners' sacrifice that Beccket became so cold. <br /> <br /> On the contrary, Millar was a new arrival, a green hand, and was not even qualified as a sniper. Billy Zane did pretty well to show miller's hesitation and fear when he first tried a bullet through your heart "(as Beccket said). What he thought about the suicide mission was that it could easily reach and then could he returned safely and received the award. <br /> <br /> These two guys were very different in their personalities and I think the movie showed the difference and the impact they had, due to the difference in their personalities These two snipers disputed each other, suspected and eventually understood through communication and through what they did to help even others. <br /> <br /> Sniper is not a good action movie, but " a good psychologist one.
