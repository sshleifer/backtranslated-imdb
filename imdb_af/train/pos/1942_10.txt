I consider myself a great movie buff. I was sick on the couch and jumped into this movie. From the opening to the end, I watched these great actors in the awe, I have never seen, say big word. The filming was beautiful. It was just what I needed. I hope this message is heard about any bad comments written by others. The director has a heart and beats all his actors. Thanks for making a movie like this. Just wonderfully awkward, beautiful characters who are simultaneous and graceful. Just wonderful. I cannot submit it without 10 lines in total, so I will simply say that I would like more of this director, more of all the role-players in this movie and more of the author. I didn't want it to end. The end
