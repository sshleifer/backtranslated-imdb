"Bell Book and Candle" was recently shown on the cable. After we didn't see it, we decided to look at this comedy again. Based on the James Van Druten's Broadway hit, which was a vehicle for Rex Harrison and Lilli Palmer in the early fifties, the movie was adapted for the screen by Daniel Taradash. The movie was directed by Richard Quine, who made the play in a wonderful comedy. <br /> <br /> It seems clear that some of the comments submitted by IMDb seem to be the big problem as being the two stars, working together on "Vertigo", released the same year. Filmhore thought nothing of the age difference when this film was released. In fact, most of the aging male stars of that period have always been involved with many younger women. <br /> <br /> The movie that takes place in Manhattan in Christmas is a wonderful comedy that enchanted viewers have. Kim Novak was aware of her beauty, as it is clear that the camera loved her, no matter what she was playing. As the witch you become, her Gillian is charming. James Stewart, who plays publisher Shep 'Henderson, is also seen at its best. Mr. Stewart was an excellent comedy actor showing why he was upstairs. <br /> <br /> In the supporting roles, the wonderful Elsa Lanchester who plays Queenie is a welcome addition to any movie, as she proves here. Gillian's Nicky Holroyd's Jack Lemmon is also good. Ernie Kovacs is also seen as author Sidney Radlitch. <br /> <br /> It's a great way to spend a winter night at home looking at "Bell Book and Candle".
