By 1955, five years after this one was released, James Stewart and Anthony Mann completed six more films, four of them Westerners. Of course, their report was self-evident and what was meant as a little more than a universal program has become both a cult and a classic. Buffs of the season will boast the fact that the first ten names on the credits were no longer known - and that doesn't count Ray Teal or Anthony 'Curtis, later Tony. Perhaps ten years later, the 'psychologist' was western-based, but in 1950 it was hard to throw Ahab with Cain and Abel. To say nothing about tackling various other issues along the way, and still a conventional western on the surface and full credit to all those involved. One to add to the DVD collection.
