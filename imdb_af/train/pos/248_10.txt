'Ned Kelly' is a wonderful Australian film that honors a true Australian hero. We are in the world of Ned, his best friend, Joe Byrne, and the other members of the Kelly Bende, as the film explains and may justify Ned's actions. <br /> <br /> There is an exceptional gift present, all giving star performances that bring the movie to life. (Great work, Heath!) Orlando Bloom was great like Joe, playing the role of quiet, loyal ladies very well. I was swept up right now. For a moment I almost believed the gang would win the battle at Glenrowan. It wasn't. <br /> <br /> Some aspects of the movie are fictitious and, as an avid Ned Kelly fan (and supporter), was slightly disappointed about this. Perhaps the movie might have gone longer to cover more of the Kelly Bende / Ned's life - I felt there wasn't enough. <br /> <br /> Regardless of some flaws, it's a moving movie that stirs all sorts of emotions. (And hey, I'm going to assume this movie would be better to watch rather than Mick Jagger trying to portray Ned ...)
