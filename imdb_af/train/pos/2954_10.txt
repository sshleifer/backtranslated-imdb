Of course, this film, although critical, has not yet been released on DVD in the US, like another great - Christine Lahti's "Housekeeping", the same year. But if you can support Region 4 (Australian) DVDs, this little masterpiece should be in your collection. There are still some VHS copies available on the internet. Divis is supplemented with a wonderful story, as well as memorable performances of her supporting role, especially Claudia Carvan and the late, great Jan Adele. Incredibly, or perhaps not, this film and its stars were unknown at the Academy Awards, such as "Housekeeping", but treat yourself to both - you'll be glad you did!
