Stage adjustments are often a big mistake. They often come out as a movie camera that is simply placed on stage (such as "Night Mother"). Sidney Lumet's direction keeps the film alive, which is especially difficult, as the photo did not present him with a real challenge. Still, it's nice to look at what it is. The chemistry between Michael Caine and Christopher Reeve is pretty brilliant. The dynamics of their relationship is surprising. Caine is fantastic as always, and Reeve gets one of his few chances to really act. <br /> <br /> I confess that I've never seen Ira Levin's play, but I hear Jay Presson Allen's adjustment is true. The writing is incredibly over and keeps you guessing. "Deathtrap" is a very entertaining movie, and is recommended for almost all fans of the stage and screen. <br /> <br /> 7.4 out of 10
