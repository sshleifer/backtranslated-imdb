I did not read the book on which it was based / inspired by. These are some of them (the others are movies). The last work of John Ritter (RIP), one hope that it is hilarious. And this is. Almost every time he is here. Most of the guests, both supportive and regular, play well apart, and the material tends to be big. He plays Paul Hennessy, the father of three teenagers: Rory, the typical guy of old age, Kerry, the depressing middle child fighting for causes and awareness, and Bridget, the fashion lover, popular denz. Sagal returns to the female lead in a sit-com, and her character is far removed from Peggy Bundy. The show changed a bit after Mr. Three's Company succeeded and for a while they could not make up their minds, if they wanted to laugh or be trying and make sure they were respectful. One might wonder how or why it lasted so long: It can be pretty good, some of the additions were happy. (If you like David Spade, most of them are part of his skitics) and have things to say. My personal favorite episode is in the previous season. The humor is a nice combination of "stupid person" jokes (mainly related to high school), silliness, dark comedy and raw material. It treated sex and other adult topics, but never graphically. The language is soft, and occasionally, moderately strong. I recommend it to any fan of those who made it. 8/10
