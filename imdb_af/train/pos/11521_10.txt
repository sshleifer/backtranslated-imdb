Magicians are a wonderful ride from start to finish, thanks to the magic generated by the stars. Alan Arkin has been fantastic in one of his best roles in decades. Like a very good movie, it's a journey in which the theme is redemption and the results of dream. I can't believe this movie is so hard to find - I will buy it on DVD in a heartbeat but don't have an outlet yet.
