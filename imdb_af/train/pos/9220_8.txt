A wonderful pretentious commission from Romeo and Juliet. Approach with no expectation other than having a good time and you will enjoy this one. A talented group of comic actors release and make a riot in this lightweight artist's vehicle. Bad reviews were due to a snob of shakespeare treatments. Some people feel that all movies should be important. --- If you share these views, don't bother them. The credits read "launch" Angelina Jolie, who is not even close to truth, but she is surprisingly beautiful as the Juliet character, and as always, her acting is wonderful --- and in view of her age at the moment Her dialect is pretty good. Entertaining this classic story with feuding Italian families in the catering industry in New York leads to great fun. See it in the right mood and you will laugh out loud.
