First, I didn't see the "Blob", since I was 7 or 8 and considered it an adult, was an incredible experience. Pages can even be written on their impact on horror movies today. And even more can be written on the social subtitle with the 50's "fear of teens". But this simple little story of interplanetary horror is still a damn, scary movie if you allow it. <br /> <br /> Sure, it looks cute, because everyone goes out into our modern world. But "The Blob", in a couple of scary moments when a group of children watches the unstoppable creatures when adults don't believe them. In fact, there are even some beautiful dark moments in its brightly colored world. And Steve McQueen gives so much more than the story that is earned on paper so we really catch the viewers in the moment and believe in him. <br /> <br /> In summary, if you can reduce your postmodern irony filter, there is much more to love here than the eye is.
