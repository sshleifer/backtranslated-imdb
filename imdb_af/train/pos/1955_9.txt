Just the kind of movie I love. Some very good British actors as well as the only Sharon Stone. Catherine Tramell (Stone) manipulates a well-educated group of people's lives, playing on their reluctance to gather experiences to write a murder story book. She plays the female psychopath fairly well while convincingly portraying with her large sexual appeals what can be considered as one of the ultimate Black Widows. Tramell is used for dark places in society and freely shares in sadomasochistic wings in the 'never visit after dark' side of the village. From the beginning there is nothing of an R rating here of the dialogue alone. Steen can also be described as a kind of female Hannibal Lecter, an emotional femme deadly without the meal plan.
