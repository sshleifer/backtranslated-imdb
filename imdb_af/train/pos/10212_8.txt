This whole movie is worth just watching for the wonderful final moment - it's the best end of any movie I've ever seen. Perfect, beautiful, funny, just wonderful. <br /> <br /> I found this movie enjoyable, even with the French self-serious deep meaning. I loved it - it's a wonderful love story. And I loved the way Algerians were woven - and by the way, the music during the final credits is wonderful. I want the CD!
