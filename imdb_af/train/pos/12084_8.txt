A dental, small pot boiler, whose length of 65 minutes doesn't seem to be too short for a moment, My Names is Julia Ross, who returns to an English tradition of things that don't look the way they look. Hitchcock's Lady Vanishes is an example. Out-of-work Julia Ross (Nina Foch) finds a dream job at a new London employment agency, whose sinister representative is very anxious to determine whether she has a relative or a boyfriend. After getting accustomed to service, she wakes up in a big Manderley-like heap on the Cornish coast, presumably as the barwoman wife of George Macready, picking up a frightening interest in knives and ice. His affection, which allows mum, is the irresistible Lady May Whitty (this time a model of vibrant efficiency on the other hand of good-to-evil than she was doing in The Lady Vanishes). The nightmare vision of this story unfolds claustrophobically; we know what's going on, but are powerless to tell poor Julia. This movie, peculiarly, regularly receives a place of honor as one of the earliest (and very few British) films. I think it is closer to the Gothic old-dark-house tradition than the American one of the wet pebbles and urban corruption; however, it performs a more modern, psychoanalytic mind. Whatever you call it remains a sharply satisfying thriller.
