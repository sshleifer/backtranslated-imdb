Armageddon PPV <br /> The last 2006 PPV <br /> <br /> Smackdown trademark. <br /> <br /> Match Results Forward ******** <br /> <br /> We're starting the Inferno game. Kane v. MVP. It was a good game. Nothing about wrestling here. It was about the footage. Overall, it wasn't bad. There were a few dots here, with Kane too close to the fire, but eventually Kane won the MVP for the first time in the fire. <br /> <br /> Nice opener. Let's continue. <br /> <br /> Teddy Long announces a new team titles match: London and Kendrick will defend against: Regal and Taylor, The Hardyz, and MNM IN A CHARGER MATCH !!!! Let's move! <br /> <br /> Match two: fatal four-way learning game. This was total massacre. By judging three of the four teams here, you'll expect chaos. The spots were incredible. A total spot festival. One point Jeff went for Poetry in Motion and London moved and Jeff hit the ladder! Shortly afterwards, Jeff is on the top rope with two ladders nearby, as MNM would kill Jeff, Matt make the save and Jeff hit the "sea-saw" shot at Joey Mercury! Mercury is hurting. His eye is fast closed and is set up hard. Mercury is taken out of the game and Nitro is still there. He's just gonna fight for the titles! Regal and Taylor then grabbed London and sucked him first into the ladder! Jeff climbs the ladder and Nitro into a killer spot, dropkicks by learning to nail Jeff! Awesome! In the end, London and Kendrick retain the tag team titles. What a match !!! <br /> <br /> It was insane. I can't figure out why WWE hasn't announced it so far. The Buyrate will grow. I'm sure the repeat value will be good. <br /> <br /> Mercury suffered a broken nose and lacerations. He's now at the hospital. Get a good kid. <br /> <br /> No way to do something else here. <br /> <br /> Next on: The Miz v. Boogeyman. (Ugh) It was a match. Will the Boogeyman ever struggle? The Miz also sucks. After a mad crowd, it kills them. DUD. <br /> <br /> Chris Benoit v. Chavo. It was a strong game. I enjoyed it. Chavo hit one killer superplex at one point! Benoit also hit eight German suplexes! Benoit wins with the sharpshooter. Good things. <br /> <br /> Helms v. Yang-Cruiserweight title championship game. It was a good game. Unfortunately, the stupid fans don't mind. WHY? Helms and Yang are very talented and wrestling well. I agree with JBL. He went to the crowd. JBL is 100% correct. Learn to appreciate it or to go out. <br /> <br /> Mr. Kennedy v. The Undertaker-Last Ride game. Not too much here. It was a snail's party, with a few exceptions. Kennedy threw at one point Taker from the top of the stage to the floor. The place was good. Response was disappointing. The finish was Taker's tombstone Kennedy on the hearse and won the game. Unreal. Kennedy needs this victory. They are both hard workers. Yet Kennedy needs this victory. Undertaker had to be lost. Creative is being screwed again. <br /> <br /> A stupid thing is next. I like women. Not the one. At least Torrie wasn't here. This is refreshing. Judging from the crowd, Layla had to win. The WWE wanted Ashley. Consider breaking your bathroom. Next. <br /> <br /> Main event: Cena & Batista v. Finlay & Booker T. It was also a match. The focus was Cena v. Finlay and Batista v. Booker. Batista and Booker can't work well together. Finlay tries to make Cena look good. That finish was botched. Finlay beats Batista's knee with a boot and Batista no-sell the shot and completes the game. Lamb. Not main calibrium. <br /> Overall, Armageddon would have scored less, but the learning match was the main event here. It was enough money right there. A few others were solid. <br /> <br /> The Last Word: A good PPV with the learning match the savior. Smackdown is not a bad show, but is not compelling enough. Smackdown must stop making Cena mark. Let Smackdown stand on their own two legs. This show proves that Smackdown can.
