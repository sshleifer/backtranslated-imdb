I can't believe it's been ten years since this show was first broadcast on television and lucky viewers with its unique mix of comedy and horror. This is the show that gave birth to a good part of modern British humor: Dr. Terrible's House of Horrible; Garth Marenghi's Darkplace; The Mighty Boosh; Sniff box. Many have imitated the style of this show, and I do not deny that some of them have exceeded the quality. But Jermy Dyson deserves to be remembered for the start of the trend, with actors Mark Gatiss, Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith. <br /> <br /> Together, they created Royston Vasey, a sinister little town in England's idyllic countryside, where unsuspecting tourists and passers-by come across an obsessive couple who want to keep the town local and free from strangers; where the unemployed are abused and insulted at the workplace; where a farmer uses real people as scarecrows; where a veterinarian kills all the animals he tries to heal; where a gypsy circus kidnapped people; and where the butcher adds something secret but irresistibly to the food to dress people. <br /> <br /> It's just a bit of what the viewer can find in The League of Gentlemen. In itself, the three actors give decades and decades unique characters. The make-up and prosthetics are so good. I actually thought I was watching many more actors on the show than there were. But it is also wonderful: the way they change their voices and their body movement becomes really other people. <br /> <br /> Most of the jokes start with something ordinary, from real life, and then it is inflated. disturbing, sometimes lean. Sometimes it is pure horror without a set-up, as in Papa Lazarou's character. Just imagine a creepy circus owner on the makeup that bark in someone's home and kidnap women to be his wives. No explanation given. It's so creepy. Then there are many references to horror movies: Se7en, The Silence of the Lambs, Nosferatu, The Exorcist, etc. <br /> <br /> Fans of horror will love it, comedy of comedy will love it. As any traveler enters, there is a sign saying "Welcome to Royston Vasey: You will never leave." Any viewer who gives this show a chance agrees. Once you discover the League of Gentlemen, you'll never want anything else, you'll never forget it.
