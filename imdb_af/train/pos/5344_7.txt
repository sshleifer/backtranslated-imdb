It's a very good Spanish film, but I'm worried that many will be lost out there because many around the world have no idea what the Spanish Civil War is going to be or when it is being fought. Being a history teacher, I had a great advantage, but could easily see how the movie can be confusing until you work all the pieces together. I doubt it would be a major concern in Spain where this film was made, but for other audiences they may be confused to a little later in the film. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with 12-year-old Carol and her mother returns to her mother's hometown. Years have passed and you gather that they come to New York from Spain. Despite the strangeness, Carol speaks pretty well Spanish and much of the movie is about how she fits. Whatever her and her mother are alone, it will now be wasted on those who do not pick up that Carol's father fights in the side of the Republicans (who eventually lost in this very bloody conflict). <br /> <br /> The movie gets exceptional points for its beautiful camera work and music. The slower and quick fit is not bad, provided you are someone who can accept movies this way. I saw several other Spanish films about this war and it compares well with them - no better or worse - just a decent piece of life film about those left behind and a nice lifetime. /> <br /> PS - If you don't know what side is, Republicans were mostly Socialists and they were supported by the Soviet Union and Mexico as well as volunteers from many countries (including the USA). The nationalists were led by Franco and helped by Portugal and the Fascist states of Germany and Italy.
