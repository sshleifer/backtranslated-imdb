. . . is just as good as the original. Very nearly achieved greatness because of Cundieff's remarkable ear for music and dialogue. Creators are the self-important swagger of the hip-hop posors. The group "Niggaz with Hats" (NWH) is every rap group you've ever heard and completely self-parody. Wardrobe is incredible. Buy the OPEN soundtrack if you can.
