Guys and Dolls is a movie that's itching for a remake. It was made forty-eight years ago. His two main stars are dead or 409 pounds. Although a remake, with big stars now, is successful, it won't capture the magic included in this version. The boundless energy can't be recovered, nor the pure joy you can get when you see something like that: a big, big-screen movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />. last time I heard Sky Masterson, one of New York's biggest gamblers. Frank Sinatra is Nathan Detroit, whose as-often-he-can-find-a-speakeasy-for-it-crap game is known all over the world. But if the one place he has to keep is $ 1,000, Detroit needs the money fast. He offers $ 1,000 to Masterson that he can't take missionary Sarah Brown (Jean Simmons) to Havana with him the next day. <br /> <br /> Guys and Dolls are basically nothing but indifferent kinds and dances, which usually, as they do here, add fun. It is obvious to see how it was a Broadway musical: there were not so many sets, and the scenes were long. If I had to complain about one thing, that's how uneven the songs were. Sometimes there were two songs in a scene; Other times, thirty minutes went without one. Guys and Dolls are never boring, just a good time. <br /> <br /> My rating: 8/10 <br /> Not rated.
