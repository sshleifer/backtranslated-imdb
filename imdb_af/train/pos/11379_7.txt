Blood Castle (aka Shree of Demon Lover, Altar of Blood, Ivanna - the best, but the least exploitation of the cinema title, etc.) is a very traditional Gothic Romantic film. That means it's big, creepy castles, a heady young woman, a mysterious older man, hints of horror and the supernatural and romance elements in the contemporary sense of that genre term. It also means that it is being deliberately submitted, and that the movie will work best for horror mavens that are great supporters of understatement. If you like movies like Robert Wise's The Haunting (1963), but you also have a taste for the Spanish and Italian horns of the late 1960s / early 1970s, you can also enjoy Blood Castle. <br /> <br /> Baron Janos Dalmar (Carlos Quiney) lives in a large castle on the outskirts of a traditional, unspecified European town. The residents fear him because the legend has it that when he touches a woman's bed she died shortly after death - the consensus is that he puts his furious dogs on them. This is quite a problem because the Baron has a very healthy appetite for women. In the beginning of the film another woman died and was maimed. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, dr. Ivanna Rakowsky (Erna Schürer) appeared in the middle of the village and asked to be taken to Baron. Dalmar's castle. She is an out-of-towner who was hired by the Baron for her expertise in chemistry. Of course, nobody wants to go near the castle. Finally, Ivanna finds a shady individual (who gets even more shy) to take her. One day, a strange woman living in the castle, Olga (Cristiana Galloni), rejects Ivanna and says she shouldn't be there since she's a woman. Baron Dalmar vacillates whether she should stay. She's ending, but somewhat unwilling. The Baron hired her to reverse the effects of severe burns experienced by Baron's brother Igor. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the Baron's brother just looks a lot of decomposing flesh in a barrel of bizarre, blackish liquid. And further, Ivanna has bizarre, hallucinating dreams. Just what happens at the castle? Is the Baron responsible for the crimes? Is he insane? <br /> <br /> I wanted to keep Blood Castle more than I did. As I mentioned, the film is very deliberate in its pacing, and most of it is much underestimated. I can go to material in such a way. I don't care for the haunting (yes, I'm in a very small minority there), but I'm a big fan of the European horror of the 1960s and 1970s. One of my favorite directors is Mario Bava. I also like Dario Argento's work from that time. But sometimes Blood Castle has sometimes been too slow for me. There are huge pieces that vary scenes of not very exciting talks with scenes from Ivanna that are slowly walking in the corridors of the castle. <br /> <br /> But the atmosphere of the movie is decent. Director José Luis Merino scored more than passable sets and places, and Emanuele Di Cola shot it pretty well. However, Blood Castle feels relatively low in budget, as it is a Roger Corman-made movie. This usually means a low budget, but often surprisingly high quality "quickie". So while there is a hint of the prosperity of Bava's colors and complex decoration, everything is much more minimalist. Of course, it doesn't help that the Retromedia print I watched looks like a 30-year-old photo that has been left out in the sun. It seems to be wiped out, with compromise. <br /> <br /> Still, Merino and Di Cola set up fantastic visual objects. For example, an Ivanna scene runs in an obscured corridor shot from an exaggerated angle, and where an important plotting element is revealed only by shadows on a wall. There are also some Ingmar Bergmanesque shots, where actors are superbly blocked to set complex relationships. Except that they are only visually appealing, they draw your eyes deep into the frame. <br /> <br /> The performances are pretty good, and the women - especially Schürer - are very attractive. Merino uses this fact by including a decent amount of nudity. Schürer also made a number of films that were so soft. They were other genres, with English titles such as Sex Life in a Woman's Prison (1974), Naked and Lustful (1974), Strip Nude for Your Killer 1975) and Erotic Editions of a Sexy Seducer (1977). Blood Castle is much tamer, but in addition to the nudity there are still soft scenes that represent rape and slavery. Of course, the scenes mix sex and death. <br /> <br /> However, the primary attraction here is probably. The story, which is much a slow-burning romance than anything else. The horror elements, the mystery elements and a somewhat unexpected turn near the end, are bonuses, but ultimately, Blood Castle is a love story, over a few that conquer different problems and contradictions (often with physical threats or harms) to be together.
