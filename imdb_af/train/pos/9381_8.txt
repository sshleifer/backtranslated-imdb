A Drifter looking for a job is wrong for a hit in a small Wyoming city, resulting in all sorts of complications. Cage is perfectly thrown as the unfortunate schmuck who hopes to make a quick buck and get out of town, but to find he can't escape the title city. Hopper does what he does best, plays a psycho called "Lyle of Dallas," the real hit. Walsh as a crooked sheriff and Boyle as a femme fatale around the fine cast. The writings of the brothers, John and Rick Dahl, contain nice twists and turns, and John's direction creates a great "neo noir" atmosphere. Sharp and very entertaining, it sucks the viewer from the beginning and never stops.
