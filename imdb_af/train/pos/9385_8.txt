Red Rock West is a perfect example of how good a movie can be with virtually no budget. All you need is a smart script, good actors and lots of atmosphere. RRW delivers all this and more. <br /> <br /> Nic Cage plays an ex-marine, injured in Lebanon, which is up to its last $ 5 after refusing an oilfield job because of its bad knee. He rolls into Red Rock and is wronged by bartender Wayne (JT Walsh), not quite as his most threatening, but still angry with a Texas hit. <br /> <br /> He pays him to kill his wife and make it like burglary. Only when he gets there just to look her out. She offers him double to kill Wayne. Cage just wants to get hell out of town with his free money and let the sparring lovers. But a series of accidents and setbacks causes him in and out of Red Rock, back and forth, yo-yoing. Ultimately, this leads to a walk-in with Lyle of Dallas (a shaky and somehow sympathetic Dennis Hopper), the REAL hitman from Texas who helps to help without knowing he is making the plot complex. <br /> <br /> RRW never had a major release, so the audience discovered it on video or on cable TV shows. If you see it this way, it may look like a TV movie, but it's bigger than that. The smooth, long-term direction, state of mind and rushed desert wind would have made everything for a good movie in theaters, but the best thing you can do today is to watch the DVD on a large HDTV. <br /> <br /> The only weak point of the movie I can think of is Lara Flynn Boyle's boring femme fatale with the nasty dia-ish hairstyle. I will definitely not fall for her, but if you assume Nic Cage's character is in militant lesbians, you will surely accept it.
