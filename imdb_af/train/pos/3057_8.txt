Wow I really loved this movie, William H. Macy is wonderful as the silent hit Alex. <br /> <br /> All the performances here are really good, the plot is interesting and entertaining. <br /> <br /> Alex, a married boy (like his father) with a little boy, goes through a middle-aged crisis and wants to close the family business so he goes to the psychiatrist for help and in this place When he meets the young free spirit Sarah will fall in love with him. One day, Alex doesn't know what to do when he gets a job to kill someone he knows. <br /> <br /> I recommend you watch it if you like adult interesting movies. <br /> <br /> 8 stars = very good
