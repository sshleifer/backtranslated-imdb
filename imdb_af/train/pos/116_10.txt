Man o man ... I'm silly delay (not the right term, there's a long list!) To watch this movie and finally have the chance to do it. And "news" is: Wonderful labyrinthine spectacle! <br /> <br /> For any Von Trier's "follower": both Rigets, Element of Crime, Dogville, Dancer in The Dark, The Five Obstructions, etc. ... Europe is probably the difference to its greatness in visual terms . Everything is beautifully bleak and claustrophobic! You really get the feeling of being in this "imaginary" nightmare time warp. Take from the masters of surrealistic theater such as Bunuel, Bergman, to the 40's noir films with sour drops of avant-guard Von Trier leads the art film as the "well-intentioned totalitarian" filmmaker of today. His authoritative way of dealing with very complex problems, without being irrational, touches the viewer's nerve with the intention of healing some of the deepest wounds we are feeding into our hypocritical world. <br /> <br /> As Utopian as it seems, I believe that people like von Trier can help society in many ways in a wider aspect. The day films and filmmakers who carry this kind of power are no longer needed, as a tool for reflection, perhaps it is the beginning of a new era: "The age of emotional control over our fears". It continually provides us with his work over and over. <br /> <br /> Bravo!
