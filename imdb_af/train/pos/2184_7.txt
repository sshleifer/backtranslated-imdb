While a pleasant enough musical, which held me over this movie, was the unexpected comic chemistry between Basil Rathbone, as well as the composer, and Oscar Levant as his assistant. He plays a high handicapped, derivative artistic type (far from his more well-known roles than either threatening villains or the cool-logical Sherlock Holmes). Rathbone's character seems as if he could not get out without help. And that help is Starbuck, played with Oscar Levant with his usual droll humor. When quoting Crosby's character as his haunting writer, Rathbone introduces him to Starbuck by saying, "He does all my thinking for me." Whatever Levant responds, "Oh, it's just a part-time job." Of course it goes right past (or over) Rathbone, which is too busy going over where its next hit song comes from. As another reviewer said, who knows Rathbone can be so funny! He had no more opportunities to show off his comic talent.
