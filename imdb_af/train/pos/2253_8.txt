I hired this movie because of my interest in American history, and especially the little strange story of the Mormons. This movie seeks to make sense of how Joseph Smith could change his "vision" into a great world religion. It first focuses on the problems the Mormons had in their settlement in Navuoo, Illinois. This suggests Joseph Smith's trial. In the course of the trial, Brigham Young is telling about his conversion to Mormonism, and his faith in the spiritual message of Smith. Then Smith is murdered, and Young must have his own doubts about whether he has been chosen to lead the Mormons to a new country. In spite of his serious doubts, he persists, and eventually he has a vision (that is, Utah is the place for his colony) that gives him confidence in the right of his leadership. Later, as crops are destroyed by cricket, he again doubted that he was really chosen - but a miracle happened that cemented its place in history. <br /> <br /> I found the performances moving, and The Story must be convincing and interesting. I'd like to know if Mormone believes it's an accurate representation. Polygamy is part of the story, but the reasons why it is central to LDS are not generated. The problem is not emphasized. <br /> <br /> I'm sure people stay away from this movie because of its religious subject matter, but it plays a good role and will keep your interest throughout.
