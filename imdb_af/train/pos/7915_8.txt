It's an "odysessy through time" via computer animation, presumably the work of more than 300 artists. Made in the late 80's and released in 1990, it was the best thing for the day. I thought it was good and very interesting in places. <br /> <br /> Most of the short scenes didn't make sense, but shapes turned into other forms, but it was nice to watch. It's all about visuals, not really about any kind of story. There were a few strange rows in which strange man-ships would dance with birds that heard. Even if it was a computer that was animated. Even the term "computer animated" was not known. <br /> <br /> It's just a chance to show this new technology in short-cut cartoon-like events with beautiful colors and imaginative scenes. No words, just pictures with electronic music. Stoners must have really loved it. <br /> <br /> It's a nice, intriguing 40 minute "eye candy" and "head candy." Against today's CG effects, it may have lost an impact, but I think you'll still be entertained.
