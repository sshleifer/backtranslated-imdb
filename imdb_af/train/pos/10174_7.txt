It was another message from World War II to the soldiers and allies to be careful to spread rumors. These are called "instructional" cartoons because it was a mix of serious messages along with a funny main character called "Pvt. Snafu." <br /> <br /> We all have imagination, with fears and what- have you, and that's what happens here as Pvt. Snafu incorrectly adds two and two to something he hears and comes up with "five". You can panic and start all kinds of disasters if you spread enough rumors and enough people believe them. This includes losing trust in your country and your cause, as shown in this cartoon. A good way to lose a war demoralizes the enemy. This is still being done today. <br /> <br /> "We've lost the war," one big baloney says near the end of this cartoon. Amazing how some Americans haven't learned yet. This cartoon may be 65 years old, but it certainly has relevance today. As I write it, there were two terrorist bombings in Europe today and some people still think the "War on Terror" is just a bumper sticker slogan. Amazing. <br /> <br /> The author, the well-known "Dr Suess," uses analogies of "hot air balloon juice" here to present the above message. With Theodore Geisel (his real name) you know the rhymes will be smart. <br /> <br /> Nothing hilarious here, but it wasn't meant to be. You need to understand the climate of 1943 and the justified paranoia that existed during World War II. People forget that the war could easily win on the other side. It was a tense time
