This is a fascinating version of the hunt for the Soviet Union's first known serial killer. I agreed, just expecting a half-decent TV movie, but I was struck by the compelling way the story was told. As others have said, there is plenty to admire which is unfortunately lacking in very large screen releases. Much of the credit should go to Chris Gerolmo, whose intelligent script and direction the viewer attracts until it is impossible not to become emotionally involved. The role of the whole role is also fantastic, especially those of the two leaders, Stephen Rea and Donald Sutherland. Their convincing portrayals give their character bows a lot of credibility and the scene where they have their first committee meeting after Perestroika really touches. <br /> <br /> If you prefer your crime movies with a little more depth and a little less glare, I recommend looking out for 'Citizen X'. <br /> <br />
