I come to Pinjar from a completely different background than most of the other reviewers posted here. I am relatively new to Bollywood movies and was born and raised in the USA. So I don't have a broad base to compare Pinjar to other Indian films. Fortunately, no comparison is needed. <br /> <br /> Pinjar stands alone as nothing less than a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> In one line I can tell you that Pinjar is one of the most important. movies to come to any studio at any time. On a mass appeal scale, it could have been the Indian equivalent of "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" if it was adequately promoted in the US. It may well be the movie that put Bollywood on the American map. The American movie audience has a long love affair with "Gone With the Wind", and while Pinjar does not borrow from that plot, there are similarities. Not least, the brilliant (by American standards) 183-minute run time. <br /> <br /> Against the eager backdrop of the India-Pakistan partition in 1947-48, a compelling human drama of a young woman who has been imprisoned and put in trouble, she has no hand in the creation. In an unreliable position, she somehow succeeds in not only surviving, but growing - and even thriving. <br /> <br /> If the story is by no means lacking, it is outlined. Puro's (the protagonist) grows as one would be better illustrated - at least for Western audiences who are unfamiliar with Indian culture - if her character's "back story" is more developed in the early part of the film. But it would have stretched a 3-hour movie to 3 1/2 hours or more. Because not one minute of the movie is wasted, and nothing of what it made from editing can really be cut for the sake of time. Better to hear some of what had to be completed before leaving any of the remnants. <br /> <br /> I could use many words to describe Pinjar: "offensive", "disturbing", "compelling", "heartbreaking" comes immediately. But "lifting" may be as enjoyable as any of those. Any story indicating the inevitability of the human spirit at the worst chance should be considered as such. And Puro's triumph - though perhaps not immediately to those around her - is no less than inspiring. For the strength of the story alone, I can't recommend this movie highly enough. <br /> <br /> Just as inspiring is Urmila Matondkar's portrayal of Puro. Too often overlooked by the younger, newer actresses, Urmila has the unique ability to deliver a completely credible character in any role she plays. She not only does Puro's part, she fetches life in character. Manoj Bajpai's choice if Rashid was inspired. He manages something that too few Indian film heroes can: subtle. His mission of expression and nuance is essential to the role. At the beginning of the movie he brought more threats with his penetrating stare combined with all the heavy-handed sewers. <br /> <br /> If you only see one Bollywood movie in your life, make it Pinjar.
