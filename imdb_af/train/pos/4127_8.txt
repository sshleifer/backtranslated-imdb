I know there are a few purists who are poo poo who are not exactly like the original but sometimes spin-offs can stand on their own merits. I like the new Iron Chef because it is similar to the Japanese version, but at the same time allows for American spirit. I love Alton Brown as a commentator because he explains things with flair. The iron cooks themselves are very interesting. I know the originals were the best chefs on the planet at the time, but Bobby Flay is the only American Iron Chef to beat them. Mario Batali looks the most fun when he cooks, makes comments and is fast while creating. I watched the series and found all the players together well. However, the judges are not always the best choices. There are a few exceptions, such as the lawyer's food, but most of the judges are doubtful to be able to handle what is served. I like to watch the chef and the challengers are amazing. The food at the end always looks great and sometimes it inspires me in the kitchen. Perhaps this is all that anyone can ask to really eat what is served. The only thing I really want to change is to ask people on the show to lift up a little. Sometimes the mood becomes a little too tense, and it is not always fun to watch when you expect more entertainment. I like the version with William Shatner (Iron Chef USA) because it was as top-down as the original, but I can say it was a fairly expensive proposition. I wish he stayed with this version and was the host - between Bill Shatner and Alton Brown, who will grin me for an hour. As long as you don't expect the original Japanese version and can accept this series on its own merits, you can find it a pleasant hour.
