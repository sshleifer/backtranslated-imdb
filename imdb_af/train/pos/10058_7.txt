I admit it is a bit about the movie genre of a young child that softens the heart of his / her unwilling guardian. Have I seen enough of them? Baby Tree, Kolya, About a Boy, Mostly Martha, and to some extent Whale Rider ?? expect to be bored with the formula. What kept my attention in The King of Masks was the wrath of the environment: China in the 1930s. Extremely poverty was the norm, and girls' children were considered so worthless for poor parents that they had killed or given them at birth who would take them to the black market. When Wang discovers his bought grandson, whom he called "Doggie", is a granddaughter, he initially throws her out, although she has shown great promise as a street-performing heir. Even after repaying her, she is not too upset when she is kidnapped. The film is then eager and shows the lengths to which a young street-motorized girl in that society had to survive. <br /> <br /> The two main achievements are credible and deceptive in their societal context. In a Western society, one would at least expect a hint of Wang's wrath if he failed to achieve substantial success. Wang accepts his station as well as a well-known low-status artist, but I did. While Doggie is displaying a level of appearance and cunning that would presumably be in a modern suburban child, it is totally credible in the context of a child who is constantly in survival mode in a society that treats poor girls like garbage. And after discovering that her previous seven owners had abused her physically and spiritually, her heavy attachment to Wang was perfect. <br /> <br /> The look at the small town in a foreign country, the naturalness of the two main actors, the surprising plot twists, and of course, the heartwarming resolution all contribute to a very viewable movie.
