With all the recent movies dealing with British Monarchy, is it really time for another? Answer: YOU BET! The Young Victoria is still contributing to the wave of the UK cinema dealing with the royal family. In this case, it's about the early life of Princess Victoria and events leading to the coronation of her becoming Queen of England, as well as her romance and eventual wedding to Prince Albert. The film also deals with the stormy lives and careers of both England's Queen and Prince, as well as various other events that occur (political unrest, etc.). Emily Blunt plays a radiant Victoria in her youth, while Rupert Friend is her beloved and best friend, Prince Albert. The rest of the film is rounded off like Miranda Richardson, the Dutchess of Kent, and always welcome on the screen, Jim Broadbent as King William, as well as other role-players on the screen. Jean Marc Vallee (C.R.A.Z.Y., Loser Love), leads from an award-winning screenplay by Jullian Fellowes (Vanity Fair, Gosford Park, Separate Lies). I absolutely went out of my mind about the visual appearance of the film (by the movie Hagen Bogdansker), which gave each frame of the film a picturesque look (with the help of production designer Patrice Vermette), as well as some stiff editing (by Jill Bilcock & Matt Garner). What I also appreciated in Fellowes's headline is the use of a game Chess, as a metaphor for some of the film's political motivation (the characters in the movie move like the pieces on a chessboard). It is clever, well written, directed, filmed, edited and entertained (and enlightened) that makes a good evening at the theater. Graded PG by the MPAA for a few scenes of sensuality, some short violence (a bit bloody, though nothing too stingy), a rude outburst of language and some on-screen smoke
