This film deals with one of the most feared geriatric diseases under aging today. As one who has experienced a number of families with the potential of Alzheimer's potential or in the formative stages, I suggest that every healthcare provider recommend this movie to any family experiencing the trauma of this disease. The film is primarily designed to speak to the patient's family and comes to the heart of the battle. Casting is excellent and the dramatic depiction is excellent with a very striking plot line.
