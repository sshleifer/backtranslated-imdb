The costumes and make-up were great, there were some very funny lines, and Jim Carrey's role was made. Carrey did a job as well as could have been done with the rather disappointing writing. Certainly, it was mostly a movie for children, but if you spend so much money making a movie, you should at least give the story enough bodies to go beyond dr. Seuss. I expected more from Ron Howard. It is worth seeing, but it does not have the necessary features to become a great classic, by any measure.
