We regularly see films about unwanted things going on in politics, but I still recommend "City Hall". In a role he was born to play, Al Pacino stars as New York's mayor who has to handle a boy's shooting. But it seems that nothing he does really will have any effect. In this movie, the characters are as eager as we would expect from someone involved in a political scandal. No matter how much you trust a given politician, you may have doubts about watching this movie. <br /> <br /> I understand that I can't name a specific example of something similar to what this movie portrays, but that's not the point. If we had idealistic impressions of those at the top, this movie cuts off such ideas. Surely one I encourage you to see. Also starring John Cusack, Bridget Fonda, Danny Aiello, Anthony Franciosa and David Paymer.
