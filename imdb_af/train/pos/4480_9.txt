In the Citadel movie series, The Movies of Gene Kelly, Anchors Aweigh, is described as a musical kingpin. I can't do better than that. It is such an important film in both the careers of Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra. Kathryn Grayson also didn't do that badly. <br /> <br /> Louis B. Mayer led Gene Kelly from Columbia, where Harry Cohn had inspiration to get Kelly choreographed. Meisie has become a classic. So, if Mayer did not learn a lesson, producer Joe Pasternak Kelly artically controlled and allowed. When Anchors Aweigh finished, Fred Astaire finally had a dance rival for monarch of biodance. <br /> <br /> The main song everyone talks to with Gene Kelly is the dance with Jerry Mouse. Originally Kelly wanted to do the number with Walt Disney's Mickey Mouse, but Disney didn't give Mickey out to anyone. Mickey will have to wait until Roger Rabbit has introduced an out-of-the-box movie. Not to worry, because MGM has its own animated rodent, one half of Tom and Jerry's team. <br /> <br /> Kelly as a dancer always tried to do something new and different on the screen, like Fred Astaire. For the next twelve years, these two were allowed to get all kinds of artistic control and were praised for their work, even though the films themselves were not sniffing. It was as if everyone inspired the others for greater and better creativity, Kelly for MGM, Astaire for MGM and any other studio. In Anchors Aweigh, Kelly took Sinatra to dance a little. In fact, Frank Sinatra has always given Gene Kelly credit to show him how musical should be done, as he acknowledged both Burt Lancaster and Montgomery Clift. Their help to earn him is Oscar for Van Here to Eternity. <br /> <br /> When Frank Sinatra bought half of his contract from MGM from RKO, he insisted on a little artistic creativity. He became friends with the songwriting team of Jule Styne and Sammy Cahn. In his autobiography Sammy Cahn tells how Sinatra insisted that they write his songs for this film. Louis B. Mayer gave in and the team wrote some very good ballads for him to sing. One of my favorite Sinatra numbers comes from Anchors Aweigh, I get too easy in love. Frank sings it himself on the piano at an empty Hollywood Bowl. It's Sinatra at its best. <br /> <br /> With Jule Styne and later with Jimmy Van Heusen, Sammy Cahn richly earned the title to put more songs in Frank Sinatra's mouth than any other person. They were lifetime friends and Cahn always credited Sinatra with this milestone boost in his career. <br /> <br /> On a bet, Styne and Cahn said they could write a song using only a chromatic scale. They proved it in Anchors Aweigh when Kathryn Grayson made her soprano work on a sudden My Heart sings. She also did some classic numbers. <br /> <br /> Indeed, here is the basis of the plot. Two sailors on leave by a combination of circumstances meet Kathryn Grayson and her orphan cousin Dean Stockwell. Kelly tries to solve her with Sinatra, saying he can get her an audition with Jose Iturbi. They spend the movie just to reach it. <br /> <br /> My only disappointment in Anchors Aweigh was that Pamela Britton, who plays the waitress 'Brooklyn', never got a number. She received surprises from her performance as Meg Brockie in Brigadoon on Broadway and it brought her to Hollywood. I suspect she has a number cut and somewhere in MGM's safes. It can still be. <br /> <br /> Anchors Aweigh is a good example of why music is no longer made. All that creative talent was under contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. If you had to pay the market value for that, the cost of the third world country's debt could retire. <br /> <br /> But the movie results will be exceptional.
