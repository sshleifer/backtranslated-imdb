It's a great movie to see with your girlfriend. My friend and I love dancing and running in this movie at the videoback. We had to get it. With no violence and such a warm-up story, it's a good movie to relax and just enjoy your night. I would recommend this movie to any family or just a lot of girls looking for a cute movie.
