After racism, rural exodus - also known as rural migration - is another socio-political issue of the 1960s. West Side Story addressed racism through a love party in an artistic show. Now, Midnight Cowboy deals with rural exodus through a friendship tradition in a psychological performance. It has a very serious end to seeing one of the two companions of the fate disappear. <br /> <br /> Director John Schlesinger gives us the deepest secret thoughts, dreams, fantasies, fears and evaluations of two New York City scums. While beautiful Joe Buck (Voight) dreams of all the beautiful women of the world beg him to share a wild love fantasy, poor Ratso Rizzo (Hoffman) dreams of a better and healthier life in clean and sunny Florida. As a result, Joe becomes a hustler to change his fantasies; and Ratso becomes a snatcher to raise enough money to migrate to Florida. Besides Ratso, Joe helps to find his way to doing what he can. They start sharing everything in life. They share food, share medicine, share an uninhabited home, share their earnings, and share a lot. Unfortunately, as the story progresses, Joe realizes that it is attractive, not the only thing to beg all the beautiful women who begged him to have fun; and Ratso can't see Florida either, as his heart didn't weaken his illness while on the bus to take him there. <br /> <br /> The Might is always right, and the Feeble has no right in the daylight. Hence, "Midnight" gives the factual face. <br /> <br /> Despite the tragedy, there is no melodrama in Midnight Cowboy. Every aspect of every character is the reality of the poor who carry their inevitable destiny. Thanks to this, Midnight Cowboy is a challenging view of a socio-political issue, the rural exodus.
