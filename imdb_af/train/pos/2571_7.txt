Arrrrrggghhhhhh, some people take life too seriously !!! Watch this movie for what it is, sit back, relax and giggle. The film doesn't take itself seriously, neither do we. If you like James Belushi, you'll love this movie. If he is not your cup of tea, give it a miss. <br /> <br /> I love James Belushi, so I love this movie. Isn't that that simple? :-)
