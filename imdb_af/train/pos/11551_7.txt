THE ODD PAUPLE (3+ out of 5 stars) <br /> <br /> Like most people, I will always feel that Jack Klugman and Tony Randall are the definite "Odd Couple". Their incredible work on the TV series from the early to mid-70's was a high-level television brand at the time ... surpassing the scene and screen versions of the story. However, how can you go wrong with a Jack Lemmon / Walter Matthau pair? Matthau is in particular good shape like Oscar, the slum. Lemmon gets a bit used to Felix, especially if you have seen Tony Randall's excellent performance before. The writing is good ... definitely Neil Simon's best. (I will be on record here, saying that Neil Simon is probably one of the worst, most overvalued dramatists of American theater.) The storyline is simple: Felix, a neat freak and newly separated from his wife, moves in with Oscar, the slum that needs help saving money for maintenance payments. Their living arrangement is also much like a marriage, resulting in some entertaining tiffs and spats. Great fun and some good one-liners.
