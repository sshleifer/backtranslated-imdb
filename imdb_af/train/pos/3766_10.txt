Visually creative epic inimitable style. <br /> <br /> This movie may not have the most alternative dramaturgy or the most artistic play. But who dares to say this movie is no art? I'm not a supporter of the idea, that an important film should be serious, non-commercial or with me with questions. Even there are many movies that meet these qualities, which I like. <br /> <br /> Bogus Journey is definitely not one of these movies. What you get is pure, excessive creativity with a very positive, childlike energy. This film does not reflect reality. Its friendly-naive and utopian. Imagine the world of the future that Rufus describes. For me it would be a nice combination to live in! Except for that music ;-) <br /> <br /> Technically, Bogus Jorney is very well made. I always liked the cinematography and the paintings of this movie. Especially at this point Bogus Journey bowed his prequel by far. Also the effects are good, and I think most of them are made very without cgi. I usually prefer the good old effects in big budget movies. Certainly she's "just another Hollywood movie" from some people's view. But I think it's in a very charismatic way. <br /> <br /> A short word for the soundtrack: all the band and orchestral music fit very well into the movie. The sound design also lacks. I'm not a big fan of rock music, but I had to get this track through Winger from the scene, "station" builds the bill and ted robots in the bus. I love the unorthodox camera work at the beginning. <br /> <br /> Let me conclude by saying: <br /> <br /> This movie is very naive and very imaginative! It is better than Panzerkreuzer Potemkin, The Godfather, Eraserhead or Aguirre - the wrath of God. It's absolutely better than citizen jugs, apocalypse now or chris markers sans soleil ... ... it's even better than Total Recall ... No way! Yes way! <br /> <br /> Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey is just the best movie ever made. <br /> <br /> Those who dare disagree make him guilty of "arts-fartsy behavior" or keep Terminator Salvation (which is the bigger self-defamation) <br /> <br /> PS: part 1 is not the better movie. So Bogus Jorney is a better successor. Not even Terminator 2 is a better successor! It's not!
