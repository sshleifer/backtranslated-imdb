Channel 4 is a channel that allows more naughty stuff than any of the other channels. This show was definitely a naughty one. The presenter of this sometimes coarse adult chat program, four times BAFTA win and British comedy award (also nominated twice). Graham Norton was just the perfect gay host for a great show like this. It had one or more famous acquaintances in the middle of it. They basically had a mature idea that would make the guests gross, humiliated or humorous, but some are not for the faint-hearted. They played women with the movie, men with their dicks to play a xylophone, women sitting up in the bath, men with or without pants under their kilts, and much more brutal but hilarious ideas. It's just for adults, but enjoy it! It won the BAFTA twice for Best Entertainment (Program or Series), which won the British Comedy Awards for Best Comedy Entertainment Program (also nominated), Best Comedy Talk Show. It won an Emmy for episode # 18. The National Television Awards twice for the most popular Talk Show. It was number 52 on The 100 Greatest Funny Moments. Very good!
