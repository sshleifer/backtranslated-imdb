Gunga Din (1939) is based on Rudyard Kipling's poem. The film is directed by George Stevens. It is in India in the 19th century where three British soldiers must stop an evil guru and his murderous cult. Gunga Din is a wonderful adventure war comedy with very exciting moments. The three leading men are brilliant. Cary Grant is Sgt.Archibald Cutter, Victor McLaglen is Sgt.'Mac 'MacChesney and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. (The son of the legendary you know who is) Sgt.Thomas Ballantine. Don't forget about the other great players that Sam Jaffe Gunga Din plays in a brilliant way. The beautiful and gifted Joan Fontaine is Emaline Stebbins. It is very nice to see the problems of Tommy and Emmy's wedding plans. Gunga Din is a lot of fun. It can be funny, it can be exciting. It can be anything that requires a good movie.
