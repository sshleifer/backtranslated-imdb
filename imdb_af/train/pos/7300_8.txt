Like the gentle giants that make up the film's last half, Michael Oblowitz's latest production has grace, but it's also slow and weak. The producer's last outing, "Mosquitoman-3D", had the same problem. It's hard to imagine a boring shark movie, but they have somehow managed it. The only draw for Hammerhead: Shark Frenzy was the passable animatronix, which is always fun when dealing with wonderful worlds under the ocean's surface. But even that was just acceptable. Poor focus in some scenes made the production seem amateurish. With Dolphins and Whales, technology is all but wasted. Cloudy scenes and too many close-ups of the movie's giant subjects do nothing to take advantage of IMAX's stunning 3D capabilities. There are too few scenes of any depth or variety. Close-ups of these wonderful creatures just look flat and there is often only one creature in the camera field, so there is no contrast of depth. Michael Oblowitz tries to follow in his father's footsteps, but if you have Cable Shark Week, his introspective and dull treatment of his subjects is a constant disappointment.
