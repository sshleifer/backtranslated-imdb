It's an Arnold movie. Knowing this, I saved a lot of you, the time it would take to read this review. If you don't like Arnold, you don't like this movie. If the case is the other, you will most likely find it. It's as simple as that. <br /> <br /> Now, if you still read it, I expect you to like Arnold. Good for you! He is pretty good, he is not. The Running Man is a very typical Arnold feature. It has the usual retro future we know so well from 80's B-Sci Fi, it has a lot of terrible one-liners, lots of violence and explosions, and a nice heroine and a happy ending. <br /> <br /> In this case, the evil opponent is the controlling 1984 government that uses television as an effective crowd control with gladiator-type games. Of course, Arnold ends up in one of these shows and turns it all upside down, with some help from his two allies and the beautiful Amber. <br /> <br /> It's not a big budget. movie, but it still managed to create a nice good atmosphere of the future, with some nice carpet paintings and sets to help. It's 80's hopeless, but I find it charming. Acting is variable, Arnold does his usual grunt and shouts, with the help of stone-confronted one-liners. Heroine Amber is putting it lightly, a little stereotype, and subtly called Damen Killian is a typical evil TV man. <br /> <br /> Despite all its flaws, the movie shows its message very clearly; Television is an opiate of the masses, a great way to control people. It also features some futuristic digital video editing so the bad guys can change faces into a video to miss their audience. It doesn't look futuristic at all, it's a little worrying. <br /> <br /> If you've seen Arnold's movies before, you know when to watch this one. Enjoy.
