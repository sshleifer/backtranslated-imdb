China O'Brien (1990) was an attempt to make Cynthia Rothrock a star in the United States. This Golden Harvet production is covered by veteran director Robert Clouse. Unfortunately, he was happy with Enter the Dragon or he lost his contact because he was not so big of a director. The only reason to watch this movie is to fight Mrs. Rothrock and Richard Norton to see. If this movie was directed by Corey Yuen or Hi Meng, it could be an action classic instead of an instant live video. <br /> <br /> China O'Brien returns to help her father. He has problems with the local gang and he needs her help. She returned home and restored order (with the help of two unlikely people). But will they be enough to overthrow Mr Big and his evil hosts? <br /> <br /> If you are a great Cynthia Rothrock fan, this movie is for you. I just enjoyed the fighting, everything is rubbish. Why didn't Raymond Chow pick out a few shekels and hire a top-directional director? <br /> <br /> Recommended.
