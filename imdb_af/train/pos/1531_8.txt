Diagnosis Murder was shown on BBC1 most weekday afternoons since I woke it up from school 10 years ago - I know I shouldn't really enjoy it just as I shouldn't enjoy it. She wrote murder. "But I'm totally addicted to both and even have the DVD cassettes. OK, I know it's sad! <br /> <br /> Dick Van Dyke wears the show while starring as Dr. Mark Sloan A doctor at the Community Hospital in LA, who is also a police consultant for the LAPD - his son Steve (Barry van Dyke - Dick's real son) is a police officer who needs his father's help on many suspicious deaths. <br /> <br /> Along with the ride, Dr.Amanda Bentley (Victoria Bentley) is the resident Pathologist at Community General and for the first few seasons you had Scott Baio who played Dr. Jack Stewart. He staged and left the series. in 1995 hope to go for bigger and better things ... he had to stay where he was, he hasn't done anything since. And his only theater show for many years was in Baby Geniuses 2: Superbabies .... Oh, Dear !!! <br /> <br /> Dr. Jack Stewart has been replaced by Charlie Schlatter's younger Dr. Jesse Travis. He sat a little comfortable in Baio's shoes. <br /> <br /> The series is highly unreliable, but what is the Whodunit range? (Murder she wrote - wherever Jessica goes, someone dies, or the subordinate father Dowling Mysteries about a murderous priest with non-sidekick) <br /> <br /> The series was much lighter until 1997 because it had played a supportive role played by fraudulent hospital manager Norman Briggs played by Michael Tucci, along with Nurse and Mark's secretary Dolores played by Delores Hall. After 1997, both of these characters were no longer included and the series became a bigger issue with a bigger budget. episodes included much more action, one episode that inflated the entire hospital. <br /> <br /> It was a family program for the Van Dyke's, because Dick's son Barry also had you Dick's daughter and all his grandchildren appearing in several episodes. <br /> <br /> As the series goes on, it has become a bit stupid, one episode I remember, Dick van Dike plays his whole family, which was a bit out of the ordinary, but on the whole "Diagnosis Murder 'was a really good TV show that had many good gas sites. Since this show was completed in 2001, Dick & Barry has appeared again in the MURDER 101 series of TV movies made by The Hallmark Channel, following the same route, and still pleasingly. Dick, now in the mid-80s, does not seem to change much, and looks as though he will work to the bitter end. <br /> <br /> TV SHOW **** OUT *** **
