Like a Streetcar called Desire (also directed by Gadg both on stage and on screen), Panic In The Streets shows a New Orleans in which its great claim to fame - the birthplace of Jazz - does not even mention it. It was Richard Widmark's seventh film and probably went a long way to establishing him as the good actor. He was really just a psychotic killer. Gadg himself appears in an unreliable small role as a doghouse fan, but the film is rich in talent starting with Jack Palance (still billed as Walter Jack Palance) as the local Mr. Big Bel, Emile Meyer, Tommy Rettig plus the rock solid Paul Douglas as the policeman who comes to the wide variety of doc Widmark. It's a much more rewarding movie, because it's not seen much. Catch it if you can.
