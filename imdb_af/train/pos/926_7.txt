I don't know why some people give so much criticism. <br /> <br /> It's a great show, probably not the right material for mainstream, but still ... <br /> <br /> Family dynamics are funny, and all in the same you see most comedy programs. The supporting characters are absolutely hilarious. The images of the individual episodes and the regular Siegfried & Roy jibes are just above average, but always so often you have sub-plots or one-liners that make you laugh on the floor. <br /> <br /> This show was worth the Â£ 8 I paid for it. <br /> <br /> grading: 8/10
