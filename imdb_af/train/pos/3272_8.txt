From the same director who did Candyman and Immortal Beloved, I'm not surprised that it's a good movie. Ironically, "Papierhaus" is a movie I've never heard of, but it must be one of the best movies of the late 80's - partly because it's been in the past decades. (I'm not talking about Iranian or Swedish "cinema" here ...) The acting isn't brilliant, but just solid - different from what some people claim here (they had dreamed this wonderful play, much like Anna). The story is an interesting fantasy that doesn't end in a clever way, which neatly connects all the loose edges. These unanswered questions are likely to be left there deliberately, and this leaves the individual's interpretation, and there is nothing wrong with a theme like this. "Pepperhaus" is a somewhat unusual mix of children's film and horror, with effective use of sounds and music. I like the fact that the central character is not your typical movie clich√©, but an ordinary, ordinary child, very refreshing. I am sick and tired of writers sticking out their own careless childhood in their books and on the screens, as if someone cares to watch or read about another misery, lonely childhood, as if it were all or as if it were of character background has a monopoly on good potential. The scene with Anna and the boy "snogging" (for quite a bit) was a bit much - as for feelings of vague aversion and entertainment - as she was supposed to be just 11, but predictably it appeared that Burke 13 was or 14 when it was filmed. I have no idea why they did not upgrade the character's age or have a younger actress. It was obvious that Burke was not so young. Why directors always throw children older than they play, so dilute realism, I will never know.
