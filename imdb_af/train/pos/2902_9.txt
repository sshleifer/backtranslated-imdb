I sit through movies like "Tiempo de valientes" and I want to talk about cinema for hours. The admiration that this movie has caused me is beyond my own boundaries of explanation, as I look at the scenes of the film and I search within my mind for movie ideas and dialogue innovations that are slightly larger than Damian Szifron's thoughts. can come out. br /> <br /> Look at the environment, so compromise, so simple, I think; This man is a genius. No wonder he has created what is probably the best television program Argentina has ever seen, and then a first movie full of elements that some contemporary directors have not yet achieved. "El fondo del mar" is the name and has awakened (a few years ago), my enthusiasm for our everyday theater. <br /> <br /> Begin his journey from people's daily real life, and Szifron goes where Pablo Trapero can never get in "El Bonaerense"; the Federal Police Department's life. Trapero's film was a journey into a man's thoughts and experiences, not in the places he saw. Yes, there was detailed training and many crime situations, but Szifron in "in there" is more of a detective story, like those we know and love, with the mysteries and exciting music. <br /> But there are many people in his writing, and he shows us his investigation through the eyes of his main characters, Alfredo Díaz and Mariano Silverstein. There are many great-caliber role players in the movie, but these two actors are the one who can't do the movie. The first character (Luis Luque) is a detective who just found out his wife's fraud on him; and must work on a case. <br /> <br /> The second is a psychiatrist assigned to the treatment of the detective. He wants to deal with him in regular sessions, but the sheriff uses the timing and suggests joining Díaz in his routine: "It's nothing, the ordinary thing, no problem". But it's bigger than that and it won't unfold part of the doctor's personality he didn't know. <br /> <br /> The relationship between the two leaders cannot be explained unless it is observed, as it greets such a complexity that shows how talented some men like Szifron are trying today to sign a signature in our history to leave. Díaz tells Silverstein points of incredible spontaneity during a high pressure situation: "How are we going to continue our treatment?" And Silverstein replies, "No, I'm not your doctor. You call me to eat dinner. Your friend." laugh because we can't help it. <br /> <br /> And we can't help laughing when Díaz crashes a car into the street and doesn't care about it or when he breaks all the red lights in the street or when he smokes his police patrol and Silverstein can't believe it (but it also smokes because he's screwed); or when Silverstein is trying to be friendly with Díaz's killer friends. Diego Peretti's Magic is what we receive there. He, a psychiatrist himself, gives a performance plan "Locas de amor", but impressed with all his series. Luis Luque, on the other hand, is again on the right track with a top-notch reminder of the great actor he is. <br /> <br /> There is a passion I have for this, and as I said, I could write Over the hours, but unfortunately it is not the way it works and I have to be exactly and sum up . Although I have to watch and study many of the old movies, I can assure you that "Tiempo de valientes" is the comedy that Argentina has been waiting for and has never received.
