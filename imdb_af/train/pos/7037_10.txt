It is a brilliant political satire. No wonder why this is largely ignored in the US: it exposes our murderous foreign policy to what it really is. <br /> <br /> Another good movie from this era, Rendition, has also been completely dismissed because it has shown accuracy. , that the US is a war machine tortured, tortured, murdered and mutilated by civilians in its quest for total world domination. <br /> <br /> A clever plot, good acting, some big stars (John Cusack, Ben Kingsley, Marisa Tomei somebody?) and some scenes of hilarity had to make this movie a hit. Unfortunately, the Americans do not like the truth about themselves, especially if they are hampered by mass murder.
