<br /> <br /> This movie is by far one of my favorites. I saw it in college in the early 90s, and while I was unable to identify with the thirties in the film, I felt that the story, characters and movie were in general. For those who have spoken negatively about Indian Summer, feel free to stick with your remaining Armageddon-type movies and leave the movies a good, healthy story for those who appreciate them.
