I saw the perfect boy about three times. I don't see how this movie is a gay movie, I'm not even gay, but I don't see it as a gay movie. This is a movie with a gay character, I can't see why every movie with a gay character should be strictly a movie about gay. I find the movie sympathetic to the study of death, the death of someone who is your family. I think Theo turns his life fairly quickly to rehab because he wants to see his brother die before him, let him reconsider his life. I found the dialogue in the scene when Theo told Ryan he was going to be a father who was moving a lot. Ryan says he doesn't want to know about the things he'll never see or share with anyone. Isn't it sorry and sad? I recommend the movie.
