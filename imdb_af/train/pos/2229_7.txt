I read some terrible things about this movie, so I was prepared for the worst. "Confusion. Muddled. Horribly structured." Although there may be some merit on some of these accusations, this movie was nowhere as terrible as your average DVD programmer. In fact, it actually had aspirations. It tried something out of the typical sample / slasher nonsense. And through God there are some interesting things going on. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Barbeau is a miracle to see. She wears the film square on her shoulders. <br /> <br /> It's not saying it's a masterpiece. UNHOLY eventually falls under the weight of its own ambition. There are just too many (unexplained) subplots trying to live together. And the sudden loopholes created by time travel are never really addressed: for example, if Hope knows her mother is angry and eventually kills her brother, why doesn't she just make the first order of the movie? Seems like it would have defeated hell to travel in the future to do so. <br /> <br /> However, I give UNHOLY points to try. A little ambition is not a bad thing.
