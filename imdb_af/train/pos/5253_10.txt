I really don't understand why people get so upset and roll this movie! Remember people, this is a SNL movie, not something that is supposed to be unpredictable and original in plot or direction! The Ladiesman is a hilarious film, though sometimes silly, with an outcast and, as usual, wonderful performances by Will Ferrel and Tim Meadows. Yes, some of the jokes are stupid, and yes, the characters are incredible, but his comedy! I really don't understand how anyone can laugh a lot during this hilarious movie. Anyway, all I ask is that people are the way it is - a SNL, stupid and unrelenting comedy. Nothing that will win awards, yet, some modern comedy gold. "10-4 Apricot!"
