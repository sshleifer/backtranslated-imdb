I saw this documentary at the Cannes Film Festival, in a small 200-seat cinema on the top of the main building at the Cannes Film Festival. <br /> <br /> I was absolutely there. I love the mix of terrified fictional scenes. This is amazing set design. The screens really look as if they were filmed in the 1920s or 1930s. <br /> <br /> And the music is so nice. <br /> <br /> I rate this experience 9/10. <br /> <br /> * Forward predictors. <br /> <br /> The Documentary tells of the spectacular Blues men, with black and white cute scenes from the black man playing guitar and singing. It's really great. But it also mixes in new ties and that is perhaps one thing I might not like in this documentary. This is the abundant use of links to modern rock bands that play the Blues songs in a modern way. I didn't really appreciate their hidden way of playing such awesome Blues songs. It's the same kind of imperfect musical taste I found when I watched Wim Wenders's Buena Vista Social Club. <br /> <br /> The Documentaries were such a standing ovation at this first performance in the small theater that the next day this documentary for everyone and ordinary tourists on the Croisette beach was shown at the outdoor cinema. Although the sand, the quality of the projection and the poor quality of the sound probably made it a difficult experience to enjoy for the thousands of people sitting in the sand that night.
