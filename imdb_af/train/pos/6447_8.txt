A well-known orchestra conductor, Daniel Dareus, suffers from a heart attack when he finishes a concert. Suddenly we looked at him as he arrived in the small town he had left years ago. Since leaving, he changed his name and gave him a new person. He bought the old school building where he planned to stay. The building needs a lot of work. One can expect a man in his position to install all the comfort of the world he has left behind in his new home, but no, Daniel puts on the hard winter in his own way. <br /> <br /> The local pastor, Stig, whose church has a small choir, calls to see if he can help Daniel, but the conductor has no desire to go back to music. Daniel is beginning to explore his new universe. The town's people leave him alone. He impresses Lena, who works in the local store where he goes to get his food supplies. Little by little he comes around and decides to involve himself with the choir. Lena will eventually fall in love with Daniel. <br /> <br /> First, the relationship between Daniel and the choristers is not exactly what he expected. As they get to know him better, they come to accept him and make him one of them. His new position didn't concern him with the woman in charge. The members of the choir are a motley crew, but they realize the change that Daniel made in the way they interpret different songs. The new piece composed for Gabriella, a battered woman, has a huge impact on her life and that of her fellow singers. <br /> <br /> Daniel's ideas for the repertoire clash with Stig's own. The minister suddenly saw Daniel in a new light; He is a tormented man who wants to read pornographic magazines before he loves his wife, Siv. His ideas clash with dogma, as Siv shows him. Stig decides to put an end to what he regards as an unhealthy influence of Daniel by dismissing him as head of the choir. <br /> <br /> The choir invited to participate in a competition travels to Austria. DaniÃ«l, who has now completely fallen to Lena, has the opportunity to show her feelings for her for the first time in his life when she doubts their relationship. Daniel who is late for his own concert, hears they make extraordinary music, although he is not among them. <br /> <br /> Kay Pollak, the director of this very attractive movie, shows that he was the man to send it. The story from the beginning involves the viewer. Much of the movie's success goes to the cast ensemble. William Nykvist, starring, is the best excuse to watch the movie. Frida Hallgren, Niklas Falk, Ylva Loof, does excellent work for Mr. Pollak. <br /> <br /> Stefan Nilsson is the composer for most of the beautiful music you hear. Harald Gunnar Paalgard's cinematography makes the film look better because of different seasons for the viewer in their beauty.
