In Manhattan, American middle class Jim Blandings (Cary Grant) lives with his wife Muriel (Myrna Loy) and two teenage daughters in a four-bedroom apartment with a bathroom. Jim works in an advertising agency that raises $ 15,000 a year and feels uncomfortable in his apartment due to lack of space. When buying an ad from a large house in the Connecticut country for an affordable price, he drives with his wife and broker and decides to buy the old house without any technical advice. His best friend and lawyer Bill Cole (Melvyn Douglas) sends a knowledge engineer to inspect the house, and tells the man that he must lay down the house and build another. Jim checks the information with other engineers and everyone condemns the place and earlier he finds that he has bought a "money pit" instead of a dream house. <br /> <br /> "Mr Mixes build his own home" is a very funny comedy, with humorous lines and top-notch script. Cary Grant is hilarious in the role of a man who is moved by the impulse of performing the American Dream of owning a large house that found it made bad choices while losing its touch in his work and feel jealous of his friend. In 1986, Tom Hanks worked in a very funny film, which was visibly inspired by this beautiful classic, The Money Pit. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Lar, Meu Tormento" ("Home, My Torment")
