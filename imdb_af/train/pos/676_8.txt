The Last Wave is much more than the sum of its parts. It's not just a disaster movie, not just an exploration of Australian Aboriginal spirituality, and certainly more than a simple court drama. Author / director Peter Weir succeeds in taking these elements to the next level to make a truly effective and exciting film with the same ominous atmosphere he gave to Picnic At Hanging Rock two years earlier, remembering years later . <br /> <br /> When advocate David Burton (Chamberlain) is called to defend Chris Lee (Gulpilil) over the death of an Aboriginal for whom he or she is not directly responsible, he doesn't just find himself struggling to do not get. the truth of Lee, but make sense of what he hears when it comes. As with the Aboriginal belief that there are two worlds - the everyday and the Dreamtime, the truth exists at two completely different levels, with events being more disastrous than Burton could ever imagine. <br /> <br /> No doubt why Picnic At Hanging Rock is better remembered because of its enduring mystery. We are led along the same path, but forced to find answers for ourselves. In 'The Last Wave' we can gather everything at the end of the movie. But even with all the information we have to choose how many of us want to believe, because the film takes us beyond the limits of our normal realities. <br /> <br /> On the production side, Weir uses its budget to great effect, gradually a sense of punishment in everything from soft lighting, heavy rain, good use of sound. The accidental music is unobtrusive and never tries to be grand. Richard Chamberlain manages the bafflement that the audience will no doubt feel if he tries to unravel the mystery. David Gulpilil captures a man in between two worlds, who want to do the right thing, but scared because he knows the end. <br /> <br /> Put together all these things and you have a perfect example of why David Weir is a well-known name in the film thirty years later. Highly recommended.
