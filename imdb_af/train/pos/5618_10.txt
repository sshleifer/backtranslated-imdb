This is a creepy movie. Worse than anything David Lynch, and it shows what a good director Polanski is, as it's not his usual kind of work, and it's BRILLIANT. <br /> <br /> All this starts with Trelkovski moving into a residential block in Paris. He soon learned that the previous tenant, a young woman, had committed suicide and he believed the rest of the people who were living there drove her there. He also believes they are trying to do the same. The result is a wonderful and frightening look at paranoia. <br /> <br /> The whole production has a classic horror written about it: from the images to the music, the viewer can build up the poor Trelkovski's terror. <br /> <br /> Are they all dead to kill him? Or maybe he just makes him angry? Is there a difference? Find out for yourself. 10/10
