Everyone in the role, from Sugiyama to Aoki and Toyoko, is someone we know in everyday life. They were so natural, and Sugiyama's transformation is incredibly credible. The score is so moving, it brought me tears. The choreography was beautiful without looking athletic. Mai's graceful dance and charm gave me goosebumps. Tamako is such a wonderful sweet character. You can almost see the charmed schoolgirl in her face as she remembers the view of the king and I. Aoki's character is both hilarious and miserable. Masako is as overwhelmingly natural as the distorted woman, you almost want to embrace her to make sure everything is fine. <br /> <br /> This movie is really a custodian.
