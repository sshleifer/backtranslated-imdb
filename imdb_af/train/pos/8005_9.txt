I bought this game on eBay after I heard it was a similar game for Elite. The game is very similar, and is very addictive. Once I played it a couple of times, I immediately went back to eBay and bought copies for all my kids so they could take part in the fun too. I played this game throughout and the storyline makes it feel as if you're actually in a movie, it's brilliant. If you're having trouble exploring freely because of the restrictive nature of the storyline in the single-player game, just set up a Freelancer server on your own computer (easy to do and software included) and play your heart content. There are still a large number of Freelancer servers on the Internet, so multiplayer is no problem and is not all that threatens because you don't often mean other players if you don't want to. So get a copy of this game, learn it by playing the single-player campaign, then set up an online presence and enjoy yourself. The depth of this game is staggering, with great systems to explore and find wreck, as well as all sorts of other things to discover - hidden planets, sluggish streets, secret bases, the list is almost endless. Fantastic game and especially because you can get it for some on eBay. Get one with the complete written guide if you can (blue box, not Xplosiv red box), it's much better!
