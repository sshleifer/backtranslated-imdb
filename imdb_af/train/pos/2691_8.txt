Probably, Bigas Luna's best performance for it achieved a delicate balance between slums, eroticism and surrealism. Delicious Mathilda May, who spent most of Tobe Hooper's "Lifeforce" in the doom, is the object of young Biel Duran's pre-teenage desire. He can't get May's breasts out of his head and wants so much to suck them and also suck the breasts of his own mom. His quest for May is the movie. As in Luna, works like "Lulu" and "Jamon! Jamon!", The director brings some sexual sensibility to his strange but beautiful story. The ordinary suspects will be offended, but those with open minds will enjoy this scary erotic poem on the female breast. Jos√© Luis Alcaine's images are beautiful and Nicola Piovani's score is sweet and rich. A beautiful cinematic steak with a beautiful anarchic sensibility that the Spanish do, of course.
