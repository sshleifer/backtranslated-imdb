Look, this is probably one of the best movies America offers the rest of the world. To hate this movie is to hate freedom. I remember the early 80's being a time of uncertainty. The economy was weak, communism threatened us all, and nuclear destruction was almost a certainty. From that confusion came a hero, Stroker Ace. Ned Beatty's performance in this movie showed he was never again thrown as a one-dimensional victim in the wilderness. His triumph is an inspiration to everyone. The screen chemistry between Burt and Loni draws clear comparisons with Brad and Jennifer. Jim Nabors is a poet. Check out this movie tonight!
