He is also obsessed with winning a car by entering a competition where the contestant has to make a record - and he decides that his son, Michel, should attempt to break the record constantly through a door. to go. He even hires an overweight coach to lead him up. Michel clothes like Elvis and has a place on a radio program called 'Cinema Lies', in which he describes errors in movies.
