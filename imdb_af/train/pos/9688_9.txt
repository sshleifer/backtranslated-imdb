I watch movies about talking animals with care. For every wonderful one like Babe you get an equally poor one like the terrible remake of Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey. Or in the case of Cats and Dogs, you have a good idea for a movie that doesn't reach its potential. When I heard from Paulie, the prospect of a wisecracking parrot didn't fill me with confidence. But I found the movie a pleasant surprise. And it manages its way in your heart without realizing you. <br /> <br /> A Russian lawyer, Misha Vilyenkov (Tony Shaloub) gets a job in a research laboratory. One day he heard singing from the cellar. And when he investigates, he finds a parrot in his cage that protrudes his heart. Misha is fascinated by the bird, especially if it appears that the parrot can not only sing, it can speak. And not a few phrases. It's a parrot that you can actually talk to. <br /> <br /> The parrot is called Paulie (pronounced by Jay Mohr) and acknowledges a fellow castaway in Misha. Wondering how this world ended up in a dusty cellar for the wise bird, Misha Paulie convinces to tell his life story. What everyone started when he was a baby, and in the care of Marie, a five-year-old girl with a stutter. The two of them became feathered birds (OK, bad pun!). When Marie's parents became worried about her good friendship with a bird, they decided to send him away. And they eventually did after Marie almost injured her in an autumn after she taught Paulie to fly. Desperate to be reunited with her, Paulie begins a long journey across America, which includes a variety of new owners, flying great distances and even ending up behind bars. From a loft that is! <br /> <br /> Paulie was one of a number of talking movies released by DreamWorks in the late 90's. And while not achieving the same recognition or boxing success of Babe, Paulie succeeds in a few levels, and occasionally works of striking intelligence. <br /> <br /> Jay Mohr's acting style is well suited to Paulie's part. He never plays the part as if he was too smug, even though he was a smart Aleck. Paulie's worldly, but he is also naive in his way. <br /> <br /> Because he lived a fairly protected life with Marie, he should throw him away for the first time. And when he falls into the hands of different owners, they promise Paulie to reunite him with Marie, what he believes. Only for those who promise to break time and time again. <br /> <br /> Although Paulie is a little episodic. It follows the eclectic people who end up Paulie, and how he slowly gets closer and closer to Marie. He first winded in a pawnshop, where he was adopted by Ivy (Gena Rowlands), a friendly woman who taught him the meaning of ways. She sympathizes with Paulie's situation and drives an RV across America to find Marie. <br /> <br /> Paulie is an occasional touch film. His scenes with Ivy are the best. Beautiful moments from Paulie put on her shoulder, Tom Jones numbers. The way she entered him was the need for hope, and some of the dialogue was written fairly well and even thoughtfully. <br /> <br /> "There are things in life that you emit because you think you will do them later. But the real thing Ivy taught me is that you have to live as it may be later. <br /> <br /> The scene where Ivy passes and leaves Paulie completely is a very heartbreaking moment, and the order in which he begins to take the courage to fly the Grand Canyon for the first time is majestic. such a beautifully composed scene that sticks to the film for hours. <br /> <br /> Despite the occasional sad moment, there is a lot of laughter, Paulie falls in with a group of educating Parrots at a Spanish outdoor restaurant The animatronic effects here are very good, as four birds make a perfect choreographic dance number, and Paulie even gets a romance, which is bumpy when he falls with a little (also played by Mohr). It may be the only complaint I have, as soon as you get comfortable with one situation, the movie Paulie moves to another. <br /> <br /> The scene where Paulie is taught to steal money from ATM machines is funny, but a little disturbing. I'm surprised Dreamworks got the chance to include such a scene in a children's movie. And Paulie's diamond robbery is many Mission Impossible. He was caught in the act and sent to the lab for animal trials, where he has remained since. <br /> <br /> The story finally comes full circle at the lab where Misha helps vows to help Paulie. Of course they find Marie. But the final revelation is a scene of such a shocking intensity. I was anesthetized for a few minutes. Paulie can never get the long life Babe has, but I believe it is an equally brilliant movie. The same laugh. The same flawless effects. And the same surprising intelligence. <br /> <br /> A little gem.
