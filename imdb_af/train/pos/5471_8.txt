During 1933, this film took a lot of cuts, as it was very up to the story content and the fact that Lily Powers (Barbara Stanwyck) would do everything to gain great wealth and power. Lily's father forced his daughter to prostitution at the age of 14. She grew up in a steel mill of a town with very poor people and her father ran a fairy tale that brought all kinds of male characters into his home. . As the story progresses, Lily comes to the man with the man and eventually finds a man who has everything and is a playboy bank president. It's great to see a very young John Wayne (Jimmy McCoy Jr.) who was only 25 when this photo was produced and Jimmy didn't even get to Lily, not even for lunch. A very young George Brent, (Coutland Trenholm) stars with Barbara Stanwyck and both, performed excellently. It is a wonderful 1933 film produced by Darryl F. Zanuck and locked in error for years and recently displayed on the silver screen. This movie is pretty soft compared to what we see on Hollywood screens today, but in 1933 it was very naughty to watch this type of movie. enjoy
