Having read some of the other comments here, I really expected something terrible, but was pleasantly surprised. REALITY CHECK: The original series was not that good. I think some people remember it with more love than it deserved, but apart from the car hunts and Daisy Duke's legs, the scripts were poor and poor. The Duke boys were too intelligent and fine for Backwood Hicks, the knotted Boss Hog was too cunning to be angry and Rosco was just hyper in every screen moment. It's incredible that the series actually took so long because it ran out of story lines in the first series. <br /> <br /> Back to the movie. If you see this movie in its own right, not as a direct comparison to how you remember the TV series, it's not bad at all. Of course, the real star is General Lee. The car chases and stunts are excellent and that's really what D.O.H. everything is over. Johnny Knoxville is his usual eccentric self and with Seann William Scott as Niggie Bo, the couple make this movie really funny in a hilarious Dumb-and-Dumber type of TV series never achieved. The beautiful Jessica Simpson is a nose like Miss Daisy, Burt Reynolds makes a much improved Boss Hog and M.C. Gainey makes an incredibly nasty Rosco P. Coltrane, as he always should have been. <br /> <br /> If you don't like slapstick humor and crazy car stunts, you won't watch this movie because you need to know what to expect. Unless you want an entertaining movie with some good laughs that aren't taxed on the brain, look at this pleasant skirt with an open mind.
