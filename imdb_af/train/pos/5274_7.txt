Yes, I loved this movie when I was a child. When I was big, I saw this movie so many times that my dad had to buy another VHS copy because the old copy was exhausted. <br /> <br /> My family got a VHS copy of this movie when we created a new VHS system. Initially, my mother wasn't sure it was an appropriate movie for a 10-year-old, but because we just bought a new VHS system, she made me look. <br /> <br /> As I said, this movie is every little boy's dream? The movie features a tremendous setting, big muscular barbarians, beautiful topless women, great bad monsters and jokes you will only get when you get older. So, a few days ago I posted the video and looked at the movie again for a long time. Initially, I was bored and then began to think about how much I loved this movie when I was a kid and watching. Yes, the experience wasn't as great as I remembered ?? The play is pretty bad, the storyline is pretty bad, the jokes were no longer funny, but the women were pretty nice. Yes, I grew up. Although the movie experience has changed for me, I still think it's 7 stars. For the good old times you know ??
