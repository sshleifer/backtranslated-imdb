It's really one of Hollywood's "Golden Age", the kind they no longer make. It's a unique, fun movie that lets you guess what will happen next. <br /> <br /> All the actors are perfectly cast and they are all great supporting actors. This is the first movie I've seen with Ronald Colman and I've been a fan of them ever since. Reginald Gardiner has always been a favorite supporting actor of mine and adds a certain quality to every movie he is in. While playing a different kind of character here, he added something to the movie that another actor who threw in this character would not have added.
