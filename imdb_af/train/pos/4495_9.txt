Outside the household is another world and the family struggles to enter the line between Dads authority and their hopes and dreams. <br /> <br /> The period is captured; The bakelite lights swithes, the Georgian floor pan, the picture rails, the wallpaper, the short skirts, the misbehaviors, the mini-van, shiny modern muffins .... <br /> <br /> The place is captured; A windwashed glacier chopped rocky landscape, walls of local stone, community, freedom. <br /> <br /> But there are many more; Childlessness, happiness, sensuality, pride, values, freedom, authority, rebellion, violence (in the deepest sense), love, struggle, puberty, naivety, morality, trust, faith, fraud, machismo, ways, maturity, loss, poverty, sacrifice, terror, acceptance, revelation, comedy and parenting are all there. (And in no particular order!). <br /> <br /> This film is a richly woven expression of family tension that is so relevant today. The fact that some of these are not tackled directly is in itself the will of the day, but the fact that they are all here is evidence of acting skill, story and direction. <br /> <br /> If there is anything bad about this movie, it is that all this deeply anchored and wonderfully tuned tension is wiped a little too lightly towards the end. Perhaps I miss my misunderstanding - the dream and gloomy feeling of many teenagers really disappear when they handle it (**). Maybe the movie is even trying to send the message. It is worth doing. <br /> <br /> What's the movie trying to say? Children: Parents were also young, parents were struggling too, everyone made mistakes, everyone was learning, changing things, fighting could end happily. Parents: Don't try too hard! Try to remember that your support is the key to their well-being. <br /> <br /> It sounds simplistic, isn't it? Sometimes the movie feels the same, but then you realize how much is being challenged and discovered. <br /> <br /> The movie is a classic. <br /> <br /> (**) - Not the trouble is worth it.
