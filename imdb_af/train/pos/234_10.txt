I always knew Anne DeSalvo was a great character actor, now I know she is also a good writer / director. I was a fan since I first saw her in the movies "Perfect", "My Favorite Year", "DC Cab" and "Stardust Memories". <br /> <br /> It is so rare to see Lee Grant these days. in anything. She has been missing the screen for too long. It's also great to see Cloris Leachman in something other than a sit-com. It's her best work since "The Last Picture Show". If you grew up in an Italian American family, you'll love this movie. I didn't expect much when I started watching this movie, so I was pleasantly surprised when I fell in love with this movie. If you get the chance, watch it.
