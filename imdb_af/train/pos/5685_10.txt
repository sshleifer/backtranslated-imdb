Kudos becomes director and throws for such a realistic movie. The eagerness, lack of glory and despair dragged me into the movie and kept me there. I was really impressed with how the dates and information were transferred to the movie; ie newspapers, letters, etc. That made the movie move so fast. I didn't feel the urge to move forward fast. Personally, I thought all the principles did a tremendous job. It was wonderful to see Bosworth and Kudrow in such difficult roles. It made me cry at times. Val Kilmer didn't surprise me. His performances of this nature usually leave me in awe. Overall, this is a brilliant movie not to be missed!
