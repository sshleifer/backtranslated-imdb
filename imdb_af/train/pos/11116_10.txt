"The Godfather", "Citizen Kane", "Star Wars", "Goodfellas". None of the above compares to the complexity of "The Sopranos". Each character has low on low absolute truth, completely and completely three-dimensional. We care heartily for Tony Soprano, despite being angry at the simplest model of good against evil. Soprano is the most challenging, intricate and fascinating protagonist ever created in history. If you're in the mood to be openly challenged as a viewer, and to change your feelings for entertainment forever, see "The Sopranos". I'm defending someone to sit down and watch the very first episode of Season 1, and don't want to continue with the series. Every season is completely brilliant in its own way. DVDs are essential for anyone's collection 4 out of 4
