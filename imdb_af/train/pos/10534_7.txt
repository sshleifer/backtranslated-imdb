Whether it's a good movie or not, movies of this kind should be made, I think. It reminds me of "I love Huckabees", an overwhelmingly enigmatic movie with Isabelle Huppert being syndicated by a young American in a mud dam, in a cheerful sadistic masochistic way. I hope the director will walk across the border, as though I was not always subtle in the choices made by Vincenzo Natali (some of the screens were unfortunately a "tarte-Ã -la-cream" like a childish flapper) , talk about script and filmography? The color of the "Cube" was black, "Nothing" is white, more cheerful, surprising, than the former films of Natali.
