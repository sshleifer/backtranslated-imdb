For fans of Troma or the Cyberpunk genre mixed with a little bloodshed, this movie is for you! There is a good amount of blood shed within the boundaries of this film, even the effects can be impressive and awesome. The plot is ridiculous and refreshing and is not chained to what we as audiences expect from movies. <br /> <br /> Also worth mentioning are the little strangers I found cute. All in all, it's a good movie for fans of the genre. Also recommended are films such as Tetsuo: The Iron Man and Versus for the strange Japanese film approach, filled with wonderful obscurity and bloodshed. Of course, if you see this movie, you should already know the two.
