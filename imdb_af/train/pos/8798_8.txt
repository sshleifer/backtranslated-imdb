First of all, I'm not going to praise IÃ±arritu's short film, even I'm Mexican and proud of his success in the mainstream Hollywood. <br /> <br /> In another hand, I see most reviews focus on their favorite (and not so) short films; but we forget that there is a subtle bottom line circling the whole composition, and maybe it won't be so nice for American people. (Though not the main goal of the producers) <br /> <br /> What I'm talking about is that most of the short films don't show the suffering WASP people have gone through because the September 11 terrorist attack, but the suffering of the other people. <br /> <br /> Do you need evidence about what I say? Look, in the short film of Bosnia, the message is: "You cry because of the people who died in the Towers, but we (The Other = Eastern Europeans) are crying long ago for the crimes that our women are doing and nobody is paying attention. to us is like the whole world did to you. "<br /> <br /> Although the Burkina Fassie story is more in comedy, there is the same thought:" You are angry because Osama Bin Laden puts you in an evil punched way, but we (The Other = Africans) must be angry because our people have long since died of hunger, poverty and Aids, and no one is paying attention to us as the whole world did to you. "<br /> <br /> Now look at the Sean Penn brief: The fall of the Twin Towers congratulates on a lonely (and alienated) man. So the message is that the power and greed (symbolized by the towers) must fall to let people see how the sun rises and the flowers bloom? It is remarkable that this terrible bottom line was suggested by an American. There is so much irony in this short film that it is close to subversive. <br /> <br /> Well, the Ken Loach (many know because his anti-capitalism ideology) is much clearer and shameless to go straight to The Point: "You are angry because your country has been attacked by evil forces, but We (the other = Latin Americans) suffered at the same time something worst and no one remembers our sadness as the whole world did to you. " <br /> <br /> It is as if the creative of this project is for Americans to say: "Do you see America now? You are not the only victim of the world world, you are not alone in your pain and by the way, we (the other = the non-Americans) have suffered much more than you, so we are in solidarity with you in your pain ... and by the way we are sorry because you have a little taste of your own medicine "Only the Mexican and French short films showed sympathy and compassion for American people, the other being a slap on the face of the US state, it is not equal to American people.
