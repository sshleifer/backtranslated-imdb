For the record, I'm in no way connected to the production. <br /> <br /> Hidden Frontier is probably the Star Trek fan movie with most episodes ever produced. Over the 7 seasons (that's the last) they produced about 50 or so episodes. <br /> <br /> This is not an average performance on almost no budget and all volunteer their time and energy. <br /> <br /> Early seasons do not have as good production qualities as their own by their own admission, but as they progress, green screen and acting are improved. <br /> <br /> I found it difficult to "dip in" so start from the beginning and look completely through. HF benefits from story bows just like all the best sci fi and dovetails in the Star Trek universe in which it is set. Original series characters and "family members" were brought into the stories and added a lot to the feel of the stories, sometimes the characters improved on the original. <br /> <br /> The whole experience includes an excellent web site, blooper roles, a high membership forum frequented by many of the actors and production staff and a weekly chat. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for high definition, high budget productions, it's probably not for you. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for ongoing adventures in the Star Trek universe with stories that make Star Trek credit and make you think, this is the one.
