The role play is different and now they have adopted a different approach. We have the street-smart team "Networth" vs. The alleged professional team, "Magna", but boy if you think the street team will struggle to get you right. While the Magna team struggled temporarily, the street team weekly disintegrated weekly. <br /> <br /> First, a few things that are repeated until the "Apprentice 3" first, remain the same absurd mentality (from Trump) and the game in this series: if you are a good project manager, but you lose, the team will turn you on and you will be dismissed, despite the fact that your teammates are often half who do their job. Simply absurd, a game show that claims to hire the best candidate is actually "weed", while the dysfunctional candidates stick to one another until one is over and the person is the best. lol <br /> <br /> Anyone of the season, we've seen a total of cursing, backsliding and even gay offensive stereotypes performed as teams try to do campaigns. <br /> <br /> The list of victims so far. Tara Dowdell, Audrey Evans, Danny Kastner those three are the only ones I have unjustly fired from Trump. The rest really got it because they just sparked up conflict, anger and suffering. It's just wonderful, as one candidate, Audrey Evans, said she was doing a good job, and how some of her worthless teammates are still in the game. <br /> <br /> Yes, this is the game, it's "The Apprentice" <br /> <br /> It was an entertaining ride, although candidates received a wide variety of photo shoot commands to to offer. the construction of mini golf courses, the construction of new apartments. Yet it is still the "Pupil", although everything you can basically do is laugh all the time like the madness and chaos to lucky person is the winner.
