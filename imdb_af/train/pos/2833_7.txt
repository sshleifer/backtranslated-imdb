Review this movie only after thirty-seven years. I was eleven and caught this movie on South Beach at the Cinema Theater on Washington Avenue. In 1969 I thought where it was! was a very good movie. Now, but after nearly forty years, it's not as good as it was. The times have changed, and this movie is now a tired old repetition of the war between generations. However, it caught a place in time that is just a reminder. It's really interesting to see the mod fashions, the old Vegas, a sleek Don Rickles, chain smoke, and a hip opening song. The acting was decent, the writing was slightly outdated, but the memories were still fresh. Where it is, may not be where it is for you, but for me it was still a fun and entertaining journey to the memory avenue.
