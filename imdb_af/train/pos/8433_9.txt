The play in this movie was wonderful, but mixed with the truth about the state of many Afrikaners in South Africa it made heartbreaking. It was good that the writer dismissed Boesman and Lena from other people's homes so we could fully share in their triumph and defeat; the conflicts they shared when they grew together and apart. Worth to see when you put the movie in the right context.
