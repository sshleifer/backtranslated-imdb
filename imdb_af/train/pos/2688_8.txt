******* SPOILER! ******** <br /> <br /> I saw this gr8 movie a few years back, it's a wonderful story about a young fella who wants to drink his mother's milk at the breast, but she thinks he should be old for it. He ends up with another ladies breast and ends up in competition with his brother who loves her. throw in a jealous man of this woman who cannot be 'awakened' and you have a shaky but warm story about love, friendship and beautiful watches. <br /> <br /> its brilliant <br /> <br /> Don't be delayed by sub-titles!
