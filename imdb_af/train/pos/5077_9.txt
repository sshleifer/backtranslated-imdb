Indian cinema typifies policemen from two broad categories: they are either the honest type or the bad guys. The honest guys always scream at the top of their voices and argue the system while the bad police are enjoying the most, but end up suffering. <br /> <br /> This movie at least breaks this ordinary formula and gives a refreshing image. of police and their lives. The direction looks at the life of a young, ambitious policeman. The music is interesting and editing is a trend as far as Indian theater goes. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the movie is slow and the dilemma facing Anbu when it comes to Maya is sometimes transmitted. But I will only give this one 9/10 because it has a lot of first class credit.
