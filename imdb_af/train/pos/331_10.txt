This 370-minute movie was broadcast by Italian public television during the early seventies. It tells you the myth attributed to Homer of the Travel House of Odysseus after the Troy war. This is an epic story about ancient Minoan and Mycenae civilizations, which were listed 500 years after the events around 1100 BC. <br /> <br /> This is a 1969 movie, so if you buy the DVD version it would find that the sound is just mono and that there is no other language than Italian, even the close caption is in Italian. Sorry. Many people will enjoy this masterpiece if it has the English captions on the list. But if it's not a problem for you, I strongly recommend watching this movie.
