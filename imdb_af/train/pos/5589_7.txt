Drop of symbolism and filled with wonderful cinematography, Extase is so much more than the erotic drama we all expect. It is almost a silent movie, with which dialogue is in German, and German is much simplified. Perhaps the filmmakers have planned the film to reach the widest European audience, as anyone with even a little German high school can easily get rid of the captions. The story is, in any case, of little importance, with the film at a film level, not a narrative one. Symbols of fertility and the power of nature overwhelm the human characters - there are even scenes where flowers darken the face of suspected star Hedy Lamarr - and there are moments that will remind viewers of the works of Dreyer, Vertov and Riefenstahl. If the film has any message to carry, I think it is a political one: the civilian man is rude and rude; working classmate is a happy, productive being; and the woman is the creator, who is unfulfilled until she wears a child. This blend of Soviet socialist realism and the National Socialist dogma does not overshadow the film - it is a beauty to watch from start to finish - but it puts it in a very clear artistic era. And, oh yes, Hedy gets her kit off.
