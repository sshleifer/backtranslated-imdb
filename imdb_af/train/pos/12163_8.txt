I found the film very expressive, the way the main character was lost, but also much more clear about certain things in life than people who mocked him (for example, his flat). <br /> <br /> He was tortured and you loved seeing him tortured! it had this twisted side that was frightening, but we were all happy to see him come out of the misery again. <br /> <br /> It was like a game character or panman by a mine or enemy and we like to watch him sniper or fire, but then we are happy to survive ... <br /> <br />.
