As the Godfather saga was the view of the mafia from the executive suite, this series is a complex story of the mafia from the working man's point of view. If you've never watched this show, you're in for an extensive treat. Yes, there is violence and nudity, but it is never free and is needed to contrast Tony Soprano, the thinker's gangster. With the reality of the life he was born, and frankly, he would never have known how to know how many of his associates ended up. Tony Soprano can discuss Sun Tzu with his therapist and then kill a man with a frying pan in a rage of anger, and while he breaks down the body with his cousin, sit down, sit and watch while eating peanut butter from the pot and give the cousin advice on his upcoming marriage, as they just finished a Sunday afternoon to watch NFL football. Even his wife, Carmella, gets a chance for a way out and finds that she really prefers life with Tony and the benefits that come with it, and looks at his indiscretions of life on his own. If you followed the whole thing, you know how it ends. If you did not, trust me that you have never seen such a TV program.
