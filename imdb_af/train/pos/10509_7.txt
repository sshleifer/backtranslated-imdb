I did not read the novel, although I understand that it is a little different from that; the fact that I rather enjoyed it, along with the fact that it is not my genre, leads me to the decision not to read the book. If I didn't read a single word from Austen's writing, I really can't compare it to any of her work. What I can say is that almost every line of dialogue in this is clever, spiritual and well-rendered, as well as the greatest source of comedy in this. It made me laugh very hard, with perfect British and oral material. Every acting performance is on the verge, and Paltrow ignores the role of a matchmaker. The characters are well written, credible and consistent. However, I found some of them very annoying, and while I think at least some of it was meant to be funny, it tended to repeat too much, and honestly it wasn't the first time they appeared no. The editing and cinematography is great, and everything looks absolutely beautiful. Plot and pacing is wonderful, you are never bored. It ends up with a * really * obvious, but maybe that's what the audience prefers. I can't say it didn't entertain me, it did from start to finish and I will see it again. There is short language in this. I recommend it to any fan of romance stories. 10/07
