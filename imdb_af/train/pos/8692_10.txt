I loved it. I had no idea that it was part of a wider range. I had to be 6 or so when it was on TV. I just thought it was funny and for some reason I had a deep fascination with something that was evident in the president's pile of bath toys. My parents cut it off when it was originally broadcast on NBC. The band even had the old Sanka coffee commercially with some others. I plan to return home soon and will try to pick up the tape on my computer so that those who want a copy can do it. If someone wants to contact you, I think you can feel it via the IMDb website. I will keep you informed and let me know when I have the show in digital format.
