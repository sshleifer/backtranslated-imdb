Sensual and difficult Maria Braun. (Hanna Schygula) marries a soldier in the middle of World War II and spends half a day and all night with him. This is how long her marriage lasts before losing him in the war and then in jail. She continues her life, becomes a successful business woman not only sensual, but also intelligent, ambitious and willing to use sex when or where needed: "I know nothing about business, but I know what German women want. You can even say I'm an expert on it ". As she climbed to success, she always remembers her husband, Hermann (her husband) and convinces her that whatever she does? is for him, for their future happy life together. "Maria Braun's style reminds many of the melodramas by Fassbinder's favorite Hollywood director, Douglas Sirk, and looks at the loss and survival of post-war Germany. Hanna Schygula literally shines in every scene of the movie and she is fantastic. <br /> <br /> 8.5 / 10
