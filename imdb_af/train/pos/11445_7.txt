A new way to enjoy Goldsworthy's work, Rivers and Tides, is for fans to move their work. Looking at Goldsworthy, he builds his pieces, one develops an appreciation for every stone, leaf and thorn he uses. Goldsworthy describes how the flow of life, rivers and tides inspire and influence his work. Although I was lucky, the movie covered the majority of Goldsworthy's pieces (no snowballs). I felt it was a bit long. The filmmakers did a wonderful job of bringing Goldsworthy's work to life, and created a beautiful movie that was a pleasure to watch.
