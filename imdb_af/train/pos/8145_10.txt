I've seen this movie over the past 4 years and I expected something funny, similar to CB4. I was blown away. I was on the floor and laughing my skirt from this movie is so good. Better than CB4, the characters, the songs, the plot, everything. Top cut independent film given by Siskel and Egbert ("Two Thumbs UP") and if two old white guys can understand the humor in this movie, you know it's good.
