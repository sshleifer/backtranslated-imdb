For Romance's sake, as a married man. The following two films are recommended. <br /> <br /> 1. Brief encounter by David Lean (1945), UK <br /> <br /> Well, if a woman goes to a train station, something can happen. And this has happened! How she longs to be there, in a small bar waiting for the man of her dreams. But she was married ... the man was a stranger to the fantasy woman <br /> <br /> 2. Xiao Cheng Zhi Chun by Fei Mu (1948), China <br /> <br /> Well, when a woman going to the market to buy fish, groceries and medicines, going through the ruins of an old wall in a small town, there is much to think about the melancholy of her life, her sick man in self-pity and lack of future. Just as a jubilant young doctor arrived, something happened ... the doctor was a high school honey from the imaginative woman <br /> <br /> In both movies, from major directors of the UK and China , the passion for restraint was so intense, but in the end the intimate feelings did not develop into physical contacts. It leaves you with a good aftertaste, sniffing it intently, without biting it.
