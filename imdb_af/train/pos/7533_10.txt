I loved this series when it was on Kids WB. I didn't think there was a Batman spin, as the original show ended in 1995. This performance came in 1997. First, I had the idea that Robin left Batman to solve Crime on his own. It was an interesting perspective on their relationship. I also liked the addition of Tim Drake in the series, and again as it had its predecessor, this show had good story lines, great animation (better than the original), fantastic voice work and of course brilliant writing. The only thing I didn't like was when it was in the US. It will often run episodes in a 15-minute story. I just wish some of the episodes might be longer. My favorite episode of any Batman cartoon comes in this series, and it's called "Over the Edge", in my opinion, as good or not as "Heart of Ice" and "Robin's reckoning." Overall a good follow-up, along with Superman this show made my childhood very happy.
