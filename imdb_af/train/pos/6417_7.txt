The inspirational story of Carl Brashear (Cuba Gooding, Jr.), a black man who grew up in Kentucky and then joined the US Navy. He strived to be the first black master diver in naval history. We are shown the series of boys fighting that Brashear has to overcome to make his dream come true (and then to keep it alive.) Not the least of the challenges was Master Diver Bill Sunday (Robert DeNiro), the head coach at The Dive School. fleet sends Brashear, which is not particularly sympathetic to Brashear's goals, but eventually becomes an unlikely friend and supporter. <br /> <br /> It's a good movie; fast and with lots of action, but not an "action" picture in the normal sense of the word. There is also a very human story here, and an interesting study of racism and the struggle to overcome it; There is also a sense of the struggle that took place in the 1960s between older and younger naval officers (the "old fleet" versus the "new fleet.") The performances are pretty good, especially Goodings. I thought DeNiro might have been a little over in his depiction of Sunday (although, know, Sunday was this excessive kind of loose cannon) and the depiction of Sunday's wife, Gwen (by Charlize Theron), also asked me if These parts are jazzed up to offer entertainment value. <br /> <br /> A good movie, though. I never even wondered if it was worth agreeing. <br /> <br /> 7/10
