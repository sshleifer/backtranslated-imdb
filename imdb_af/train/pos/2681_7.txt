As you probably already know, Jess Franco is a productive man. Hes made hundreds on hundreds of films, many of which are shit. However, he succeeded in breaking out occasionally good work under all the composition. Succubus is not his best job (it is either "The Diabolical Dr. Z" or "Vampyros Lesbos"), but it has many of its brands that make it a must for anyone interested in diving into its big catalog. He combines the erotic (alternating between full frontal nudity and leaving somethings to the imagination) and the surreal seamless. It is a very dreamy film, full of good atmosphere. I especially liked the constant name recording. Despite being incredibly pretentious, it is amusing to hear Franco's influences. <br /> <br /> However, there are many users who do not like Succubus and I can see where they come from. It's quiet, but I can handle it. More problematic is the incoherence. The writing here was of course rushed, and within five minutes in the movie I had absolutely no idea what was going on (and it never really came together). Those who want something with their style look elsewhere. Also, if it's a horror movie, it never really becomes frightening or even exciting. Yet I am entertained by all the psychological psychology that I have not quite thought of these big mistakes. (7/10)
