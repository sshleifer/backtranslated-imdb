When scientist and family man Matt Winslow (Robert Urich) finally accepted the invitation to work on the Micro Digitech Corporation in a space suit, he moved with his beloved wife, Patricia (Joanna Cassidy) and their son, Robbie (Barret Oliver) and daughter. Chrissy (Soleil Moon Frye) assembled into a large modern house in the corporation. They meet their friend Tom Peterson (Joe Regalbuto) and his family totally adapted to the new lifestyle, and Tom invites the Winslow family to join the Steaming Springs Country Club. Tom is trying to trick Matt into telling him that every member of the club has a meteoric professional ascension in Micro Digitech, but Matt was not tempted. Later he is introduced to the director of the club, Jessica Jones (Susan Lucci) who welcomes Patricia and convinces her to join the club with her children. Matt feels the change in the behavior of his family and decides to investigate the club and find an evil secret about Jessica and its members. <br /> <br /> In the 80's, when I saw "Invitation to Hell", I liked to like This movie, partly reminiscent of "The Stepford Wives", with people changing the behavior in a suburban connection . I just saw it today, and I found a great metaphorical message against the big corporations, when people literally sell their souls to the devil to climb positions and earn higher salaries. I don't know if the author wants to give this interpretation to the story, but I believe it fits perfectly. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Convite Para o Inferno" ("Invitation to Hell")
