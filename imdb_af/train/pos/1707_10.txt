This movie is not for everyone. You're either bright enough to get it or you're not. Fans of sci-fi movies who don't take themselves too seriously will enjoy this movie. I recommend this movie for those who can appreciate spoofs and parodies. Everyone I recommended this movie enjoyed. If you enjoy Monty Python or Mel Brooks movies, you'll probably enjoy this one. The voice characteristics are done in a tongue-in-cheek manner and the one-liners fly fast and furiously.
