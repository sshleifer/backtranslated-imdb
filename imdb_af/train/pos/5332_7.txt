In the light of bad reviews - or car accidents - I feel in possession of the gear and make a transfer to give merit where applicable and a service. I'm not sure people have a license to say it was so bad, almost automatically. <br /> <br /> It is rare for a movie to have SUSPENSE. This movie holds on to tension, it's for me a whole length, despite any errors it may be. How many movies can it say? Not even big. Because of the simple premise, you don't know if people will come out of the life-threatening situation, which lasts the whole movie. Yes, the suspension was stiff, and over some bumps the shocks did their job. It's not just a TV movie, but an all-action movie; there is no point where it stops, or deviates or talks. It will be difficult to make such a film, always on the road. Just Duel, or Speed, is what I remember. The best thing in them was the constant tension. <br /> <br /> EMPLOYMENT IS NOT BAD: The Judge is as good as ever, and the other is. <br /> <br /> SCRIPT is good. But the jury is deciding if it can be a bit wrong. What seems unrealistic is not necessarily the case. Your first judgments aren't always right, but I think the main actor was right in this movie. <br /> <br /> STUNTS is mostly great, especially for a TV movie. Their only failure could be the noticeable, and apparently, slow speed. But we all know how deceptively slow Grand Prix cars can look. <br /> <br /> I liked the fact that the BEGINNING said, "inspired by a real story." So you're not gonna go how much is true? You just know the base is. The ordinary "based on a true story" makes me think it should be mostly true. But maybe it's my fault. <br /> <br /> HOW TO SAVE THEM: Good reviewer's idea to set a trailer to lift the back wheels. Just do a few inches. A stunt driver can do it at 100 mph. Strange that they didn't call a car expert, or a car electrician or mechanic, to see if there was a way. <br /> <br /> I hope this review has the reverse of this movie being a disaster. Or at least neutral. And it helps to become a runaway success. <br /> <br /> Peak quality is a bit soft for a DVD. <br /> <br /> SPOILER: They would have carved out after the baby was, but strangely, life-saving idea was cleverly handled in a joke conversation to blur it. I think we know why. End of the movie. Suspension of unbelief came out with the baby's top window.
