While the movie sometimes feels almost, it's worth it. Gordon leads a style that reminds you of Vonneguts' writing styles. Ruthless, thoughtful, ironic, peculiar and dark, it's a movie that stays with you for a while, and begs for answers to impossible questions. Nolte, Goodman and Arkin are all incredible. Sheryl Lee is also wonderful, in a role that reminds us Lynch fans of her Laura / Maddy days. do not miss this one!
