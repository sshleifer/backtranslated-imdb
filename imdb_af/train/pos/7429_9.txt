She is such an extraordinary singer, who cares for anything else !!!! The final scene is one of the best moments in any show biz - bar none !! I'm glad she kept the camera on herself for ten minutes - she deserves the iconic status - so is the power of the voice. <br /> <br /> I only saw this movie when I was five and it had a huge impact on me. I see it today, and yes, I can see some of the mistakes (as Esther wants to leave Grammy's law, as her award is announced). <br /> <br /> But some of the other users' comments are simply fake - I mean, where's the free neck - maybe we've seen different movies? <br /> <br /> Streisand's singing ability is monumental, and if she has a great ego fine! <br /> <br /> She earned it.
