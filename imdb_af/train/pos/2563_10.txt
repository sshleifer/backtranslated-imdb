I saw several remarks about Brando that used a southern accent, some of which felt it was a mistake. When this film was made, racism and discrimination were very strong in the South. The Jim Crow laws were still in operation. Civil rights were in its infancy. Could it possibly be a subtle social comment, a Southern man in love with a woman of another race? Similarly, MASH was a subtle criticism of the Vietnam War? Any thoughts? <br /> <br /> Another comment was made about Myoshi Umeki that is cold. Anyone who was in Japan would understand. The Japanese people, at least in my experience, have no inclination to show emotions to strangers. There were strict social rules, especially for men who met single women. Americans in Japan were totally unfamiliar with this culture, and the stupid attempts to meet women were shocking to the ladies. One characteristic of the Japanese was being ashamed when they were embarrassed or uncomfortable, who took many American soldiers as a sign that their advances were welcomed. Also remember that Japan is currently represented in the movie, only defeated and the occupation forces treated with unwilling acceptance. I think Myoshi Umeki gave a very credible view of what her situation would have been. Looking at her interaction with the American actors, several memories of my own experiences in the country have been brought back. I was able to meet some lovely young ladies who, after convincing them that I was not the typical American man, taught me my language and culture during my time in their country.
