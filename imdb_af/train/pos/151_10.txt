Film was designed to influence the audience and this film left me speechless. Obediently photographed and dealt well with dialogue that approaches poetry. The film involves lust, hatred, murder, rape, theft and deception. It weaves an intense web that did not allow me to take my eyes off the screen until the end credits. The story is wiping. It takes the audience from the atrocities of the Spanish Civil War to the human wreckage left behind. Roger Casamajor and Bruno Bertanzoni are two young actors who recommend the screen. Supporting players are excellently cast and give a true sense of authenticity. Sets, lighting, landscape and cinematography are wonderful. I absolutely love photography.
