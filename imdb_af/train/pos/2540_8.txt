Although not as well known as some of their other collaborations (such as the BLACK CAT and THE LIVING SNATCHER), it's a dandy little horror movie, though the decision-making was a bit strange. Boris Karloff plays dr. Janos Rukh, a strange scientist living in the Carpathian Mountains - near where the Dracula character's hometown. Bela Lugosi plays dr. Benet - whose nationality has never been discussed, although the name probably hears French. I really think it would have been meaningful to have the two liaison roles, as the Carpathian role for Lugosi looks tailor-made, especially with its accent. In spite of this unusual twist, the two still performed excellent work. Karloff's was definitely the lead, but Lugosi did well for him as a relatively normal person - something he didn't play very often in movies !! Dr. Rukh is a bit of a pariah, as other scientists (especially Benet) think his theories are bizarre and nonsense. However, in the course of the film, Rukh seems right and Benet is especially generous in his new praise for Rukh. But unfortunately, the wonderful new element Rukh has discovered has the nasty side effect of making him into a murderous machine. (Don't you hate it if it does?). Although it just became a simple, good scientist, a crazy story became, the plot was well-built, the characters were well-developed and the mad Rukh was NOT a one-dimensional killer, but complex and interesting. <br /> <br /> These movies are enjoyed by everyone, except for people who hate old horror movies. You can really tell that Universal Pictures has eliminated everything and made a bigger-budget movie instead of the cheap quickies that both Lugosi and Karloff got unhappy in later years. Good stuff.
