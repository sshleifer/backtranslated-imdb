I saw this important, intense movie tonight. The Richard Gere and Claire's Dane's most important and best work. Gere deserves an Oscar for his fine representation of a man forced into early retirement as a sexual offender-registrar administrator. Claire Danes sounds like the woman Gere handpicks to replace him - a woman he tries to learn everything he can while investigating a final case in which Gere's character is convinced that one of those he is charged with monitor, hold a young girl hostage. The subject is shocking, sex offenders and those who monitor them, but this movie won't be forgotten soon. I know I will be haunted by Gere's portrayal for a very long time. Not since Anthony Hopkins's depiction of a serial killer has feared a screen depiction and has become my engagement. The film opens with shocking statistics, so don't miss the opening credits. Intense and memorable. Richard Gere's best role proves the man can act. Danes can do just as well and both very well in this often challenging movie. <br /> <br /> It's a gutsy movie and Gere gives a multi-layered deep performance. Just give him the Oscar ... he deserves it!
