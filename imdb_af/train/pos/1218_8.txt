This cartoon was strange, but the story actually has a bit more depth and emotion for it than other cartoon films. We have a girl at a camp with low self-esteem and almost no other friends except a brother and sister who is just as miserable as she is. She reaches the ultimate low and when the occasion arises, she literally makes a pact with a devilish demon. I found that this movie is very true for life and only when things can't get worse, the girl she did, she sees and then remorse and then she helps this dark, mystical creature the human quality of love learning. The twins also improve by helping the little bears and they also get a sense of self-worth. A very positive message for children, although some elements of the film were strange, it was and still is a nice movie. The music of Stephen Bishop (Tootsie songs) made the film even better
