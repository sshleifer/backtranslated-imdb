A recommended masterpiece, not only for the underlying themes of the story, but also for the unforgettable brilliant and ingenious work of Angelopoulos, not to mention the acting of giants, Mastroianni and Moreau, and the remarkable character play of Ilias Logothethis.

Not for spending free time, but looking at a work of art with the necessary concentration such as reading a book or attending a concert. Due to the overall photographic style, large screen viewing is recommended. <br /> <br /> Dialogues are used sparingly. But the film includes - in addition to the standard Greek and English-speaking fragments spoken in Albanian, Kurdish and Turkish. It will be attractive to those who are housed in the beauty to hear different languages.
