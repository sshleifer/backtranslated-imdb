If you like adult comedy cartoons, like South Park, it's almost a similar format about the little adventures of three teenage girls at Bromwell High. Keisha, Natella and Latrina gave explosive sweets and behaved like bitches. I think Keisha is a good leader. There are also small stories going on with the teachers of the school. There is the idiotic principal, Mr. Bip, the nerve mathematics teacher and many others. The movie is also fantastic, Lenny Henry's Gina Yashere, East Enders Chrissie Watts, Tracy-Ann Oberman, Smack The Pony's Doon Mackichan, Death Ringers Mark Perry and Blunder's Nina Conti. I didn't know it came from Canada, but it is very good. Very good!
