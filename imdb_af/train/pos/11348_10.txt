I absolutely loved this movie when I was a kid. I cried every time I watched it. It wasn't strange to me. I was completely identified with the characters. I'd love to see it again (and hope I won't be disappointed!). Pufnstuf rocks !!!! I was really drawn into the fantasy world. And for me the movie was loose. I wonder if I ever saw the series and confused them? The acting I thought was strong. I loved Jack Wilde. He was so dreamy for a 10-year-old (when I first saw the movie, not in 1970). I can still remember the characters alive. The whistle was completely credible and I can still feel the evil wood. Witchy poo was scary - I don't want to cross her path.
