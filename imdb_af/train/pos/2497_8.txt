Indeed: drug use, warehouse shooting-ups, Matrix-esque bullet dodging, a futuristic city with a mixture of Asian races, and a lonely vampire - all in the same movie - look like a story that can only be by ' suggested a Japanese pop / rock star. And that's exactly what Moon Child is, and more. While all of these elements can look like the perfect subject for a B-week cam-movie, Moon Child pulls it off, but some anticipated bumps and witches en route. <br /> <br /> The film has a sharp, definite independent feel of it, jumping from one scene to the next in smooth transition, but rather sporadic leaps and bounds, giving glimpses in the characters' lives and barely scrape on a real plot. But the film makes no excuse, but makes the story in one of friendship, love, trust and betrayal, all sugar covered in the aforementioned elements of a futuristic society, fighting gangsters and vampires. <br /> <br /> HYDE like the gloomy vampire 'Kei' is excellent, gives depth to character and balances the overly zealous action of Gackt as 'Sho', an orphan who befriends Kei. Lee-Hom Wang also shines as the inventive 'boy' who becomes friends with an adult Sho. The story revolves around these characters and their extended friends and family through different periods in their lives, and how simple friendship can be so easily changed to grief and betrayal. <br /> <br /> While the action at times is also all unrealistic and special effects appear just for display. One thing the movie never does is supposed to be about the very popular Asian singers it contains. The superstars as actors have their mistakes, and so they do characters. The movie is rarely boring, and ends where it needs to, after it has jumped over a little. 'Moon Child' is quite nice, humorous at times, and even touches: it's definitely worth it!
