Dog Bite Dog won't be for everyone, but I really enjoyed it. Full beating, stabbing and shooting (but don't worry, the head is a terrible shot), it can best be described as a violent skirt by Hong Kong and Cambodia. Edison Cheng plays Pang, a Cambodian killer in town to kill a lawyer. Despite the dirtiness of his journey, he is almost immediately at a large table in the middle of a clear expensive restaurant. If it seems impossible for you, you should probably avoid this movie. It took me to suspend unbelief, and I had much more fun. <br /> <br /> Chasing Pang down is Wai (Sam Lee), a young, edgy cop who likes people almost as much as he likes to smoke. Wai runs a fine line that has investigated internal affairs, and his father, a legendary Good Cop, is in a coma after a south-facing drug deal. (The implication is that Wai dropped his rap for his own corrupt transactions). <br /> <br /> There is a car accident, many murders and a strange and uncomfortable love story presented here. It all played in almost cartoon style. I suspect that the humor was deliberate (no one uses giant concrete blooms without regard to the excessive absurdity), although the over-the-top nature has lost some of my fellow-audiences. There are at least three points where the movie may have ended, and at 109 minutes it made it possible for more merciless editing, or deleting one of the narrative threads (the light things worked well, so I would have omitted the interactions with the three fathers). <br /> <br /> I tend to give it a (high) pass but only because of the end? I rarely heard so many people laughing so hard at what was a pleasant moment. It is one to see with a group of friends who love the ridiculous
