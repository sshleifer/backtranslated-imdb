I'm very picky about the movies I see. I accidentally heard from Moon Child. For some time I was a fan of L'Arc And Ciel and a fan of Gackt and Mizer. <br /> <br /> Eventually I realized the movie was released and picked up without a second thought. <br /> <br /> Being as critical as I am about movies, I will admit, the action scenes can sometimes be hokey ... but they are meant to be, as another user suggested, this is the essential calm before the storm, with Gary Oldman from Leon ... without getting into the foreigners, the movie became very difficult to me because you realize that the boundaries of friendship are unlimited and as they often say, true friendship is loyalty and such as Hyde and Gackt give performances that show why they can make such depth in their song songs. Their passion for music happens on the big screen and in the process. It creates an exemplary film that will come in your soul and react emotionally. <br /> <br /> When you see the movie for the first time, I realized that it will probably be in heavy rotation as far as my collection goes. I want to encourage someone who reads this post to pick up the movie if you want to get away from the current Hollywood trend in film ... it takes a whole new direction with the use of classic Yakuza movie elements and how can you go wrong with A cameo from Ryo Ishibashi from Takashi Miike's "Audition" and "Suicide Club" boasts. <br /> <br /> Man .. I just can't say enough about this movie, but I'll stop here. <br /> <br /> 10/10
