I love this TV show so much. It contains animation that is interesting and beautiful. I can't believe they cut it off from TV, and also that I never found out if cybersix and data7 died or not, apparently they survived, but I'm not sure. Cybersix was by far the BEST TV program ever. I know it's too late to hope they'll start the series again, so I'm really glad I should see it. I have so much <3 <br /> <br /> about a woman called cybersix, she is not human. She goes through Adrian Sieldman, a high school man teacher. Now cybersix is ​​actually a woman, she's just disguised as a man in the day. At night, cybersix patrols the city. <br /> <br /> A man named Von Reichter is the one who created cybersix. And as soon as he found that his life, he used everything he could to catch her. <Br /> <br /> If you've never looked at it, download it completely. It was the best TV show in the world. Why did they cut it off? some people have problems. but I am glad I watched the 13 episodes.
