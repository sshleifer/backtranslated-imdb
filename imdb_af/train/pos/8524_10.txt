The kids, aged 7 to 14, got such a big kick from this movie, and this year we gave a copy to all the other kids on our birthday list. Everyone loved it! Children from 2 to 7 watch it repeatedly and regularly and we get a kick to watch it with them. <br /> <br /> It is rare for a movie to entertain children for so long, and laughs at adults, too. Most enjoy it more than the first. <br /> <br /> Top-quality production and an outstanding role-play, led by Christopher Showerman as a superior George - athletic, energetic and fully credible, with a lovely innocence and a special tree in mind - well supported by careless Christina Pickles as the evil mother-in-law, Thomas Haden Church as the evil jerk rival, and everyone else. It's fun.
