The book on which this movie is based was excellent; It took a while to understand Houellebecq's unconventional style, but as soon as I understood the mood behind the writing, I was totally drawn into the author's world of sadness. In fact, no other book has affected me so much. It is not necessarily a good thing - it has eased my own personal struggle and made the futility of my own struggle more difficult to accept. Houellebecq's insights are masterfully captured by Harel and the hero's apathy and indifference to a world that has rejected him is perfectly portrayed. It is a movie that reveals today's society to the humble man in all its horror. Hopefully things will change in the future, but for the moment we have to accept the gear as shown in this movie. It is probably best that Harel or Houellebecq does not create such a genius work again. One is enough for any man.
