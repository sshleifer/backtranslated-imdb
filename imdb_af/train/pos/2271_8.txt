I just recently listened to the directors' comments for this movie, and I think the one big thing I got with it is that this film, like Mann's The Insider, is totally subjective. That's from Howard's POV. So, any review or attempt to consider a set of comments about it, as Ebert did, is actually about Nolte's character. If you feel the movie doesn't "work" then you say I think Howard is not working. And to be honest, you can be right. Howard's reasoning and personality really won't stand on professional mental treatments and analysis. <br /> <br /> But this is the nature of people. <br /> <br /> Andrew.
