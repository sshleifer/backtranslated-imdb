I'm not a big Tim Matheson fan, but I have to admit I love this movie. It was dark and a little upset with some scenes a bit edgy, I don't know how to classify this movie, it's a little SF and a little horror slash thriller. So on my local channel there was nothing else so I decided to watch it. If you did not see this movie ID, recommend it is not really that bad, the characters are interesting enough, but not really exploring their full potential that could make this movie even better. I don't know if this movie went to the theater, but it felt like it was made for TV or went straight to the video because I would buy it. if it is on DVD, it fits well with my kind of movie and has a small portion of the X-FILES story attached to it. Government firms or sharp corporations involved in dodgy shadow transactions. Generally a good movie.
