A couple (Janet and Richard) are camping in the bush near a giant marsh. After camping and enjoying nature, the couple take shelter in what they think is a deserted place. Soon some escaped prisoners will appear and, after many unexpected delays, they will rape Janet and join Richard in a birdhouse. <br /> <br /> This LAST HOUSE on LIFE film should be one of the most underrated horror movies ever made. It's one of the more sick and twisted early 70s shockers. In addition, I found it to be very enchanting and beautiful in its perverted tone. I love CAGED TERROR. The music certainly helps a sense of personality for the film as well as a lot of beauty. I found the movie very funny. <br /> <br /> The mistakes are mainly related to the pacing of the film, that is, the film is quite slow and winding. While I didn't think of the pacing due to the beauty and excitement of that particular movie, I think it would be most people. The acting is not too good, nor the dialogue, at least in the early stages. This movie takes a little more patience than usual, and it really isn't for everyone. <br /> <br /> In short, this was a good movie. Not the biggest horror movie I've ever seen, but it's definitely fun. It's not exactly the easiest movie to find. It is possible to find it in the USED section of many stores if you look hard enough. It's not for everyone, but if you're a fan of the trash, it's definitely worth checking out.
