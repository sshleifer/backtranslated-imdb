Oh, Domino is actually a fresh air, something new to the cinema world. I enjoyed the movie very much because of the complicated plot, the varied characters and the intense camera effects. I complained about the camera and almost, according to the creators themselves, the flashy and wild shots were the highlight of mistakes made over time. All you see was the desired effect. Maybe some complain because there has never been such a thing as it has ever done, though it does break it down. In a deeper aspect, what you see is how Domino sees things through her eyes, think about it. <br /> <br /> As far as the story is concerned, I see nothing at all about it. In spite of this, it is "messy" nature, according to some, it's actually just a quick form of storytelling. The plot is really not that difficult to follow, if you actually focus on what's going on. Maybe it's just me because I see movies from many different aspects, such as acting, plot, etc. I'm not an interpreter or something that plays movies apart, it just comes to me. Having said that, I believe it is quite an excellent movie indeed, despite the future as a cult classic, sting or whatever. <br /> <br /> And the characters, there is no doubt how varied the cast is. I believe the movie is excellent, as they all do good work that portray their characters effectively, it makes a movie ladies and gentlemen. The characters are all very unique and a plus is that you have to experience a small piece of each of their lives and they have to fall even further apart. Actually, I personally loved the movie and characters. <br /> <br /> Anyone who bashes and burns this movie may not be able to see it or just call it. It doesn't matter, it's a good movie in its own right, no, it's a good movie period.
