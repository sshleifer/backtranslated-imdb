It's one of the loudest episodes in that the plot was really an excuse to just have fun. BUT, I appreciated this light approach and it is truly one of the best episodes to see at a pure fun level. Think about it - the crew members meet with the white rabbit and Alice from Wonderland, a Bengal tiger, a Samurai warrior, a knight riding horse, and McCoy killing and an army of other seemingly bizarre events that just don't feel anything to the end. Despite all the danger, you just can't take it all seriously - it's just too fun and the whole episode looks very surreal. So, on a purely non-aesthetic level, it's good stuff.
