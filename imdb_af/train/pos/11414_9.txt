A great story with a message. Joan Plowright is wonderful as "Phoebe", Mike Kopsa is hilarious as a coach and Richard de Klerk plays the role of "Carmine" excellently. Mischa Barton as "Frankie" puts a good performance and Ingrid as "Hazel" plays her first head very well. This film is excellently directed by Jo-Beth Williams. The editing is first time.
