The last chapter in the Hanzo Razor trilogy provides a fitting conclusion for this entertaining series of samurai exploitation. Inoue replaces Yasuzu Masumura (Blind Beast, Red Angel, Manji) in the director's seat, but the style is almost the same, perhaps due to Shintaro Katsu who acts as a producer, apart from the titular antihero. <br /> <br /> Hanzo unveils a female ghost guarding a treasure in the bottom of the lake. Of course, Hanzo is Hanzo, he is not deterred by the fact that she is a ghost, so he continues to rape. Ahem, questioning her, using the well-known lathe network. The plot takes a series of blind monks, including doubletime as loan port, corrupt officials, vile women and the necessary heel and cut. Hanzo's superior officer, Onishi, and his two servants provide the typical comic notes, and generally it's business as usual. <br /> <br /> Significantly less complicated and easier to follow than the first (which is all over the place and a bit of a mess), less stylish, dramatic and bloody than the second (probably the best in the Hanzo series), but still entertaining and worth its own merit. Complete with trademark training series, mandatory rape, sword fighting and a riddle Hanzo are requested to investigate. This will ultimately satisfy the fans.
