Based on a true story of how a man before his time - the great 19th-century American poet and humanist Walt Whitman - made an important contribution to how Western medicine is treating people with psychological problems. <br /> <br /> Interested in treating people with psychological problems, he started associating with psychiatric workers and patients. After the psychological methods of the time (inhuman and illegal cruel methods), Walt rejected the methods and treated patients with compassion and dignity, and encouraged others to do the same.> The story of Walt's interactions with psychiatric workers, patients and urban people is full of drama, good humor and wisdom. :)
