It has long been one of my favorite adaptations of an Austen novel. Although definitely not in the same category as the spectacular "Pride and Prejudice", Emma is a lazy and relatively faithful TV version of Austen's novel - especially in view of its short length. The biggest change between the novel and the movie is a good one, as the unnecessary snobbery that Austen puts at the end of the story is removed here and replaced by someone much more in line with Emma's character in the rest of the the book is. I thought the characters selected to portray the rolls were well picked. Kate Beckinsale runs the fine line between girlishness and the social snob with a grace completely lost in Gwyneth Paltrow's '96 version. Samantha Morton's wispy blonde locks fit her attitude and character as the simper who accompanies her role in previous characteristics, replaced with the Harriet we know from the book. Mr Knightly's role is very well executed in my opinion; Both the seriousness and the gentle compassion with which the hero was painted in the novel is here in this very neglected, spectacular film.
