Full disclosure: I am a synika. I love my ends sad and dry my hands. I didn't cry when Bambi's mother was shot. Will Smith's new movie Happiness looks like a desperate plea for an Oscar. Actually, I was born without an artistic soul. <br /> <br /> So why on earth did I have "10 items or less"? Maybe it was the double espresso I finished before the show. Or (more likely), perhaps it was that even the most cooked movie fans could use a shot of sweetness. <br /> <br /> It's sweet. From the moment "Him" meets "Scarlet" (an event far from a Nora Ephron "meets cute"), the view is taken on an intimate journey with two strangers caring about where their lives are heading. (Beautifully supported by Phedon Papamichael's movie reality style camera works.) <br /> <br /> The main argument about the movie is that it is too far out. Is the movie fetched? I do not know. Tell me. I met Adrian Brody on the market. (But not for lack of trying). Do I like to consider the adventures that may occur if this important event occurs? Darn I do straight. . This is where most reviews fall into 10 items or less. . They don't take into account that even our cynics have fantasies. And it's sometimes worthwhile to earn the admission price to live 82 minutes at a time.
