If it was possible to distill the heart and soul of the sport - no, the pure lifestyle - to navigate to its perfect shape, this documentary did it. This documentary document shows that life is not just about the waves, but it is more about the people, the pioneers and the cutting edge that pushes the envelope of the big wave further than it ever was. <br /> <br /> Stacy Peralta - a virtual legend from my early 80s skateboarding days as a SoCal teen - has edited and created reams of incredible stock and interviewing that are not just a documentary, but a masterpiece of the genre. When his heart and soul are in the subject - and clearly it is here - his genius is fraught with a pure vision that does not glamorize his subject, hype or sentimental. He respects surfers and the surf / beach lifestyle, but does not make it white. There is also a serious reality for the sport. <br /> <br /> There is so much that can be said about this documentary, about the surfers, the early history of the sport and the wild golfers surfing this profile. Greg Noll, the first big golf personality who probably started the sport; Jeff Carter, a wonderful man who has traveled almost alone for 15 years on Northern California's extremely dangerous Maverick's great surf; and the centerpiece of the documentary, Laird Hamliton, the great wave surfer's contemporary messiah. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of heart and warmth among all these guys - and a few girls on camera - and a deep and powerful love for surfing and the sea that comes in every word. I got the story of how Hamilton's adopted father met him and how Hamilton as a small 4 or 5-year-old boy actually forced him to be heartwarming (and deprived of stripped sentimentality) of his father. <br /> <br /> If you want to navigate - or even if you don't - it's a great documentary to look at, even if it's just because you are a student of the form or someone who simply did amazingly well art work
