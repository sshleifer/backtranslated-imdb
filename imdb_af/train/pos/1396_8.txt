Probably one of the leading examples of an exciting dramatic episode (in this case, the wonderful balance of terror) with a lighter affair, is Shore Leave's first true attempt to sci-fi a more entertaining piece on behalf of the Star Trek writers -fi, and while the formula is not quite right in this entry (the true triumph is Trouble with Tribbles, in Season 2), the laugh is pretty fast, as long as the viewer is willing to allow for all the folly. <br /> <br /> Deviation from the tradition of the show, the Enterprise is not on any proper mission in this episode. Instead, Kirk got a perfect planet for his crew to provide some service: a well-deserved break after three months of continuous work. The terrestrial planet (a budget-related fact) is very attractive, but it only takes a few minutes before something strange happens: Dr. McCoy begins with visions of a white rabbit coming straight from Lewis Carroll's work. Soon, other people will experience similar things: a woman meets a Don Juan-like character, Sulu has an intake with a samurai, and Kirk has a double encounter with the past in the form of almost love and the man who used to choose him at the Academy. Throw a freakish, straight tiger and it's easy to see why Kirk and Spock are determined to figure out what's going on before someone gets hurt. <br /> <br /> The idea is a classic one: idyllic place seems to be far from heavenly. The episode's humorous action is quite successful, it's not for a dark event that doesn't fit well with the rest (of course, everything works well, comes back to the end) and the general reluctance of the cast to show off. funny side of themselves (especially and ironically, the otherwise hilarious William Shatner). And yet, Shore Leave deserves recognition that this is another good example of the writers trying new, previously unseen things: the definition of Star Trek's success. <br /> <br /> 7.5 / 10
