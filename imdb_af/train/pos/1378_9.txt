I saw this little Belgian gemstone two days after I saw 'American Teen'. Make no mistake about it, adolescence is a rollercoaster ride, whether it's American or European. 'Naissance des Pieuvres' (or as mentioned in the US 'Water Lillies') is a story of a young 15 year old girl (played by Pauline Acquart, who sometimes looks like a young Scarlett Johansson) girl who is at school want to be a swimming team, just to be near another attractive girl (Adele Haenel). It is more than obvious that Marie is more attracted to Floriane. Fishing under it all is Marie's rather plump, unattractive friend, Anne, who just wants a boyfriend like any other girl who has her age. Along the way, we show the usual range of teenage pastimes (broken hearts, store raising, alcohol and / or drug use, comfortable sex, etc.). It's a quiet movie that takes time to work. This is a way to work in your system. (Michael Bay fans, note: the pacing here is s-l-o-w, so pushing clearly), but if you have no problem with it, Water Lillies is a charmer. No review here but will deduct a hard "R" due to language, nudity, adult situations.
