Charles Boyer is supposed to be Spanish, and he came to London to buy coal in "Confidential Agent", a 1945 movie featuring Lauren Bacall, Katina Paxinou, Peter Lorre, Dan Seymour and Wanda Hendrix's lead roles. Boyer is Luis Denard, and everyone is out to stop him except Bacall. His papers are stolen, he is accused of being murdered, but he is determined to get coal for his people to fight the fascists. <br /> <br /> This movie has its good and not so good points. It is high for atmosphere and tension, and it is highly entertaining. Bacall is incredibly beautiful, Boyer is passionate, Paxinou is mean, Lorre is smart, Hendrix is ​​pretty pathetic, and Seymour is extremely wonderful. <br /> <br /> The not so good points: Bacall is supposed to be English, and Boyer Spanish. Uh, no. Boyer is great in his role, even with the wrong accent, but Bacall is 100% American, not British. The two have no chemistry. Conclusion: Bacall is somewhat disregarded. Her actions are also not sniffing; She's better in other movies. But she is an amazing looking woman, and many can be forgiven. <br /> <br /> Paxinou is almost over and hateful. Then Seymour almost steals the entire movie as a hotel guest studying human nature. It's a big part and its performance is perfect, while some of the other actors' direction is not that good. It was definitely a case of not small parts, just small actors. Seymour was not a small actor. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing even with its mistakes.
