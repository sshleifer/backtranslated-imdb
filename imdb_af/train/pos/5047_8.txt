Actor Paxton made his director debut with this cold, dark and capable writer on a widow mechanic (Paxton himself) who focuses on his two sons to participate in jungle murders, claiming that the victims are not humans at all, but "demons" and that they were chosen by God to destroy these "demons". It is all told in the backlash of one of the boys, who has now grown up (Matthew McConaughey) to a skeptical FBI agent (Powers Boothe). <br /> <br /> This movie is hard to forget automatically; Better than most serial killer features, it is a twisted and disturbing story that is simply told with bare minimum biosets. Paxton, with praise, barely shows any blood to the end. Well done by all, especially the two child actors (Jeremy Sumpter of recent "Peter Pan" and Matt O'Leary of "Spy Kids 2" and "Domestic Disturbance"). The only reason I deducted any points is because I can understand that some people find it difficult to stomach. Anyway, it's an atypical stuff with a decent writing. <br /> <br /> 8/10
