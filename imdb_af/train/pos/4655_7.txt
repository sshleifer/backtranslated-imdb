Peter Ustinov plays an eclipse that comes just out of jail when the movie starts. As soon as he runs the gates, he immediately starts working on a scheme to make another bundle by stealing, although this time his images are quite high. This is actually one of the weaknesses about the movie, as he apparently knows nothing about computers (some returned in 1968), but managed to literally overnight a computer genius! Yes, right. Anyway, he comes up with a scheme to personalize a computer expert and get a job with a large US corporation so he can eventually obscure a lot of cash. Considering his knowledge of computers is rudimentary, it's amazing how he launches a brilliant plan and manages to infiltrate the computer system and his defense. But that's a movie, so I could suspend unbelief. By the end of the film, he and his new wife (Maggie Smith) could run away with a million pounds. <br /> <br /> In the end, however, it becomes very, very confusing and Smith announces she has actually accumulated more than two million by investing in the companies that started Ustinov (although she doesn't realize them are all stupid companies). This should mean that eventually these shares she bought were worthless. What it seems to imply (and it may be advisable to me) is that Ustinov and its new partners have quickly paid into the shares before it became known and the shares would become worthless. Either way, the movie seems to be ending at a magical end, by which nobody is hurt and everyone is happy - and it just didn't make much sense. It's a pity, really, since the acting and most of the writing was great. Karl Malden, Bob Newhart, Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith were just wonderful. <br /> <br /> If I seem to have interpreted the end, let me know, since the movie was very vague at the end.
