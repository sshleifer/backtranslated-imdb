<br /> <br /> Everything is relatively like the main theme from the beginning by this set of eleven pieces by eleven directors. That is to say that the first priority for people like Bush, Blair and Company may not be so for many other people, ordinary people. From the opening scene in which an Iranian teacher tries to impress her little ones, the most important thing has happened, with the result that the children are not impressed, such as the death of a neighbor and things as it seems to be much worse than anything What happened in New York, USA, wherever it is, establishes this series of almost documentary styles that not all things are as equal to all people as some world leaders are trying to prophesy. <br /> <br /> While the attack on the WTC was, of course, a turbulent event by any measure, one gets the impression that both politicians and TV cameras tend to inflate things from all relationships - marvelously manifested in one of these pieces. Would the same reaction take place at international level if the attack on Lagos say whether Jakarta was done, say or even say in Rio de Janeiro? I don't think so. News seems to be distorting, depending on where things are happening: much more TV time has been given to an earthquake in Italy, say, than one ten times more destructive in Outer Mongolia. Larger distances seem to reduce the size of the disaster. <br /> <br /> This series of eleven pieces helps to put things in a better perspective - or, perhaps I should say, do some of the pieces, as each director has set his own story with full freedom, she own translation perspective so that it is not possible to judge the whole merit, but individually for every eleven-minute segment. <br /> <br /> In no way should one conclude that it is an anti-American movie: it would be too simple a reading of the diverse messages manifested by the segments. However, this is not American. The eleven segments take on different attitudes and the common link - if any - is that the disaster of the WTC attack should be viewed from different points of view from a perspective. Only then will such people as George Bush first understand the planet he lives on. <br /> <br /> Clearly, in one segment is my belief that I've been hammering for two years now. America did not learn the lesson. And the lesson is that the US should share this planet with the rest of mankind - don't dominate it by merciless economic conviction or just ordinary power. Instead of learning that the US cannot continue to bump over everyone and everywhere, its political leaders, supported and attacked by Blair (and even Aznar), become even more arrogant and even more intolerant, no one in Afghanistan does anything at all. or Iraq at the moment, let alone many elsewhere. The White House's mentality is completely unacceptable: the US and the UK have invaded Iraq and caused all the chaos, and so they have to clear up the mess they caused. Do not insist that the UN and other nations be buried with a helping hand and thus easily find it. away from the turmoil. <br /> <br /> Radical views adopted by the US (or even Israel) are used only by radical views of Islamic people who have been tackling fanatic fundamentalism for years, if they only cover their own macho. futility, that is to say, killing women or simply surrounding them from the top of their heads to the dusty ground. <br /> <br /> The world is in a terrible mess, fueled by the greed of some rich countries that seem to see or understand nothing from more multilateral perspectives. This film in eleven separate pieces accurately portrays this dark and stupid attitude.
