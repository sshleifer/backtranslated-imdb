I saw this movie many years ago and it made me a lasting impression. Unfortunately, over the years, I've hardened many movies and didn't expect to be impressed by California again recently. It is pleasant to say that it is just as unnecessary and visible as it was ten or so years ago. <br /> <br /> There are two things this movie really does. The first is his cast. We had a staggering turn by a young Brad Pitt as early as Grace. Knowing that Pitt, as we all do, is one of Hollywood's most enduring hearts ever, is refreshing to see how he plays such a nasty, unattractive character. Pitt pulled off the show without attacking white-dirty clich√© or parody, and managed to stay terribly frightening through the film. <br /> <br /> Juliette Lewis is as impressive as Grace's tragic friend, playing the character like a ten year old. old girl with a 40s life experience. Lewis manages compassion (for her character's station in life) as well as contempt (for her naivety), but she endorses her performance with the kind of subtlety rarely seen by an actor so young. Personally, I think it's a tragedy not named Pitt or Lewis for any awards for their performances here. <br /> <br /> David Duchovony and Michelle Forbes are both perfectly thrown as the yuppy couple unaware of traveling the US with Pitt and Lewis. Duchovony is rather geeky and naive, and Forbes seems cynical and concise, but both actors succeed in convincingly portraying their characters' changes, as they are equally enriched, apostate and strange to Pitt. <br /> <br /> The fine casting and uniform brilliant performance, this movie really takes us through the proverbial balls through its flawless pacing. By the time 'California' was released, Hollywood released a bunch of beautiful character-out-to-psychotic movies ('Single White Female', 'Pacific Heights',' The Hand That Rocks' The Cradle '' Deception ' , "Sleep with the enemy" etc.). Most of these movies followed the same formula, the only variation being the kind of relationship between good old and bad guy. "California" doesn't really get too far from this area, but its first two acts are the perfect example of the slow chore player, and we are kept at the edge of our seats waiting for the tide to turn. /> <br /> When the penny falls, and Pitt is released to play the manic bad man, the movie moves completely gears and the last twenty minutes don't quite live in the rest of the movie. That said, the action is thick and fast and the resolution is suitably cold. The battle is over, but the scars will always be there. <br /> <br /> Much of the narrative (presented by a somewhat whiny, pre-X file Duchovony) is a bit confronted. Of course, it is meant to write from the book written by the Duchovony's journal character, so one can argue that the self-conscious narrative is intended to be a nod to the kind of sensational style in which most journalists write. <br /> <br /> The movie is largely a success and is definitely a cut above 90% of the exciters of the past twenty years. Highly recommended, but not for the weak of the stomach or mind. This film is disturbed on more than one level. But then it is meant to be.
