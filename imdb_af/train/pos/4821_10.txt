One of those beautifully intense movies that moves us so intimately, ends very soon! Then they looked at the screen like, "No, they didn't!" Lol. Good performances around the world! The play is wonderful with Emily Blunt simply outstanding! I knew she would give a solid, convincing performance that captures Victoria's regency, mood and vulnerability throughout the movie. The production is also excellent in all ways: style, fabric and sensitivity. A remarkable look at a remarkable time in Britain's history, told by a very personal and touch of school-going age princess until she was queen, and later married to Prince Albert, ending with the birth of their first nine children. It had a well written script and error-free editing. Rupert Friend as the ever so patient and compassionate young Prince Albert who fled to the young queen's attention was to ensure her love for Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany). Just as busy was the relationship between teenage Victoria and her mother, who was sometimes cruel, as with her mother and King William (who also did not like her mother). The acting and plays were fascinating, highly emotional. <br /> <br /> I would recommend it to anyone interested in the historical and political situation that exists in that era, and indeed someone who loves a compelling true romance story
