Granted I saw a "Speed ​​Racer", but I never really saw it and I also saw other shows that some characters dressed as birds flying a ship called the Phoenix and a others revolve around a spaceship that looks like a giant ocean, and for some reason it flew backwards and was very dark and difficult to understand for someone who was perhaps five. This one though I watched almost every episode and the incredible to me at the time was that this show had some solution to it. It actually ended. The bad guys have done in contrast to almost every American cartoon where nothing is really done, like the last episode of the generation of Transformers that ended with Galvatron and this new bad guy who never gets the Autobots, Dungeons and Dragons with the kids . make it home, with GI Joe with Cobra still out there ready to try again and so on and so on. This one ended and had a pretty cool robot that got new weapons as the performance progressed. It was a bit thin to start because it couldn't fly and only had some very cool weapons. As it did, he got a cool shooting fist, like the one Android 16 that was used against Cell in Dragonball Z. Then the weapon developed to include razor blades. Then the big robot even had wings so he could fly and even more weapons were taken up in the wings. He will also get some allies in a female robot and a funny one, called Bobo in America. The villains don't just consist of dr. Hell, but a very strange person who was half-man and a man with a flying head. Interesting display and it was nice to see a conclusion.
