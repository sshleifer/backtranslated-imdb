LES CONVOYEURS ATTENDENT was the first movie I saw in 2000 and I doubt I will see a better one this year. This beautiful tragicomedy by Belgian filmmaker Benoit Mariage is in the industrial residential areas of Wallonia. Benoit Poelvoorde plays a father who desperately wants his son to win a car (a Lada!) For him. To do this, the boy must open the doors of the record. What the father actually wants for his son is someone, because he has never mentioned it as the reporter of local news for a newspaper ironic L'Espoir (Hope). Of course nothing works as planned. This movie can best be compared to Aki Kaurismäki's DRIFTING CLOUDS, although it is more dramatic and the humor is darker. Just as in that movie, the show is more melancholy than depressed and ends up optimistic without being unrealistically happy. The humor is absurd, without making the plot incredible, and Mariage finds impressive images in the dark settings that never seem artificial. The best thing about LES CONVOYEURS ATTENDENT is the performance of Poelvoorde. This actor became known to the brilliant cult-classical C'EST ARRIVÉ PRES DE CHEZ VOUS in which he played the charismatic Hitman. Since then, he has played only two minor roles in films not released in the Netherlands, because, as he said in an interview, he was not convinced of his own acting abilities and all the roles he offered were repetitions of the Ben character. With his return to a leading role in LCA, there should be no doubt about his acting. He is simply brilliant as a man who is stupid and angry to put his family in misery, but clever enough to realize what he has done and is torn by repentance. A must see.
