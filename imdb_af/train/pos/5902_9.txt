As a Westerner looking at another culture's view and tradition of marriage, I found Just Married enchanting and delightful. The idea of ​​marrying a stranger with the mutual arrangement of parents is difficult, especially in this modern era. Yet this is the case in this Hindi movie. Tell us with humor and fresh perspective, we learn from Abhay and Ritika who once met and are now on their traditional five-day honeymoon. As said, it is difficult to believe in this mobile-prosperous age that such an archaic habit as a regular marriage still occurs. We see the discomfort this young couple feels when they come together on their first night and how they try to make a bond, even though they don't know each other. We see different views of marriage and dedication as offered by the other couples on holiday, from a few forty years married to others who are not yet sure of the marriage relationship. There is a song, witty dialogue, gripping moments, blending and comparing new ways and traditions. Watching the movie with subtitles definitely loses some of the truth of the story, but it's still a pleasure to watch. Granted some of the plot is a little bit trite and the bus incident a little pulled out and confronted; but the overall movie was worth watching.
