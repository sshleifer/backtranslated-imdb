Red Eye is an exciting movie by creator Freddy Kreuger, Wes Craven. Wes Craven portrays the story of a regular hotel worker Lisa. After burying her grandmother, she decided to take the red eye flight. As she waits, she meets this man, Jack Rippner, (how is fffrreeaakkyy it?) And they become friends. Ironically, both are sitting right next to each other on this plane. Then it's when the horror begins. This movie is exciting and for the faint-hearted people who don't like exciting / horror movies, we can say that they can be dropped into their pants. This is an excellent example of a bottle production. Wes Craven did well with this movie. He chose the right actors, such as Rachel McAdams, an intelligent, sexy girl who knows what she is doing and is careful of everything when acting in a movie. Cillian Murphy, the frightening and frightening actor who can chew your legs while his amazing play is the bad character in this movie, and his face can really enlarge your eyes. Wes Craven did an excellent job and I hope he makes more movies like this one.
