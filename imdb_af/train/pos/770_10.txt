I love Tudor Chirila and maybe that's why I enjoyed the movie so much. Two days before the movie prize I went to see his concert. I saw the trailer and the video "zmeu" in front of the movie, and I thought I found out everything. I went wrong: instead of a good movie, I helped a good one! I felt the movie. it was sad .. it was funny .. but most of it made it LOVE .. i can't even describe the soundtrack so i won't :) I'm not a film critic. I can describe it in more words. My kinda vague description is all because the play left me speechless. Thanks for the keyboard. Thank you Tudor Giurgiu, thank you Maria Popistasu, thank you Ioana Barbu and THANK YOU TUDOR CHIRILA. Encore! :)
