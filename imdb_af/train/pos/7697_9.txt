It's another big movie I had the good fortune to see on the big screen for the first time (thanks to Rick Baker et al). Back in the late 80's, I was a relative newcomer to the genre and just new to the big three JC, SH & YB. I wasn't sure what to expect when I paid my hard earned money to see it in a "Triple Bill of Classics" at the old Scala. I don't have to worry, I was left breathless by this movie. If you're a fan of Hong Kong Action / Kung Fu movies and haven't seen this movie, do it now!
