I found the memorable quotes looking for video clips; they forgot one of my favorites ... <br /> <br /> Old Person 1: You know, I remember the first time they played that thing. <br /> <br /> Old Person 2: You remember pterodactyls. <br /> <br /> Old Person 1: And I can remember that you fall for it, hookline and sinker. <br /> <br /> Old Person 2: Oh, I didn't. <br /> <br /> Old Lady: You did it. You put a big bucket on your head and left with their army boys to fight Martians. <br /> <br /> Old Person 2: Aren't you dead yet?
