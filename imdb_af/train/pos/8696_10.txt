One of the unhealthy jewels of the 1980s, Scenes ... has razor-sharp satire and excellent performances from Arnetia Walker (how did she not have a lot of roles after that?) And Wallace Shawn. It is a wonderful send of class warfare and the people in that class. The writing is hilarious and the characters, while not subtle, are nuanced. And sorry, but the Asian gangs (if you can call one Japanese man who expresses one of the other characters a "gang") is not adapted to sociological value. The value here lies in what makes the movie fun and in the hopeless way it does. I found it creative, funny and idiosyncratic.
