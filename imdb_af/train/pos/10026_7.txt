Without Kirsten Miller, this project should not be completed. But with the awesome beauty and talent of me. Miller is, I would definitely recommend it. The other actors seemed to play only for her strong performance. Wagner's painful attempt to honor this film was a bit disappointing, but his few scenes didn't detract from entertainment. Mostly, my criticism of the writing and plot line, the group of talent that came together, did a heroic job to save what had to be a disaster. The charismatic Miller delivery and timing was impeccable and credible. She plays the fine line between assertive and boss, but never offensive, she is actually the structural engineer she claims. I wish I saw it on the big screen, but unfortunately I was lucky to rent it before it got lost.
