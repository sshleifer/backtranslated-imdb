Although it is definitely politically wrong to entertain drunk, there is such a charm for Dudley Moore's portrayal of lovely lush, Arthur Bach, one cannot help feeling this unique and wonderful character. How can you not be entertained by that contagious laugh and giggle and fullness. Although I'm not really a Liza Minnelli fan, she was really great like Linda Marolla and I couldn't play anyone else in that role. Sir John Gielgud was the heart of the film and earned his Oscar. The rest of the cast is also excellent and the big voice "Arthur's Theme", wow. Surely this was one of the best comedies of the 1980s. Big movies get better with every view and this is the case with "Arthur."
