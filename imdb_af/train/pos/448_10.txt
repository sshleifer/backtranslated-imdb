I think this movie is absolutely beautiful. And I'm not just referring to the breathtaking scenery. It's about two unhappy English housewives who decide to rent an Italian castle to take a break from their not so happy home life. Eventually four women join the place, all with different personalities and different reasons to be there. In this wonderfully beautiful place they all find the peace they desire, and interesting that peace comes from inner reflections and decisions, more than just outside. I also find it wonderful because of the relationships developed from friendliness and understanding. The acting is a joy to look at itself. I especially love the characters of Lottie (Josie Lawrence) and Lady Caroline (Polly Walker).
