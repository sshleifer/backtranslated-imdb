Men of honor have many great aspects to it. Good action ranges, lots of "good feel" scenes, a good musical score, but the part that really makes the movie is the big play. Mostly by Robert Deniro. The story of Mans of Honor is focused on Carl Brashear played by Cuba Gooding Jr., who wants to be the first African American deep sea diver in the fleet. It chronicles his rough struggle to be an arm farmer to come to the dive school and even further. It's a good story, but it seems to have been done many times before. A person, at all odds, will not give up until they reach their goals that they have set for sentimental reasons for years. This may happen, but much of the Brashear faces in the movie are being questioned, including the C.O. from the diving school with his final test toddler. But it's all on the scene when Robert Deniro finally enters the movie. Deniro plays Mater Main Sunday, who is the teacher at the dive school. Brashear is attending. Once Deniro comes in, he leaves this vibe of extreme arrogance that you can't hate unless you have incredible willpower. Before the movie ends, Deniro gives several speeches that will make you laugh about how cool he is, but you are too amazed at the way he exhausts them. Ultimately, you have to doubt some of the aspects of the movie, but acknowledge it. If it were the truth, you would have slept your seat for the first twenty minutes.
