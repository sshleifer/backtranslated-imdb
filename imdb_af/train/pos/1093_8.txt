I always enjoy this movie when it appears on TV. <br /> <br /> The one scene that always stands out for me is the one with the Myrna Loy and the painter foreman, where she gives him a lot. express instructions on the colors and as soon as she gets away, he turns his guys and says, "Did you get it, it's yellow, blue, green and white"
