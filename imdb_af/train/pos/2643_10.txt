I really can't say too much about the plot of the movie that hasn't been said yet. I haven't seen the movie in about 25 years and its memory never left me. I've been looking for that. I just did searches in the past, but got empty. Last night I think of the movie again and try to remember who was in it, but I was just about 10 or 12 when I last saw it and I wasn't even sure if I had the right movie, so I decided to do Another search and I finally found this face. I was right. If someone knows where I can get a copy of this wonderful movie to share with my family, please let me know at tawnyteel@yahoo.com. And for anyone who hasn't seen this movie and has the chance to enjoy it, it's worth it.
