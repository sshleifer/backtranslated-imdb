I think this show is screaming funny! It's not for every taste, and I'm not going to raise or deny the people who don't get it. I'm sure they're wonderful bright people working on a different wavelength. But if you like it, you really feel it. Sarah plays a self-releasing loser called "Sarah Silverman" who often finds herself in Homeric preachers (this is Homeries as in Homeric Simpsonies.) I remember Sarah Silverman from her short act. Saturday night Live in the early 90's. I immediately liked her, and I'm going out of my way to do something she did. <br /> <br /> This show is funny on your chicks and food and wet pants. Therefore, I always hold fast before I see it and wear adult diapers. Look at it!
