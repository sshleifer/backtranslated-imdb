William (Nicholas Ball) and Emma Peters (Rachel Davies) buy an old house where a brutal murder happened in very bad circumstances years ago to restore it. They move with their daughter Sophie (Emma RidleY) and become friends of their neighbors Jean (Patricia Maynard) and George Evans (Brian Croucher). However, ominous events happen in the house, including Sophie's cat death. In Sophie's birthday party, a pipe licks blood, and they leave the place and reveal a secret later. <br /> <br /> "The house that was brought to death" is a frightening and one of the best episodes of the "Hammer House of Horror" series. The fantastic twist, the disclosure of a secret, and the tragic conclusion is really excellent. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Casa Que Sangrou At√© Morrer" ("The House That Bled To The Death")
