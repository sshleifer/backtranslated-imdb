When I sat down to watch 'Largo Winch', I didn't expect anything more than action scenes and fascinating cars. When I got up, I saw both of them; and more. <br /> <br /> Finally, Karl Roden was not the antagonist in a movie to start with. Kristin Scott Thomas played her role well, but the real two stars in my opinion were Tomer Sisley and Miki Manojlovic, both of whom performed excellently. In Radivoje Bukvic, Goran portrayed well. <br /> <br /> Mixed linguistics has created a good color for the movie, but I understand why people would be bored of it. <br /> <br /> The landscape of Hong Kong and especially the beautiful Croatian sea both surprised me and I didn't want to take my eyes off the screen when Largo entered the incredibly beautiful island. <br /> <br /> Rolls Royce Phantom; Mercedes S500, and BMW 7; if someone likes expensive limousine cars; this is their movie. It is also a movie for people who love action sequences, good acting, extreme beauty landscapes, and above all a quick, well-written action movie, with a brilliant battle and a thoroughly twisted inner drama. <br /> <br /> My voice, as it lightened a gloomy day, is: 10/10
