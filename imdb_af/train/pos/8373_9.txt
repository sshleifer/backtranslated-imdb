Note to previous reviewer: This movie is "science-fiction adaptation of the Iliad" according to the scriptwriter. So whether the references are painful or not, no excuses, it's the basis for the movie. They admit that they have stolen ... although modified, the P.C. term. <br /> <br /> Big movie too short. Probably it didn't come out, as well as the author, director or studio wanted, but nice damn fun. The fact that the studio itself implied during the making only helps with his legacy. <br /> <br /> A big budget remake won't be so nice and will probably no longer do the script. But it's nice to dream about the potential there. A DVD edition with a few cool extras is apparently available, but I don't think it will play on NTSC players. I'm not an expert and still try to make it up. For now I live with the VHS incarnation.
