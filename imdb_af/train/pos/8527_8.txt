Let me just come here. I have 3 children, 5 to 10 years old. I see a trip to theater a success if there are no talking animals. I saw most of the children's videos in our collection at least 72 times. I can tell you when the movie is reversed in The Wizard of Oz, the 18-year-old sexual joke in El Dorado and the tragic mistake at the end of Rudolph's Red-Nosed Reindeer. I can probably tell Nemo about the memory alone. <br /> <br /> What makes me support one child (it varies) that represents this title for the family movie of an evening? In a word: Showerman. <br /> <br /> Time of silence ... <br /> <br /> * Suck *
