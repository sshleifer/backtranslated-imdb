Well, to start with, it was actually the most elegant Clausen movie to this date. <br /> <br /> The man always has a feel for characters with a bit of humor for them, but I think he adds a dimension unprecedented to anything he made in this movie. His work is - in very black white words - accepted by the broad but not the critical audience and we always have his sense of humor and his ability to mix it with human problems, and a clear way to entertain the audience , appreciate it. know what to say. <br /> <br /> However, for the first time in Villa Paranoia, he surprises with invisible wisdom and respect for the minorities. Not only the ethnic but also the common people you tend to forget. Set in Jutland - in the country - it's about the eternal issue of lack of love, but in a now and sometimes cruel way that shows you and keeps you focused. And besides, he manages himself ab ****** d! A real b ***** d, who wants the right thing, but has no idea how to get there, and so people are suffering. Bitter. <br /> <br /> I have to say this is one of the best movies I've seen this year and I expect its next.
