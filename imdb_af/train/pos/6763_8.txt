Elegance and class are not always the first words to bear in mind when people (at least people who can do such things) sit and talk about film noir. <br /> <br /> Some of the best films of the genre, "Out of the Past," "The Killers," "In A Lonely Place," "Night and the City," run a level of sophisticated sophistication This elevates them beyond a gentle enthusiasm and its connotations of precocious shadows, fedoras and femme-fatal. <br /> <br /> "Where the pavement ends, a fairly difficult movie to find - the only copy in perhaps the best-filled video store in Manhattan was a rough bootleg of the AMC cable channel - belongs to a category With these classical artists. <br /> <br /> From the moment the black cloud passes through openings, a curtain draws a crook resident, Marc Dixon's crumbling world, and as the moments pass it gets closer, threatening choking. <br /> <br /> Sure, he is the well-known "dark-haired cop", but Dana Andrews gives Dixon a spicy stare and upset intensity that makes you as uncomfortable as he looks. , he is too long to smuggle suspects, and the newly promoted chief (Karl Malden, in a typically robust and instructive outing) warns him "for the last time." <br /> <br /> But Dixon hates this thugs too much to stop now And the boy did not have them, it came? <br /> <br /> "Hoods, dusters , mugs, nickel rat ". He spits out when that tough nut of a boss rolls out and rolls out all the complaints the desk received about Dixon's right hook. The advice is for him to cool down for his own good. But instead he takes matters into his own hands. <br /> <br /> And what a world of trouble he finds when he relies on his instincts, and falls back on a nature that may or may not have passed a generation before. <br /> <br /> Immediately he is deep with the police, the syndicate, his own mate. Dixon's dubious involvement in a murder investigation threatens his job, wondering if he is simply as a base than the one he swore to bring. Like Bogart in a lonely place, can he "escape what he is?" /> <br /> If he does not turn anywhere else, he discovers that he has virtually condemned his unexpected relationship with a seraphic beauty (the wonderful Gene Tierney), which seems to be his rude bachelor's existence in something worthy of to come home. <br /> <br /> The pacing of this beautiful film is stiff and gripping. The group of writers who contributed to the production polished the disc to a high gloss - the dialogue is funny without falling into dated parody feeding, passionate without becoming melodramatic or juicy. <br /> <br /> And all this top-notch direction and acting is not too smooth or crammed to leave the film's emotional hold. Gene Tierney's angelic, soft-focus beauty is used for great effect. She shows herself as an actress of considerable size, and her soft, natural nature is so limitless here as her psychosis in "Let her go to Heaven." The scenes between Tierney and Andrews's Dixon are growing more intense and are approaching what he seems to be self-destructive. <br /> <br /> At the end of his rope, Dixon cuts, bruises and exhausts his fate: "Innocent people can also get into terrible jam," he says. A false move and you're over your head. " <br /> <br /> Perhaps what makes the movie so compelling is the feeling that things can go wrong for almost anything - especially for someone who is so hard to do right - with a slight shift in the wind, one wrong decision or punch, or, very scary, due to factors you didn't control. Noir always reflected the darkest fears, they brought to the surface. "Where the pavement ends" does it in a realistic way. <br /> <br /> (One nit choice from one side: This other sterling movie has a shiny bad dub of a blonde model that doesn't come out of Mystery Science Theater.) How very strange. /> <br /> But Noir fans - heck, ANY movie fans - who haven't seen this one, are in for a tremendous surprise.
