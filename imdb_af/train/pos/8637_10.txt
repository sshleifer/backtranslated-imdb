"California" is a good movie we let ourselves see. The movie has a good role, Brad Pitt (Johnny Suede, a River Run There And The Legends Of The Fall), such as Early Greyce, David Duchovny (The X Files) such as Brian Kessler, Michelle Forbes (Star Trek: The Following generation, murder: street life and escape from LA) such as Carrie Loughlin, Brian's girlfriend, and Juliette Lewis (Natural Born Killers, Cape Fear, and What Eat Gilbert Grape) as Adele Corners, Early Girl. <br /> <br /> Brian Kessler is a liberal writer ready to write a book about serial killers. Brian and his girlfriend, Carrie, decide they want to move to California. So Brian puts an ad at college for some who want to go to California to share expenses on the trip. <br /> <br /> Early Grayce is a former and sociopath on parole, who recently lost his job at the town's mirror factory in debt, owes his owner's money. Each one's parole officer stops visiting him and tells him about a job. Usually go to the spot empty and see the ad, he later tells his girlfriend Adele to go to California. First and Adele met Brian and Carrie at the bus stop and left town. Brian and Carrie don't know he's a murderer who just killed his death. lessor. For a while, Brian and Carrie thought of early and Adele different, but they got them and became friends. Carrie and Adele become real good friends. <br /> <br /> Their journey is a very teachable one. Although Brain and Carrie do not know early, a killer is still in the film until later. The question Brian asked in this film about the difference between murderers and us is a very good question. First Grayce is a sociopat who does not fault his roads later and pays the price. <br /> <br /> This movie is a good movie, I give it 10/10 stars and 2 inches up. I love the songs in the movie, especially at the end of the movie, the song "Look Up To The Sky" by the Indians.
