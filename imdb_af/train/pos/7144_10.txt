I saw the movie Holes and said it should be the best movie all year long. It brings out the child in everyone. I mean who would have the idea that difficult boys were digging themselves for their punishment? Louis Sachar was. Although the film differs from the book, it was still very good. For example, Caveman / Stanley was the biggest one there. Weight wise and sensible, but ZigZag / Ricky was longer and Armpit / Theodore was bigger. X-Ray / Rex was also one of the smallest boys, but was not. The only thing I didn't like about the movie was that the flashbacks were quite persuasive and long. I'd rather have seen the present rather than past, but it's just my opinion. I especially like the work of the boys. Like Squid / Alan played by Jake M. Smith was supposed to be a naughty and tough child. Jake M.Smith did the same and did a good job with it, just like almost all the actors in Holes. So I would say if you haven't seen Holes yet, you should definitely see it when it comes out again or you'll miss out on a lot of fun.
