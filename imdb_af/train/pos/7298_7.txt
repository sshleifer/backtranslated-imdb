It's about a crazy scientist who creates half a shark - half a man working on an unknown island. He then calls on all his old business and academic friends to see his creation (evil laughter), but he actually wants to kill his sharkman. ! Lots of bad GCI, goofy plot elements, and babies follow in tight T-shirts. <br /> <br /> These monster movies all follow a similar formula, but these one spice stuff with a little humor (I guarantee the people who made it, planted tongues firmly into the cheek), not the ones to name sexy babes. But let's call the sexy babes - many hot babies, in tight T-shirts, very heavy. One is in her bottom at the beginning, another at the end. Thanks, thank you, makers of bad movies! The plot is full of goofy things, a man drives in a jeep, hits it right in a tree and then offers to fly all of the island into a helicopter. Yes, okay, how about that in a while? we come back to you. The sharkman is hilarious - either awful CGI or an equally comical guy in a rubber suit. The mad scientist gives a good performance; He's angry, that's his motivation, he's not making excuses. <br /> <br /> Overall, if you want a stupid, fine B movie, this one has to do the job.
