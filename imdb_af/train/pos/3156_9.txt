Like the characters in this show, I was also a teenager during the 70's. The producers really left the whole zeitgeus to be a suburban teenager in the 70s. The 70's fashions, cars, home furniture, food and feasts are all very authentic in this show. <br /> <br /> The show boasts a very talented ensemble throw that all work well on the camera. I really like the unique, psychedelic-style film series. No other show does camera tricks like this. These leading film series really help to convey the hips, which have characterized the 70's. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a very funny sitcom. The one thing that bothered me about this show was that it was too much dependent on cruel humor, to generate laughter. This way I think this show is too much like Married To Children. While Married to Children is a good sitcom in its own right, it's tough showing the creators of the 70's, trying to imitate it. <br /> <br /> I recommend that 70s show, mainly due to the nostalgia factor. It can even be a better performance if the authors rely more on a witty dialogue, rather than bawdy, tasteless jokes and pranks.
