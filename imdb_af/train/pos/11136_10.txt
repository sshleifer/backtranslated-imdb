"Midnight Cowboy" is one of those movies that was preached for good reason. It's actually one of the best movies ever made in America. It is both artistically valid and yet completely accessible and commercial. No wonder this was a great success initially. But be warned, it's also one of the most heartbreaking movies ever made. The characters are memorable, well developed, and ultimately tragic. The filmmakers have to be applauded for not giving the Hollywood end, something that was actually mandatory in the 80s. Yet, for the years 1967 to 1977, I estimate American film. It's a time when well-made, innovative and mostly dark films can be made with the huge budgets Hollywood can offer. All this was over by the time Star Wars was released. <br /> <br /> The direction of John Schlesinger makes the material work. It combines a simplistic style with some experimental editing. Unlike many other movies with these psychedelic effects, "Midnight Cowboy" has become very well-aged. It is still as powerful as it was when it was initially released. However, the acting is what makes it a masterpiece. The background of the characters is never fully explained, but the performances are fully developed. Both Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman are absolutely memorable and sympathetic (despite their sometimes reprehensible actions). Plus, I was a fan of vintage exploitation movies, I loved the scenes set on particularly sleazy 42nd street. "Midnight Cowboy" is close to perfect and one of the most powerful films ever made.
