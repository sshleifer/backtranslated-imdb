I'm not quite sure whether the term "serious comedy" applies to this movie, I don't even know if it can be applied. For the past few years, movie theaters have been filled with comedy films that are too stupid to make us even smile. That's why I considered the movies that didn't fill these requirements as "serious comedies". <br /> <br /> Is this 40-year-old virgin fit in this guild? This is ultimately for you, but in my opinion it is a very funny movie. You have to laugh a lot, plus it delivers a social commentary through a few many characters and situations. <br /> <br /> I'm pretty there is more than one 40-year-old virgin out there, and even the people who don't fit these specifications may be identified by one of the characters in the movie, especially men . <br /> <br /> The story, as the title says, is about Andy, a shy, quiet man, who collects action figures, looks at Survivor with his kind neighbors and whose favorite band is Asia. <br /> <br /> Kal is Andy's co-worker at SmartTech. He believes Andy to be a psychopath until Andy's secret is revealed. Kal is clearly a sexual pervert, but he apparently gets what he wants with the opposite genre. <br /> <br /> David is the passionate man still in love with his ex-girlfriend, who ran away with another guy. And Jay, a man in a relationship that is apparently affected by his constant deception and becomes imprisoned. <br /> <br /> I'm pretty sure most young people from 13 to 21 have already watched this movie, but it's really not an age limit to enjoy it. So if you haven't seen it, you'll laugh a bit, with social commentaries, than going to your video store and getting rid of those deep and depressing independent movies. <br /> <br /> It also includes DVD bonuses that you will really see from top to bottom.
