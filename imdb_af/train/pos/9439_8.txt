Before I watched this movie, I heard a lot about it and some scenes in the movie, but didn't listen to me, so I planned to watch it and wow! Ned Beatty, Ronny Cox, Jon Voight and Burt Reynolds make for an interesting group of individuals who are bent on diving on the Cahulawassee River and the unfortunate series of events that occur on them all. The character development takes time to embrace the viewer with a better understanding of each person, but eventually you know these guys as they were your friend. Acting dialogue is very real, as close to reality as you can for Hollywood. Reynolds' character "Lewis" was interesting as a man who is very hard to come by, but under the male veneer he lies a very soft and broken man (I was impressed with his performance!) Jon Voight is the character on the spotlight. Most are, The unfortunate circumstances that seem to him at every corner really shape and throw him into another man. (His character crossing was excellent). Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox really look like the stupid lunkheads just joking and not looking too serious unless they have, and they have ... I was really surprised by director Boorman's vision of Dickey's novel , very impressed. You can't go all your life without watching this movie. I give it eight out of ten stars, very impressed.
