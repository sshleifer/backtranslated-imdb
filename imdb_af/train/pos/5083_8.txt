In the hands of smaller actors such as Claudette Colbert and Robert Ryan, this movie can be stupid. But with these two experienced thespians who led the way, I found "Silent Fury" to be an exciting and enjoyable little secret. When their wedding is interrupted by a stranger who claims that Colbert is already married and that he was the best man at the wedding, one can feel that there is some kind of plot against her at work. As Colbert, Ryan, and her lawyer claimed the strangers' claim to a previous marriage, they were met again in turn by more evidence that apparently strengthened the claim that she was indeed already bet. Although it is not very difficult to figure out just who the most important "bathing" is, it is still a lot of fun as the intensity and speed of the story increases. All in all, a good, solid mystery film with good performances by the two leading actors and a fine supporting role that includes the often underrated Paul Kelly.
