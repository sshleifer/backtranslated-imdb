I remember remembering this movie on Saturday afternoon TV in the 1950s or 60s. It was well-presented, but I remember there was a message of hope emitted from transmitters secreted in lamposts in one of the last manic drains for impending liberation. I'm not sure squares with the facts. <br /> <br /> However, the movie was well done. The German high commando reports cruelly without emotion. "The Russians are progressing the Fredrich Strasse" as if everything was planned. <br /> <br /> It was my impression that this film and a later American for TV beat were based on the British historian Trevor-Roper's account by a similar title Last Days of Hitler. I was surprised to find Trevor-Roper no credit. <br /> <br /> I agree with the latest German movie on the subject. DOWNFALL was just as good as the classic. The American knock was a little flat. <br /> <br /> Few figures attracted so much attention from the theater as Adolph. Yet I find it interesting that none of the many films and books that came out ever speak of Hitler's double reference in the passing of John Toland's wonderful historical piece. <br /> <br /> Was gibs?
