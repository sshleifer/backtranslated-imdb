My family and I have been viewing this movie over the years. It is clean, healthy, heartbreaking and heartwarming. Show us the compassion between two families of two countries, thousands of kilometers apart and at the most unpleasant of coincidences, it is almost as if the hand of God had to intervene. <br /> <br /> 5 Jo Jelle Micah Ferland who plays Desi the sad girl, has a wonderful job of doing her part, and to me she was the Priam star. <br /> <br /> All in all, a 10 out of 10. There are no downsides to this lovely human story. Children of all ages will be slow, then it will be joyful and it will bring the viewer family with smiles and good feelings.
