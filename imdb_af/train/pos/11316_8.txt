I did not read the James M. Cain novel (The Postman Always Rings Twice) on which this movie is based. So I can't compare this movie version, but I saw and loved the 1946 American version. (also titled 'Postman'). <br /> <br /> Even better, this jewel from Italy, which I have read, was "mutilated" in editing because of too many blatant references to the fascist regime. Well, no matter ?? What remains is a fine piece of cinema, apparently the forerunner of the neo-realistic motion in movies. One can surely see why? In spite of how difficult editing has been, remains a constant sense of social and cultural as well as personal oppression, depends heavily on key players, thus facing many limits in life. <br /> <br /> Consider Gino, the young drifter, not well-educated, unemployed, and turning to hide, steal, and lure to come by, one pair of shoes as thin as practically useless be. <br /> <br /> In Giovanna he sees a way out, but he had to keep going, as Giovanna was suppressed by her loveless marriage to an elderly man with a little money (working at the trattoria for her man, moving behind the bar and in the kitchen) her sex. In the past she had limited options and decided to marry owner / gas station owner (Giuseppe Bregana, played by Juan de Landa) knowing he would not make her happy. She tells Gino that she feels sick every time Bregana touches her. <br /> <br /> For the sake of helping Bregana, he makes his car and sends him to the village to buy a needed part (which he actually caught), Gino wins Bregana's favor (also promises to repair the broken water pump, water that symbolizes life or lack thereof and is left alone with Giovanna. They immediately start a warm, passionate, but fleeting love affair. <br /> <br /> Gino soon feels disturbed, and feels the need to get back on when Giovanna suggests they have her husband. Gino does not leave the town on a train ride he cannot afford, kindly pay for him by another gypsy-type man named Spagnolo, a co-train passenger. For Gino, Spagnolo represents a kind of freedom, and they become friends (Spagnolo also symbolizes Gino's morality and conscience), along with work on a carnival. Eventually, Gino did a steady job. To his horror (he is not yet about his love for Giovanna), Bregana and his wife went to the carnival and Bregana persuaded Gino to go back home to work again, as he was helpful. to have. <br /> <br /> Too willing to resist, and knowing that he and Giovanna will reunite. Gino agrees and goes back to stay with the couple. After a while he gave Gina's claims to get rid of her husband. Once the evil act has been done, Giovanna becomes more cold-blooded than ever, and apparently has a lot of conscience, while guilt and shame go away at Gino's for the hurt of a man who has never hurt him. As much as he wants to leave her? He briefly does, they are now inextricably linked and must face the consequences. <br /> <br /> I like the way the Spagnolo character returned to Gino's life to act as a judge of his iniquities ?? It was very good and interesting, adding a different dimension to the story. <br /> <br /> While the '46 US version with Lana Turner and John Garfield gets lost in a peripheral character safe, especially the policemen and The Attorneys, Ossessione, does well to concentrate more on the psychological effects of the crime on the lovers alone. This gives the final outcome even more potential and makes a powerful statement that strengthens the helplessness inherent in the society in which the characters must live. <br /> <br /> A slight obscurity: The amount of time (almost any) that elapses Before ominous love is spoken by the lovers, how quickly they kill the man (there is no first attempt as in the US version ); Gino's very fast-to-escalate relationship with the dancer / hooker ?? they confess their love so well and she is willing to take a lot of risk for a man she just met! ?? all rather unrealistic, isn't it? Did I distract this time frame problem very much? It made me think I missed something somewhere. Otherwise, the viewer's time is worth it. The acting and direction were both equally good. Recommended.
