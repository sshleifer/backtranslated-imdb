This is a very interesting movie. It's a comedy-action action movie. Foxx teams with comedian Epps in this movie to give it a comical twist. This will wonder what will happen to Foxx next. It was a well-shot film, the director uses the right colors in this movie (dark blue colors) to give it the right kind of feeling. Kimberly Elise also played in this movie and it is always a pleasure to see her on the big screen. She plays her role well. Even Jamie Kennedy is in this movie. It's worth seeing. You didn't see it. It's definitely worth having if you're a Jamie Foxx fan. It earns more credit than it actually is given.
