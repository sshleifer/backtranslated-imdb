Blackadder 3 is probably the Blackadder series that people have least heard about. It basically has the same principles as the second and fourth and has nothing revolutionary in it. But it's still big - a fiery Duke of Wellington and a fat fool Dr Johnson (author of the first dictionary in England) make this series one to be reckoned with. There are even more hilarious one-liners delivered in this series, bringing out the humor in a lesser-known era - in historically accurate and enjoyable episodes. Blackadder's third outing is not the best-known and best-known of the lot, but Rowan Atkinson's role as a butler for a stupid prince is a funny and effective one, and Hugh Laurie is at its best in this series. Very good! 9/10
