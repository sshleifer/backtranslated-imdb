All I can say is, if you do not fall in love with Big and Little Edie after watching this movie, then you are not human! Even after I first watched it, I was addicted. It's a fascinating experience that's hard to describe, as I'm sure other fans will testify. After watching, you will cry to think that these two wonderful ladies are no longer with us. At least we have Gray Gardens to remember them! I think we all want to possess the heavy independence of these two ladies. Although I always admired Jackie Onassis Kennedy, she didn't stay in your heart like Big and Little Edie. What a strange treasure to know such people; I just wish I had!
