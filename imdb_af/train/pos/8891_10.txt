I can agree with other comments that there is not a huge amount of history discussed in the movie, but it was not a documentary! It was meant to be entertaining and I think it did a very good job. <br /> <br /> I agree with the black family. The screens with them looked out of place. Suddenly it would be thrown, but I later attacked the story and the relationship between the families and found it to be pretty good. <br /> <br /> Despite this, it was not a re-enactment of the 60's, it revealed very large and important landmark periods of the decade. I found it very entertaining and worth watching.
