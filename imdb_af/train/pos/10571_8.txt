James Cagney is best known for his hard-hitting character and gangster roles, but he also played a number of soft characters in his career. These musicals are one of them and it was the first but not the last music movie Cagney would die. <br /> <br /> Cagney even does a little singing in this one and also quite a lot of dancing. And it must be said that he was not bad. He plays the role with a lot of confidence. He apparently had a few dance years in his early life before starting to play big time. In fact, it's not a strange thing that he also played a musical role in his career. Of course, he also feels comfortable in this completely different genre than most people are used to seeing him. <br /> <br /> The film is directed by Lloyd Bacon, who was possibly among the best and most successful director in the genre. . His earliest '30s musicals defined the musical genre exactly and was also responsible for genre films such as' 42nd Street'. His musical was always light and fun to watch and more comedy than anything else really. '30s musicals were never really about his singing, it was something that appeared more in the 40's and later made musical, mainly from the MGM studios. <br /> <br /> As usual, it has a light and simple story set in the musical world, it is of course predictable and progressing in a formal way. It is, however, a fun and simple story that just makes it an entertaining movie to watch. So do the characters and actors they portray. However, it is strange that the overall plot line of the movie is abandoned similar to the end of the movie, when the movie first consists of musical number routines. <br /> <br /> The musical moments after the end of the movie are also amusing and well done, although I'm not too big a fan of the genre itself. Again, the musical numbers also have a young Billy Barty. He also played little ones / babies / mice once earlier this year, and earlier in his career, including the movie "Gold Diggers of 1933". <br /> <br /> A recommended early genre movie. <br /> <br /> 8/10
