I was so impressed with Doug McGrath's movie version of the Jane Austen novel "Emma," and I loved Rachel Portman's music score so much that when I went to the video store one day, she discovered two reunited for "Nicholas Nickleby" I immediately hired it without any other consideration. <br /> <br /> I read the book, and for those who are critical fans of this Jane Austen adaptation, I don't know what McGrath could do anymore. To capture the spirit and most important elements of Miss Austen's work more perfectly, especially considering the limitations of a two-hour movie (some complaining to be too long!). And as far as Gwen Paltrow's emphasis is concerned, I must confess that I was not too familiar with her when I first saw it at the theater and I was convinced at that time that she was an English actress! <br /> <br /> I'm amazed at those who criticized the movie for its sumptuous scenery. This is one of the things I enjoy and look forward to seeing in periods that occur in English countryside. The movie's beautiful backgrounds are a major contributor to its appeal and success. If your idea of ​​an escapist rate is a little more bleak then you might need something like "Death Wish III!" Rent. <br /> <br /> The English country settings are as attractive and beautiful as the role-playing game, combining with the story and soundtrack for entertainment that doesn't let you repeat. McGrath is a wonder to choreograph the interaction of subtle expressions that is so essential to convey the intricate romantic plot that takes place in this story. <br /> <br /> This refreshing movie can also be a clinic on how enjoyable a movie can be. little sex, violence or even a shameful antagonist. The story is often amusing, engaging, and sometimes, very enjoyable. <br /> <br /> I have seen many capable Jane Austen book adaptations, but this is without a doubt my favorite.
