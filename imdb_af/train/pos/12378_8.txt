In the hands of a more skilled director, this film would be considered a horror masterpiece. Despite Michael Wins's random sense of direction, the movie is interesting, original and more than a little scary. <br /> <br /> The writing falls more than one horror clich√© from its back (several can't shake it) including Chris Sarandon as the heroine's boyfriend who actually listens to her because she insists ominous things go down. Burgess Meredith is beautiful as the lovingly insane neighbor. Eva Gardner is haunting with a young Beverly D'Angelo as her dumb and disturbed lesbian lover. John Carradine does a gate-of-work sitting in a chair. And watch out for a short comedy of an unknown Chris Walken! This movie is creepy and creative. The plot turns are nice, as a tick predictable. The climax, which I will not give, is disturbing and impressive. Again, a better director may have done more with it, but it is quite satisfactory - at least to those with the sensibility of the seventies abomination. <br /> <br /> If you like modern overcrowding torture fantasy, you've won. There is almost no gore. The direction is rather spartan. The effects are low, although there is a beautiful make-up near the end - most of which are not make-up ... but maybe I said too much. <br /> <br /> I just rated it a bit higher than its quality justified, but I enjoyed it as much as any "8" movie I saw.
