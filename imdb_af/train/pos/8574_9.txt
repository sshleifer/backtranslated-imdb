This film works on many levels. Great fun for both adults and children. There is everything from car accidents and cakes to face some good (but subtle) adult jokes. <br /> <br /> Glenn Close is at her sublime evil best as Cruella (`call me Ella ') De Ville. <br /> <br /> After three years in Dr. Pavlov's Behavioral Change Clinic is healed of her desire for fur ?? even the puppy fur she wanted so intensely. She even placed all her fur coats in the dungeon of the extraordinary castle she occupied. <br /> <br /> But it wouldn't be a Dalmatian movie without the subterfuge and machinations of Cruella and you know that something will change her behavioral change. And now she needs one more puppy (thus 102 Dalmatians) to complete her shameful scheme this time. <br /> <br /> Immediately, Ioan Gruffudd is the hero of the movie running the Second Chance Dog Shelter. Although he was in "Titanic" and in last year's television version (as Pip) of "Great Expectations", I didn't recognize him; Well, he was ?? Fifth Officer Lowe 'in `Titanic' and I did not see` `Great expectations '', so I am not terribly surprised. <br /> <br /> Gerard Depardieu makes a beautiful twist as Cruella's furrier pawn. He performs and attitudes in the most outlandish and disgraceful fashion that you have ever seen ?? and do it well. His 'Wicked Hitch of the West' a tribute is hilarious. <br /> <br /> Tim McInnerny is wonderful, is Cruella's not-so-angry man? He was too? Alonzo, 'Cruella's butler, in' 101 Dalmatians' and you also recognize him from all the Black Adder-Brit-Coms. He plays his usual bumbling, kind-hearted, somewhat dull character to great effect. <br /> <br /> Oscars for costumes are generally given for full costumes in a movie. It is a pity if the clothes worn by Glenn Close are wonderful ?? It is incredibly detailed (note her handcuffs when released from the Behavioral Change Clinic) and worthy of such an overarching character. Her clothes alone earn at least an Oscar nomination. <br /> <br /> Animation holds a special place in my heart ?? but comparing this movie to the original animation film is to compare apples to orangutans: it can't be done. Suffice it to say that "102 Dalmatians" are even better than the movie version of 101 Dalmatians who came out in 1996. There is a lot to do here: from the eyeglasses, the dialogue and the costumes to the decisive - This is a great movie for the whole family.
