"The Ladies" is experiencing a common problem among movies based on Saturday Night Live sketches. And it's a sketch that usually passes in five minutes, won't do so well in ninety minutes. Although this movie, like Tim Meadows as Leon Phelps, a sex maniac straight from the 70s, and Will Ferrell as a wrestling obsession man, stolen by Leon, she laughed. So this movie is funny enough, but it's not 'Wayne's World'!
