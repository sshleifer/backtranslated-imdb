Here's one that will enjoy the whole family ... even those who consider themselves too old for fairy tales. Shelley Duvall surprised herself with this unique, imaginative approach to almost all the popular fairy tales of childhood. The scripts offer new twists on the age-old fables we grew up in and they have a handful of stars in each episode. "Cinderella" is no exception to Duvall's standard and it is, in my opinion, one of the top five of the series, highlighted by Jennifer Beals (remember her "Flashdance" - and she is still in Hollywood today and there a movie). the title role, Jean Stapleton as the fairy grandmother with a southern accent and Eva Arden as the embodiment of the wicked stepmother. Edie McClurg ("Ferris Bueller's Day Off") and Jane Alden make a hilarious duo as the step soldiers. Matthew Broderick is a good Prince Henry. You will all come back for this one!
