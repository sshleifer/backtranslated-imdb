I think Lion King 1 1/2 is one of the best successors ever as though it's not the best of the three Lion King movies! In the movie, Timon and Pumbaa tell us where they came from and problems with others fit in, like Timon struggling to dig tunnels with other Meercats! Timon and Pumbaa go out to find their dream spot and find it and find it fast and also Simba they arrive, but they have to choose between their dream spot or to help Simba to see his evil Uncle Scar and his right as the Lion King of Pride to proclaim. Rock! Filled with great new characters such as Timon's Ma (Julie Kavner) and Uncle Max (Jerry Stiller). I think my favorite character was Uncle Max because he was very funney and was spoken by a funney comedian Jerry Stiller, the father of Ben Stiller. Disney was smart to throw Stiller into that role! Filled with wonderful characters, animation and story and music Lion King 1 1/2 is, in my opinion, the best of any sequel and better than Simba's Pride, although I will admit that I really did that too! Lion King 1 1/2 is a great Disney sequel to enjoy the whole family! It has a good story and is very funney! 10 out of 10!
