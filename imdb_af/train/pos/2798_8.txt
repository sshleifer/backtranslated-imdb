Jess is 18, very clever and wants nothing more than playing football, when she joins a local team, she has to lie to her parents again and again. Because they will never approve of pursuing her dream, they want to settle with a nice Indian boy and learn how to cook. Bend it Like Beckham is a very funny, good movie that should not be deep and complex, it is just as good as it is. The role-play is all very good and they play their roles very well, the story is simple and predictable, but it works perfectly and the writing is very realistic and very funny. <br /> <br /> A great family movie 8/10
