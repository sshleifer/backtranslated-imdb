This animation has a very simple and straight good vs. evil plot and action. What sets it apart from other animations is how well human movements are animated. It was really nice to see the flightwoman running around on the screen from left to right, her movements were done so well. Why don't they use this rotoscopic technique more recently? It's quite effective. <br /> <br /> Fire and Ice, in the prehistoric environment and barely dressed women, were clearly devoted to the attractive girl in all sorts of sexy ways, with her excited body serving as a beautiful eyebrow. Some may hate it and regard it as another moronic male sexual fantasy; others (including many women) will worship its aesthetic quality. I certainly didn't mind! Bakshi likes to love lovely, mature children, as can be seen in Cool World, and I don't think he should get rid of it as it is almost adult animation. But I also enjoyed this animation as a child and I never forgot it. <br /> <br /> This one was just special, so different from the standard Disney or Anime rate, so it's only worth the watch since then. It may be Bakshi's best. For those who love slothful animations, try Space Adventure Cobra. <br /> <br /> I give Fire and Ice 8 out of 10.
