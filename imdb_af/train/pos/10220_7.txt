The hilarious line is typical of what these naughty sisters say. (It's funny on its own terms and also unknowingly funny.) Only two of the sisters are really bad. Son, are they too bad! One is given to sign in and excited comments to which she goes. The others stand up like Marilyn Monroe. She has those sensual, slightly divorced lips. And to give nothing away, she is even more bad than the other. <br /> <br /> All three sisters are played by stars. The man who stumbles into their lives is played by John Bromfield. He had something of a career. <br /> <br /> Today, it looks like the first mainstream softcore porno ever to be marketed. Well, of course not the first, but the most racial then. <br /> <br /> The girls wear as little as possible and let's not forget the female hearing aid: Bromfield is shaved with an electric razor - whose fetish was it? - bollard. He is also shown in a swimsuit as wet. <br /> <br /> There's also a real plot: The girls' family, see, is cursed. They are prone to suicide - or dramatic deaths that occur as suicide. <br /> <br /> The movie is not bad. I really don't know where it was shown. Maybe it's made for setbacks. Somehow, and I could be wrong, I felt that the typical male audience was not the primary goal here. The women are slim-dressed. They often look like police detectives or jackets of dime novels. However, the <br /> <br /> is the central focus. Not everyone in the movie likes him, but all the girls love him. And I think the audience is also meant. <br /> <br /> It's great fun - and also on its own terms.
