I haven't seen this movie in about 5 years, but it's still haunting me. <br /> <br /> When I was asked about my favorite movies, it was the one I always always wanted to mention. There are some movies (artworks such as this movie, "Dark City" and "Breaking the Waves") that seem to be a place within you, a place that is so protected and hidden and yet so sensitive that they make a lifetime impression . on the viewer, not in contrast to a life-changing event, such as ending a serious relationship or the death of a friend. This movie shook me when I first saw it. It left me with an emotional hangover that lasted for a few days.
