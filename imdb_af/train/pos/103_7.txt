When I read other comments, I decided to watch this movie ... <br /> <br /> First, Michael Madsen and Tamer Karadagli in particular; good enough ... <br /> <br /> Movie, lots of intelligence and interesting because it has many international special European actor and actress such as Turkey and Russia. <br /> <br /> Second, Story is basic and you can guess, but if you play interesting action well, you will, in my opinion, ... <br /> <br /> Third, Final chapter is not special or interestingly, it is often like other action movies. . <br /> <br /> Finally, I recommend watching this movie ... And I hope you'll love to enjoy it: D
