If this movie was made just a few years later, I would have beaten the score a point or two because the sound quality was pretty poor. Sometimes the movie was a silent movie during the intermediate scenes (normal ambient noises are missing). But, since it was 1931 and a French film, it is pretty forgiven. Especially since it also occurs in later French films - at which time the sound problems had to be completely worked out (as in L'Atalante from 1934). Good, apart from a few minor sound problems. , it's a cute picture about a missing winning lottery ticket and a long list of people trying to get it. And during the search, there are a lot of small songs that you can't help. A nice beautiful movie all-in-all.
