When you compare what Brian De Palma did in the 80's that go for entertainment today, his films stay better and better. "Dressed To Kill," Blow Out "," Body Double "," Scarface "and" Carlito's Way "are all the wonderful works of a filmmaker at the height of his powers. This is a pure Hitchcock with a fiery 80 perversion, a love story of lust and murder with many twists, great style help, a beautiful Pino Donaggio score and a trashy, allo-inspired plot. 's love for complex camera work and nice, blood-filled footage helps overcome the logical holes, while the awesome performances of Dennis Franz, Keith Gordon (a good director in his own right), Nancy Allen (De Palma's wife of the time) and Michael Caine every scene special, let the virtuoso take you on a surrealistic, scary, erotic charged odyssey and you'll enjoy every frame of "Dressed To Kill".
