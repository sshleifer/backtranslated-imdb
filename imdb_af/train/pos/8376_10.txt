One of the best movies out there. Yes, the movies were not the biggest, but an excellent plot and concept. Great for time and brilliant and creative ideas. Something different from the usual movies and lots of fun. One of my favorites and would recommend anyone who enjoys creative and imaginative movies. After World War 3 and fighting in giant robots, the actors delivered a good performance and made it all worthwhile. The sets are not wonderful but simple and worked for the overall look of the movie. This movie is very hard to find on DVD, but also on VHS. Check it out because I loved it since it came out. Not a mainstream and not what you've ever seen. Take a look and think like a child. It's a beautiful view and fun.
