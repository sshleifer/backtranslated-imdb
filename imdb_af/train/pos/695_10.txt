This movie pulls you in and gets you hooked to keep your eyes on the screen. The author / director is brilliant with the narratives and the use of creative and interesting camera angles and perspectives that will all add to the touch. Insomniac's Nightmare is original and refreshingly different from any other movie you've seen. Is it a dream or reality? In this indie you will discuss the coils and take it through the conscious and subconscious. It has an honest feel with it being dark interpretations of illusions. Dominic Monaghan has really become the insomniac. He is also a good actor who is also out of sight! He really threw his whole being into this role. From the storyline to the way it is shot, this is one of my favorites. I highly recommend it highly and to see more of this innovative, creative writer / director / filmographer !!!
