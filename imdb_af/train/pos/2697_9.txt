Nothing revolutionary here; GARDE A VUE is almost exclusively limited to a percussion station, and mostly to one interrogation room, but director Claude Miller (who made the wonderful film THIS SWEET SICKNESS among others) intercalates savings flights from outside tableaux as minimalist local scenography. Miller's self-restraint, especially early on, is breathtaking, making his beautiful handling of the resulting critical interior-mise-and-scene for engaging performance. <br /> <br /> Lino Ventura is excellent as usual, and manages to legalize a character It is on paper a clich√©: the laconic, stubborn, world-weary homicide detective. Ventura lives the role and makes it completely credible, though the scripture gives us little access to its inner workings; the movie ends at the moment it seems as if it will be forced to confront its failure for the first time. <br /> <br /> Michel Serrault is equal to the task of the alleged child killer who splashes sharply with the single-minded flic. The exchanges between the two are more-often-as-not-pregnant with tension and the aura of a constantly metamorphosing playing field for a battle of whites. Serrault's character is, by turns, deplorable haughty and cunning and spicy; then later .... <br /> <br /> The "message" of GARDE A VUE, if you wanted one, is a condemnation of police methodology and the kind of pressure a government authority makes if necessary. decisive matters at the expense of justice. For the most part, however, the film seems to be nothing more than an example of how to change a potentially sophisticated mainland scenario into an exciting drama of the biggest movie economy. <br /> <br />
