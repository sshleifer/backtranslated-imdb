I don't like "degree inflation", but I just had to give it a 10. I can't think of anything I didn't like about it. I saw and woke it up last night when I thought about it. I'm sure the Hollywood repetition that someone told me, with J Lo and Richard Gear, would be great, but this original Japanese version of 1996 was so emotional and tempting to me that I had a hard time thinking of thinking about any way it can be improved or its setting changed to a different culture. <br /> <br /> A story I had a hard time watching, with o fist fighting scenes or guns going down or something of the sort! Imagine! <br /> <br /> All the characters were well-developed, even non-primary characters had good character development and enjoyable acting, and the foundry was very suitable. <br /> <br /> It's always hard to find good movie music in our day and age, and maybe it doesn't really qualify (there is a lot to learn about how to dance, but no singing), but I really think Gene Kelly and others who have put a place for dance in our lives would have thought so much about this movie and the role of dance to help tell a story about a middle-aged man with a family in Japan, looking for something ... he doesn't know exactly what. <br /> <br /> Thanks to the team of people in Japan who contributed to this movie, thank you for making it and doing it.
