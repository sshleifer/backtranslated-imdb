Faith and Mortality ... watched by the lens of an elderly Ashkenazi Jewish-American gentleman and a younger African American Jewish gentleman who dared not conflict with each other and with honest conversations about how their lives unfold over the years has. <br /> <br /> Mostel's character is a partner with chronic back problems, and a terminal sick woman; Belafonte's character is a career obstacle that never happens on a regular basis, and a fatal car accident leaves him in a strange purgatory. He must convince Mostel to renew his faith, as it is not with his wife's health (and his own). But Belafonte's Levine has his own problems, still pain for the girl he left behind. <br /> <br /> Belafonte's character leaves the film before he seems to have to, and so the end is cryptic and the movie suffers a bit from its ambiguous end. <br /> <br /> It's not a 'typical' Hollywood movie about ethnic relations or about a person's crisis of faith. It's worth watching more than once and the great performances of the main actors.
