If you want to see a movie of different kinds, if you feel the Love in your heart, even if you miss the Lord, make this movie your mind. Although George is mentally disabled, you can finally see the ultimate intelligence, when love gives you directions, not the brain. I'm not emotional, but this movie makes you feel human. The movie is as good as Forrest Gump in my faith. The foreign films are sometimes more interesting, but there are not enough ads to make them popular. "Rang-e khoda" by Majid Majidi is another example of such foreign films, almost similar in taste.
