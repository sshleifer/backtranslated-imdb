This movie has problems in its presentation, can even offend people looking for temporal and cultural fidelity, but it challenges the viewer to think about a variety of issues. One of these is the nature and character of the relationship between Jesus and Judas. Another is the historical nature of the Bible and faith. And the third is the humanity of Jesus. The tension of the Christ-betrayer relationship is developed and held by the film. Judas's passion is presented as a darker parallel to that of Christ. When Judas takes his own life, the viewer can feel the fear. Peter's denial and guilt, however, are not portrayed as powerful as the Judas drama. Chris Sarandon presents a novel and challenging Christ, whether credible or not. I would like to find this movie on DVD or even VHS to use in study or discussion groups.
