This movie is a real gem. The plot of the plot is defined in the first 3 minutes, the characters are sympathetic and clearly drawn, their motives are completely credible. The dialogue is fresh and so so. The situations are unique to the characters and not cut or snapped at all. To the climax, that is. Then it's as if the movie was a bit off the track and it got a bit hokey and incredible. But I don't want to discourage people from watching this movie. The first three quarters of it is truly remarkable. I got it a 8. There are some remarkable performances here. Watch this movie.
