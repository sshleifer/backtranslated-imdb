I read one comment that marked this movie as a garbage and a waste of <br /> <br />. "I think this person got their political parts a little <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> I just rented the new Criterion DVDs from both Yellow and Blue. <br /> <br /> These films - though almost large - have become at least of <br /> <br /> historical interest in the so-called "radical student <br /> <br /> political-social movement" of the late '60s. br /> <br /> I have not seen a picture and of their notorious reputation, I <br /> <br /> expected to have real pornography (there is no.) There is frontal << / b> </ b> </ b> </ b> </ b> </ b> </ b> </ b>> <br /> In your face democratic socialist message. <br /> <br / > Although it tends to be simplistic, I thought it made its points good. <br /> <br /> It was good that both films were good and I laughed out loud <br /> <br /> Commentary made it clear. There was a lot of <br /> <br /> film in the movie. Especially the soup osedly "pornographic e "sex <br /> <br /> scenes. The first such scene is very realistic. The main pair is <br /> <br /> clumsy, inactive, funny and engaging in their first copulation scene. <br /> <br /> The second - which caused the most complaints - has <br /> <br /> Cunnilingus and fellatio. And the final is the end of a fierce battle, <br /> <br /> it's credible. <br /> <br /> The extras include an insightful introduction to the movie, an <br /> <br /> interview with the original US distributor and his lawyer, <br /> <br /> excerpts from trial evidence in the US and a "diary" comment <br /> <br /> by the director on some scenes. <br /> <br /> It is the movie that will not allow "blue nose" and it leads to the <br /> <br /> core interest that has no social value value. <br /> <br />, grateful, stand still. <br /> <br /> Those with an interest in the writings of history will see it a must <br /> <br /> see.
