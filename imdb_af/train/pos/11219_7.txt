/ * slight spoilers * / <br /> <br /> Go back, before Gospel is made, before Hideaki Anno was an idol and household name for many anime fans, and before Gainax reached the status of fan favorite, Gunbuster is made. With only Wings or Honneamise made by Gainax at that time, and the well-known Otakon shorts or shorts, Gunbuster had some difficult actions to follow. This has not made it easier by removing a genre that has already been opened already. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Gainax decided to postpone it as a six-part PAV (directly to video) series. This allows the range to have a larger size than would have been possible if it was made in a movie. It also prevents it being too boring and too long, with lots of sensible battles and stuffing along the way. In addition, they have made an effort to stay away from the opera mechanics used in Macross or Gundam, and many other popular space operators. <br /> <br /> For one, the performances are slightly light, with Noriko in the Okinawa High School High School. Noriko is the daughter of a respected ship commander who died in the battle when she was still a little kid. This makes her life at academia quite difficult, as some of her classmates are beginning to suspect that Noriko is being favored by the professors. The first episode is almost a comedy drama, with a very sharp focus on the characters and institution of the school. Things are changing rapidly when the threat of an alien invasion is announced, and Noriko and Kazumi (best class girl) are chosen to help out the joint fleet. <br /> <br /> The middle part of Gunbuster lets our female head into space, focusing on both personal drama and action. A few characters are being introduced, and parts of Noriko's past are being dragged back. In addition, the alien threat becomes more and more on hand every minute, and Gunbuster, man's last hope, is being offered. Clever as writer, Okada, he was, incorporating the principles of time elimination to give up slightly. In short, the time moves slower for those traveling at the speed of light. This means that Noriko can be part of a war that takes almost a century to complete. Also, the dramatic aspect of this is emphasized when Noriko sees her friends again on her return to the base, which has outdone much more than her. Science may not be perfect, but it is presented in a reasonably credible way, with even some SD science theater shorts among the episodes where Noriko, Kazumi and their coach give a brief description of the scientific principles in the series used. /> <br /> The animation, for a series in the 80's, is definitely good. The designs are, of course, retro styles, but it has charm. Animation is fluid enough and the character designs are fun, though the costumes betray <br /> <br /> some of the Gainax support service will later fully exploit. The mechas throughout the shows are also very cool, with the Gunbuster as the ultimate killer, powerful and big. The last episode was completely black and white. Although it is generally believed (but not confirmed) that it was done for budget reasons, it gives a whole different atmosphere to the series, which is perfectly suited to the last part. <br /> <br /> The music is very typical space opera fair. Too bombastic in places, very generic, and definitely not worth buying. It fits most of the range, but it can sometimes get worse. Tanaka is not really a well-known composer, and the only other respected series he has worked on is Dragon Half. If you think 80's anime music, you'll know what to expect. <br /> <br /> As the series progresses, the focus moves slowly from drama to space opera to epic battle, but so the viewer will hardly notice this. Step by step the drama is burnt down, and the battles will take the front row. No aspect is ever left out. With the last episode in sight, Noriko and crew are fighting for the human existence, and with the final battle in sight, some questions are presented to the audience regarding the position of the human race in the galaxy and how far It can be safeguarding self-preservation. While never being answered later, they still offer interesting food for thought. The last episode is very epic, with a nice but fairly predictable ending, although not all endpoints should of course contain many foreign twists. Again it fits the range. <br /> <br /> Gunbuster may sound like your average space-opera anime, with alien invaders, huge battles and some personal drama, and for the most part it is. But it's extremely good for a change. Instead of a steady mix of former elements, six episodes long, Gunbuster offers us a change from small-scale drama to large-scale epic heroism. Along the way we meet with some interesting and well-filled characters, which mutual relationships are changing due to the time-widening phenomenon. The show is written very tight, although it is prone to some points. Too many dramatic events and too cheesy mecha attacks could have been easily avoided. Overall, the journey taken by Gunbuster is a very relaxed, sometimes sad, sometimes heroic one. It may not have broken the boundaries and boundaries of the space-opera genre, but at least they bend a bit. Very pleasant anime classic, but not without errors. <br /> <br /> *** / *****
