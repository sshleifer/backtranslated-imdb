<br /> <br /> Coming with a box in New York City, the keen young woman with the BABY FACE starts methodically to the top floor in a big bank. Stanwyck is fascinating as the amoral heroine of these influential pre-code drama. Without a bunch of decency or regret, she manipulates the removal or destruction of the men dissatisfied to find themselves on her way. A wonderful actress, Stanwyck has the opportunity to portray her many talents. <br /> <br /> It's quite late in the story, George Brent is a welcome addition to the one that could possibly handle Stanwyck; His sophisticated style of acting makes a good counterpoint to her icy behavior. Douglas Dumbrille, Donald Cook and Henry Kolker present a succession of her unfortunate victims. <br /> <br /> For a few rare seconds, John Wayne appears as an unsuccessful oath for Stanwyck's love. It will be the only time these two artists appear together on the screen. <br /> <br /> Movie Mavens must recognize Nat Pendleton as a speakeasy client, and Charles Sellon and Edward Van Sloan as bank managers - all unfair. <Br /> <br /> The music heard on the soundtrack throughout the film, which perfectly underlines the plot, is 'Baby Face' (1926) by Benny Davis and Harry Akst and ?? St. Louis Blues' (1914) by W.C. Submit. <br /> <br /> BABY FACE is an excellent example of ignorance. In his candid and unapologetic sexual trafficking, this is exactly the kind of movie that the implementation of the Production Code was intended to eliminate in 1934.
