Interesting mix of comments that it would be difficult to add something constructive. But I will try. It was a very good action movie with some good pieces. You will notice that I have specified the genre. I did not cling on the lack of characterization, and I did not argue the play. Enjoy as well as what it is people, a well above average action movie. I can go on, but I have commented.
