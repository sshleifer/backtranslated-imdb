Certain elements of this movie are of course dated. An all white male crew, for example. And like most Pre-Star Wars Science Fiction, it tends to surprise too long. <br /> <br /> Still, no movie ever caught the flavor of Golden Age Science Fiction like this one even down to the use of "electronic tonalities" to provide the musical score. Robbie the Robot depicted the Asimov robots and was the inspiration for everything that came from C3PO to Data. <br /> <br /> Of course, the plot line is Shakespeare's "The Tempest". Morbius is Prospero and a bandaged magician who invaded his kingdom by interlopers. It was a movie that treated Science Fiction as an adult genre, perhaps the first.
