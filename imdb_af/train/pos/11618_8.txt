Rachel McAdams. Cillian Murphy. Wes Craven. The Dream Team. This is one of the best vibrators of 2005. A great plot. A great twist. A big eyebrow cake. This is one of Wes Craven's best movies, except "Scream" and "A Nightmare on Elm Street". It may be the best. The plot is one of the best things about the movie and it's very simple. Lisa Reisert (McAdams), a struggling hotel manager, spends a late red-eye on LA. Little did she know that Jackson Ripner AKA Jack followed the Ripper (Murphy). They have a few drinks and end up on the plane. Later, he reveals to her that he is an assassin sent to murder the Home Security Secretary staying in Lisa's hotel. And what does it need with Lisa? Well, she'll have to move his room to the top suite so they can bomb him if she won't kill Ripner her father (Brian Cox). The turning and bringing of the story really gives it the extra singing and the side characters and the side jokes really add it. Overall, definitely one of the best vibrators of 2005. Definitely worth it. <br /> <br /> 3 1/2 of 4 stars
