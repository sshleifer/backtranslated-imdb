Excellent view of an adult woman, it will lose everything (even the pruner has a bandage). The way she gets involved in this special "business", the innocence and the true love that exists between the people of a village, is perfectly blended to give us a fresh, light and funny comedy. I couldn't stop laughing with a very funny scene of two old ladies in a drugstore. <br /> <br /> I love European movies, and with movies like this, my opinion is getting stronger. A movie I also recommend with my eyes, in the same genre, is Waking Ned Devine. <br /> <br /> Save Grace, a comedy that many friends enjoyed as much as I did. You're going to love it.
