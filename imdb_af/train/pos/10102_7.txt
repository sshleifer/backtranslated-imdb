I must say it has been a long time since I saw it, but have seen it five or more times; a wonderful little skirt that is clearly inspired by the music / comedy cups of new or fading stars with musical groups of prominence. Kay Kyser's mysteries would be a good example. <br /> <br /> Unleashing Spike Jones is the best part of the show, as he and his band are playing lots of songs and being part of the action, doing a good job of support. Hugh O'Brien plays the face, Buddy Hackett. The comeback presented it to Lou Costello and thus, Abbott and Costello replacing the leaders. Don't know if it was true. <br /> <br /> All in all, a nice movie, but important to have so much Spike Jones and his band on the movie for history. Wish it was released, as I haven't seen or heard it in two decades. Hope this is not lost
