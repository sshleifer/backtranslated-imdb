For years I was a fan of this movie. Because of Teri Hatchers moving in the forefront, I had to take the film off the shelf and watch. Why didn't people see back in 1991 how wonderful this movie was in me? Sally Field and Kevin Kline are fantastic. Although I never watched daily soap operas, this movie makes me every time I see it. The play is not a comedy for anyone and the writing is so clever. If you don't have it yet, I recommend you see it. You'll see Elisabeth Shue, Whoopi Goldberg, Teri Hatcher and Carrie Fisher ... to name a few ... everyone gives great performances.
