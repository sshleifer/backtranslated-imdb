Gojoe is part of a new wave of Japanese theater. It takes many creative directors, editors and photographers and works on historical themes, called the Japanese "periods". Gojoe is extremely creative in terms of color, photography and editing. Brilliant, even. The new wave of Japanese samurai films shows the traditional belief in shamanism, demons and occult powers that were certainly part of their ancient culture, but not really explored in Kurosawa's samurai epics or the Zaitochi series. Another good example of this genre is Onmyoji (2001). I will be director Sogo Ichii as one of the most interesting and creative of the new wave of Japanese directors. Other Recent Japanese Magazines I would highly recommend Yomada's Twilight Samurai (2002) and Shintaro Katsu's Zatoichi: The Blind Swordsman (2003).
