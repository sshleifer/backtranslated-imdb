I love this freekin movie! Walsh is a true master of the film, his movie has sometimes been overlooked. But this movie is a favorite of mine because it really gives you the feeling of the time the movie was set. <br /> <br /> All the wonderful characters that existed, the lifestyle, the way of dress, the way They spoke, OK, they may be exaggerated, but it's good to know that there occasion was when two men tried to defend each other with insane stunts. <br /> <br /> I just felt it was a piece of history it should be. which is affected and appreciated by many people because of that fact. <br /> <br /> Can I find it anywhere on DVD? I just saw it on TV. But for anyone who wants a piece of life movie, it's the perfect one.
