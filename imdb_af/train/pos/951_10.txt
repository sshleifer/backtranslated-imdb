I know many people have a special love for the Alistair Sim version of Dickens's story, but to me this 1984 version is the one to beat. My wife and I have a copy of this movie on VHS, and we watch it together every Christmas. I often notice that we can also see it on Halloween, because it is a very nasty ghost story. <br /> <br /> Scott - tipecast as Scrooge - is shockingly mean and dirty, making his transformation more wonderful and moving. I think it's there with his performance in Patton. The spirits are all effective, each one is more beautiful than the last. Look at the dark, wandering, skeletal form of the Christmas Spirit. Nevertheless, I will send chills every year in my spine. And what a supporting role! David Warner, in particular, is in the best shape as Bob Cratchit, like Susannah York as his wife. <br /> <br /> I want to remember that this version is closer to the original story than most others - but I am mistaken as it has been years since I read it. Regardless, this is a great Christmas classic.
