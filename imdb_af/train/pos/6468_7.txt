It's a nice OK movie ... yes some parts are lame and extremely comfortable, and the movie doesn't really justify the big star cast (AB, SD, Tanuja). But the actor who really impressed me was Kay Kay Menon (not confused with the singer KK). In the scene where he first met Amitabh's character, I thought that a man who can only look at AB stays and doesn't say a word and still looks strong is definitely a good actor. In fact, for the second time he proved worthy of Sarkar, along with AB. This man needs more roles, he is brilliant. <br /> <br /> If you've read any of the other reviews here on IMDb, you already know the plot, and I agree that Akshaye Khanna's entry into Pakistan is a bit too easy. And the little love angle he shared with "what-her-face" was completely unnecessary. But he's a pretty good actor (as seen in DCH), Sunjay Dutt is always cool to watch. and AB ... what can I say. I don't know if I'm the biggest fan in the world, but I know I can definitely compete for that place. <br /> <br /> An interesting look, it's Bollywood, though a little inspired by Hollywood Oldies like "The Great Flight" and "Bridge on the River Kwai".
