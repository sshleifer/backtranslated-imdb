If you want to see something for "him" and "her" to say then it's the movie to choose. I'm a sucker for rom coms, but my husband isn't always so keen (what an old !!!). Anyway, I managed to see him because I told him it's about sports, and you know what he loved! <br /> <br /> Drew Barrymore is very funny and her front man (sorry but can't remember his name) is equally good. When I watched the movie, it was "The Perfect Match," but I think the title has been changed to the UK, as it is based on the Fever Pitch book and a movie has already been made about football with that title. (same movie but the English version - phew!), <br /> <br /> Anyway, all the reviews here will tell you more details if you need it, buy girls, take it from me, get you hubby / boyfriend in front of the television on a Saturday night and you will laugh and cry together. A real gem.
