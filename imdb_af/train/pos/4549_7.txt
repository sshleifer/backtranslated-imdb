"My Left Foot" is a beautifully impressive film that tells and tells the story of Christy Brown, an artist who is crippled with cerebral palsy, to paint with his left foot, the only limb in his body over which he had control . Daniel Day-Lewis won his first Oscar as Best Actor for this film, which I was not quite sure about, but is still remarkable. Day-Lewis gives Brown a realistic and sometimes almost humorous touch. Brenda Fricker, as Brown's dedicated mother, also won an Oscar for a credible and touching role. My problem with this movie is that it is sometimes too real. When Brown is in despair and needs someone to help and do everything with his left foot, the movie can be difficult to watch. This gives it an often depressing feeling that some viewers can turn off for a while. However, if you look further, you will see a sense of hope and inspiration for those with disabilities and other problems to overcome. Those of us who are not crippled and still believe that we have problems are inspired by this film, because if something with a much worse condition if we can overcome their problems, we can certainly do the same thing. Well made, sometimes nice, but hard to watch. May not be for everyone, but not bad at all. <br /> <br /> *** from ****
