For anyone thinking 1. It was a boring exhibition. 2.Hall Berry and Denzel Washington did not earn their Oscars. <br /> <br /> SHOW THE F ** C UP !! This was one of the best academy awards, because 1. It was a moment in history to have a black yes. 'Black actress' wins an academic award for Best Actress so many of our black sisters have been ignored by the Academy for years. To be honest, I stopped looking at the academy awards because of a lack of diversity in the winners or nominees. For me, it was nothing but a lot of white people hitting each other in the back. The academy has many chances to vote for black actresses. It was brilliant in movies such as Alfred Woodard, Whoopi Goldberg, Diana Ross, Mary Jean Babtise, but that didn't happen. Hale Berry deserved Oscar competition. The academy was under pressure to vote for her so long, deserving actresses ignored by the academy whose majority consisted of white voters yes yes, Nicole Kidman sang very well in Muling Rouge! But it was time for black people to be accommodated in these awards. As for Mr Washington, the academy owes him a great deal of time about that unfair loss for MalcomX. is also reduced to stereotypes made by whites, roles of what they think is a black woman or is not 'Angela Basset'. I don't expect many white people to understand these things, because they never paid attention to them. Come on, think they're the one who used it.
