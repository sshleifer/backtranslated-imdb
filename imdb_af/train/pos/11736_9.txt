Those who are not familiar with Cassandra Peterson's alter-ego Elvira, then this is a good place to start. <br /> <br /> "Elvira, Mistress of the Dark" starts with our heroine with the gravity that keeps the boobs busy. message. It seems that a great aunt died from her and that she should be present for reading the will. Anxious to raise money for a show she wants to open in Las Vegas, she decides to hope to get a lot of money. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the place to go is the town of Fallwell, Massachusetts. To keep breaking a game because of her car, she finds out that her big aunt has left her 3 things: a home, a dog and a cookbook. The residents of the village have mixed reactions: the teenagers like her, the women hate her, and the men desire her (though they try to remain moral pillars of the community). Her worst problem seems to be her great uncle Vincent (W. Morgan Sheppard), because he wants her cookbook. The cookbook seems to be a book of proverbs that will make him a more powerful safe. <br /> <br /> The movie is actually pretty funny, with Peterson aka Elvira jokingly using her "endowments" and sexiness ("And don't forget, tomorrow we'll show the head with two things ... I meaning the thing with two heads "). Especially funny like Edie McClurg as Chastity Pariah, the woman who works the hardest to keep the town in line, but looks ridiculous (the picnic scene is the perfect example). Earn a glance (The movie, not her boobs, of course).
