While the title "Before the devil knows you are dead" comes from an Irish proverb the movie plays like a Greek tragedy. It all starts with an anesthetized robbery and continues to spiral out of control, as two brothers are trying to escape the debris they found themselves. <br /> <br /> The scroll is well composed with Philip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke playing the above brothers. Well-known support includes Albert Finney as their father and Marisa Tomei as the wife of one brother and the other of the other. Apart from these principals, the play is imperceptible. <br /> <br /> The story is compelling and is told with some degree of enlightenment. The narrative structure keeps things interesting by providing different viewpoints and regular time frames. It is said, the film's unpredictability is somewhat muted, as it seems early this story is a tragedy, through and through. All in all, a pretty impressive debut for the first time author Kelly Masterson. <br /> <br /> Sidney Lumet's direction is well treated, but I am more impressed by the fact that he is still more than eighty years old. I was less impressed by Carter Burwell's score, but that's not a big distraction. <br /> <br /> In the end, the movie seems to be compelling and while the story and presentation may have superficial similarities with others films this one remains a unique experience.
