The Young Victoria is a beautiful film and has Queen Victoria in a different light that everyone thinks of her. The films wipe away the impression of Queen Victoria and show that she was a cheerful young woman. <br /> <br /> As I like history, especially Victorian history, you can imagine my reaction when I first saw This film was advertised, I was so excited and counting down the days until it theater has come. I was a little worried that it wouldn't be historically accurate, but it was and I loved it. I found out new facts about Queen Victoria who hadn't known before and it was very interested in me. <br /> <br /> In many lights, Queen Victoria was one of our very best monarchs, and this film paints a picture of her true personality and how her life was. She was treated so badly by her mother adviser Sir John Conroy because he wanted Britain to have a rule. That's what Victoria inspired to be a great queen, what she was! The romance between her and Albert was so deep and it was very well done by Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend, who were both brilliant! The Young Victoria is a sad love story, but at the same time a good look at much of British history. I love it !!!!!!!!! 10/10 ... no doubt!
