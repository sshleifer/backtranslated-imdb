I love the Doodlebops. My son watched them for over a year. We went to the Doodlebops concert last year, as well as one concert (connecticut) yesterday. He loves them. The doodlebops do not teach the alphabet or numbers, but who cares? are you serious? The TV is not supposed to teach your kids about numbers or the alphabet. the parents must come over it. The Doodlebops can actually sing. Deedee has a beautiful voice and in concert you can tell that all 3 of them have nice singing voices and do NOT sing lip. Imagine, they dance, jump around and still STAND. they have talent, the kids love them, I even enjoy watching the show. This show is by far the best television show for kids. AND a rock group for kids. How wonderful is that? Why are people who say Chad (rooney) is gay? where did you hear it? Whether he is or not, he is wonderful! Leave him out. It is not as if he or anyone promotes homosexuality to our children!
