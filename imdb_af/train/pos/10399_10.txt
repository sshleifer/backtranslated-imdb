It was a favorite of my childhood - I can remember seeing it on television every time and excited. Now I grew up and had my own child, I wanted to lie to him for this classic movie. We watched it on Friday and he liked it. During Abu's struggle with the giant spider my son's hand crept and held mine - he was really scared. "Is he going to beat the spider, Poppa?" Look, you will see. He has no historical frame of reference to speak of (eight years old), so Baghdad under the grandson of Haroun al-Raschid can only be Oz under Ozma. <br /> <br /> I think he liked many of the heroic acts and the delusions committed by the boy thief, not the great king. In fact, if you slightly deconstruct the film's narrative, the king is the side of the thief, and not the hero. It must be many imaginative, adventurous young boys. <br /> <br /> It's definitely a time piece - I suspect that by the time he is eleven or twelve, my son will find it "corny" or whatever word the next generation will use. The love story is hardly one-dimensional - as a cynical friend commented, "Why does Ahmad love the Princess? Because the story demands it." Abu's willingness to put himself (repeatedly) at risk for the indecisive, love-slain king is equally unlikely. But to doubt such things while flying mechanical horses, fifty feet will be healed and the Temple of the All-Seeing Eye will be in the extreme. The satisfaction of seeing the prophecy fulfilled in the film's climax is enormous, and Abu's last shot is triumphant on his (stolen) magic carpet, which is looking for some fun and adventure!
