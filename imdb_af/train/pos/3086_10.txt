Here Italy (I'm writing from Venice). Why Canceled? The ABC had given it a chance to build an audience. The cast (Hope Davis, Campbell Scott, Erika Christensen, Zoe Saldana, Jay Hernandez and Bridget Moynahan) is one of the best I've seen recently. We need more apps like this that viewers feel are intelligent individuals who don't think. I hope ABC will reconsider its decision or another station will pick it up.
