"The Godfather" of television, but apart from his spectator and mobster characters, the two are not the same. Tony Sopran is forced to go to a psychiatrist for a series of panic attacks. His psychiatrist teaches that Tony is actually part of two families. In one family he is a loving father, but not as perfect a man, and in the other family he is a relentless wisdom. After analysis, Dr Melfi comes to the conclusion that Tony's problems actually originate from his mother, Livia, who is believed to have border personality disorder. Gandolfini is rightly praised as main character; Yet Bracco and Marchand are not nearly as recognized for their equally and talented performances as the psychiatrist and mother. Falco, Imperioli and DeMatteo are commended for their brilliant supporting roles. Van Zandt (of the E-Street Band) plays his first and only role as Tony's best friend, and is pretty convincing and grumpy. Chianese, the only repetitive actor who actually appeared in a Godfather movie, plays Tony's uncle and on-and-off nemesis. Many fans also enjoyed characters from Pastors, Ventimiglia, Curatola, Proval, Pantoliano, Lip, Sciorra and Buscemi. Tony's kids are "okay" but not noticeable (with the exception of Iler's beautiful performance in the third to last episode, "The Second Coming"); Sirico and Schirripa are unconvincing and over-the-top, but the show is too strong to hold back. Even if the performance lasts for more than six seasons, it ceases to have a dull or predictable moment. <br /> <br /> **** (out of four)
