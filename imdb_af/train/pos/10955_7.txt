I originally recorded Sarah's show with a greasy 8, but I did have a bit of humor with her and a thin 7 is about it. I'll explain. <br /> <br /> You'll also love Sarah's humor or you won't. If you don't, I doubt someone who can persuade you. You know who you are and it is perfectly good, but then you know it too. The first season we gave fantastic bits about Sara, her friends and family, and her pursuit of life. In an unforgettable episode, she is "pulled" by officer Jay, whom she first met. - "Do you know why I'm standing here?" he asks. "Because you have all the C's at high school?" she replies in a fresh way. It was a real question. - It's funny things in my book. Sara can come to you from strange corners. In another episode, her relationship with God was especially funny. God is small and jealous is wonderful added to the joke. It's smart, it's a distorted view, but she'll show us the truth in humor and we laugh. <br /> <br /> Then came the second season. While it's still not without a new and inventive comedy, it looks like we've slipped a bit into banal shit and fiery jokes. I get some good laughs here and there, but a lot of them look like stuffing while she, and the authors, are struggling to find original material. Sophomoric and tiring are the feelings I have had recently for the episodes, but I exhausted it for the jewels I find (the tortoise) and waiting for her to turn it around. I was a fan of her "Jesus is Magic" routine and would like to think that I understand what she is capable of. Let's get it back.
