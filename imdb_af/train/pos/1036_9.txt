Watch on the Rhein is one of the best anti-Nazi propaganda films made during World War II. Paul Lukas was definitely deserving of his Oscar. Bette Davis shines brilliantly as the great actress and beauty she was. I would recommend this movie to those who are interested in that era, and of course the fantastic films of the late, Mrs. Bette Davis.
