"The Last Wave" is one of those movies that relies heavily on the mind. David Burton (Richard Chamberlain) is a Sydney lawyer who has been appointed to defend some Aborigines accused of murder. Around this time, there was exceptionally heavy rainfall in Australia. While defending the Aborigines, David learns the last wave theory, and begins to wonder if it's just mythology. <br /> <br /> The film's last sequence is a metaphor to descend into the depths of man's thoughts. Peter Weir created a confusing but thoughtful movie. Aboriginal actor David Gulpilil (who saw you in Walkabout, Crocodile Dundee and "Rabbit Evidence") offers an interesting support role as one of the defendants. <br /> <br /> If you have a chance, watch the "make" feature on the DVD. Peter Weir explains some of the film's undertones, some of which relate to Richard Chamberlain's background.
