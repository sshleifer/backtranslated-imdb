This afternoon we took the kids to the movies and saw Neil Gaimans Stardust. All I can say is Wow. <br /> <br /> It's scarcely surprising to me, but it's probably the biggest fantasy movie I've ever seen, maybe even the best movie of any kind, and that's all Neil Gaiman owes. <br /> <br /> Certainly, I could be caught up in the wonderful dialogue that was clever, flowing smoothly and made the characters completely credible. <br /> <br /> For days, I can perform over the spectacular acting. Charlie Cox is perfect like Tristan, Claire Daines is brilliant as Yvaine, and Robert Di Nero steals the film as the deep in The Closet Pirate Captian Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> The pure joy caused by the humor that managed to make Laugh our Loud funny, Intelligent enough to make the first Shrek look like an 80's Sitcom, and perfectly blend with the rest of the movie alone it would have made a good movie. <br /> <br /> Special effects were near perfect, t It was not LOTR or Star Wars SF Extravaganza, but where they were used, it was exactly what it was asked for, not too much of the movie itself to guide and blend perfectly into the story. <br /> <br /> When is the story? What can I say. How often do you come across a story that contains all the classic fairy tale formula components that come not just like another cheap Princess Bride knockoff. It is capable of being simultaneous and comfortable and yet completely new and refreshing. <br /> <br /> Any one of those things would have made it a good movie, all together making it a great movie, but they turned out to be the rich enchanting world that combines those elements to make good living. bring. Again, Neil Gaiman did this, he drove another dagger into my heart by creating a fantasy world that is so beautiful and magical that I will do almost anything to live in it and just give me a brief insight . I didn't want it to end, I wanted to be sucked into the Stormhold land by a whirlpool and personally meet Tristan and Yvaine, to visit his fields and valleys. Walk through the markets and meet its residents, both dangerous and friendly and stay there forever. It's a feeling I noticed when I read something by Gaiman, The Sandman, American God, Coraline, everyone left me with a deep sense of sadness when I was finished reading them because it was over, I couldn't do anything else in the worlds he had created that were so much more vibrant and livelier than the one I forced to stay in Stardust. <br /> <br /> In the end, I'm sure Neil's writing and this movie won't have the same effect on everyone, but trust me when I say you won't regret the time or money spent on this movie is spent. It's easily one of the top 5 movies I've ever seen and I can assure anyone anyone will love it at least.
