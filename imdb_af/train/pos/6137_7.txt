What a great jewel it is. This is an unusual story that is fun to watch. Yes, it sings, but it is very beautiful in the story and is very melodic to hear. It was so nice to watch; I enjoyed it from start to finish! <br /> <br /> The film takes place in England during World War II. It's about a pupil's witch looking for a missing part of a game she needs. She uses her rough "magic" to transport her and 3 children under her care to different destinations to find it. They are joined by her correspondence teacher, who is surprised to learn that his school lessons really work! <br /> <br /> Although the special effects may only be a bit dated, they first become part of the charm of this movie. In fact, the movie won an Oscar for these effects! <br /> <br /> The movie is innocent and fun - and it's hard not to keep the songs. The characters are wonderfully interesting to watch. I think anyone at any age can find something about this movie.
