There are many people in our lives who meet us once in our lifetime, but for some reason we remember those people for the rest of our lives. This time in life, friendships are between people with long distances and there are always natural reasons why we no longer meet these people. We do not always know their names, as we are never offered each other, and sometimes we even forget to ask what their names are. It's funny how ordinary humanity occasionally makes friends and we like to keep it as such, because reunification may spoil good memories or we don't know. We're too scared to go out. <br /> <br /> The movie "Before Sunrise" just caught me watching it. I never had the intention to look through it, but because the conversation between the couple was interesting, I watched the rest of the movie. I didn't know what to expect, but neither did the young couple. They had time to discuss each other until the sunrise and anything could happen before they had to divorce. I believe this movie has had good reviews because the situation is something that everyone on this planet lived at least once or twice. It all reminds us of all the people we once met in our lives.
