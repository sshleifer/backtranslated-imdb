'Iphigenia' is the great achievement of Michael Cacoyannis. This masterful play is masterfully adapted to the screen and is brought to life by a wonderful scroll. Cacoyannis achieved the impossible. He managed to shield a Greek tragedy without losing its effectiveness and interest. A Greek star throws him away. Newer Tatiana Papamos show is extremely impressive like Iphigenia. Equally impressive is Irene Papas, who, even though she sometimes looks at the top, is very realistic. A wonderful Greek film, beautifully adapted and directed by Michael Cacoyannis, with an excellent music score by Mikis Theodorakis which is ideal in every scene. <br /> <br /> P.S. Rumors say the movie has lost the best foreign language film Oscar with only 1 vote !!!
