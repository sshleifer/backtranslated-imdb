Samuel Fuller's Pickup on South Street is anomalous: a "Red Scare" movie without hysteria, in which the Communist threat is nothing more than the McGuffin that ignites the plot. Pickpocket Richard Widmark relieves runaway Jean Peters of her wallet with a strip of microfilm; Unknown to one of them, it has secrets that are essential to the Cold War. Peters, as it did, is under the supervision of FBI agents, who are not left by the theft as the man running her cowardly Richard Kiley. To try and regain the valuable film, both sides get the help of Thelma Ritter, a street old Jane who is always up to date and willing to sell what she hears. <br /> <br /> Fuller pulls out a cute palette of tempos and tonalities to tell the story, which is a race against the bell of rising brutality. From the subway to the waterfront, its midnight Manhattan takes a sweat that is almost sharp. The love shows between Peters and Widmark become an unstable mix of turbulent and fierce, and they are recorded to 'Again', a song introduced by Ida Lupino in Road House. The pace relaxes for Ritter's beautifully written and played death scene - among the most mournful vignettes in all noirs, and a kind of miracle in a movie that falls apart from sentimentality. It is writer / director Fuller's only work in the strictest constraints of the noir cycle; His later explorations of American pathology (The Crimson Kimono, The Naked Kiss, Underworld U.S.A.) never led to a synthesis that was satisfactory than Pickup on South Street.
