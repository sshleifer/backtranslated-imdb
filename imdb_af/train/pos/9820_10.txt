It's a very good, made for TV movie. It portrays the trouble in suburbs about 1970s and the kind of neighbors that one definitely does not want. The worst and most disturbing part of the movie was when the punk teens killed the family dog. The teens do everything to blaspheme and annoy this poor family. But boy !, finally take the main character revenge on those punk teens. The father / home owner certainly does not take all the aggravation of the punk teens lightly and can fall back quickly after police assistance. He stands up and protects his home and his family. A very good actor. I can add it. <br /> <br /> I watched it on TV when I was like 8 or 9. I have never seen it on TV and would like to. Definitely a good one! It's the kind of movie you can collect late at night on a weekday and can't watch a weekend or stop an afternoon movie. It's the kind they just don't show anymore. <br /> <br /> It's definitely worth seeing!
