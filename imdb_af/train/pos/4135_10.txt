It's an absolutely beautiful movie, one of my favorite romantic comedies. It's very humorous and the role play is wonderful. Although Laurence Olivier is mostly associated with his Shakespeare work, in this film he shows that he is by no means limited to only classical theater. He manages the transition from the cynical divorce lawyer, who tries to avoid women and their treacherous ways, to the loving puppy played for Lady X by Merle Oberon. The dialogue is wonderful and refreshing and enchanting the atmosphere. Ralph Richardson was also a pleasure to watch. I highly recommend it.
