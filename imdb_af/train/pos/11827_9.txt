If Dick Tracy were black and white, the Pope would not be religious. A new sense of the concept of color in a movie gives us a unique experience in a comic book world, and this is one of the few movies that has succeeded, thanks to a serious writing, good direction, good performances ( Al Pacino is astonishing) and above all a powerful combination of cinematography, art direction and costume design. The use of only primary colors is very different from what we have seen before. And there is also a real success for all the gangster movie genre, extinctly extinct from the modern theater. Overall, I see this movie as a fresh effort and a touch of originality to a theater that relies more and more on the old and already seen formulas. 7 out of 10.
