It's a beautiful, spiritual recovery movie. Using the real villa inspired by Elizabeth Arngrim to write the novel in the 1920s to the inspired casting piece, every choice was perfectly right! The quiet joy of this movie does not look like repeated views. Josie Lawrence, Miranda Richardson, Polly Walker and Joan Plowright seem to have been born to play these parts! I would like to see Enchanted April released on DVD in a widescreen format.
