Lindy (Meryl Streep) and her husband Michael (Sam Neill) have just welcomed a baby girl, Azaria. As Seventh-day Adventists, they live their beliefs every day and Azaria quickly devoted to their church, with their two older sons watching it. Michael gets a holiday and the family decides to go to Ayer's Rock, one of the impressive tourist spots in Australia. The family does not camp near the grounds. After a wonderful first day, Lindy puts baby Azaria to sleep in one of the tents. Suddenly she heard Azaria crying. As Lindy jumps to the tent, a dingo dog is just excited, shaking his head. The baby is gone and soon, so is the dingo. Although the whole camp looks like the baby, she is not found. To conclude she was dead and that the dingo had been dismissed with their beloved child, the Chamberlain struggled to accept God's decision and to continue with their lives. But unfortunately, the story gets sensational coverage in the news media and soon the story is spread that Lindy killed the baby. She is then arrested and executed. How can this happen? It is a good portrayal of real events that show how "evil rule" is not an imagination of imagination. The whole country is turning against the Chambermates, partly because they are considered strange. Streep gives her best performance ever as the complex Lindy, whose own strong attitude towards her every step of the way. Neill, too, does a wonderful job as the reluctant and confused Michael. The film is one of the biggest ever, depicting people across the country digging in Lindy's case. The costumes, scenery, mini-dissertation, direction and production are all at the top of the line. If you've never seen or heard of this movie, fix it right away. It is not far from reality to say that this "Cry" should be seen by everyone who cares for film and about the abused power of the media.
