Fabulous actors, beautiful scenery, naughty reality. I will not elaborate on all the other reviewers' comments, because you get the picture! But the movie is not for the sick. The reality is hitting pigs and other livestock to survive. I also have Elinore Randall Stewart's book book. I've read it a few years ago. I have to read it again as I just watched the newly created, remastered DVD of the movie. <br /> <br /> I tried to buy the video for a few years, eventually bought it. from a video store that went out of business. But Yippee! The DVD is now for sale, I bought it on amazon.com. Not cheap, but it's worth me. This is a movie I will watch until the end of my days!
