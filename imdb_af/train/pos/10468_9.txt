Monster vision was a show where I grew up. From late night with Penn and Teller to the one, the only one, Joe Bob Briggs. The show held me back in my high school years on Friday night and came up with some of the best in-room memories ever. <br /> <br /> Without a doubt, the best late night television ever. If you didn't get up, you were gone. <br /> <br /> I know John Bloom and Joe Bob live but I want them back where they belong. SAMPLE VISION! Question ... has anyone else been sitting for 4 hours from the "Swarm"? q :) <br /> Long life Monstervision!
