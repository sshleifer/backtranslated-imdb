*** SPOILERS *** On the first WWII movies that come out of Hollywood, it shows how the war brought about these CIs, or in this case US Marines, who fought in it. <br /> <br /> 21-year-old Al Schmid, John Garfield, started living with a well-paid job earning about $ 40.00 a week. At the local steelworks and girlfriend, Ruth Hartley, Elenore Parker, he is going to get married when the Japs spoiled him. millions of the same Americans, by attacking the American Pacific fleet at Pearl Harbor. His duty as an American citizen Al immediately joined the US Marine Corps to hope to return to the Japs. It is right to show that the Marines would be the first American war units to crack them. /> <br /> Although it finally got its chance when its unit, the 1st Marine Division, landed on Guadalcanal on August 7, 1942, in the devastated Solomon Islands to take control of the Japanese. It was during the struggle of the Ilu River that Al almost stopped one by one with a massive Japanese Banzai attack which, with its machine gun after wave of suicide attacks, threw through the set Japs until aid or reinforcements finally arrived. It was during the bloody battle. Al was hit in the face by a Japanese grenade that eventually blinded him. <br /> <br /> Now back in the states invading a naval hospital, Al is faced with something much more difficult to overcome. then a battalion size battles Japanese or German soldiers. He's faced with a future where he'll never see again and have to depend on others to check on or for him! <br /> <br /> We see in the movie "Pride of the Marines" Al battle much harder than he did the Japanese troops at Guadalcanal to deal only with his disability. No one, especially his friend Ruth, wants to feel sorry for him. Even though the one who is sorry for him feels more than anyone else in the movie. It is with the help of Navy Nurse Virginia Pfeiffer, Rosemary DeCamp, and Ruth with his American Navy friend Lee Diamond, Dane Clark, who finally gives All the courage to look at his blindness with the same strength he is after the wave of Japanese troops on Gudalcanal.

We see that in many ways it was much more difficult for those fighting the war to adapt to a peacetime America when, as in the case of Al Schmid, they left something behind on the battlefield. All of his struggle with his personal demons was much more difficult than the Japanese he fought because they were part of him and thus had to fight himself to overcome them and eventually defeat them. Despite the help he had of both nurse Virginia and his friend Ruth, as well as his naval doctor - who had a striking resemblance to actor Gregory Peck, it was still alive to Al about the fears he faced. to overcome. Fears he and only he has to fight and overcome both, as he has been told by everyone in the movie, everything himself.
