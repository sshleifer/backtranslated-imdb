Since Siskel's death and Ebert's absence, the performance remained in Richard Roeper's unaffordable hands. Roeper is not a film critic. He just criticizes anything he doesn't like personally, ie movies with country music are placed because "I don't like country music!" and children's movies get a standard "Don't see it now, wait until it comes to DVD and rent it for your kids!" Caller may be an idiot savant, but in a different field. The weekly guests sit for Ebert better, but who wants to pick a daisy in the middle of a cowboy? All that said, this is the only show in town and it alone makes it worth watching. As for Roger Ebert, if Stephen Hawking can speak, you can too! These are your thoughts and thoughts that we desire. Do what it takes to get that same stated throne from his cellphone.
