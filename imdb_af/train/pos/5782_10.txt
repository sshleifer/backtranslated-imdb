The Internet database lists it as a TV program. And yes, it was a series on MTV that appeared on the "Oddities" program, after "The Head" and before "Aeon Flux" if I remember correctly. But the version I watched this time was a VHS band with all the episodes that go together in a movie without waiting for annoying credits in between or a week for the next fifteen minutes. <br /> <br /> You have the story of Maxx, Julie Winters, Sarah and Mr. Gone. The Maxx is a superhero or a bum, July a social worker or a leopard queen, Sarah, a girl who has to listen to less of The Smiths and Mr. Going for a man who can't seem to keep his head on. And then there are the other strange creatures ... <br /> <br /> I use "or" with Maxx and Julie, because part of the fun is trying to figure out which parts of the story really are and what dreams are . Maybe they're all real or dreaming. Perhaps one of the characters does not exist. Perhaps there is only one and the other dreams. You have to wait and find out. <br /> <br /> I had the comics before the show came out, and that was one of my favorites. The artwork was spectacular and the story was original - unlike anything you would find in Superman or Batman. It will bend your mind and have strong adult overtones without being obscene or offensive. And the show basically uses the same exact artwork (just now moving it) and the same story ... guaranteeing that the beauty actually found in the cartoon will be faithfully reproduced. It was the best performance to appear on "Oddities", hands down. <br /> <br /> If you like comics of a darker nature or need a good mindset, this is a show to check. This is "Donnie Darko" before there was ever such a thing. <br /> <br /> The astonishing thing is that it never again became another movie or television series, but I'm not disappointed. By keeping it simple, they sealed this movie in gold and released it from the scars followed by successive failures.
