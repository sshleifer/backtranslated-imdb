I really enjoyed the movie, but I didn't realize that Little Richard has so many things in his life. First, I wasn't aware of Lucille. There is very little (almost no) mention of females involved in Little Richard. Even in his life today there is no mention of any involvement of women in a romantic way. I wonder why this part of his life was not mentioned. Overall the movie was great. I also didn't like Leon playing part of Little Richard, he is a good actor, but I feel that part of another actor should be. Visually, he didn't remind me of Little Richard. I was also totally unaware of the debauchery that Little Richard was part of. From the film he was proposed as a sexual addict. In today's time, he will be referred to counseling for his sexual addition. He was a voyeur. I don't want to ruin the movie for someone who hasn't seen the movie. However, there were several things about the movie I didn't feel should be part of the final cut.
