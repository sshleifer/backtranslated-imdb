This is the best performance of Georg Wilhelm Pabst's social realism era, based on a tragedy early in 1906 that claimed the lives of nearly 1,100 French miners when a coal explosion deep in mines occurred at Courrieres in northern France after a fire has smothered three weeks, eventually the release of deadly pit gas that has caused the deadly effects. Affordable designer Erno Metzner creates sharp sets that simulate the tragedy, which offers a reality perspective, complemented by inexorable sound editing. The only music being produced by integral orchestras at the beginning, ending parts of a work for which hearing-controlled effects are equally important with leading directors' fascinating visual compositions. Pabst's way of "invisible editing", which seems to be the action of shot-to-shoot by player movements, is smoothly integrated into this landmark film, which also displays sublime cinematography using cameras mounted on vehicles so that the director between screens can move without the need for cutting. Although the cardinal theme of the work is related to socialist dogma, the memorable power of this film is kept in its details. It was born from Pabst's unparalleled skill to weave numerous plot lines into a theater wall carpet, admiring German rescue groups whose homeland is very proud, but no less desperate of disastrous losses to the families of the French victims; Certainly, a sensory triumph, which is being stimulated today into a cookie as it was at the time of its first release.
