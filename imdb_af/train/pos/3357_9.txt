While Rome gets angry with Hitler's visit - uniforms, ties, parades - two outsiders stay home, in a big building and meet each other. She is Sofia Loren, who is the wife of the brutal civil servant and the mother of six children. He is Mastroianni, a radio speaker who was dismissed for his homosexuality. Both need a business and understanding, both of them find it in one another. <br /> <br /> The movie covers a couple of hours. The color is blurred and everything takes place with a soundtrack of military marches and hysterical radio announcements. Strangely enough, the Nazi Anthem - the Horst-Wessel Song - ends with a romantic theme. <br /> <br /> Beautiful movie, great relaxation of a special era in Italian history and a touch, sad story. Mastroianni is as good as we expected, and Sofia Loren does a great job, far away from her usual truck driver's precipitation, Neapolitan fisherman. Don't miss it.
