The film took a new look at Gandhi's life, which is great to see and shows how man was. His relationship with Harilal is something that Gandhi is concerned about and has repeatedly mentioned it as his failure as a father in his autobiography. <br /> <br /> My big grip is that I thought Gandhi was surprisingly uncharacteristic in the movie. It could be better done by the person who played Gandhi. Some of Gandhi's statements were too obscure and he seemed deliberately portrayed in a negative light in some parts of the movie. <br /> <br /> The movie is not really rounded, but only relates to the relationship of the father and son. The rest is blurred and uses only the time frame and general setting of the movie. <br /> <br /> Overall beautiful movie if you keep in mind that it is not a complete picture.
