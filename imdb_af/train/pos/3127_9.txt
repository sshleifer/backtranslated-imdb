I loved this movie. I knew it would be full of camp and silliness like the original series. I saw it very heart-warming to see Adam West, Burt Ward, Frank Gorshin and Julie Newmar all together again. Anyone who loved the Batman series of the 60's had to enjoy Back to the Batcave. You could say the actors had a lot of fun making this movie, especially Adam West. And I'll bet he would have jumped back in his Batman costume if the writing required him to do so. I told a number of friends about this movie that didn't choose to see it ... now they wanted them to. I have all the original 120 episodes on VHS. Now this movie will join my collection. Thanks for the reunion Adam and Burt.
