Then you should see this movie to understand reality. After reading the book, Mrs. Duke now an advocate for those with bipolar disorder; previously named manic depression. <br /> <br /> It is hard to believe that people of this age and age still criticize others with emotional problems, or those seeking psychiatric help. Regressive and discriminatory thinking still exists, and it is a pity. <br /> <br /> In this movie, the audience sees the pain and suffering of Mrs. Duke was through, especially as a child. Many of us may remember her from the teen "Patty Duke Show". She was a household name in America by the age of 15. <br /> <br /> You learn about her exploitation by the Ross' (well played by Howard Hesseman). As she grew up in the 1950s, the stigma was in full force. However, we see if she is progressing in her career, but the disease gets worse. She goes through drug abuse and debauchery; even marry someone she divorces the next week; and she has several conflicts and tantrums with her children and elderly mother. All this problem occurred before she received adequate therapy and medication. <br /> <br /> A recent survey released by NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness) has shown that a majority of American adults do not have the most classic symptoms of bipolar disorder. It was also released that one in five respondents believed the polls that people could control their illness without medication if they wanted. (bp Magazine, Winter 2006) Watching this movie, you'll learn the true story of a talented woman who couldn't "pull" herself through her bootstraps and "get well" until she was educated about her illness and properly received has. treatment. Thank you, Mrs. Duke, because you are an advocate against ignorance and prejudice.
