I thought it was a wonderful movie. It touches every human fiber. The love in the film is very intense. I thought it was Will's best performance so far. Great direction. Like editing. Music was wonderful. Good use of flashback. This is the kind of movie everyone should see. I hope people will get something wonderful from this. Overall, excellent movie. I think Hollywood should make more movies with dust. Even action movies can have a caring story. I like the fact that Will was very subtle in his acting. He had a purpose and a dedication that is scarce to see. I suggest watching it alone or with someone you really care about. For me, I found the world stopped and my only focus was on the movie. The outside world was suspended for a moment. It was a nice feeling with all this chaos going on in this world. And with this generation of me it was great to see something (someone) who cares for people other than himself.
