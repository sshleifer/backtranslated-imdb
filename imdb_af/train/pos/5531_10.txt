To watch "The Fox and the Child" was an intoxicating experience. The lush visual, integrity of the point of view and the full beauty of the environment and characters left me in a pleasure of pleasure. <br /> <br /> This plot is uncomplicated. Misleadingly simple. Within the holder of that simplicity unfolds a world that draws you and leaves you breathless. <br /> <br /> I laughed. I cried. I learned. <br /> <br /> It's a movie you can trust - give yourself a go. Dare I say this is a love meant for any innocent heart. It reaches the heart of the viewer - of any age - and reveals the world through new eyes, as if it were seen from the heart. <br /> <br /> Adi Da Samraj once said that true art is the viewer in ecstasy participation. I feel privileged to look - no to participate - this film, a work of real art.
