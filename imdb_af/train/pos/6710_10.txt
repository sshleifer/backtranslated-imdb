Sabrina the Teenage Witch was one of my favorite T.V shows of life: D I returned daily when I got to school. So far I thought I watched every episode at least once and the whole series 3 or 4 times. Melissa Joan Hart plays the perfect teenage girl / witch with normal teenage problems that we can all endure. She is funny, smart, outgoing, witty and much more. Caroline Rhea and Beth Broderick fit the part very well like Sabrina's aunts. Zelda, the intelligent scientist, and Hilda crazy, wacky makes a perfect balance in Sabrina's life. Although I have to agree that college years are not as good as her high school years, but that doesn't mean they were not good at all. I think the end was wonderful, although it wasn't what I was hoping for, it made sense and I loved it anyway. :)
