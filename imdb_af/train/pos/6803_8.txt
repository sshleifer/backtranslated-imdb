In one of her first movies, Romy Schneider, as young queen, Victoria of Britain, as she suddenly sits at the age of 18, seems to learn to rule despite the claims of politicians, and eventually romance and allegiance to Prince Albert of Saxony. Kitschy and campy (although surprisingly true to the real events), this romantic piece is irresistible. See this movie about British royalty spoken in German, adding to its beautiful charm. On the front, one wonders why an Austrian movie about an English queen was made; But then one remembers that in 1954 Austria was still under occupation by Allied troops, including the British. Perhaps this was one of the reasons for the existence of this movie.
