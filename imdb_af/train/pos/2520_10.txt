Despite what others have said (* cough *), this is my favorite movie of all time. I don't know how long I waited to see it, but as soon as I did, I immediately fell in love. Certainly, it's strange, but it just gives it an exciting scent. For those who don't know, Moonchild is one of Gackt and Hyde's first movies. They didn't do much at all, maybe 3 or 4 tops each. So, give them some credit. We all know that Adam Sandler wasn't the best either. I believe they are throwing some strange situations in there, but I'm looking to find the best points of this movie, the emotions being displayed and what isn't. That's why I, and always will, give this movie a 10 out of 10.
