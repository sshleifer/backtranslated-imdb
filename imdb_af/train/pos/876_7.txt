A great, unusual film by Audiard, Read My Lips, is a quirky, lonely-hearted thriller. Perfect for Vincent Cassel's exceptional grizzled charisma, it features a wonderfully embodied Emanuelle Devos. Devos is a repeating feature of Audiard in the same way that KArin Viard appeared to Jean-Pierre Jeunet: unconventionally beautiful (it is called by everyone as unattractive in this movie), versatile and capable of having a subordinate profile. <br /> <br /> It's almost the definition of her role as Carla, a pleasant dogbody, prompted by colleagues who use her deafness. Yet she finds an ami d'exploitation, if you like in Cassel's ex-con Paul. Everyone uses the other's unconventional talents (theft and lip reading) to struggle through their respective situations and form an unconventional romantic acceleration. Devos / Audiard manages Carla's deafness and his accompanying, distorted inner world with strategic, stylish flair. <br /> <br /> In this film (2001), Audiard is already in control of his handling of tension, action and collection of his framework. with a true visceral experience that will become the great hit - a prophet nine years later. 10/07
