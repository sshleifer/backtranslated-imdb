There were many film and TV productions by Jane Eyre, each with aspects to recommend them, but I suspect this is the one that people will discover and fall in love for decades from now on. It's just a classic (and offers much more of the story than others do). Timothy Dalton is entirely in his element as Rochester, who seldom misses the mark; his performance is surprisingly bare and multicolored, while never deviating too far from the dark complexities of the character. Zelah Clarke's Jane is more cerebral than others worldwide, but she makes a perfect foil for Dalton (which is appropriate to her!) The nuances of her performance come better on a second show (as soon as you shock Dalton's charisma absorbed). There are some technical flaws and a few moments where the production values ​​could be better; although it was pretty much a top-of-the-line production by the BBC's standards of that time. But these are the shows that are the real pleasure. do not miss this one!
