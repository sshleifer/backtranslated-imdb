I just saw Hot Millions on TCM and I completely forgot this gem. Ustinov creates a clever and divisive plot that goes smart from two pieces to human skill. Well, you will see. Perfect as the bumbling secretary / neighbor who has a hard time keeping a job, Maggie Smith has a warm and vibrant personality in this picture. She creates a fine representation of a warm, witty and real person in the long run ... well ... <br /> <br /> Molden and Newhart as top managers take the challenge of making banal roles. and make them out in a comic life of their own. <br /> <br /> Robert Morley and Ceasar Romero are just a pleasure to see and I know at least in Romero's case. Ustinov expands a helping work. <br /> <br /> This movie is meant to be a shot back on the rising computer age and it's a problem for the average man or man for the case, but the characters are actually so involved and so much fun about it. to see The computer's subplot is almost lost. I almost say. <br /> <br /> Leave your usual comedy expectations and look for great shows and friendly, forgiving and profound plot in this picture.
