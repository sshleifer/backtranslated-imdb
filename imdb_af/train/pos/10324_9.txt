In the 30's it is a brand new entertaining period that takes place in the 30's. It is a twist on the classic wreath pendant series, as much as Raiders of the Lost Ark. It's done only on a low budget and a lot of champion by Michael Anderson. The opening styles eat liberal amount of Gothic art nuveau, which Batman predicted over two decades. With Ron Ely (Tarzan) as a perfect hero and beautiful Pamela Hensley as the local latina Mona who is on our hero on a golden hunt in the Latin American country of Hidalgo, which does not exist. Best rule, our hero for Mona, holds a fist to her chin, just as you expect from him, to make her tired and give her a hug: "Mona, you're a brick!" <br /> <br /> Paul Wexler ham and cheese blackhat, Captain Seas is an absolute pleasure. Expect a little "Raiders ..", a little Batman, a little "The Lost World", a little "Lost Horizons" and lots of campus, and you'll get it right. Watch out for cult lover Michael Berryman to a small extent as an entrepreneur and enjoy the campus use of John Philip Sousa's patriotic music. A leading candidate for the release of DVDs, it's definitely overdue. An inexplicable treatment for the whole family. 9/10
