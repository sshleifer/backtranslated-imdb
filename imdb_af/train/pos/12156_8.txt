Some of the background details of this story are very, very loosely based on actual events of the era in which it was placed. The story combines some of the details of the famous Leopold and Loeb case with a bit of Aimee Semple McPherson. <br /> <br /> The story begins with two moms (Shelley Winters and Debbie Reynolds) being rushed while courting. The crowd seems to have the most intent to injure them physically, as their sons are only convicted of a horrifying crime. One person in the crowd seems to cut Winters's hand while making their way to a chariot. <br /> <br /> Shortly after they get home, they start getting threatening calls, so Reynolds suggests they both move to the West. Kiss together and open a dance school. The dance school is successful and they cater for incredibly unpleasant parents who think their child is the next Shirley temple. One of the parents of these spoiled children is a multi-millionaire who is beaten a lot with Reynolds and they start the meeting. Life looks very good. But when the threatening calls start again, Winters responds by flashing out - acting like a psychotic break, and she continues to move into religion - listening to the radio after 'Sister Alma' almost constantly. Again you see winters on the edge and end it in very bad things !! No more, because it can destroy this exciting and interesting movie. <br /> <br /> In many ways, this movie is much like the Bette Davis and Joan Crawford horror films of the 1960s such as "Whatever happened to Baby Jane?", "Straight-Jacket" and "The Nanny". Although none of these things are exactly intellectual, they are very entertaining and fun at a kitsch level. The writing is very good and there are some nice twists near the end that make it very exciting. Winters is great like a fragile and demented lady and Reynolds plays one of the sexiest 39-year-olds I've ever seen - and she can really dance. <br /> <br /> My only concern about this is that some Winters' hypertension in the movie may be a bit tough - like a cheap attack on Christianity. Initially, I felt like that, but if you meet Sister Alma, she looks sincere and is not mocked, so I have Winters's religious zeal as just a sign of madness - what I accept is all that is meant. /> <br /> By the way, this movie is packed with "Whoever Tantie Roo?" - Another Shelley Winters horror movie of 1971. Both are very nice ... and quite over!
