Dismiss the plot and enjoy Fred Astaire who does a Foggy Day and several other dances, one a duo with a fearless Joan Fontaine. Here we see that Astaire does what is essentially a "stage" dance in pure form than in his films with Ginger Rogers, and before learning how to fully exploit the potential of the movie. Best of all, the fact that we see Burns and Allen before their radio / TV man-woman comedy career does the kind of dance they had to do in vaudeville and didn't have a chance in their Paramount college movies. do the 30's. . (George was once a tap dance instructor). Their two numbers with Fred are high points of the movie, and worth waiting for. The first soft shoe trio is a warm-up for the "Chin up" exciting carnival number, in which the three of them sing and dance through the rides and other attractions. It looks almost spontaneous. Fan of Fred Astaire and Burns & Allen find it worthwhile to act under the "plot". I've seen this one 4 or 5 times, and find the quick button useful.
