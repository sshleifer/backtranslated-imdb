I am a cute guy, old enough to remember the taste of Oreos and Coke as they were 50-55 years ago when every taste was fresh to a child. I wish I had somehow set aside, then there is a magical suspended dressing room so I can taste those things today. This magical shade can even adjust the fabric of the food to explain how I physically and otherwise have a kind of dynamic expectation. In the middle of the century they had to adjust a bit, because you see that I knew I had set aside them. Eating one now would be a celebration of self and past, and story and sentence, which would make the interim years an expected reward. <br /> <br /> I didn't have enough sense to do it with the original Coke. And I couldn't find any of those magical psychic lockers ?? not then. But I did almost as well. In the seventies I really agreed to Roman Polanski. He was a strange and exotic pleasure? You know, movies smuggled out of the Soviet bloc. Movies that are so sensitive to beauty that you cry for weeks. Movies that make you want to live with Polish women, one, and then decide that they will be the last to get it. <br /> <br /> Here's what I did. I took what I knew would be my favorite Polanski movie and put it aside. I didn't look at it. I delayed until I thought I'd be big enough to earn it. Over the years I tried to test myself, my ability to surround beauty and define it without occupying it. There are probably few Poles who worked on this, to earn Chopin. Work to earn womanness when I see it. I'm trying to get the inside of the edges. <br /> <br /> Recently, I achieved something like the assurance that it was time to pull it out. I already knew that I was already over when it would work optimally because I saw and understood the 9th Gate. <br /> <br /> If you don't know, it's about a man who rents innocently a room in which the previous tenant (whose story is called) jumped out of the window later to this man ( played by Polanski) to die. What happens is that time-lapse and he becomes this woman. We are foolish to believe that he is just crazy. But the way we follow him is not. He only has flashes that the world is normal, and that the surrounding people are not part of a covenant that distorts his reality. <br /> <br /> The story doesn't matter. What matters is how Polanksi forms this thing, both in the way he is aware of the eye that only makes edges and resides in the body that is made up only of tangled flesh. The two never meet. There is a dissonance that can haunt me for the next 30 years. She's the idea inside and out with no sides? any one except a redhead wig. <br /> <br /> I know of no one else who can do this, this sketch that remains a sketch, this horror that stays natural. <br /> <br /> To know the Genius of this, you must know one of the greatest films ever made; "Behind Pane." The genius of that movie is the post-noir idea that the camera forms the world; that the viewer creates the story. What Roman does, take this movie and turn it inside. In the rear window was the idea that the screen (Jimmy Stewart) was the anchor and everything was fiction, woven as we looked. Here, the screen apartment apartment is the movie maker. We know this. We know that everything we see is true because he is the narrator. We know this is where bodies move identity, move those times, cause plasticity. We know that the narrator will kill us. We know that the narrator will leave us in an eternal abomination, on the edge he attributes, but never show us and can imagine. <br /> <br /> Ted's Evaluation - 4 of 3: Every role player needs to experience it.
