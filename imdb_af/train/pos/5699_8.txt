One of the most disturbing and tragic periods in American history has begun. The members of the Summer of Love culture, at the end of the seventies and early seventies, eventually became an old instrument for love beads and all night parties and developed back into the mainstream, whatever it meant. For those who cannot grow their youthful and sometimes irrational exuberance, they were the Wonderland culture. A love for drugs and a sense of justice coupled with a deviation for authority, values ​​and "establishment" is the world that captures the film. <br /> <br /> The sixties were a time of revolution and violent change that tore the American "house" apart. After the battles were over, we all had to deal with the aftermath of the massacre. The characters in the Wonderland house are icons of the misfits of the Seventies; share biker, share hippie, share rogue, all wiped out. No ideology to express, just a feeling of dissatisfaction with everything and commitment to nothing. Ron, Billy and David look like a kind of Robin Hoods with dope. They speak of love and behavior violently; they take from the rich and sell to the wrong people; they steal from everyone. <br /> <br /> Holmes and the company are the result of a strange clash of anti-matter like sex, and drugs and rock & roll, when lab technicians get bored and move. <br /> <br /> The film is skillful and fitting and takes the frenetic world of drug addicts into their element. The fact that Holmes is a pornstar is almost irrelevant. That story was told in "Boogie Nights". It is a story of a transitional and forgetful era.
