One of the most timely and engaging documentaries you'll ever watch. While the story takes place in the Venezuelan capital of Caracas, it offers an intimate look at political dynamics, which dominates the entire western hemisphere. While essentially another chapter in the story of the "American-backed Latin American coup", this movie chronicles in real-time, what can happen when the poorest people are armed with unity, political skill and courage! <br /> <br /> The political insights that this film offers are invaluable. One gets clear examples from the private media, as a formidable force for mass deception and propaganda. We see the poor people of Caracas struggling with the cruel realities of "American politics". One gets a clear sense of impending punishment, if the people do not offend the blatant tyranny, suddenly and illegally, by the conspirators. We also see the arrogance and fascism of the CIA, private media, plutocrats and generals, who conspired to bring Venezuela back under Washington's domination. Although pres. Hugo Chavez has led many people, the people of Caracas are forced to act without him, after Chavez has been abducted with intimidated apostates. Their reaction is the highlight of the film. If you are looking for an excellent portrait of what the American government, Hugo Chavez, and revolutionary Venezuela are, this film is it!
