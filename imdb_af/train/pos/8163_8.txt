Corbin Bernsen gives a tremendously intense and resounding performance as dr. Alan Feinstone, a rich and successful Beverly Hills dentist obsessed with perfection. When he discovers that his lovely blonde baby trophy wife has been cheating on him and the IRS begins to mislead him about tax problems, Feinstone breaks under pressure and goes around the corner. Director Brian Yuzna, who works from a pretty dark, greasy and demented script by Stuart Gordon, Dennis Paoli and Charles Finch, exposes the sick neurosis and psychosis that bumps under the squeaky, clean, manipulated surface of respected rich America with bitterly malicious pleasure . In addition, Yuzna further decorates the creepy with a vicious, twisted sense of pitch-black gallows. Bernsen seems positive as Dr. Feinstone; he expertly projects a truly moving underlying cripple that is right under Feinstone's deceptively calm and insured veneer. The supporting film is also excellent: Linda Hoffman as Feinstone's bitchy, treacherous wife Brooke, Earl Boen as a smart, encouraging IRS agent, Marvin Goldblum, Molly Hagan as festive assistant Jessica, Patty Toy as perky assistant, Karen, Jan Hoag as pious office manager Candy, Virginya Keehne as sweet, gawky teen Sarah, Ken Foree as thorough, no-nonsense Detective Gibbs, Tony Noakes as Gibbs's equally messy partner. Detective Sunshine, Michael Stadvec as wife stud muffin pool maker Matt and Mark Ruffalo as on the making sleaze ball Steve Landers. The first-class make-up f / x is every bit as stingy, coarse and unsettling as it should be. Sophisticated cinematography by Levie Isaaks boasts many crazy tilted camera angles and some nice zoom-in close-ups. Alan Howarth's hustle and bustle score also hits the meat-crawling spot. An enjoyable twisted spoil.
