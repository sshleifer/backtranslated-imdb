I like movies that do not offer the typical "happy ending", and that is my main reason for my taste of this movie. Alice Marano (Danes) and her best friend Darlene (Beckinsale) are arrested in Thailand for drug smuggling after a tip the Thai authorities have phoned anonymously. The film does a great job of guessing viewers or (or whatever) of the girls are involved, and Bill Pullman is perfect as their messy lawyer. Jacqueline Kim turns in a tremendous performance as his more friendly, big wife, Yon, who is also a lawyer. I wish the girls were abused more in jail, as another commentator suggested, as I heard that Thai prisons could be pretty cruel. However, where this movie grabs me, it's the end. Alice submits herself to a total of 96 years in total so that Darlene can be forgiven, and we (the viewers) realize they are both innocent. Any movie that fights my expectation of the end wins extra points, and this well-intentioned drama definitely deserves.
