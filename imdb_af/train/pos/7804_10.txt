I keep this movie over and over and over. I have to look at it at least once a week. I'm from Africa and look at that movie that taught me about things I didn't even know about Africa. Denzel's movies are all full of lessons for people living. I wish he was my own brother. I also saw and loved your Masala Mississipi. What an exciting situation. When Denzel tried to hook his brother to work, I remember my teenage years when my brother was always angry with me to keep me busy. My brother always cares about my old father and he wants to see me in the same way. By the way, where does Denzel get the African accent in the Cry Freedom movie? I first saw the movie in Africa and I didn't know then that Denzel was American until I moved here.
