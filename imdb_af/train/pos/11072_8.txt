It's all very simple. Jake goes to prison and spends five years with the cow and chess masters. they are compassionate about his history of loss and failure, and utter misery he lives because he believes in his mastery of small tricks and control of the rules of small crooks. they decide to give Jake the ultimate freedom: of his inner fears, of what he believes he is. For that they take him on a journey, abandoning all the fear, all the pride, all the hope, to be born again as true master of his will. <br /> <br /> It's a clever movie about the journey of relief, about the infinite gambles and games we do with and within ourselves. 10/10, no doubt.
