I'm not an ordinary fan on this site, but to see how this movie is underestimated, I try to write comments and comments on them. I watched this movie, maybe because Cat is everything I wish I could be. . It's a very underrated movie, I don't have arguments here, I usually enjoy and talk little about it. Going to the movie is fun, and I really enjoyed the 1h53 I stayed in the dark room. A must be seen over and over until the delight fades. Let us not try to be so critical about it. thanks for reading.
