I was always a big fan of this movie. First, you saw the movie, the play is great and helps move this movie very well. Cybill Shepherd gave good reviews for her, and they were well deserved. The beginning of this movie begins in the past when Corinne Jeffries (Cybill) whose image-perfect marriage comes to a halt when her husband Louie dies unexpectedly. Luckily, Louse gets a second chance at life when he agrees to return as the newborn Alex Finch (Robert Downey, JR). Alex continues to forget his new life to forget his past life while Corinne tries to relieve her. But fate crosses Alex's path 23 years later when he meets Corinne's daughter Miranda (Mary Stuart Masterson) and is suddenly flooded with a wealth of unwanted memories (that's where fun begins and embarrasses.) The music is wonderful and the scenes are heartfelt and very cute. You won't be disappointed if you give it a chance. Chances are you like it. Very funny and sweet!
