It may just be the most nostalgic journey back in time and through time until childhood begins to travel to memories back and forth, back and forth, up and down and around. The boy Jimmy, H.R. Puffinstuff, Dr.Blinky, Cling & Clang, Ludicrous Lion, and even the evil Witchie Poo also through and through. The latter day's inspiration from Lidsville, "The Brady Kids Saturday morning Trailer Special" Sigmund & the Sea Samples, and Land of the Lost as well as the New, is what bridged this show, as well as The Donny & Marie Show, Die Brady Bunch Variety Hour has Brady Bunch Hour and even the Paul Lynde Halloween Special. Perhaps there are other things between and Beyond the Buck goes on and on and beyond expectations and unexpected ties. Now as we are updated in March '06, we know Jack Wild's gone and now it makes it even more symbolic for us to become truly nostalgic. Included in August of '06 both as Jack Wild guests stars like himself on Sigmund and The Sea Monsters, as well as when a last episode HRPuffinstuff also does and the other recalls nostalgic trips of all the Syd & Marty Kroft characters, as well as the HRPuffinstuff Goodtime Club; The Donny and Marie Show; The Brady Bunch Variety Hour aka The Brady Bunch Hour; etc. Truth, Stephen "Steve" G.
