My brothers and sisters and I stumbled upon the champions when our local station sent out a summer in the 1970s. We absolutely worshiped it. There was something so exotic and secretive about it, especially compared to the usual American re-runs (Petticoat Junction, Green Acres ... you get the idea). It had a similar feel to The Avengers (not too much of a surprise as it was also British and in the spy / adventure genre). <br /> <br /> I'd love to see it again - hopefully stop. I mentioned this show to others and no one ever heard of it, so I started wondering if I thought about my whole existence. But the wonder the web has allowed me to find out about this. Hopefully it will find a new generation of fans.
