It's a very, very early Bugs Bunny cartoon. As a result, the character is still in a transitional period - he is not as prolonged as he was later and his voice is not quite right. In addition, the chemistry between Elmer and Bugs is a bit unusual. Elmer is a poor juice that buys Bugs from a pet shop. There is no gun or desire to smear his bunny! Still, it's still a very enjoyable movie. The early Bugs were definitely more sassy and cruel than its later incarnations. In later movies he messed up Elmer, Yosimite Sam and others because they started it - they messed with the hurry. But in this movie he is much more like the late 30's and early 40's Daffy Duck - a push that just irritates other people! A true "anarchic" instead of the hero of later cartoons. While it's not among the best Bug Bunny cartoons, it's definitely fun to watch and it's interesting to see how much he has changed over the years.
