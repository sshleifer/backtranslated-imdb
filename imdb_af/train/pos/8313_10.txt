First of all, I think the comments below are unworthy of a site like this. Of course you have no taste and do not respect the taste of others. Not giving you a history lesson, but I think it should be done. Black actors out there are just, if not more, successful than others. If you're not part of the "Black" race, you can't understand the quality, creativity and vibrancy of old movies like "Sparkle" and "Mahogany" and "Cooley High". Unfortunately, since you are not black, you do not have the pleasure of feeling what we feel when we look at this classic. Therefore, you should keep your freaking mouth and just stick to your non-dance run. Thank you.
