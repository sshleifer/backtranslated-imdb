Jake's Closet has the emotional power of Kramer vs. Kramer combined with the imagination of Pan's Labyrinth. Even the beginning special effect looks like a nod to Pan's Labyrinth. But this is a story taking place in modern times, not in a war sixty years ago, and so it has even more resonance today. Jake's Closet is about a boy, an only child, almost alone on summer vacation, dealing with his family falling apart. It's a horror movie like The Others and The Sixth Sense, a horror movie for the thinking person. If you're looking for a treasure movie, it won't be your cup of tea, but if you're looking for a story that both touches and saves on good acting, it's the movie for you. At the show I saw, I swear there was one moment where the whole audience shouted. I strongly recommend catching this movie.
