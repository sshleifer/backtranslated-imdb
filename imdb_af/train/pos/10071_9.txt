When tradition dictates that an artist has to transfer his great skills and magic to an heir, the aging and proud street achiever, known as everyone "The King of Masks", desperately desires a young student to adopt and cultivate. <br /> <br /> His warmth and humanity find him paying a few bucks for a small person displaced by China's devastating natural disasters, in this case, abundant floods in the 1930s. <br /> <br /> He takes his new, 7-year-old companion, on his straw, to live with his valued and beautiful monkey, General, just to discover that the child is a sickle. <br /> <br /> His life is immediately transformed, because the love he feels for this little slave is entangled in the astonishing tradition that requires him to spend his art on only a young man. <br /> <br /> There are many stories in this one ... Many people are touched, and the culture of China opens up to our Western eyes to observe. Thousands of heritage cook off in a drama drama, and little will leave this DVD with a dry eye. <br /> <br /> The technical transfer itself is not that good, because I found the sound levels everywhere the meter, and could actually see the video transmission lines in several parts of the movie. Highly recommended :-) 9/10 stars.
