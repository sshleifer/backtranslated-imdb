Plato's run is an entertaining b-movie with Gary Busey. It's a pretty unknown movie, so I saw it with a motorcycle. I thought it looked nice. I was right. Gary Busey plays Plato Smith a tough mercenary estimated for the murder. of a powerful Cuban crime Lord, now on the road, Plato must survive long enough to prove his innocence with the help of his friends, played by Steve Bauer (scarface) and action star Jeff Speaksman (the expert). What I liked about Plato's run was the way the movie never got boring, but it was still good, but the action was nice to watch and the action was also very nice, especially the climax. Gary Busey is a good hero ironic as he usually plays the bad guy and Steve Bauer is good as Plato's sidekick, even Jeff Speaksman makes a good performance and he can't do well to finish it. Plato's run is a pleasant effort of now photos and I give it 7 out of 10
