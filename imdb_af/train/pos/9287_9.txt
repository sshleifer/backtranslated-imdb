When caught, they are written in an area where the game remains inside the forehead, but out of sight. The prisoners plead to be released, but rules are rules. <br /> <br /> Given the pedigree of his director, Jafar Panahi, it was disarmed to discover that Offside is a comedy, and often a hilarious one. In 1997, The Mirror, Panahi, presents two versions of Iranian girl and lets the audience wonder which one is "really". In 2000, The Circle walked several Iranian women out of the system; their transgressions are different, but they all end up in the same tragic place. <br /> <br /> But now thinking about Offside, it's hard to imagine it as something other than a comedy, because the situation it offers is so naturally ridiculous. As the women ask to know why they can't watch the soccer match and their prisoners are struggling to answer, the only possible outcome is comedy. <br /> <br /> What matters most is that young women are not portrayed. as activists attacking the system. They are just soccer fans and patriots, and despite being unfairly treated, they never lose their focus on the game and the historic victory that is within their country's grasp.
