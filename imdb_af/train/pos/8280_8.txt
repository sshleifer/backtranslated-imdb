George and Kim travel with their young son Miles to a remote cabin in New York, where their car hits a deer and hits a ditch. But there seems to be a mere incident of accident, the start of a terrifying journey where myth becomes reality and a meat-eating spirit, half-man and half-man Wendigo, a small town. 'Wendigo' by Larry Fessenden is an exciting horror movie that is often in a dreary family drama. The acting is great, the characters are well developed and there is a bit of cold moments. The subtle gloss of Wendigo is handled effectively and it is never clear what is real and what is imagined, or even if the story is entirely in Miles's head. In general. , "Wendigo" is my first contact with Larry Fessenden's work and will definitely not be the last. Give this movie a chance if you don't mind watching something unconventional.
