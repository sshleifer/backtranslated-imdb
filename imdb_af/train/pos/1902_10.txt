Let's start with that theme song sung by Christopher Cross. The song is, "If you're caught between the moon and the New York City." It's a good theme and song even after all these years, it never gets tired. It's also a good song about New York City. Anyway, the big Dudley Moore CBE stars as a spoiled drunk millionaire involved in Jill Eikenberry's character in the movie. Jill would later stare at LA Law. In any case, he is served by his wonderful British butler, Sir John Gielgud OM, who won an Oscar for his acting as the best supporting actor. Arthur falls in love with Liza Minnelli's character perfectly in this movie, besides her performance in her Oscar-winning role in Cabaret. No, Liza can't sing. She plays a dinner waitress. Anyway, I love Geraldine Fitzgerald as the family's Bach matriarch who decides the family's fortune. Anyway, she's fantastic and had to get an academic awards nomination for the best supporting actress. Barney Martin, known as Jerry's father at Seinfeld, plays Liza's father. He is also wonderful. The movie was well written, performed and delivered to the audience who wanted more of it.
