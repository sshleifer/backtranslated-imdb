It's the first movie I've seen of John Singleton and he's a pretty good director. The movie starts with a bunch of incoming warriors and shows what happens to several of them. Omar Epps plays a tracker with a partial scholarship and has a hard time keeping up with his work. He is friends with Ice Cube and creatures who meet Tyra Banks. Kristy Swanson is a rich girl who is raped date and becomes friends with Jennifer Connelly, who is a lesbian and is not sure which way to go. Michael Rapaport is a kid from Idaho who falls into a group of Neo-Nazis and their leader is Cole Hauser. These are the three main characters and Laurence Fishburne is a political science professor who tries to help them. This is a good movie and it is a pity that the studio had to make several clips to the movie.
