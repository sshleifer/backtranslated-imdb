Okay, here's what I think about Jack Frost. I watched the morphing box for the VHS band and I thought to myself, it looks interesting. I rent it and I take it home. Boy, I was right, it's interesting. They put serial killer spirits into dreams, bodies and every day machines. But it must be the most unique place to place the spirit of a serial killer. Inside the body of a snowman. I like all the friendly snowman photos that make the landscape, the potholes, the snowball, and so on. Eat, etc. I love the actor Jack played, he made a murder pleasure, not really seen since FREDDY KRUGGER. That's right, I said. FREDDY KRUGGER. This is the level of "cool". I wish some doll effects were better, the mouth movements could be better matched. But I get it to a small budget. The movie does a good job, there are some good one liners and scared to make any hardcore horror fan. All in all, a good story, good effects, good dialogue and a good role. I give JACK FROST ... 9 stars
