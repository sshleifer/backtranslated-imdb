I thought the movie might be a little more complex, in a psychological sense, but the action and voice work was on top of that. The animation was heavy CG in many scenes, but very good at it. This is one of the Batman Returns / Forever-type movies, including romance and Wayne's conflicts and motives for dating. 007 fans will love it, and so will the females, the great theme song! Wayne is very well portrayed in this movie, and the Penquin was back to his true form, no mutant genes in him this time! I liked the fact that Robin was not used too much, Tim Drake was just a good computer nerd, a bit of an Indigo child or mind of the future. <br /> <br /> The supporting role-play was made up of a few soap opera stars, decent talents and characters drawn to look like the voice actors. Kelly Ripa was hilarious in this movie. <br /> <br /> I rate it under Phantasm, Return of the Joker, and Batman vs. Dracula, but love the smarter script better than I enjoyed Subzero. 10/07
