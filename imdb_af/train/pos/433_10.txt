It's one of those rare movies, it's beautiful and compelling, dignified and peculiar, a real gift. I consider it a prerequisite for any trip to Italy, or any holiday, as it reminds you to open yourself up to a broader experience (yup, find the magic). I especially liked Josie Lawrence, like Lottie Wilkins, but every head and support actor is flawless in this movie. Further costumes, when drawn on fashion and costumes, have been exceptionally well done. I just wish they would release it on DVD, because I was carrying my tape version! <br /> <br /> Worth your time, make sure you see it without interruptions.
