OK. I'm biased. I live near Shrewsbury in England, where this wonderful movie was filmed. It still looks the same. I remember their filming here alive, and the false snow on the streets for days to end. Often when I walk through Shrewsbury, I see a street or house and it will remind me of this movie. <br /> <br /> George C. Scott's Scrooge is a more realistic character than many of the other screen versions. His physical appearance is not the typical misery. Scott's is great and impressive. A man who finds himself smaller than himself is inferior. <br /> <br /> We all know the story and the quotes. The book is one of the most cherished works in the English language. And I do not believe there are many cynics who would say that people are unable to change and give salvation. This movie version depicts it all beautifully. George C. Scott may be American, but he plays part of the English woes with wonderful skills. <br /> <br /> I love this movie. If you did not see this version, I would strongly urge you to do so. It's usually available for a very small amount of money ... or are you in common?
