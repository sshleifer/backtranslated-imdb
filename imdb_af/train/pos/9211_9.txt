Action, horror, science-scientist, exploitation director Fred Olen Ray shows he has a talent as a director. Character actor William Smith is one of the best tough / bad guys in the industry. He treats the viewer with the best performance of his career. As for Randy Travis, he gives his best Lee Van Cleef impression. He's not bad in the movie. Smith and Travis make the movie. As for the rest of the cast, none of them really stand out. Ray had a good job managing this movie, Smith and Travis were good. I will give these B-Westerns a seven to a scale of one to ten (ten best).
