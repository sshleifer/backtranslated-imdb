I already loved "How the Grinch Stolen Christmas" was released and I'm still fond of it, 5 years later. Still many people disagree with my opinion and this movie never really received much love when it came out. <br /> <br /> Sure, the movie is top and bottom, but at the same is also the reason why this movie is so charming and fun to watch. All the sets, costumes and characters are done perfectly over-the-top in a fun way, without ever getting ridiculous. It's a visually stunning movie to watch. It's a camping movie at its best! Director Ron Howard is very surprised with this fun Christmas movie. <br /> <br /> The main reason why the movie works and why it's so nice to watch is Jim Carrey as the Grinch. He really wears the film with his good and fun role. He is of course helped by the convincing makeup, which also received an Oscar award. Of course, if you're a Jim Carrey hater, don't even look at this movie. This movie is really his movie and he makes it all work and so much fun to watch. Other fun and memorable roles are played by Jeffrey Tambor, Clint Howard and Josh Ryan Evans as the young Grinch. <br /> <br /> The movie has a good morale, but it's a little nice to me. Maybe it's because I'm Dutch and we don't really celebrate Christmas that is as enthusiastic and big as in the United States or England. For me the movie was just fun and entertaining and the morale just left me cold to be honest. <br /> <br /> James Horner's musical score is good and fun, even if it's your average every day Horner stuff, It still works perfectly for the movie and helps to make the stage work. <br /> <br /> Perfect Christmas entertainment. <br /> <br /> 8/10
