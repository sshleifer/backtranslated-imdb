I remember seeing this movie with my friends when we were 4 years old, but the strange thing is that I never looked at it. The other day I had babysitting and my cousin never saw all the dogs in heaven, so we both rented movies and watched them together today and he really loved these movies. So many memories looked at this movie again and I have to admit that I even cried a little. I'm 22 years old and the end still comes to me. All dogs going to heaven are one of the most beautiful animated movies and I'm honestly shocked by this 5.8 score, I thought this movie would bring good memories to others too. I admit that the animation was a bit typical, but the story is just as charming and fun. Charlie is a gambling dog murdered by another gambling dog, Carface. But when Charlie wants to take revenge, he comes back to Earth with a clock that can't stop, or it's the end of his life. When he and his best friend Itchy look for and spy on Carface, they find out how Carface gets all his money, he has a small orphan talking to animals and finding out who will win the races. Charlie takes the girl, Ann-Marie, and makes false promises to get the money. But he ends up learning that maybe he should put Ann-Marie in front of himself when Carface returns with a vengeance. <br /> <br /> All dogs going to heaven are the perfect family movie, not Disney, but it's a great family movie to watch. Not to mention that it's just as cute and touchy. I know it's ridiculous and some people call me crazy, but this movie for me when I was a kid made me believe that dogs have souls. How can they not? They just love it, and I think I'm going to cry again. But anyway, I would only recommend this movie to anyone, it's a fun movie to watch. <br /> <br /> 7/10
