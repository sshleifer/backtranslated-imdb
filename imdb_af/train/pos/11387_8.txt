An American in Paris is a wonderful musical about an American painter who lives in Paris for inspiration. He meets a rich woman who admires his paintings on the street and she believes she can make his work even more popular to the public, eg. in a museum. Golden Globe nominated Gene Kelly as artist Jerry Mulligan is perfect at both singing and especially dancing. He also meets head girl Lise Bouvier (Leslie Caron) who is engaged to his best friend. He can't help his feelings for this girl even after finding out who she is involved with. Filled with beautiful romance and wonderful song and dance, this is a very good music movie. It can drag slightly with its dancing dream sequence, ie the American in Paris ballet, but there is a good happy ending. It won the Oscars for Best Art Direction Set Decoration, Best Cinema, Best Costume Design, Best Music, Musical Picture Award, Best Writing, Story and Screenplay and Best Picture. It was nominated for Best Director for Vincente Minnelli and Best. Movie Editing, the BAFTA for Best Film of any Source was named, and won the Golden Globe for Best Film - Music / Comedy. It was named best director of Vincente Millenni (Liza's father). Gene Kelly was number 66 at The 100 Movie Stars, and he was number 15 at 100 years, 100 stars - Men, "I Got Rhythm" was number 32 at 100 years, 100 Songs, the movie was number 9 at 100 Years of Musicals , it was number 39 on 100 years, 100 passions, it was number 68 on 100 years, 100 films, and it was number 58 on the 100 largest musical instruments.
