OK, this movie starts out like a cute movie and doesn't get any better at the movie. The script is full of 'cheese' and 'fluff' and the role is not well-aimed. For the first half of the movie, the girl grumbled on my nerves. I don't think it's one of her best acting works. The only reason I bought the movie is because it was for sale and Ellen Burstyn had it in it. She's great, but it's not one of her best acting games either. The story is based on real events and it helps the movie. Actually, I didn't even help the movie and I was disgusting when I saw the silence of the balloon traveling. I mean. It gets where it's supposed to go with it! But everything is forgiven by the time it reaches it, and the story comes to an end. If it doesn't bring a tear to your eye, nothing will! It is cheesy and predictable, but also makes you feel good about the world.
