I love the movies and the comics, the comics are different from the movie, but I still will give it: 10 out of 10. It was wonderful. If the movies become more fantastic. I'll have her babies. And I'm a woman. Read the comics you won't regret. Yes in this movie since Brian P., the artist for her is dead, we don't get nearly as good a work of art. I mean seriously, don't make me wrong, these people did well, but different versions for different people. Different strips for different people like the saying goes. Anyone who doesn't go bonkers over her is insane, or doesn't like women, or you just know crazy plan. If I can count on my fingers how in love and how many times I have read the comics, I will surely run out of fingers, but hey, there are always toes.
