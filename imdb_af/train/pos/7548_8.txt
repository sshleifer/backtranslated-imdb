Short but long enough, Cat Soup is a very wild journey to watch. One day I just searched for and found my on-demand list through the anime section and decided to see it. I spent all the time with my jaw agape. All the time I was either unaware of the thought, or had a brief one shouting: "TURN IT OFF !!!". But I didn't. And actually I'm glad I did. <br /> <br /> The animation is stunning. Very artistic, strange and dark. I personally loved it for the wonderful animation, but the seemingly incomplete story for that is also compelling to me. <br /> <br /> A young boy - well, cat - is looking for his sister's soul. In the first part she is lying in bed, and is paid quickly by a visit to some kind of grim reaper. Her soul is divided in half. One is regained by the cat boy, while the other half is lost. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is a little lost to me. I expect them to go back, and their world is ... maybe falling apart? Perhaps her absence of soul is the answer to this, because the rest of the film contains different stages of the world. First, there is a great flood, and then it turns into a dark desert, and then everything freezes (thanks to what God or destiny is, as you will see). Then I believe they find the sister's soul in the form of an orange flower. Then the whole world disappears. Haha, it didn't quite get it, but it sends my spine alternately every time. <br /> <br /> Despite the seemingly random scenes, I'm sure there's a deeper message behind it if you look at it and do some research. Personally, I love trippy things like this, and would love to spend time doing it just to understand it. But for some it is probably not their cup of tea. It comes out as very disturbing, so if you keep going straight ahead, it's not a movie for you. However, if you have an open mind, I strongly recommend this movie.
