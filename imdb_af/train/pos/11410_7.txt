EDMUND LOWE (who reminds me a bit of Warren William) likes to throw an interesting little puzzle moving fast, and just runs a little over an hour. <br /> <br /> Douglas Walton plays the unfortunate jockey that appears to be on his own demise (hypnotism, anyone?), and the suspects include a good number of the supporting cast - all of Virginia Bruce, Kent Smith , Frieda Inescourt, Gene Lockhart, Jessie Ralph, Benita Hume, Rosalind Ivan and HB Warner. As an added bonus, there is Nat Pendleton as a fool detective - and also gets a load of that art deco decoration for the fancy interiors of a rich home. Must have been a set used in many subsequent films. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the riddle is not so complicated that anyone can follow the plot with reasonable assurance that he is not too baffled. It's all suddenly apparent to detective Philo Vance - and then he has a final confrontation with the killer who gives the film a nasty five-minute unmotivated tension. <br /> <br /> It's done well and beyond the time in an entertaining way. .
