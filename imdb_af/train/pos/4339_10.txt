It's one of the best movies I've ever seen. I feel very touched by the theme the film intends to convey. One sentence that comes to my mind is that "history is repeated". Life is what it has shown in the movie: when people are young, they do not seem to understand their parents, their own wife; people have every excuse not to let their children share their favorite time; people should always work hard to support the whole family, but are only responsible for neglecting the subtle feel of their friends; people always change their perspectives at different stages of their lives; people can always be forgiven if their hearts are full of love for their loved ones; nothing is more important than the blood relationship that people in this world share, and one is never too late to talk to their people about what they feel at the bottom of their hearts to get a better understanding, so when life has to To end, people should not be sorry or sorry, as they have kept their words and there is always hope --- a new life. The actors and actresses are fantastic. They understood the director's intention perfectly. The film's charm lies in me, the effect of bringing an experienced and wonderful fusion of cheers and tears to the audience.
