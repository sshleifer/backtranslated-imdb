This movie leaves the intellectual minds and tries to analyze the story. I also can't understand why people will be watching this movie. <br /> <br /> If you are a Jerry Bruckheimer fan, this movie may not be suitable for you. <br /> <br /> This movie offers a high degree of realism. The actors and actresses' performance is exploration. Not fake, of course. <br /> <br /> No special sound effects, such special side effects. <br /> <br /> The camera work is excellent, the music is o so good. I can't wait to get the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> It makes your body disappear, like Constant Garderner. It has directly raw talent, certainly not a follower.
