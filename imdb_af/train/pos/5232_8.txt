This movie is a journey through the mind of a scriptwriter captured in his own paradoxical philosophy. He examines the ever-illusory question of "who am I" and "what am I?" It is a courageous and thought-provoking company. There is a shipload of beautiful images, dream-inspired, Escher-like paradoxes reminiscent of the signature itself, or rather, the removal of self. More and more we are following the author in his anxiety about what to say and what to film, we see him with his wife who left for Peru, let him take care of their baby, a task he does with less attention until He is so absorbed in his dilemma that he no longer looks at the child. His wife comes back and makes a scene, destroys his notes and helps him to go over the last three teams until he wipes himself. Interspersed with eye-pleasing and I-destructive images, the story is mainly philosophical. It's about the veils of Maya, the world of illusion. The paradox of the movie, however, is that it speaks a lot and thinks to prove that thinking should stop. During the more than two hours of challenging beauty and fast-paced philosophy, the film left me silent or a shorter movie. If that was the purpose of the author, he did it well.
