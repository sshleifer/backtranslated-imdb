If you're in the mood for fun ... and just want to relax and enjoy ... prayed Miyan Chote Miyan is one of the movies to watch. Amitabh started very well ... but that's Govinda stealing the show from his hands. Great timing for and good dialogue. It's inspired by Bad boys ... but it has Indian Masala. .. people think it can be confusing and stupid ... but the fact that David Dhavan directs and Govinda is acting ... should not ask questions .... other recommended movies in the same genre (David Dhavan / Govinda combo) ... is Shola Aur Shabnam, Aankhen, Raja Babu, Saajan Chale Sasural, Deewana Mastana, Collie no. 1, Jodi no. 1, Hero no.1, Haseena Manjayegi, Ek Aur Ek Gyarah.
