I wonder what audiences of the day thought when I first laid Walter Jack Palance (Blackie). Surely he looks like no one else of the time, that skull-like face, nostrils and elongated body - even now he remains a disturbing presence. And what could be more appropriate than his appearance from those beautiful New Orleans slums that seem to be losing Blackie to the city. I'm sorry he didn't have any more scenes. <br /> <br /> The movie itself is very skillfully compiled ?? The black humor of the mortuary, the Widmark-Douglas interaction, the un-touristy places, the battles among officials, are all blown into a tough realistic thriller with a threat as opposed to others of the time. Even Widmark's inland scenes that a woman (Bel Geddes) places on the marquee do not manage to be disruptive. Director Kazan certainly shows his ability to brighten a studio (Fox) product, no matter how he felt about the commercial aspect. <br /> <br /> Widmark has a solid key function as the public health officer. But my money is on the only one zero Mostel. Was there ever a sweeter performer who could be harder or pushed more than the bulky valman (eg The Enforcer, 1950). This scene at Mostel, where Palance repented with Mostel's villainous wife (Liswood), is a jewel of wonderful submission, as Mostel tries to pacify everybody like a berserk. He lost so many years after the blacklist. (I wonder if it was the perfect Kazan who called him.) <br /> <br /> But it's not just the professionals who add color. The locals add both character and authenticity, especially the two Asian guys questioned by the police. That whole scene had an improvised air, as if Kazan recognized their potential and made a fine little scene on the spot. Also that colorful rental hall with all the deck hands is pure inspiration. And how about those flea coffee shops that run me to the nearest Denny's. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the movie is still a well-advanced, sounding thriller with an apocalyptic air that is strangely oblique to today's mega heat.
