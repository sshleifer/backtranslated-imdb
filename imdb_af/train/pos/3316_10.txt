Bette Midler is indescribable in this concert. She gives her every time she is on stage. Whether we're laughing at her jokes and cheating or watching our eyes on the trunks of one of her awesome ballads, Bette Midler moves her audience. If you can't see it (which is the best way to see Bette) then this is the next best thing. An interesting thing to look at is how amazing her voice has changed and aging over the years, but never lost its power. Her more "vocal correct" version of "Stay With Me" never loses anything in the spirit of THE ROSE or DIVINE MADNESS. Here it is just more pure and as hearty as ever. I will treasure this concert for a very long time.
