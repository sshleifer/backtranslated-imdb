Along with the "King of the Rocket Men", it was repeated on BBC TV early in the eighties. If I load a time capsule of this period, these ranges will definitely go in as well. <br /> <br /> For the first time, anyone who views it will think it's stupid, but it's one of the best examples of "magazines". Don Del Oro will make you laugh. (When I was little, my nickname was Mr Dustbin's head) and it was funny when he was shot. He says, "Your dots can't hurt me" then he bumps back, apparently less than happy. I also like the way he ended up with Sebastian in the first episode. <br /> <br /> I watched it again because I had good memories of it from years back, there are good stunts and good music, it has the ingredients You also expect water, rockslides, runaway carts. Apart from the first episode (with Ralph Faulkner), the swordplay wasn't as good as I remembered, and yes, it contains the inevitable flashback section! It gets 8 out of 10 because it still suffers from slow pace, stuffing and other tricks. If you are interested in these magazines, I recommend the book by William Witney, "In a door, a fight, a door, a blow," although there is only a small entry on this series.
