A tragic wonderful movie ... brings us to a Japan that no longer exists. In spite of Hollywood's technical expertise, I have another (Hollywood) movie that can match the authenticity of the atmosphere in this small town along the river near the sea ... Tom Cruise's Last Samurai looks like the last installment of the Lord of The Rings is trying to capture rural Old Japan. <br /> <br /> If you like quiet but intense story lines, it's a movie you should see. It will be a refuge from hollow flashing movies, like the last 1000 blockbusters you've seen. I think this is one of Kurosawa's better stories. <br /> <br /> Even if it is a movie about geishas and brothels and the complicated rules that govern life in such institutions, it has not become a skin spot. The characters are full of depth and act with much intensity.
