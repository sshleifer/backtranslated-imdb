This is one of my all-time favorites. It's so simple and sweet - definitely a chick flick romantic comedy. I really like a movie full of good quotes and this has it ... one of my favorites is when Albert Einstein tells Ed Walters: "Do you think what I think" and Ed says: "Now, what is the chance of it to happen?! "In my opinion, a movie is great if you can see it again and get the same amount of enjoyment from it, and with this one you can !! I also really enjoyed Walter M.'s way of portraying Einstein. I think all the characters really fit in well and the story flows out nicely. There are so many times that I smile upright with the movie and quoted with my favorite lines when I see it! I would recommend this movie to anyone who has a heart and occasionally enjoys a nice romantic comedy!
