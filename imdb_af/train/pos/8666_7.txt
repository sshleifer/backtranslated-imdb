Frankie Dio (Lee VanCleef) is a sought-after gangster who enters police or illegal gambling (for reasons that seem unclear to me). Tony (Tony Lo Bianco) is a lower level buoy who visits a swimming pool hall and spends his free time at Frankie. Being in the right place at the right time, Tony is arrested with Frankie and sent to jail ... where they form a band that may not be friendly, but it will happen so far. <br /> <br /> This movie came to me under the title "Frank and Tony", which is disappointing because I see an alternative name, meaning "Mean Frank and Crazy Tony" who can sell the movie better. I suppose it's a tribute to "Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry", but what do I know? I watched it shortly after another Italian crime film, "Violent Professionals", and I have to complement the two very well say. <br /> <br /> Italians have always left behind Americans in their budgets and production values, which is a real shame on this movie. It is considered a "grindhouse" movie, which shares it unfairly with a b-movie (or worse). With a cleaner sound and picture, it could be a Hollywood hit, I suspect. I found the story very interesting, the characters (and actors) better than average and unlike "Great Professionals" the plot is pretty clear - not too many secondary characters. <br /> <br /> If you like Mafia movies or crime movies you should give this one. A movie about the gang that is actually from Italy (how much more authentic do you want?) Is as much as you can ask. Sure, it's not "The Godfather", but it's not supposed to be. It's not a drama, it's a light comedy, a heavy action friend ... like "The Hard With a Vengeance" from the bad guys point of view. Well, okay, not really. <br /> <br /> As nothing else, this film made me look at other movies by the director and lead. Movies except "Escape From New York" (where VanCleef plays "Hauk") and the usual culture films. What's more fun than discovering a lost classic?
