The traditional Western is synonymous with wide open spaces, clearcut morality, inevitable stories, the optimistic belief in a hero's ability to form his own destiny, to escape his past. These features directly reflect the American sense of self, the self-forming Dream, the pressure of boundaries and boundaries. That's why the genre is still being pointed out by opportunistic politicians. With some noble exceptions (eg Wellman, Hawks), the Western was healthy free of neurosis or true anxiety. Anthony Mann has changed everything forever and this first decay in the genre is one of the most violent, vibrant, complex, not to say exciting Westerns ever. <br /> <br /> The traditional Western depends on a hero who depicts robust health, regardless of the discomfort he had in the past, a supporter of order and justice, dominating the film, removing his barriers, restore its harmony; And an obvious villain who runs the irony ironically forces the hero into certain actions. The difference between the two is often simply delineated as being white or black hats. <br /> <br /> Mann's background was in film noir, a genre antithetical to wide open spaces and optimism. Noir was neurotically charged, focusing on the dissolution of an unstable protagonist, where morality fades, the hero so often makes the villain, trapped in an inner labyrinth of his own, a passive victim to destiny . Noir is about repeating progress, interrogating and denying ways and signs of representation, not the creation and affirmation of them. <br /> <br /> WINCHESTER 73 is fraught with noir anxiety. Noir is often considered a psychological genre, which visualizes the traumas of its main characters. Do it too, and is increasingly disturbing because starring Jimmy Stewart is great and starts his big run with tough movies with Mann and Hitchcock. In many ways, good-natured and sweet, right and trying to disrupt the natural order, he is also a nearby man who will do nothing more to achieve murderous revenge, whose relentless quest for Ethan Edwards in the SEARCHERS his inhuman perseverance, whose human instincts are being driven by this quest and whose outbursts of violence are actually frightening to testify. <br /> <br /> Like in noir, its anxiety has a psychological basis - unlike most 'healthy' heroes who killed McAdam's father (symbolically killed), and his father died before he could process completed. his pursuit of his brother is less moral revenge than an anxious protest against stubborn growth. The climate shootings are not cathedrals: McAdam stumbles back into a normal society, as he has seen only the world's worst horrors. <br /> <br /> What is most disturbing about the movie is that it is not really. about a hero or a villain, but an ominous piece of reflection driving the action. 73 starts with the gun of the title privilege, display behind a glass window, while his admirers are trapped, chopped, undifferentiated, framed and admired. Throughout the film, human power is reduced to the most arbitrary of meaning changes; Lin and Dutch mimics shoot each other because they have no guns; quest loses their moral vitality and their practitioners are close to madness; armies need help from confederate strangers to fight battles; A man is only respectful when he calls his name; Another man is revealed as a coward when he leaves his fiancee to the Indians; The gun retains its prestige, power, wholeness. <br /> <br /> It's not the revenge chart that drives the movie, but the rifle story; It cuts the film out of conventional expectations and creates an exciting, alienating, modern feel. We are so caught up in the revenge plot that, with the gun, we feel another plot completely, we feel slightly confused. <br /> <br /> This emphasis on rifle, symbol of powerful masculinity, actually provides for a criticism of that masculinity, which reveals countless extended rituals at the expense of society and order; brutal capitalist greed; Murderous Indian Traders Who Deceive both Seller and Enemy; cowards; psychotic killers; before returning to his "true" owner, a broken hero has thoroughly compromised, which has become so murderous as the murderer he is looking for. The gun is never imprinted with the name of its owner, not just because there is no fixed owner, but because there is no solid masculinity, is an insight anatomy for the traditional Western. <br /> <br /> 73 calls brilliant Western myths - Wyatt Earp, Dodge City, the Cavalry, the Civil War, the wide open west - just to undermine them. Earp has a bloated reputation that is all the name but never proves. Dodge City is no safer for outside men than anywhere else; The cavalry is inactive (Custer only lost Little Big Horn) and the bitter feud of the War seems to be irrelevant. The myth of the open west is a place for a very closed, inescapable, circular plot that traps its characters, refusing to allow them to form their fate, but to form it. <br /> <br /> The old John Ford silhouette of riders on a vast mountain is robbed, but does not mention progress here, but repetition and circularity. But for all its deconstruction, the film is also tangible in a way that few Westerners ever reach. Mann's sharp technique enters his camera in critical positions, alternating revealing distance with intense investigation, which makes the salon doors and playcards look alive and live.
