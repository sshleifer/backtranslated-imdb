While the story is sweet and the dance and singing of the film is a joy, the uniqueness of the film (and what makes it a masterpiece) is the dream sequence. It combines the supreme form of truly American music (Gershwin), the impressive beauty of French impressionist art, Kelly's exciting choreography (including his deux d'amour races, a divorce genre), with the most beautiful palette of color ever designed for the set. It was a real work of a creative genius and a great artist who fits the exciting music and the visual blast with those dances.
