Good story. Good writing. Good casting. Good acting. Good direction. Good art movement. Good photography. Good sound. Good editing. Good everything. Put it all together and you end up with good entertainment. <br /> <br /> The shame is that there aren't nearly enough movies of this caliber. We can be happy that writers / directors like John Hughes can sometimes hear their creative voices. <br /> <br /> When I see that I watch a movie for the third or fourth time and still find it profoundly satisfactory, I have to conclude that there is something about the movie.
