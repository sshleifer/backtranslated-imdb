I recommend watching this movie with your significant other if you are planning a romantic evening with him / her. The chemistry between Johnny Weissmuller and Maureen O'Sullivan like Tarzan and Jane is so steamy that it can obscure your screen. <br /> <br /> After the original movie we begin to see Tarzan and Jane adapt to the jungle and to each other. Jane's cute jungle and Tarzan's protest when Jane covers their visitors relieves them from not only being romantic but also very sexually in love. <br /> <br /> Man's imagination can speak the constant touch and love between Tarzan & Jane to portray how much Jane actually teaches Tarzan about emotional, romantic and sexual love. And Jane's student is not only embracing, but also with his previously unused sexuality. <br /> <br /> The hideout in this movie is out of the cards. In addition to Jane's two-piece sexy midriff, leg and hip costume, she also has an underwater nude swimming with Tarzan. (Although not O'Sullivan, but Olympic swimmer Josephine McKim who doubled her in this scene), Weissmuller also reveals a tremendous body and perfect pectoral in his rare loins. The ladies will be delighted when Weissmuller comes out of the water after his long struggle with the giant crocodile, and sounds like his screaming. With its wet soaked patchwork that almost falls from its hip. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that the overprotective sensors showed the adult nature of the Tarzan movies after this entry. Although the Weissmuller Tarzan movies would continue to prosper in the years to come, they would rarely approach the gender appeal of this movie.
