A sentimental story with a sentimental soundtrack. It's about a little girl (with a voice bust) who costs her green parrot Paulie. The parrot thinks and talks like a human and gives help and advice to his constant companion. <br /> <br /> The parrot is definitely the star of the movie. Sometimes uncomfortable and sometimes in depression, the bird fits the mood in a remarkable and expressive way. The synchronized voice is also very well done and within a minute or two you can actually believe that this intelligent bird exists. <br /> <br /> Early in the film, her father gave the bird a pawnbroker and the subsequent scenes told The story of Paulie's ongoing struggle over many years to reconcile with his mistress. One of the many memorable scenes is when he falls into a bad business and is encouraged to spy on people using the automated teller machines. Paulie seems to have a phenomenal memory. <br /> <br /> The end is predictable, but who wants it differently. Children will love this movie and anyone who loves a bird as a pet will swap Paulie's deception.
