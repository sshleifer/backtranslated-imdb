Hello, this little movie is especially interesting for an artist, film maker or music creator or a visual artist for: <br /> <br /> One can feel David's touch / style straight out of a short family member and explore . simplicity. <br /> <br /> You can see the rhythmic spacing of shots, pans and sound elements. <br /> <br /> Even as a simple movie, this creation is versatile. For example, there are a few sounds that have long been drained, while others (though subtle) occur, at certain points to support certain shots. <br /> <br /> One can also see several types of pans: some go up and down on a soft back road. There is a diagonal pan. Zoom also sometimes goes back and forth. <br /> <br /> Lightning and the composition / disposal of elements in space, as usual and of course, work from a pain / artist. It can even be felt in this crappy room. This is to say: One can make excellent art by the simple art of placing / viewing and composing the look. Then come the curtains of the footage: such as digonal, parallel, etc. The light breakdowns and colors, but without too much research for textures such as large productions, are also good. It is an artist's sketch of a kind ... <br /> <br /> All of these are not calculated but with inner feelings, and this feeling gives the touch / feel of David, as with any true artist .
