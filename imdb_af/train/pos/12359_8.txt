Remarkable because of his notorious explicit scene when the beautiful Maruschka Detmer takes her young lover's penis from his pants and into her mouth. Even without this moment, the film is a beautiful, slightly disturbing, passionate and blind sexy ride. Detmer is in a good performance as the partially confused, insatiable joy, wandering over her flat naked. Dressed, partially dressed and naked, she steals most of the film about love, sexual passion, philosophy and politics. For me, the last two are a bit lost and the end is confusing when her fiance is released while fellow terrorists are released, she looks uncertain about who she wants and the young lover looks more interested in his exams than anything other than his crying , beautiful of course!
