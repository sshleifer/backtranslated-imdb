The ODD COUPLE is the classic film version of Neil Simon's most famous play about a TV news writer, Felix Unger, which is an obsessive neat freak. He moves with his divorced best friend, Oscar Madison, a sports writer and full demo, to his wife. Frances throws him out of their apartment. Already divorced, Oscar takes in his best friend and regrets it from the moment he does. Neil Simon's classic comedy first came to Broadway with Art Carney playing Felix and Walter Matthau playing Oscar. Jack Lemmon takes Carney in the movie version with a memorable performance as Felix Unger. Lemmon is not only very funny in the role, but so alive that he brings an element of melancholy to the pitiful figure, Felix Unger. Matthau was happy to review his role as Oscar, a one-of-a-kind jewel of comic performance that consistently laughed throughout. This team from Lemmon and Matthau seems to be comic gold that has been visited again in nine other films. With both of these actors, who are no longer with us, the performance of this classic is more touching, but not less hilaries. Simon's play has been beautifully expanded for the screen with a silent prologue chronicle of a depressing Felix's suicide attempt. The supporting film includes Herb Edelman, John Fiedler, Larry Haines and David Sheiner as Oscar's poker cookies and Moncia Evans and Carole Shelley as the Piedgon Sisters, blind dates of Oscar and Felix. Of course, it later became an excellent TV series with Tony Randall and Jack Klugman, but there is nothing like the original. A joy from beginning to end.
