Here is an excellent Barbara Stanwyck double account on one slide. The first film - and I believe the lesser of the two - is MGM's "To Please A Lady" (1950) in which she is with Clark Gable. It is essentially a star gable with Gable as usually dominated by the screen presence. Here he plays a macho rider, who gets bad pressure from the feminist reporter Stanwyck and begins the battle of the sexes. Of course they eventually end up in each other's arms and it all comes predictable and pleasant. A little flickering of a move, but Gable and Stanwyck - two Golden Age icons - wake it up! <br /> <br /> But the real meat on this DVD is the second feature - a wonderful and rather unknown little thriller called JEOPARDY. Produced by MGM in 1953, it is a wonderful jewel of a movie that has not dated one iota! Here Stanwyck plays Barry Sullivan's wife and mother for their young son, Lee Aaker, on vacation on a deserted and remote Mexican beach when sudden tragedy occurs. A lost wooden path trapped trapped in Sullivan under a heavy arrow and guessing what? Yes, the tide comes in. With no soul in sight and he can't free himself, Stanwyck goes with the car for help. A little further away, the only help she can get apart from an unscrupulous escaped convict (Ralph Meeker) who, in exchange for his help, wants more of her than money or a change of clothes ("I'll do anything to save my husband "). Is she or she not? <br /> <br /> Meeker walks away with the picture! He turns in quite a brilliant performance! Once he gets into the movie, you just can't take your eyes off him! An actor in the smoldering Brando style, he has surprisingly never made much of his career in films. Although in 1953 he was a deadly sacrificial French troop in Stanley Kubrick's powerful WW1 drama, Paths Of Glory (1957), his former, shameful cavalry officer in the outstanding Mann / Stewart Western "Naked Spur" (1953). Fame was like Mike Hammer in Mickey Spillane's "Kiss Me Deadly" in 1955. His performances in "Jeopardy" had to do wonders for him, but he had such a career in movies. He died in 1988. <br /> <br /> Because of this edition, "Jeopardy" can now take its rightful place as a classic noir. An unforgettable, thrilling and exciting thriller thanks to good performances, stiff direction by John Sturges, the sharp Monochrome cinematography of Victor Milner and an atmospheric score by Dimitri Tiomkin. However, extras are not a big shake, except for a radio version of "Jeopardy" and trailers for both movies. <br /> <br /> This disk is also part of a Barbara Stanwyck set celebrating her centenary. Hard to believe the woman would be over 100 years old when she was still around! <br /> <br /> JEOPARDY - an MGM winner!
