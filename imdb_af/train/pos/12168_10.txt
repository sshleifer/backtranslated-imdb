"A Guy Thing" may not be classic, but it is definitely a good, funny comedy. The plot focuses on Paul (Jason Lee), who wakes up in the morning after his baccalaureus party wakes up and Becky (Julia Stiles) lies naked in his bed. Before he could find out what had happened, he removed Becky from his flat because his fiance Karen (Selma Blair) was coming. Then, as you can imagine, chaos occurs. <br /> <br /> Almost every scene in "A Guy Thing" delivers loud laughter. The funniest moments come from Paul's suggestion of what can happen if he tells Karen. Selma Blair is a truly talented comedian, and the worst thing about this movie is that she is used below. Though, it seems more funny than Stiles's character, which isn't really that interesting. Of course, not every comedy is perfect. <br /> <br /> As I said, "A Guy Thing" is not classic, but it's not bad either, 7/10.
