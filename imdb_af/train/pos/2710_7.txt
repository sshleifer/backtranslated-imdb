It's not my favorite WIP (Women in Prison), but it is one of the best-known films in the sub genre. It was produced by Roger Corman, who has already produced some WIPs at this stage. Obviously the movie is trying to play with the established formula. The movie takes place in a US prison, not in a "banana republic" like most WIP movies. I'm not sure if it was a wise step, but it is an acceptable change. Author-director Demme really does work and always digs for new ways to present a well-known scenario. In fact, he is a bit too ambitious for his own good. The filmmaker creates some surrealistic dream series that are border-like, but it's fun to see how hard he tries to put this movie above your average chick-in-chain movie. But don't worry, Demme still works within the subgenre's parameters. There is a lot of nudity and violence, which will satisfy hardcore fans. The movie is a bit slow, but it is very entertaining. The throw is good. Roberta Collins is a WIP veteran, so she doesn't need an introduction, and Barbara Steel is a joke as the wheelchair-bound mad observer. However, Pam Grier has been greatly missed.
