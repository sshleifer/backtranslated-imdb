Monty Berman and Dennis Spooner then succeeded 'The Baron', a fantasy series of three super human spies who preceded the 'The Six Million Dollar Man'. It was a favorite of mine when I was a youngster, and I still enjoy watching it. Stuart Damon and William Gaunt have an unmistakable on-screen chemistry such as Craig Stirling and Richard Barrett, while the sophisticated Alexandra Bastedo has entered her way through Sharron Macready. The late Anthony Nicholls made a wonderful Gruff Tremayne. By far the best episodes were those written by Tony Williamson, Terry Nation and Brian Clemens, while Spooner's own 'The Interrogation' compared the prisoner favorably. I'm sorry there was never a second series; the concept left so much life in it. Would Craig and Richard be competitors for Sharron's love? What if Tremayne learned about the champions' powers? Did the champions have any other abilities than we saw? We never found out.
