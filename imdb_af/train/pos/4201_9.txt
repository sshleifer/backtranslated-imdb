Pickup on South Street (1953), directed by filmmaker Samuel Fuller, features a beautiful opening that results in a double complication. Subway rider Candy (Susan Peters) clashes with pickpocket Skip McCoy (Richard Widmark dipped in the shades of Sinatra cool). She is not aware that she is carrying valuable microfilm; McCoy is not aware of this. Both are unaware of being observed by two federal agents. So the grift makes some knowledge work. Candy is double-watched (Save and police) and thus double naive; Skip, the well-known little one, is particularly unaware, dragged up by federal agents. The feds, everyone knows, are ultimately helpless. They cannot stop the "passing" of government secrets or the spread of communism.
