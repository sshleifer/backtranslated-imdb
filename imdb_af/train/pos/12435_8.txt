I was glad to see that she had black hair! I have been a fan for about 30 years and was disgusting about the two previous attempts to film the stories. <br /> <br /> I was glad the screenwriters updated the time to include a computer, it didn't "spoil it. In fact, I watched the movie twice a day, a sign that it was up to standard. This is what I do with books that I love so well. <br /> <br /> I thought all the characters were well portrayed and represented the early days of Modesty Blaise extremely well as in both the book and the cartoon. I also disagree with a comment made by a previous reviewer about the bad things that should be ugly. Did he actually read the books? <br /> <br /> I thought it was a very good movie and looking forward to persecution.
