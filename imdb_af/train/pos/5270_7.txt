This movie may be really bad, but it's fun. The bad acting and poor direction improves the film's hysteria. The twins are very funny in their Conanesque roles. If you go into this movie, expecting the first Conan or Excalibur, you will hate it. Looking at it in a good mood and accepting it as a good, dumb fun, you'll have a good time. Watch the scene where they are trying to hang the brothers, the funniest scene in the movie. I wish Mystery Science Theater 3000 would have done so !!
