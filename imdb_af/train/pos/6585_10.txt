Having seen Jeremy Brett as Sherlock Holmes, no actor would ever have had such intentions to think he could ever come to Brett's portrayal of "one of the most interesting characters in literature". Jeremy Brett IS Sherlock Holmes and I think there can be no other. Big actor Basil Rathbone is, I must admit, a short second, but is still second. One can argue that Mr. Rathbone's scripts were inferior to the absolute best productions of Mr. Brett gave me. But when all is said and done, Jeremy Brett will always be the only actor to truly become Sherlock Holmes. The book should be closed on this topic, and we, the public, have left to enjoy Mr.Brett's unique performances. <br /> <br /> Bill Rogers <br /> <br /> (sonarman65@yahoo.com)
