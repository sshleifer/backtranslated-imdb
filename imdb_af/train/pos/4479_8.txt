Since I first saw Anchors in 1945, I see many nostalgia on videotape. At age 15, it was easy for me to be drawn to the first of the great MGM Technicolor musicals. Now I'm perhaps most interested in the future careers of leading players. Although Sinatra did some insignificant films shortly after his rise to his Dorsey days, it was his first major movie appearance. As another viewer noticed, it almost looks like a warm-up for On the Town. Sinatra might have worked hard, but his dance with Kelly is credible, and he'll do better in their next games. However, when he sees his body, it's easy to see why he is carousing like a string bean. Who would have thought that he would win an academy acting actor in a decade and would play many roles as a hard detective or leader in battle. Although Gene Kelly's personality and dance dominated the movie, his overwhelming performance did not suggest that he would become a major creative force, almost the iconic figure for MGM musicals, where he complemented a style of dance to that of Fred. Astaire developed. Finally, it was funny to see facial Dean Stockwell and remember that he would later play a "thrill" murderer in Compulsion, based on the Leopold-Loeb murder of the 1920s. An additional note: One judge praised Betty Garrett's performance as Sinatra's love interest. She later played against him in On the Town, but Pamela Britton was in this movie.
