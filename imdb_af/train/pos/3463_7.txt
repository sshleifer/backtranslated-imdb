I'm a big Beatles fan. My favorite Beatle is Paul and my least favorite is John. I already had some knowledge of the Beatles music and the truth behind the break, as well as things like John Lennon's family and Paul's band Wings. I was curious to see how this movie would handle the relationship between John and Paul for so many years after the break. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed with this movie. Although the story itself is fiction, many of the references used by the two musicians are very accurate. This includes how Yoko Ono will always be with John wherever he went. The Wings song "Silly Love Songs" is the number one hit that year and the concert on the roof of Apple Studios plays music from the album "Let It Be." <br /> The actors played a very good job in John and Paul. The accents might have used a little more work, but they seemed to have read the two former Beatles used to act. I also liked the dialogue between them, which was basically the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Initially, the end disappointed me, but the more you think about it, the more you will appreciate it, especially as it really went in real life. They also show off the fantastic bat of Saturday Night Live in which the Beatles are offered $ 3,000 to play on the show. (compared to the $ 220 million others offered). Overall I was not disappointed with this movie. It really gives you more of the reason why the Beatles broke and why they never came together again.
