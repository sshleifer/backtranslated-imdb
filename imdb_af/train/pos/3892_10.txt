Right, then he is absolutely brilliant. But you have to be intelligent and quick to understand his humor. He covers (attacks) all sorts of topics, such as the first moon landing, Easter / Christmas, Transvestitism, Movies, and Herr Doktor Heimlich. <br /> <br /> For those of you, it's not worth swearing. not for you. While some of us break with commas and periods, he uses the f word. Also, if you can't laugh at yourself, you should never look; you will feel the fool. <br /> <br /> By the way, I watched his other things and even saw how he performs alive, and that is by far his best job. He seems simple. <br /> <br /> What can go so far as to say he's glorious.
