It was a good movie with a powerful message of love and redemption. I loved the transformation of the brother and the consequences of the terrible disease on the family. Kind and benevolent. If there were any mistakes, I would have to say that the story showed the typical suburban family and their problems again. What about all people of all cultural backgrounds? I'd love to see a movie showing all these cultures - like in real life. Nevertheless, the film has risen in terms of its values ​​and its understanding of how a disease can bring someone closer to his or her author. Love the movie and it brought tears to my eyes
