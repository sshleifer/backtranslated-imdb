WHERE SIDEWALK ENDES to be a better-known film directed by Otto Preminger, the man who gave the world LAURA. And this time he has the same co-stars: DANA ANDREWS and GENE TIERNEY. It should be said that Tierney is used below, which plays even more of a supporting role, while the spotlight goes to Andrews. <br /> <br /> He plays a tough, hardened cop used to handle a bunch of thugs. In a strong way until one night he accidentally killed a man in the process of arresting him. When suspicions fall on a taxi driver (TOM TULLY), he goes with the investigation into the murder, but begins to feel guilty because he falls in love with the Cabbie's daughter (GENE TIERNEY). Tierney looks a bit too elegant for the girl she's playing here and doesn't look like the awkward background elements of the story. <br /> <br /> The story takes a grim turn as the investigation. deeper and it was discovered that the murdered man of his service as a war hero had a silver plate in his head. In the end, it becomes a morality story with Andrews to develop a conscience about his crime. <br /> <br /> It is fascinating as film noir with capable performances of a strong supporting role. A good entry into the field of noir, compellingly directed by Preminger and well played by Andrews and Tierney, despite the slight disregard of her character.
