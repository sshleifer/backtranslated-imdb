Stylish, moody, innovative revenge-driven massacre. Also cheesy, of course, and sporadically very cheesy. It reminded me a lot of The Big Heat because it has the vengeance of the exact same event, and the girl comes to the good man's side because of the same bad behavior by the bad man. It's sad there is no Gloria Grahame, but so fantastic that it is Alain Delon and not Glenn Ford. Can anyone be as beautiful as Alain in a cashmere sweater and trench coat? Yet he is quite tough and freezing cool. No one can touch him nowadays - although someone like Jude Law can try to guess. Hard for any girl to look good with him. The music was funky and perfect and there were some excellent car hunters (and mostly not my cup of tea) - especially one wild in the forest. People also met their creations in a creative and bloody way, for example in a junkyard cruncher. But beyond the cheese, the overall atmosphere touched and expertly pulled. More creativity, excitement and freshness in the "forgotten" movie than most of what I've seen lately.
