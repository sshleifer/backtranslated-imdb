It's a movie that contains many things that only Japanese people can understand. Even good translation, there are things that are, of course, private jokes or regional symbols. My guess is that it is trying to send a message of some kind, but it just washed me away. <br /> <br /> What I feel is basically it's a mediocre movie with special effects. Some children become "The One" and ultimately have little relevance to a yokai war which in any case makes no sense. It would have been nice to understand what the hell they were talking about, but between the Azumi bean was Yokai and the one that looked like a big umbrella. (Rihanna eats your heart!) I couldn't really distinguish the plot. br /> Bottom line: beautiful visual, the child shouts a lot, the river princess is very cute and the rest is shit.
