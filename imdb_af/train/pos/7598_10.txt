"Lost", "24", "Carnivale", "Desperate Housewifes" ... the list goes on and on. These, and a lot of other high-quality exhibitions, prove that we are in the midst of a golden age in television history. "Lost" is pure genius. Incredibly low personal and psychologically viable stories, underlined by sublime cinematography (incredible to use this word, when describing a TV show), a killer score, good performances and editing. Anyone who is not dedicated to it misses one of the most important creative expressions in television ever. This can be a problem if you only watch one episode per week, but the DVD format is actually an incredible way to see it. Hope they keep it up (as I'm sure they do).
