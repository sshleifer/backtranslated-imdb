This is the first Michael Vartan movie I saw. I didn't see an alias and I was curious to see if the man could act. He is probably in this movie and can enjoy. Natasha Henstridge is of course beautiful, but she is usually in more physical and action roles, so I found her very good and loving in this different "lovely" role of a teacher. Some of the negative comments I read are true, the movie is full of clich√©s and the story doesn't sound true at all. Even though every character in the movie says how well they look together, I don't think there is screen chemistry there. However, I enjoyed this movie. The places are nice, the characters are nice and nice and the supporting actors are pretty good. If you expect to see a great romance, this is not the case. But if you want to see a pleasant innocent love movie with similar characters, it's very good.
