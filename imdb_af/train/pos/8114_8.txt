As scientists behaved in such a way that H.G. Wells was confident, they would not have completely outdated history in the future. Was almost 80 years past the point Wells wrote, the form of things to come, on which this film is based and not closer to the world he describes as before, in some ways further. <br /> <br /> Although well-known players such as Raymond Massey, Ralph Richardson and Cedric Hardwicke are in the movie, they are more caricature than true characters. This is the main weakness of the movie, it is dedicated to Wells' science philosophy, will solve all problems and the rest of us are backward foolish. <br /> <br /> Massey's characters, two generations of the same family, hold that highly optimistic performance. Cedric Hardwicke is a skeptic who feels the man hurrying too far forward. And Ralph Richardson is a warrior arising from the destruction of another Thirty Years' War fought with modern weapons. Incidentally, since the atomic bomb was not invented, poison gas was considered a weapon that almost destroyed man. <br /> <br /> According to Wells, science and conquest can never interfere. Scientists as a group are far beyond the world of politics to involve such things. In Wells's lifetime, scientists certainly fled the right-wing fascist governments of Hitler and Mussolini. The same people, to defeat them, made themselves subordinate to the Allies and formed the atomic weapons that began in the modern era. If they behaved like Wells would have liked it, someone like Albert Einstein would have had a junta of scientists who would set up a new order after World War II. <br /> <br /> Wells have it wrong both in time and in development. He apparently never intended the computer as well as the atomic power. Computer programmers are much more likely to be our rulers in a brave new world than scientists right now. Still things that are led by William Cameron Menzies and the sets that are created offer an interesting look at the thoughts of H.G. Wells, probably a respected thinker of his time, though he did not get the shape of things to come.
