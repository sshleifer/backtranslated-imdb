I've seen this movie a whole dozen times and that's great. But the only thing about it was that in the beginning there was too much talk about who went out with whom. I think it would be interesting to repeat it. But on the official website they said they wouldn't reconsider it because so many people are saved when they see it. What has happened to Patty Dunning? She is a pretty good actress. She did several other films in the 70's and 80's, but we haven't heard from her yet. I'm sure Thom Rachford, who plays Jerry, is working for Accounting at RD Films. But overall I have to say that the series itself is like Left Agter Old School.
