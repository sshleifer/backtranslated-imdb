I saw this movie when it was new. Later, I rented it in Japan after being here for three years, afraid I would cringe when I looked at it in the harsh light of my extensive international experience. The film pleasantly surprised me with how accurately it depicts the culture clash between Japan and Pennsylvania (where I come from). Not all things are almost on the point, but the tone is perfect. <br /> <br /> I've been in Japan for many years and I continue to enjoy this movie for its fair treatment of the two sides in the story. Interestingly, although Japanese-American actors spoke Japanese in the original, the Japanese version dialogue is reaffirmed to cover obviously second language delivery issues. <br /> <br /> I noticed that one reviewer used it in a Japanese class. I think you can learn more about what to expect from a meeting with Japan by watching this movie than reading any of the "serious" books on the case (most were written in the 80s and financed by Japanese propaganda companies) ). <br /> Don't be fooled by dragging on the average rating caused by one star reviewer who, among other things, has found indisputably that Japanese cars want to build in the US. (Of course, the Japanese run many factories there to be close to the customers and to avoid trade friction.) This is a very hot and funny movie that I would rate higher if it wasn't for some 80's clips, like to dance to Cheesy electronic disco music. Michael Keaton has never been harder.
