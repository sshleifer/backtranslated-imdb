This movie is a perfect example of a movie that divides people into 2 groups. Those who get the joke and those who don't. People usually fall into what they don't understand. This film has a comic style and charm that has been unmatched ever since. It's a BIG comedy. And a great romance. This is a perfect date movie. A perfect movie for someone who wants a good sad laugh. And if your perspective is too tense, this movie may not be for you, and you may need counseling. It is an injustice that, since the early 80's, Paramount has kept this film up for grabs, never seen the light of day on DVD. Yet they feel an urban version of "The Honeymooners" is a good idea. I find it odd that my two overall favorite romantic comedies have never been released on DVD. The other is Gene Wilder's "The World's Greatest Lover" that Fox has been sitting since the early 80's. But, "From Justin To Kelly" is in almost every video store in the country. There is no justice in the world. Maybe those who took the time to use it, "From Justin To Kelly", I'm sure the one is enough to "get" them. Sometimes age groups lose their sense of humor ... Or sometimes they just get obsolete and find satisfaction in reruns of "Full House".
