It requires a Serbian or at least a Balkan familiarity to understand and enjoy many of the situations, characters and jokes of 'Zavet' as well as many other Kusturica films. For example, look at the opening scenes, with the remote village in the Serbian mountains, with the low-tech devices defending the integrity and lifestyle of the residents, watching the nostalgia for the good days of the Communist government and the awakening of the Young to his naked teacher after the sounds of the Soviet song. Kusturica not only deviates from the tragic history of Serbia described in its previous films, but creates a whole world of itself in the process. <br /> <br /> It's not a political film or an explicit political film. anyway. It's a fun movie for everyone. Kusturica creates a set of characters we care about. Music plays an active role in this movie, as in all its other films. His style is direct and grotesque, we are now what he feels about his characters and we know he wants us to feel the same. The space he develops reports the presence, history and magic, and the colors appear to be a Caucasian Rousseau of modern cinema. <br /> <br /> It's also not a perfect movie. The main mistake is the length, some editing and shortening would have been useful, as the director was exhausted at some time over time and appeared repetitive. It's another of the most striking, amusing, moving movies I've seen lately.
