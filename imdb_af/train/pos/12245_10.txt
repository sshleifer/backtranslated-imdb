That is, I think, the best Emma. Having seen the other version (1996) which is also good, and reading the book, I think I can confidently say that this is the true interpretation and most true to Jane Austen's masterpiece. The 1996 movie with G. Paltrow is also good, it's just that it's almost like another story. It's very light and fluffy, you don't see the dark edges of the characters, and if you just want a nice movie, it'll be fine, but the intricacies of some of the plot points, such as the Churchill / Fairfax entanglement , so much shine is that it hardly exists. But if you want the characters to work out a little more realistic and multi-dimensional, then the 1996 TV version is superior. Emma is a remarkable person, but she is defective. Kate Beckinsale is masterful in showing the small features of the character. You see her put to the test for the simpler conversation of Harriet Smith, but she does not regret destroying Harriet's proposal until the action destroys the end of her own marriage happiness. You see her narcissism and it reflects Frank Churchill because they would harm others to achieve their own goals. For Emma it was a contestant and he had a new friend to avoid the time of losing her governor to marriage. For Frank Churchill, he assures the promise of the woman he loves while cruelly treating her and others to keep the secret. In the book she realized this all in a crushing awakening of all the blunders she made. Both Kate Beckinsale and Gyneth Paltrow are convincing in their remorse, but Paltrow's is more childish and stagnant while Beckinsale's awakening is really and serious and you see the transition from childish, selfish behavior to a friendly and thorough adult. Both versions are very good, but I prefer this one.
