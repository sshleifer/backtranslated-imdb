The movie "Frailty" is actually more of a psychological thriller if it is a horror movie. It has all the steps of a horror movie, but it is not. "Frailty" is a film about perceptions of religion and the differences between right and wrong. <br /> <br /> In 'Frailty', a middle-aged father (Bill Paxton) and his two sons claim to be the work of God. We watch the father kill the "devils" in some rather brutal ways while convincing his sons and himself that they are doing the work God is doing and that it is right. He claims he received a message from an angel who gave him specific instructions to eliminate the demons living here on earth. God gave him a list of names and in exchange for his "services"; He and his sons will get protection, which basically means the police will never be able to catch them. We see this in a very disturbing way before us. But what is really disturbing is the effect it has on the two boys, especially the oldest son, Adam. Adam himself doubted the existence of a supreme being, it was to his father and a week in the basement changed it all. He knows that his father has obviously lost his head and it is quite certain that it will also happen with his younger brother, Fenton. Fenton, the other half of this puzzle, takes everything as if it were his own religion. He looks trapped in his father's world of god and demons. I think it's because he is so young and easy to impress. But everything that happens to these three is quite convincing, in fact, convincing. <br /> <br /> The events occurring in the movie can be seen as a lively hallucination experienced by the three main characters. I say this because they react to the situation in different ways and at one stage in the film they claim to see God each. Dad first sees murders as his mission. His "purpose" eventually uses him and quickly becomes obsessed with the extinction of demons. In fact, its hallucination is the primary one. His "orders" and the list of names he receives are all part of this hallucination. Look at the scene where Dad finds the ax in a barn to find out where I come from. Fenton, the younger son, is easily impressed by all these talk of demons and destruction. Being so young, it's easy for him to fall into his father's fall. Adam, on the other hand, is very skeptical of his father's actions. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> In a way, the hallucination ends when Dad is killed at the end of the movie. (I won't say how or under what circumstances). But I'll say it's not nice. After his death, it is fast forward to this day. (The story is told by flashbacks, as seen through the eyes of the eldest son Adam). In fact, it is Fenton who tells the story, not Adam, as originally believed. The story is told how he observed it, through his actions and his brother's actions. Fenton is insane and continues with what his father started by luring the FBI agent in his fall. <br /> <br /> Since religion is an important theme in this movie, the film also plays out how easy it is for religion to be misinterpreted by those who do not understand it. Before Dad discovered his new-found mission, he didn't have a clear understanding of religion, nor did he fully believe in supremacy. His sons, Fenton and Adam, often sang innocent grandchildren's psalms, but probably did not have a clear understanding of what the lyrics meant. After the revelation of Dad's new-found mission, they both took separate directions - Adam showed a supreme being, while Fenton was gradually sucked into his father's madness. <br /> <br /> A very good excitement that will cure the pain from you should not see it alone.
