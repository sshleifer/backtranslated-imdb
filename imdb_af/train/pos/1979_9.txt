My friend Annette and I saw it together and we will both comment. <br /> <br /> Both really enjoyed viewing it, though they enjoyed a few freedoms with Dicken's work. Many Dicken's works are somewhat dark and sad (including Oliver Twist), but this movie has changed it all. It was fun, colorful (both visual and musical), and the characters were lighter. <br /> <br /> TRAVIS: Usually I don't care for music and dance movies, but the songs in this production were exciting and lively, and the choreography was wonderful. <br /> <br /> MATTHE: That's really what comes out of Travis. I can't stress enough how good the dance numbers were. For example, you could say that those boys really worked hard to achieve the routine. <br /> <br /> TRAVIS: Three actors really exhibited IMO; Nancy (Shani W.), Bill Sykes (Oliver Reed) an Artful Dodger (Jack Wild). Man, that Oliver Reed can really do a good crook. That one scene where you see his eyes through the mail slot, gave me cold fever from behind ... AWESOME. And that kid Jack Wild was a perfect Artful Dodger. And Nancy was fantastic (man, I felt bad when she was murdered). She can also sing! Kudos to the ruling department about their choices there. I hate the Oliver Twist kid tho. He was just too bright and wimpy for my taste. (I liked the wish that Bill Sikes would drop him in the mud in the background.) Neither should they have sung him. <br /> <br /> BUT: Acting was really great. In addition to the three stars called Travis, I felt that Ron Moody (Fagin) did a tremendous job. He was so funny and at the same time lightly sinister. The supporting actors were also wonderful. Harry Secombe behaved very well in his Mr. Bumble role. And he has a wonderful singing voice. I have Mr. Secombe featured in another movie titled "Davy" where he played an opera singer with pleasing results. The talented Harry Secombe had to be in many more movies. <br /> <br /> TRAVIS: As I mentioned earlier, the story isn't quite true to the book, but IMO is stronger. This movie was also not boring, as some musicals seem to be. And the continuity has moved you right with the characters. The songs didn't detract from the plot, or you slept by being too long. <br /> <br /> BUT: Any music movie that Travis watches should be completely out of the box is a rare find. And this one is indeed a rare find. It's a very easy to see production that carries the viewer smoothly and pleasantly to the end. In a day where movie effects seem to be combined with beautiful faces, it was a refreshing intervention. <br /> <br /> Our combined rating for this was 8.5 out of 10. (In this case we will have up to 9 votes.). <br /> <br /> TRAVIS: I rated it a 7, mainly because the Oliver Twist kid (Mark L.) irritated me and his songs were torture to my excessively sensitive ears. Otherwise, it was an excellent movie. <br /> <br /> MARY: My rating is a 10. Movies aren't much better than that. And you can really work for everyone involved in this production to make it what it was ... a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Don't miss this one ... even if you don't normally like musicals. It's really a rare treat.
