This is a movie I decided to watch, because I'm a big fan of adult animation. I often find that when a movie does not develop around a well-known actor or actress, but rather a story or style, it is considered the movie as a piece of art, rather than a showcase of the actor's ability to different styles. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely more about style than story. While I found the story interesting (an excitement that lends the story and atmosphere of movies such as Blade Runner and many animated films), it was sometimes difficult to follow, and didn't feel that it all took it all together. could. It certainly got a mixed feel of French animation and Japanese Anime. Whether it's a good thing or not is up to the viewer. Visually, this film is a feast for the eyes, and in that sense an artwork. <br /> <br /> If you like adult animation, or want to see a movie that is different from most movies at the moment. I would recommend it. All I can say is that I enjoyed the experience of the movie, but got a little disappointed because it could have been better
