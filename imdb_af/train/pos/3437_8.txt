Some genre films should be dressed. This one was an exception. Taken on his own merit, this is a dressed version of the horror genre movie. With minimal special effects, it is a psychological study of types, with a simple but existential theme, hit by the bus, and why? It's not a good movie, but because there's little about it, the story works. Subtle, and all about the interactions of the characters. Actually, there is one summary in the opening scenes, but it may have been set up just to show off what is coming. I really appreciate the balance of male and female energy and will not recommend this story to anyone who is interested in more than people who respond to a physical and psychological challenge. You will enjoy the movie if you have some empathy, appreciate the need for a little adventure in your life and wonder "What will I do in this situation?"
