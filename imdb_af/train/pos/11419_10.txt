Claire Denis' debut is both brave and confident. In this portrayal of life after the end of the French colonialist Cameroon, she explores the relationships between men and women, black and white. <br /> <br /> With the black servant 'Prot√©e' as the film's primary purpose of desire and oppression, the film goes from the beginning to the taboo area. Denis builds a picture of life through a series of character relationships that keep the informed viewer on display. The sphere of the film is perfectly captured by the camera work and (lack of) lighting. <br /> <br /> A good discourse.
