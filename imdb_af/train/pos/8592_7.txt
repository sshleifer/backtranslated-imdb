Good for an evening's entertainment - but the plot was inconclusive. Garrison's relationship with the First Lady was unreal and passionate; the president was a cardboard cutout. And who were the right villains anyway? Nothing is sufficiently developed or explained. I still don't know why they wanted to kill the president or how the mole got involved. The villains were nameless and undeveloped, so you never got involved in their plot. Michael Douglas and Kiefer Sutherland did their best to put reality into the story - chasing and confrontation was good. But Kim Basinger and Eva Longoria were both incredible in their roles, Basinger had no signs at all, and Longoria couldn't be a secret service agent. It could have been a very good movie, but it missed the road, with too many unanswered questions. Disappointing despite some very good scenes. And did they use the 'West Wing' set for White House scenes? - I expected CJ or Charlie to appear!
