When you record a book written in the 50's in the 90's, the bloody thing in the 50's and not the 90's sets. Look, 40 year old mores and values ​​tend not to play so well, or so, so far in the road. This is a simple rule that Hollywood usually violates. And that's the problem with this movie. It should have been in the era in which it was written. You'd think it would be a no-brainer, but no. I want to expand, but bmacv's comments play it very well. I'll limit my comments to Rachel Ward. She looked as if she had killed her ass completely out of the existence of this role. As a result, she looks like a crack on chemotherapy, and is about as sexy as a gay leather sofa. I found her dying at any moment. It looks very upsetting, and it has greatly detracted from her supposed "hotness" and the "sexual tension" that the film wanted to create. Other than that, the movie was pretty good; a 7+ out of 10.
