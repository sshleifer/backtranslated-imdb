This 1939 movie tried to capitalize on the much better Michael Curtiz's movie "Angels with Dirty Faces". As indicated by Ray Enright, the only interesting thing is how tamed these children were compared to what is happening to the youth in America's downtown today. <br /> <br /> The movie is just worth seeing because of the presence of Ann Sheridan and Ronald Reagan, who have shown that they are well matched. The dead children have larger parts, as the plot focuses on them rather than in the older ones. <br /> <br /> In a way it is curious how arson was used in the same way, as some persistent owners did in later years. In New York. It was the fastest way to turn a property into never having to consider the social problems it created. In today's climate with so many guns around there is a new reality. The young children of the story were mere pranksters rather than criminals. How times change!
