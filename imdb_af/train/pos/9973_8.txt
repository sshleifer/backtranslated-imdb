I really liked this version of 'Vanishing Point', unlike the 1971 version. I found the 1971 version very boring. If I can get up in the middle of a movie a few times (as I did with the 1971 version) than me, it's not that good. This can be of course due to the fact that I was only nine when the 1971 version was released. However, I saw many memories where I kept the original and older one better. I found that the plot of the 1997 version was more understandable and basically true to the original without undermining the meaning of the 1971 version. In my opinion, I felt that the 1997 version had more excitement and was not so "blistered". (Boring)
