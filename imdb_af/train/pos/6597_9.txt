We always watch American movies with their particular accents from every region (south, west, etc.). We have the same here. All strange people have to watch this movie and have an open mind to accept another culture. Apart from America and Europe, the cinematographic industry dominates almost. <br /> <br /> This movie tells us about a parallel world that isn't. I even thought of those living in a big city like São Paulo. All actors improvise and they are very realistic. The camera gives us an idea of ​​their confusion world, the loneliness of each character and invites us to share their world. <br /> <br /> It's a very good movie and the worst is a rental even at home.
