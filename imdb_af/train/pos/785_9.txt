I am of Irish descent, loved this movie. Not only was the man warm and funny. He was also sincere and honest. I loved the girl he also fell in love with. She was beautiful. They were such a cute couple. The end was so sad. Love this movie! Although a little dirty, it reminds us of a British or Irish version of Prime. If you like this movie, you should look prime. The same story line young man falls for older women, older women fall for young men. Many roads eventually cross, the best decision is made whether the task is completed. Nothing else to say, without destroying the whole movie, even though I thought the French man was ugly, less attractive to me. Umm ... If you like Irish movies, I would recommend "circle of friends", that movie is so good. Quick quote, you can't get it unless you see it "well, it's ruined my dinner." lol
