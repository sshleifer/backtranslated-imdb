Although this show was off the air since 1973, after reading a DVD set I borrowed from our library, I was forced to say so. <br /> <br /> I can remember when it was the only color show on television in the 1960s, and sometimes there will be a small "Sunday Night Party" with friends watching it on NBC on one of the few color televisions. <br /> <br /> I don't enjoy history so much for names and dates, but how it affects us today and how much so deep can be based on the most inconspicuous actions of the time. Case in point: Virginia City, Nevada, which has become one of the richest cities in the world as a result of the silver, has gained its name from a character called "Old Virginny", which in the early days of the town a salon came out, dropped and broke his whiskey bottle. <br /> <br /> Old Virginny didn't want to waste the opportunity, as the precious liquid was dragging into the dust, he decided to condemn the town "Virginia Town". The area became known as the Comstock Lode because another character, Henry Comstock, had the reputation of trying to jump everyone's claim and the area became known as the Comstock Lode. <br /> <br /> I just watched an early episode treated. with these 2 subjects. Other episodes responded to Mark Twain's literary turnout while a Territorial Enterprise reporter ... <br /> <br /> It was healthy (and often educational) family entertainment. As someone else noticed, each episode would really be considered a movie in its own right scripts and characters. <br /> <br /> One thing the truth was about was the proximity of Virginia City and the Ponderosa. Indeed, to drive from the Ponderosa (all of the Northern Lake Tahoe) one has to ride his horse about 3000 feet (1000 meters) at the Spooner Summit to the high desert (3000-4000 feet) of the Carson Valley and then another 30-40 miles to the Virginia city. <br /> <br /> Needless to say the Cartwrights will do it on a regular basis, it will be difficult. But every writer must have a little leeway with the truth. <br /> <br /> How I miss that show, even today.
