Lauren Bacall was ill and dead by her husband, Humprey Bogarts, when she did this movie. Rock Hudson was near the top of his 1950s death. Dorothy Malone is in excellent shape and wins an Oscar for support. Robert Stack is nominated and just falls short of his role. <br /> <br /> The story is a little bit of soap from another time, but just as worthy of most dramas. Wonderful how good drunkards can drive in this movie and how quickly Stack pops up in some of the films' early series. <br /> <br /> You can see why the movie is so good and actually production shows this movie is very good. You can see that Bacall is distracted during this movie, while her play is fine. She looks emotionally drained in some rows. <br /> <br /> The sexual references in this movie are so soft that many of today's young viewers do not realize what they are. Film does a good job of telling a story and actually makes a sequel to the end even though no one has ever been made - although Scriptural Beyond The Wind would be a good title.
