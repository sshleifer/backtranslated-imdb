Such a masterpiece as the first of these two Snowy River films, the sequel to The Man From Snowy River is all that has to be a sequel. It does not tread on the toes of its predecessor, and prefers to leave the legend where the first film was in some unique immortality. <br /> <br /> The Man of Sneeur River II is based on the return of Jim Craig to the Sneek Riverland after an absence of three years. The film subtly tells a story of change in the nineteenth century, of Australian history, legend and horses. The storyline shows a touch of Hollywood in lighter shades, an aspect that was totally absent from the first film, but it blends in uniquely with the distinctive feeling of Australian patriotism. The plot is much more vibrant than the first movie, and much more striking, with specific aspects of the previous movie, but The Man From Snowy River II features every essential feature of the first film; sensational gorgeous cinematography, a beautiful focus from the Australian highland, the second impressive footage of horses ever filmed, and a fantastic and deep moving soundtrack by Bruce Rowland, which is the first in every respect. Geoff Burrowes has done an excellent job with this film, and it is highly worthy of recognition, especially with regard to the quality of the Australian film industry. The lead, from Tom Burlinson to Sigrid Thornton, and well-replaced Brian Dennehy, portray their parts with so much passion and distinction as the first film. As far as successors go, The Man From Snowy River II is a masterpiece; a deeply moving and inspiring experience.
