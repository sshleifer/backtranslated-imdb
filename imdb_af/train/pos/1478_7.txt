I liked this movie, though I could half-know who the secret admirer was. <br /> <br /> I also wonder if it's based on a real story, as it told the "real" people at the end of the movie. I think I should investigate and let it know. <br /> <br /> Is there anyone who remembers what happened? I believe they moved to North Carolina if I'm not wrong. <br /> <br /> Of course, the states could have changed to protect the innocent. <br /> <br /> You would think this man could have found out as easily as I did. Was he stupid or what?
