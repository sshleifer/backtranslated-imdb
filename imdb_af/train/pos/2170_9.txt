I think the creator (s) of this film's concept deserves much more awards than they probably have ever received. This is of course not an Oscar caliber film, but at least for me this film has left a lasting impression since I first saw it in 1984 (in the theater). <br /> <br /> I don't think it's (and is not) a spoiler, but: Imagine responding to your impulses. Do the first thought that appears in your head, say the first words on your lips ... No restraint, no consciousness, nothing keeps you from the things that intelligent adults know we shouldn't actually say or do. or do. If anything, the movie just scratches the surface - it's not as far as it can go. <br /> <br /> At a time when Hollywood seems to be having older "classic" parents who are trying to make money today, it won't be nice to see them regaining an older movie of modest success for the sake of taking it to the next level? A little further, or even to explore what the original crew did not, could not handle 20 years ago or not? <br /> <br /> That's just my opinion anyway. : O)
