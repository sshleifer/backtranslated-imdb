I'll say it to start: ... Why, oh, why can't WB do what these short film directors do? Of course, Sandy is an incredible director, and earns some credit from WB and DC. But I think they're good on the brink when a man with a $ 12,000 budget can make a superhero fan. The world's best is one of the best short films I've ever seen, Trailer or not. <br /> <br /> I think choosing a Bodybuilder (Mike O'Hearn) to play Superman was a genius choice. Let's see it, Superman isn't a supermodel. He can be beautiful, but he is not a GQ stud. And I don't know what that guy was saying to me above, but Superman is pretty bitter. (Have you ever read a Superman comic?). I guess the fact alone, flows me ... It seems like a clear choice to get someone with a real muscle mass to play a superhero, rather than a pretty face. The same thing for Batman, Bartram is in incredible shape and an excellent Batman ... I don't know guys ... If a bigger budget and his own movie is given ... I think Bale and Bartram will be neck and neck . Bottom line, This is one of only a rare pair of Super Hero movies with actors actually seeing the part. <br /> <br /> The Acting is also very good. I don't know what everyone is talking about, O'Hearn isn't that bad. He's convincing as Superman, and Bartram ... well, he's IS Batman. I mean, come on people, this movie had a $ 12,000 dollar budget, what did you expect? Everyone Else is also good, except Two-Face looks a little crazy as usual. But hey, we just have Tommy-Lee Jones as reference. Oh, Lois is also warm. <br /> <br /> The SFX is also so nice. I mean, Superman sees the car light up ... MAN! How cool it is. Unlike the "Tank" scene in Grayson, I may have to put this one, as Mike actually looks like he's flying, and with ease. The flying rows left something to be desired, but again with a bigger budget ... Oh, and he even used a Batmobile! (It was probably a model, but it looks convincing). <br /> <br /> All the trailer's only downfall was a lack of a serious budget. And WB refuses to admit that Collora is a credible director, and must be separate from some kind of a project ... But no, they will (like most of the Marvel projects) get these hack directors only which shows almost no respect. for the fans and what they care about, and keep these gamblers out. Thanks God Superman Returns was a hit, or it would be the end of it. World's Finest is excellent and counts in my book as a Superhero Movie.
