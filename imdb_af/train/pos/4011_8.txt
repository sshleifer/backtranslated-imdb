After the Superfriends and Scooby Doo left the Saturday morning airwaves in the fall of 1986, I almost stopped seeing cartoons on Saturday morning, as these were the only two who agreed to me. And since neither the Real Ghostbusters nor the Flintstone Kids I looked very promising, I retired and started to sleep on Saturday morning. I just returned to Saturday morning TV in 1988 for that one year only for one and only animation program. <br /> <br /> A new animated show from Superman was something I wouldn't succeed. I was 17 and in high school then, but so! I loved this show. From what I can remember, this series was a gift to fans I celebrate in the celebration of Superman's 50th birthday that particular year. It reminds the theme music and the music style of John Williams movie score of the Richard Donner / Christopher Reeve Superman movies. I honestly felt the animation style Ruby Spears did was reminded of the Super Powers team: Galactic Guardians Series by Hanna Barbera a few years earlier. Unfortunately, Danny Dark was not back as Superman, but I felt Beau Weaver did a very impressive job when Superman's voice and his Clark Kent were like the Chris Reeve version. After becoming Reed Richards / Mr. Fantastic on the 90's Fantastic Four, I could still see this version of Superman in my mind. Ginny McSwain as Lois Lane. LOL! What a rhyme. She was a voice director for Hanna Barbera and Ruby Spears, and I think she accepted it herself to do Lois. Memories of the SuperFriends heard in this series when it came to the voice. Jimmy Olsen is Mark Taylor, who was on the SuperFriends previously Firestorm. Perry White is none other than former Batman TV writer Stanley Ralph Ross, who shows SuperFriends Gorilla Grodd and Brainiac in the Super Powers. And Lex Luthor, now a wise crawling billionaire magnate is nothing but SuperFriends voice alman, Michael Bell, who I know best as Zan and the Riddler, as well as many other characters on many other series. <br /> <br /> I felt this series was a combination of the movie Superman with the post-crisis. John Byrne once again lived from Superman, with Lex Luthor as a billionaire tycoon, Jonathan and Martha Kent to see Clark as Superman. . The Bruce Timm series and Lois and Clark will also do so. Unfortunately we never saw Brainiac, Bizarro, Toyman, Metallo or Darkseid. Unlike Luthor, we only saw the Prankster and we saw General Zod. I especially enjoyed that one episode with Wonder Woman, pronounced by BJ Ward, who also played on the Super Powers team. <br /> <br /> The episodes were devastating and I also enjoyed Clark's growing and evolving stories from childhood to childhood to an adult moving to Metropolis in the short-term segment, Superman's Family Album. <br /> <br /> The only two things I didn't like. It only lasted one season. And after Wonder Woman's gas spot I was hoping that Batman would be raised about Adam West (still thinking of Super Powers team episodes, I think). I also hoped for it, because on the Prankster episode the Metropolis baseball team was pitted against the Gotham Goliaths. <br /> <br /> Every popular superhero has one ultra-scarce cartoon. For SpiderMan, I feel it is the 1981 solo series that broadcast the same time as Amazing Friends. For the amazing Hulk this is the 1982 cartoon. For the Fantastic Four this is the 1978 series with HERBIE the robot. For Batman, it is the New Adventures of Batman 1977 by Filmation with BatMite. But for Superman, the rarest series is this one. <br /> <br /> Superman books and documentaries never cover or mention it. It's another series that WB should consider for DVD release. All in all, this 1988 version of Superman is good .... Super !!
