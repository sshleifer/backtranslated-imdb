Melvyn Douglas again gives a sophisticated performance in which he lives in the role of a detective this time, who cannot put love for service and adventure, and the warm beautiful Joan Blondell (who is presented as a judge as illiterate) wrote a novel about her early life) is just as nice as his eternal dear treasure. It's almost a helicopter comedy, almost a Thin Man-type movie, almost a series, I think, it didn't make it right. a successor. It does not reach quite classic status, but it has all the ingredients for a fun 85 minutes with an episodic but pacey script, fine character characters and direction that all move fast so you hardly notice that Williams is not (Douglas) exactly Columbo when it comes to detection. I wish there were more movies like this.
