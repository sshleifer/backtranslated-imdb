The movie is about Pony and Gray Owl. It's also about Aboriginals, Canada, the English, Gray Owl's aunts and the North Bay Nugget. Excellent story. <br /> <br /> It's an excellent movie, more like a book, that creates interesting questions about cultural identity and values. The key scene is Gray Owl who admits his impulse to Pony and her response. <br /> <br /> Some observations about user ratings. Note that the user ratings are two-polar clustering at 5 and 7; It's not for everyone, but has a strong impact. This movie is underestimated and overlooked, but will be noticed for the coming year. Also, few women watched the movie, but they considered it more powerful than men. Is it properly marketed? <br /> <br />
