Great actors, an Oscar nominated actress, beautiful scenery, good strong story line and more laughter than you can fit into my new handbag (and that's quite big). This movie was brilliant. It was beautifully performed in the more serious scenes and the funny moments were. Well, she divides. I have never heard a theater listen, and tears flew over my cheeks during the "stoned ladies in the tea shop" scene. Well done to the British film industry and Craig Ferguson, whose magical ingredients made it sure, is one of my favorite movies of the year, if not.
