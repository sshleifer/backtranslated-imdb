First, this jewel of Joe Sarno came back, and I must say after I saw it, I could never forget Jennifer Welles. Initially I thought the movie was a bit slower than I would expect for a Sarno movie, but when Jennifer allowed her, I was the first time I saw her anywhere. I sat down and noticed. Her presence in this movie is hard to avoid. She saw most of the rest of Sarno's films, and the other movies starring Jennifer Welles, and I must say it was Sarno. and Jennifer at their collective best. Sarno's direction in this movie of domestic adult drama is wonderful, and Jennifer (figuratively and literally) showed an acting ability to show it. Co-stars Rebecca Brooke (aka Mary Mendum) and Chris Jordan, both regular co-stars of Mrs. Welles, as well as regular stars from Sarno's work, make credible performances as a few adventurous but ordinary housewives. This movie is Sarno classic.
