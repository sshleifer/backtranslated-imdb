You know the end> ​​will not be rosy, and the tragedy will cease, but it really is about traveling and characters and their dynamics and how they all fit into what Yugoslavia was. > Although I am not Yugonostalgic and tend to abandon the current Yugoslavian crop (give me Ademir> Kenovic over the late 90s Kustarica), I will have the chance to stumble upon this movie again it shines in my celluloid memories. Ever since 15 years ago I heard the theme song being sung by the gypsies jumping around my head? I am miserable,> I am so born ??? With the accompanying Jewish harp The last, great actor Pavle Vujisic (Muzamer from When Father> Going on Business) was unforgettable as the bus driver of> the bad journey in his typical gruff yet lovely way.
