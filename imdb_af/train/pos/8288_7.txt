Good successor to murder in a small town. In this one, Cash and his police Lt-friend deploy a tough plot that includes a Nazi criminal, a philanthropic witch and a family of screws and their helpers. As in the original, the viewer is treated with a nice little secret with distinctive images and sounds from America before the war. Go see it.
