I was a fan of Xu Ke (Hark Tsui) for many years since school. This movie is the best fantasy movie in years. I don't think "action" is the right genre, although there is a lot of action and KongFu scenes. Wait, did I say this is an ORIENTAL fantasy mug? Please keep in mind that NO Hollywood formula uses this movie to judge. And for the guy "poo" around, I don't blame you, because you're still young and need to know more about "culture".
