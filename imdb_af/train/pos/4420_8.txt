The struggle between darkness and light is indicated by the constant motive of the burning sun and is perfectly demonstrated by a three-dimensional battle between 'demons', bandits and soldiers in a forest during an eclipse. <br /> <br /> Be prepared: Following a beautiful sword battle under the lightning full of skies, the end of this picture will crush your head in puzzlement.
