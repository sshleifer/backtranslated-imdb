I went to see it twice, a friend of mine went to see it at the release party and he said it was so nice that I expected a lot from the movie. enjoy it because I didn't view it in nuteral position. The second time I knew what to expect and I enjoyed it more than the first time. After The second time I felt so in the mood to have a party. I loved the music. It's just nice. <br /> <br /> If Tom Barman improves his direct talent, he will be a director everyone will talk to. If you have to deliver this movie first, you need to be talented. <br /> <br /> The play is done by some great Belgian stars (Dirk roofthooft) and a lot of emerging talents like Titus De Voogdt. <br /> <br />
