I saw Savings Grace after it came out on the video. Since then it has become one of my favorites! The plot is not particularly complex, but it does not take away from the entertainment. It is chuck full of comic moments and has a very engaging quality. The characters are what make the movie so good. They each have their own peculiarities that add to the humor, the two old ladies played by Linda Kerr Scott and Phyllida Law jump out. Wonderful acting has been done by everyone, especially Brenda Blythen. She and Craig Ferguson were wonderful to pull off the nicer moments. If you are looking for a good comedy, I would definitely recommend this movie!
