*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Delivered in 1956, and considered reasonably racial at the time, Douglas Sirk's best candy-colored melodrama is still a wonderful thing. The plot is about the action in an oil-free dysfunctional Texas family that includes big brother Kyle, who is insecure, weak, wounded and very alcoholic. Robert Stack played it in a remarkable and playful performance and his slety sister Marylee played in the extreme. way by Dorothy Malone. Mrs. Malone's performance is selected by her through her eyes, which she uses to show us her emotions, which are mostly lust (for Rock Hudson) and jealousy (for Lauren Bacall). Malone is the only actress I have ever seen in movies that comes first in the room. Don't get me wrong, her performance to say the least is an absolute flute, and is one of the supreme camp acting works of the 1950s. But it is also terrible, because as attractive and attractive as Malone she is not a very good actress, and she cannot be subtle or harmful. Her display is of a note. She gets a bad Mambo, and in a big montage, like an unbelieving dad played by the always good Robert Keith, he falls to his death when he climbs a staircase, mixing it with an almost crazy Malone who doing orgasmic dance while she withdraws. Stack (who had to win an Oscar) and Malone (who won the award but shouldn't) are the real stars of the movie, those who have been hysterical, both sexually and otherwise, while the Hudson & Bacall fade gray and brown, which are the colors they are mainly costly. Hudson, who was a better actor, then received credit for Stack's childhood and best friend, and the stalking Love of Malone's interest, making most of Rock's film fumble. But Hudson doesn't want any part of her, and instead falls in love with Bacall who is married to Stack. No one is very happy and no one is very happy. The Stack-Bacall marriage falls off after a year and Stack drinks in oblivion because he thinks he's sterile and Bacall can't give a baby to prove he's a man. Sirk, who was a very intelligent man, had a long and fascinating career, both in movies and theater in Germany, has his Hollywood career at Universal in the mid-1950s with a series of intense, vibrant "women's flies. "or melodramas ended. Although mostly adapted from medicinal or fearless source material, they became masterpieces of the genre in Sirk's hands. Sirk has a wonderful sense of color and design that he has played in these films to fill his wide screen spaces with characters who have played their emotional lives under strange color combinations and lighting, made shadows, and many mirroed reflections. In "Write" characters the characters always out of windows, listen to the doors or sneak around. In the end, after much violence, an accident, a miscarriage and more Sirk ended the film with a final and surprising scene of a "reborn" and reformed Malone in a man-oriented suit sitting at a desk that a miniature oil wash.
