This movie is about a fictional soap opera. It's very fast and funny. To say something else will ruin the movie. There are several sites and subplots in the movie. This movie has ensemble cast with today's hottest stars. They all give the best performance. This movie is my favorite of 1991. Soapdish is perfect for fans of daily soap opera or first-time soap opera! If you look, check out this movie, it's hilarious !!!
