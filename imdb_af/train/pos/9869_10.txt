I have to say this is one of the best animated movies I've ever seen. I did it for the first time, but it appreciated me on the second show just a few weeks ago. I can see why pursuing such a big business at the box office. Apparently, many people liked this movie. <br /> <br /> A beautiful color palette (man, it looks good) and very good adult (but clean) humor make it a great winner. The opening 3-4-minute scene with "Scat" is excellent, as the subsequent interludes with him. "Sid" the sloth (pronounced by John Leguizano), however, offers the main humor in the movie. He usually has something funny to say throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Ray Romano is the voice of the mammoth, the great character of the film, literally, while Denis Leary is the terribly bad man sabertooth tiger <br /> <br /> It's not just humor and nice colors, but a nice, sentimental story of how a baby softens a few tough characters. It is not interrupted by many songs, either: one short one and there is nothing offensive, language use. <br /> <br /> If more animated movies were good, I would own more.
