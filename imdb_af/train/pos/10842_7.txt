So I still hired "still crazy". When I described Hardcore Logo for the guy at the video store, he said it looked like Still Crazy. So I rented it. Was I disappointed? Well, as Still Crazy focuses on a classic rock band rather than a punk band, but that's right. Still Crazy tells the story of the Alien Fruits, a rock band that broke up in the 70's at the height of their popularity at a great rock festival. Twenty years later, members of the group are struggling to make a living and are given the opportunity to play a concert at the 20th anniversary of this festival. They accept the offer and decide to permanently reform through Europe in the process. There are quite some funny hooks, and all the characters go through subtle changes. If you watch this movie, you feel more like a viewer of a carefully edited documentary than a participant. And that's not bad at all.
