On one level, this film can bring the child into us who just wants to build sand castles and throw things into the air just to drop them again. On a deeper level, though, it explores a deep desire to reconnect with the land. I thoroughly impersonated the artist when he said, "If I'm not alone here for a while, I feel unnoticed." <br /> <br /> I see Andy Goldsworthy as one of the great contemporary artists. I am familiar with his works mainly through his coffee table books and some art gallery installations. But to see his work in motion, perfectly trapped by Riedelsheimer's lens, was a revelation. Unconscious in time, Goldsworthy's creations come alive, swirling, flying, solving, crumbling, crashing. <br /> <br /> And that's exactly what he's about: Time. The process of creation and destruction. From emergence and disappearance. To get out of the Void and to become the Universe, and back again. There is a shamanic quality about him, furious at madness. You get the feeling to see him at work, that his art is a power of life for him, that if he did not, he would go there and perish. <br /> <br /> For us, Goldsworthy is able to share his vision through the communication medium of photography. Otherwise, with the exception of a few cairns and walls, they would only exist for one person.
