Bell, Book and Candle was one of the wonderful pop culture phenomena of the mid-twentieth century, very similar to the phenomenon we see today (in the 70s - more than ten years later - there were still endless references to this movie). It made Novak a great star, a good object on Jack Lemon's resume, cast new light on Jimmy Stewart, and Lancaster and Gingold explored new roads in their careers. Both continued to play witches and other curious "old bats." In film and television. <br /> <br /> Along with the 40-year-old movie I married a witch (who helped an icon for Veronica Lake), Bell, Book and Candle inspired the big movie and TV fascination with everyone. things witchy starting with Bewitched and continuing through Practical Magic, Worst Witch and Harry Potter. <br /> <br /> What I rarely see is that the movie is also a pretty interesting alternative Xmas movie. The story takes place over the Christmas holidays, and despite the fact that it is superficial about witchcraft, it actually embodies a large amount of Xmas spirit (giving, love, family, self-sacrifice, etc.). <br /> <br /> I will always see this movie (has seen it several times since my first viewing in the early 90's), especially when shown around or just after the holiday season. It has style, fabric, a good role and tremendous production values. And like Adam's Rib, it expresses unconditionally ideas that were previously radical. Even now it's radical (in both movies the female character is innocent and powerful) and it always looks ahead of time.
