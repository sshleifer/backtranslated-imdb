After the Deer Hunter, who is a masterpiece, just watched, the movie Jacknife had great shoes to fill. It has the same themes as The Deer Hunter, the devastating effects on a person after the Vietnam War. Robert De Niro is in this movie, as in the deer hunter, and it's very good here, like Kathy Baker. but this movie belongs to Ed Harris, who gives a powerful, emotional and impactful performance. The movie is based on a stage play and there are one or two scenes where it felt obvious to me. I mean it only for those one or two scenes it felt like I was watching a play. It wasn't a big deal and didn't really reduce the movie. this movie.it is not an epic like The Deer Hunter. They are about similar time and have similar themes, but they are two very different movies. I thought the Deer Hunter was great, and I think this movie was great too. this is the acting. in this one that makes it so good. For me, Jacknife is a 10/10
