An excellent series, Mr. Deighton, masterfully acted and directed, but unloved (told by me) and withdrawn by him to a single recital. It is now only in private collections, and via the British Film Institute at special request. Very unfortunate as Ian Holm's nuanced portrayal of tired but determined Bernard Samson is excellent; one of his best achievements. The supporting role, including young Amanda Donohoe and Hugh Fraser, is excellent. With Mel Martin playing the clashing and treacherous wife, and Michael Degen as the mercurial Werner, the story is positively simulated with the tragic and fatal personal effects of the big game.
