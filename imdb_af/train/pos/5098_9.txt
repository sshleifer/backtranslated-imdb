Even long-standing Shirley fans can be surprised by "Now and Forever." The film is filmed with Paramount studios? not with Shirley's parent company Twentieth Century Fox ?? in 1934, before Fox producer Darryl Zanuck made the successful Shirley formula perfect (cute songs, cold hearts for her to melt, young couples playing cupid for her, happy ends). So "Now and For All" falls into the category of a Shirley vehicle without the standard Shirley story. It's an awkward position for any movie, but this impressive, talented player makes it work. <br /> <br /> Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard star are loving, irresponsible artists Jerry and Toni Day. The only thing that seems to be this devious dysfunctional duo is more than being together is apart. When they suddenly landed with the custody of Jerry's young daughter Penny (Shirley Temple), is it Toni ?? and not Penny, so much believe? convincing Jerry to give up his criminal appeal. But Jerry flounders at his desk, and desperately proving he can cater for his new family, he quickly returns to theft and dishonesty. In a standard Shirley device, Penny tries to melt the heart of the crusty crown shepherd Felix Evans, one of Jerry's disadvantages, but her attempt fails because Evans is revealed to be an artist herself. He wastes Jerry to help him steal gems. The drama, gunshot, death and grief that everyone follows, make this movie a very unusual one for Little Miss Sunshine. There is no happy ending, no dance, and only one song series (the cute number "The world is my living life"). <br /> <br /> But that doesn't mean Shirley fans should avoid "Now and Forever." On the contrary, it is a departure from the regular Shirley story, making it more interesting and memorable than many of her other movies. But beware: You should avoid colored version of this movie and see it in black and white as you can. The color is bright, wreath, and unrealistic, and in many scenes Shirley's famous curls are actually red instead of blond. Yikes!
