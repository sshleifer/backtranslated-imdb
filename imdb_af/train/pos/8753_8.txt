I saw this movie in the theater, and was thoroughly impressed by it. Then again, when Claire Danes was a good actress, not the foolish, arrogant, Hollywood-hidden bitch, she is today. Anyway, this movie really hit me as one of the more raw, realistic, beautiful friendships. How far do you really go for your best friend? I was at the end of tears, and still tearing when I see it (I own it). I remember as soon as I left the theater I called my best friend and swallowed her how much I loved her. It's a great movie to watch with your best friend. However, be prepared for the almost certain conversation she is turning to you and ask if you would do something for her.
