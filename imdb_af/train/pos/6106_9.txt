Regarding the erotic genre, I'm happy to get the first 20 minutes of the plot without getting up or watching anything else. This movie is different. Julie Davis (I Love You Don't Touch Me) directed two very strong lead players Kira Reed and Doug Jeffery in this exciting thriller. Kira is convincing as "Kim" a lovely innocent novelist caught in the web of temptation of Doug Jeffery's "The Man" a handsome stranger. Kira lost control over her inhibitions in the role, and as an actress it gives what could only be another T and A depth and credibility. I believe this is her best performance yet. And Julie Davis's direction is a good gift for eroticism.
