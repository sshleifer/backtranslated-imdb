I have to disagree completely with the other comments on this movie. The visual effects complement the supernatural themes of the movie and do not detract from the plot. Furthermore, I loved how this move was, unlike Crouching Tiger, because this time the sword action has no strings attached and most of the time you can see the action now. <br /> <br /> I think western audiences will be very confused with 2 scenes one of which is a monk trying to burn him, and the other about the people who sing that it is the end of the world. The said scenes are derived from certain interpretations of Mahayana Buddhist text (Mahayana Buddhism can be found in China, Korea and Japan) and the other scene deals with the Japanese calendar. ... people thought the world would come to an end ... Gojoe has the action, story and footage to enchant any viewer. I strongly believe that with some good editing it can be sold in the US. My one complaint is in the last battle scene (I can't give anything away - sorry).
