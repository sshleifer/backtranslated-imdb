I have seen many Saura movies and have always found great ways to collect music, dance, drama and a big movie in his movies. Ib√©ria shows an even better Saura, which deals with multimedia concepts and a more contemporary concept of dance and music. Another thing that has brought me attention is the fact that dancers and musicians, dance and music are important in this movie: the camera shows various aspects of music interpretation, and not only explores technical issues, but also the emotional experience of playing . Saura's interest in the bridge between classical and contemporary music and dance is yet another ingredient to make this movie the most aesthetically exciting among his other works. That's why I highly recommend it to those who love good theater, good music, good dance, good art.
