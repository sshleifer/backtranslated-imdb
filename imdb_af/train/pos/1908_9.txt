This show is beautifully done. When it first came out, it was nothing more than a light-hearted family comedy with quite a few good one-liners. It also seems to express a lot of families, with different concepts from both parent and child, but as I said, I never thought about it again, then it is a good indication. But my view was shot from the other window when the tragic death of the fantastically funny John Ritter fell. The program has been standing and it is really priced the characters' lives in a very sensitive way. It also touched the hearts of all admirers of John Ritter, a fantastic actor with the talent to do something. When the show was broadcast after Ritters was over, I just wanted to hug my dad and let him know how much he meant to me. I thought it threw the acting talents of the three children, especially those of Bridget's character, worried about the last words she'd told him. It reminded me that it doesn't matter what terrible things I say to my dad. I don't mean it and it's very important that he knows it. Great Show
