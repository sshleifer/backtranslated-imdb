The anime that got my anime ... <br /> Set in the year 2010 (hey, it's not too far away!) The Earth is now poison gas desert of pollution and violence. To see how crimes happen every 30 seconds is so and linked by thieves who have the fire force of third world terrorists. The government of fictional New Port City forms the Tank Police to deal with the problem - police with tanks! Oh the madness! <br /> <br /> The "heroes" of this series include the new site Leona Ozaki, a red-haired Japanese woman (yes, I know, they never fit their clear Japanese names with a Japanese look) just put in the Tank Police and is fast with blonde, blue eyes, good old Al. Leona is new to the use of tanks and unfortunately she destroys the favorite tank of Tank Police Commandant Charles Britain (also known as "Brenten"), a great man who looks like steroids like Tom Selleck and some fine sunglasses, a great revolver a bad mood. Britain didn't like joining Leona at the Tank Police in the first place, and her Tiger Special (a giant green monster tank) didn't really test her. He also doesn't love her to take the remnants of his huge tank. and use it to build a mini-tank she calls at Bonaparte, and he quickly pushes her over to child welfare, "where the boys are more your size" as he puts it. There are also Specifications, the bifocal genius, Bible Hearing / God fearing Chapel, Pers-Mohican Mohican, and the Chief Tender, right on the edge, thanks to the mayor, who always screams him over the Tank Police Camps. To see how the tank police often destroy half of the city while chasing the bad guys and using extreme violence to catch them. They are not much loved by the people. <br /> <br /> The "villains" are a cyborg called Buaku who has a mysterious past related to a project known as "Green Peace", his gang and his two sexy cat cyborg sidekicks Anna & Uni Puma. In the first installment, these guys are paid to steal urine samples from a hospital that are not infected by the poisonous clouds, and in the second they are hired to steal a painting of a naked Buaku. However, the story was unfinished in the anime and was finished in a book that was very difficult to find a cult chart ("Manga"). <br /> <br /> All kinds of chaos and chaos occur in this black comic business. who investigates how far people want their police to go to catch criminals and what happens when the fine line between good guys and bad guys begins to fade. This is the kind of thing that if you make a movie of it, you'd better get Quentin Tarantino. Uneven places, but still fun. <br /> <br /> Followed by "New Dominion: Tank Police".
