While this movie has many flaws, it's actually a fun '80s movie. Eddie Murphy peeps at his 80s movies here. While his character of earlier movies is indistinguishable, his timing is almost flawless with perfect partners and foil. <br /> <br /> Link it with the hypnotic beauty of Charlotte Lewis, making for a fun rainy action comedy movie. <br /> <br />
