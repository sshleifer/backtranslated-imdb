Now that's what I call a good horror. With the occultic / supernatural undertones, this good, low-budget French film caught my attention from the very first scene. It proves that you don't need wild FX or many gore to make an effective horror movie. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around 4 cellmates in a prison, and each of these characters (and their motives) is gradually becoming more interesting, as the movie spans the final build-up. Most of the action we see through Carrere's eyes, which just went to jail, has to get used to these 3 other prisoners. <br /> <br /> I won't say much, because this movie is really being seen more commonly. However, there are some mistakes: the FX is not so good, but it is being used effectively. the plot opens some mysteries; And things get very confusing at the end, but Malefique saves him by the time it's over. <br /> <br /> I thought he was a very good movie, 8/10
