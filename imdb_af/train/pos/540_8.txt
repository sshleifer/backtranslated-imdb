actually ... the "video camera" effect, it's just, it's an effect, a pretty good one. (you don't know much about directing a movie?) This movie is actually better than the original, It's great to watch, made for TV, doesn't have to follow any rules. I find it difficult to look at number 1 because of how he kills the first girl, it is disturbing. and all the time we are on our way to Judd Nelson to get away with it, we as the viewers are on his side. One day I hope we will see a 3rd cabin at the lake, but I doubt it. Watching this movie lets you understand how real movies are made, as it is like a movie in a movie. Judd is one of the rogue villains ever, and he's more realistic. He not only kicks people like other horrors.
