The villian in this movie is one mean sob and he seems to enjoy what he does, that's what I think makes him so mean. I don't think most men will like this movie, especially if they have ever cheated on their wife. It's one of those movies that pretty much stays pretty much to the end. But then, there you have it, a candy that ends up looking me back and saying, "HOCKEY AS HELL." A little good movie to the end. End is the end we'd like to see, but not the end to such an average. And then there is the aftermath of what happened. Guess you can make your own thoughts about the real end. I felt that only one character had to survive in the end.
