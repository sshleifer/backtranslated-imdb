Homelessness (or household like George Carlin said) has been a problem for many years, but never a plan to help people on the streets ever seen as people who did everything to go to school, work or vote. Most people think of the homeless as just a lost cause, while worrying about things like racism, the war in Iraq, the pressure on children to succeed, technology, the election, inflation or worrying as they will be along the streets be. <br /> <br /> But if you've been sitting on the street for a month without the luxuries you ever had from home, the entertainment sets, a bathroom, pictures on the wall, a computer , and all you ever estimate to see how homeless it is? This is Goddard Bolt's lesson. <br /> <br /> Mel Brooks (who regulates), who is like Bolt stars, plays a rich man who has everything in the world until he decides to race a sissy rival (Jeffery Tambor). make. if he can dwell in the streets thirty days without the luxuries; If Bolt succeeds, he can do what he wants with a future project to make more buildings. The bet is where Bolt is thrown on the street with a bracelet on his leg to monitor each step where he can't walk from the pavement. He nicknamed Pepto by a vagrant after it was written on his forehead where Bolt met other characters, including a woman named Molly (Lesley Ann Warren), an ex-dancer who had divorce before she left her home. lost, and her pals Sailor (Howard Morris) and Gumes (Teddy Wilson) already used on the street. They are survivors. Bolt is not. He is not accustomed to reaching mutual agreements as he ever did when he was rich in fighting or fleeing, killing or killing. <br /> <br /> While the love affair between Molly and Bolt was not necessary to plot, I found 'Life Stinks' is one of Mel Brooks' acting films where it is a comedy before it is a comedy . It shows a soft side compared to its slapstick work such as Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein or Spaceballs for the case, to show how it is to have something valuable before losing it the next day or on the other. stupid bet as all rich people do if they don't know what to do with their money. Maybe they should give it to the homeless instead of using it like Monopoly money. <br /> <br /> Or maybe this movie will inspire you to help others.
