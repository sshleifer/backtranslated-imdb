SS Van Dine had been a smart businessman in dealing with Hollywood. Most of the movie series from the studio were usually limited to one or two studios. But Van Dine apparently had to sell his rights to every book on Philo Vance one at a time. Note that Paramount, MGM, Warner Brothers, and more all released Philo Vance movies. Just Tarzan looked at Hollywood more. <br /> <br /> MGM produced the Garden Murder Case and stepped down Edmund Lowe as the fashion detective. Of course, MGM then had the screen's original Philo under contract, but Bill Powell was doing The Thin Man at that time and I think Louis B. Mayer decided to concentrate on that. <br /> <br /> Edmund Lowe is a fairly acceptable Philo Vance. Lowe started at the tail end of the quiet era with a splendid glory and then with a series of films featuring Victor McLaglen with their Flag and Quirt characters. But after McLaglen got his Oscar for The Informer, Lowe faded into the B image market. <br /> <br /> The Murder case involves three separate victims, Douglas Walton, Gene Lockhart and Frieda Inescourt. The sinister atmosphere around the perpetrator gives it away, the mystery is really how all the murders are linked and how it is achieved. <br /> <br /> I will say so. Vance takes a very big chance of exposing the villain and the last 15 minutes Hitchcock is worthy.
