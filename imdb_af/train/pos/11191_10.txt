This frightening and rather gory adaptation of Stephen King's great novel contains excellent central performances by Dale Midkiff, Fred Gwynne (who unfortunately died several years ago) and Denise Crosby and some very horrific gore effects. Director Mary Lambert has a wonderful sense of visual style and manages to make this one of the few versions of King's work not only worth seeing but truly unnecessary. The portrayal of the zombie child Gage (Miko Hughes later in the "New Nightmare") is equally remarkable, as it can be easy. a laughable character is threatening and haunting. As for the people, who thinks this one is not scary, watch it alone in the dark (finally with your squeamish girlfriend) and I guarantee you that "Pet Sematary" will crawl you out. Some horror movies like this one or "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre" shouldn't be watched in the group. Recommend for horror fans!
