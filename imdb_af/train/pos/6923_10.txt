FIND SPOILER With the possible exception of John Wayne, no other actor put more in the ward in the Western than James Stewart, and this movie proves it. This wonderful story of revenge is centered on a Winchester gun. It only has one weak spot that I can think of: throwing Will Geer as a very un-engaging Wyatt Earp. The blasts of the villains were good: Stephen McNally, as terrible Dutch Henry, Dan Duryea as Waco Johnny Dean, and John McIntire (versatile to play both good guys and bad guys) as a smooth rifle runner. The show between Stewart and McNally on the cliffs is great! I want this Western pile against the whole crop Western made today. They won't give a chance!
