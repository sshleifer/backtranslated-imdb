I didn't expect much from this movie. I got a ticket for an advanced show. I was just off work. It was hot and I was tired. I had to wait in the movie line for 40 minutes and there was no cool air flowing through the corridors of the theater complex. <br /> <br /> Once in the theater, tired and frustrated, the movie started, I didn't recognize any of the actors at first, but the movie of the movie was perfect. From the beginning I digested with the movie, becoming more and more excited with every minute of passing. I think this movie is meant to be a fantasy / fairy tale classic. The actors were fantastic, the pass was perfect, and the end was magical.
