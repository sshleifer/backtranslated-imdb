Disney, the movie name once for all things innocent and suitable for all ages, eventually began to realize that it is necessary to survive, it needs to be more diverse. Such diversity has been very clear over the past few years. Films like "Tarzan" and "The Emperor's New Groove" have tried to move away from the traditional song-driven routine of Disney's past and to a new, unknown area. "Atlantis" is the fastest step yet, but we must remember: This is silent Disney. The first ever serious movie to come out of Disney's animation studio is a great achievement for them - in fact, it's so serious it's making it in the PG area. Perhaps there are many families who were afraid to see it this past summer. <br /> <br /> But despite the more mature subject, it's another movie that Disney wanted to dress in the families, not just adult. audiences so the plot had to be kept simple enough for children to understand, but interesting enough to take it away from the realm of "The Little Mermaid" et al. <br /> <br /> So what we get is actually a potentially detailed plot, which unfortunately suffers from condensation in a 96-minute movie. Ultimately, it's an action movie about Atlantis, not the outline that precedes it, so we are beaten by the first half hour with as many sequences bombarding the screen as possible without losing coherence. Brace your unbelief about how characters move so fast from point A to point B, you probably won't find an animated movie coming out of Hollywood! If you want epic levels of detail in the plot, turn to James Cameron's "Titanic". Both films have a boat somehow. <br /> <br /> And we're talking about love, will we? Yes, as with many movies, the chief (one Milo Thatch, an eagle archaeologist) and a female woman (Kida, the clichéd Atlantic princess), fall in love with each other. But what I found was not as clichéd as I expected. By the end of the film, the touching / feeling / kissing characters were once more muted. There are several points in the film where the attraction grows, but it's not just in the ballpark of, say, "The Little Mermaid". <br /> <br /> You may have understood that it's a better click movie. Correct. You've got your leading hero and heroine backed by more than half a dozen crew members going on the expedition, and everyone gets their moments during the movie. Several other characters appear, take up the few minutes of the screens and then disappear. It doesn't take a genius to do the math ?? A 96-minute movie focusing on action and visual, and with a significant role, has little time to expand the characters to any extent. So what does this mean? Clichés, and many of them. Each character emulates something that has been done a thousand times before. You have the fascinating scientist, the attractive princess, the square colonel, the rich eccentric, the maniacal sleazebag, the Russian femme fatale ?? should I continue? <br /> <br /> I don't know why it was someone? I found the tongue-in-the-cheek nature of this movie quite amusing. Well, it's meant to be a serious movie, but do you really expect Disney to give up every feature of their history? At least, the authors have tried to come up with consistently spectacular dialogue, and sometimes it's even a little inspired. <br /> <br /> But ultimately, it's the great impressive visuals that place the icing on this cake. The CGI animation is really great in places, and does not dwarf the characters, which was a mistake the recent "Titan A.E." late. off. Disney has created an outside cartoon artist to create the designs and anime style of the film. Infact the visual presentation of the film as a whole is very much due to anime, much more than any previous Disney outing. This led to a conflict with fans of the Japanese anime, "Nadia", for the film's overall resemblance to the said cartoon. If I didn't see this anime, I couldn't comment. <br /> <br /> Picture is sound. Gary Rydstrom heads up the sound team, and what a soundtrack! From the opening shot, the sound stage is alive and is a surprise. James Newton Howard treats us to a dynamic musical score that complements the film in every way, never sounds out of place and always helps to build or subject the tension. Maybe I missed the point the creators mean. For me, the movie is known to be an adventure thrill ride, though with a more serious tone than any Disney movie before that. If you don't like the cut language-in-the-cheek attitude, then the effort put into the graphics will be wonderful. The mythology is anyway much more correct than can be said about other Disney efforts (* cough * Hercules * cough *). <br /> <br /> It's a positive, 10 out of 10 review, from someone who has been blown away by this movie. I always suspend my unbelief with any animated movie? The laws of the real world are broken more than often in the cartoon medium. So sit back, enjoy the ride, and maybe everyone can find something to enjoy this movie.
