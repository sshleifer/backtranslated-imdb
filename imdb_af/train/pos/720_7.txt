Just think of what school would have been like in a world like this: the kids are one big gang that has great taste in music and is united against bad heads and teachers. "Rock 'n' Roll High School" takes place in the world. It's like a Ramones record that comes to life. The characters are all as stupid, innocent and beautiful as the Ramones songs, and the music itself is of course fantastic. High school comedies have really changed over the years, if you compare a movie like 'American Pie' with this late 70's classic, where no tasteless sex jokes are made. As a remake seems to be in the works, it can probably be expected that the charm of the original along the way will be lost and replaced by vulgar, half-funny dick jokes, as Bill Hicks used it. However, the biggest problem would be that the Ramone could NOT be replaced. They were the perfect band for this movie and no one else could even get close to taking their place. So, the best thing to do would be to leave the original alone, neat and beautiful as it is. Gabba-gabba hey!
