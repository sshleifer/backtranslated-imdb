I don't understand the low 5.7 rating on this movie. It is a pleasure for people who want a strong tension spot and dark atmosphere. The tone is reminiscent of midnight in the garden of good and evil, up to the room (Savannah). The acting is strong, and I was amazed at the veracity of Kenneth Branagh's southern accent. Famke Jansen is wonderful, Robert Duval is in a small part, and Embeth Davitz is the BOMB. Big, full nude scene of her too. <br /> <br /> The plot is fairly standard but effectively executed.
