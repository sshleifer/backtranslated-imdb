This is definitely one of my all-time fav episodes from Trek. There is so much going on in this one movie that it's crazy. First, the guys come down to an alien planet that is about to explode. They meet a freaky librarian-type man (played very well). Then Kirk succeeds in transporting himself back to what is much like the 16th century earth. McCoy and Spock are trying to follow, but almost freeze on the frozen version of the alien world 100,000 years in the past. Kirk manages to get himself locked up and accused of witchcraft, while Spock is enjoying himself with a sexy cave girl found by a bad man at this frozen, terrible world. <br /> <br /> Spock decides he's happy when he comes and gives McCoy a royal test if the doctor says they should look for a way out. Anyway, they all finally escape, leaving the poor cave girl behind. It finally takes a lot of convincing before Spock finally in and leave. You can literally taste the sadness at the end. Leaving the cave female alone in her frozen desert just seems cruel and really touches. Spock had to be from his folk spirit to leave his greatest hope for love and humanity. Anyway, in a not so beautiful environment! <br /> <br /> Anyway, you get as much fear for your money with this episode .... A love story, the Salem gate trials, Spock as a human, the desperate to leave in total isolation is leaving ... and three completely different institutions on the alien planet. She managed to jam it all in a fifty-minute movie. This one is a classic, don't miss it .... I want it on DVD barn volcano !!!!!!
