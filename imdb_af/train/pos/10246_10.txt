This movie should be my favorite of all time. It's not supposed to have a plot, because his makers wanted people (Charlie Sheen, I think) believe that it was a real snap movie. It was an exercise in visual effects, and didn't cut away when the action happened like any other movie. Movies nowadays are about sound effects, and that makes the footage made by computers, because it's easier to go with CGI blood. There are still filmmakers who still can't get fake blood to look like the right thing. There is no rape scene, as it was not the point to make the film. Have you seen the hills have eyes? The rape scene was funny instead of shocking. Although I am sure, there are a few GONZO porn movie makers trying to marry pornography with horror. But as they probably suck to make movies, they probably won't be able to pull it. The movie "Baise Moi" has a disturbing rape scene, because the actresses are actually porn stars and they show everything, though the film sucks. <br /> <br /> It's too bad a movie can't be made without thinking about the money aspect of it all, especially if you're talking about an AO or NC-17 rating. I'm sure Eli Roth has the ability / talent to make his Hostel movie series much better, but he's too short of getting an R rating ... or at least I hope she sucks movies because of these restrictions. <br /> <br /> If you don't want fair footage (accident and crime scenes / footage), see Traces of Death or More than Broken Pumpkins. Don't forget that this movie was made in 1985. The fact that this movie is still rising against most shit made today says a lot about this movie. It will be like someone who says the 8bit Super Mario Brothers sucks because the PS3 has better graphics.
