I just bought the restored version of a movie that I remember with great love from childhood and it definitely made for a wonderful afternoon's entertainment. Bedknobs definitely make more sense in its complete form, the scrapped plays (especially those with McDowall) link neatly together. What's a bit disturbing is the way the screens are remastered. Clearly, the soundtrack to these footage has been lost or damaged, such a fierce spark at Disney has decided to obscure the screens with new dialogue. It would have been good except that half of the cast wasn't around to do it (some for better reasons than others) and the whole thing has a pretty good quality of it. Some of the lip sync is pretty poor, and David Tomlinson's voice is called by a blocker, which sounds absolutely nothing like David Tomlinson (there is actually an indication of the Germans in it). However, it is good to hear the full versions of all the songs (although 'Step in the right direction' is still absent) and the moments of magic in this movie still shine. And I challenge you not to giggle when young Paul looks so innocent at Angela Lansbury and Coos "but what does it have to do with my button?"
