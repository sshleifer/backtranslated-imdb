Ayone who looks at how this movie is crazy or that it did not have a plot, was looking for "Jean de Florrette". Hello! This movie is made to be a random comedy of comedy and in no way involves a plot in any form or form. I would also like to remind these whiners that if you want to flutter the crap out of this movie, they seem to miss the point. This film is made clear to people who do not appreciate the so-called "American humor", which just seems to me a pile of nice shit. The point is that everyone has an opinion and you should be a little more appreciative that some people's sense of humor may not be in line with your own before shooting your mouth. <br /> <br /> Thank you
