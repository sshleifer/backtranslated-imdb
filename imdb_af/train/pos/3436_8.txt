Letters with no destination end up in another world found in the back rooms of the post office. Here Alice manages a job hoping to find her lost father. What she discovers is the tormented soul of her boss, Frank. A quiet Aussie movie that came and went to the theater. Now you'll find it in the deep dark corner of the video store, overshadowed by fifty copies of the dreaded GODZILLA movie. It is a pity that it seems to be a satisfying film that tells a brave story with strong simple images and effective actions by the two leaders. This film succeeds where Garry Marshall's other dead letter office movie Dear God (1996 USA) failed, and comes close to the glory, not the Kevin Costner turkey, but He Jianjun's POSTMAN (1995 - China).
