I saw Mystery Men police a little stick in the press and with the general public (for example, the imdb voice), but my overall feeling is that Mystery Men is more fun than most movies, definitely whiter than most so-called comedy movies and very almost 'smart'. <br /> <br /> The movie is excellent; Greg Kinnear is excellent, like Geoffrey Rush and Tom Waits. Kinnear's limo scene with Ricky Jay is a perfect 'spoiled movie star' and he impresses his character with the right balance of comic book quality and realism to make him work. <br /> <br /> I will admit that the pacing is a bit off In places, and footage is definitely a very flashy bang, possibly to the detriment of further characterization, but in the end it is a high concept film production . It's about the moments: "What is Tiger Lily?" - and there is so much in this movie to appreciate this repeated look.
