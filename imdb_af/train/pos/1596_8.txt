Although Cher and Cage are the focal points of this story, Gardenia and Dukakis are good counterparts to them. That's where Loretta and Ronny will be in 50 years - still in love. The whole role-play does a good job from Aiello to John Mahoney - it shows a real piece of life. Although I have seen it for a long time, I am glad that Kage eventually hijacked to the place where he was recognized for his talent in Hollywood. From the music to the scenes at the opera to the kitchen table arguments - this is a very entertaining movie.
