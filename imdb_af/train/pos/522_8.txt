A wonderful movie by Powell and Pressburger, whose work I want to explore now. The film is about what we regard as real and what is real and how the two can be so difficult to distinguish. Beautifully shot and acted, although David Niven is not 27 years old, as his character claimed. Nice to see a very young Richard Attenborough. This movie made me think while watching it and afterwards.
