This movie surprised me in a good way. From the box I got the impression that it was an action thriller, but it was too funny to be excited, even if it was a bit exciting. <br /> <br /> There are many nice one-liners and funny situations in this movie and James Belushi was born to do Bill Manucci, he does a good job. The rest of the role-play is also not half-bad and Timothy Dalton is a surprise. <br /> <br /> The story can sometimes be disappointing as new characters appear during the movie. Things become more complicated as no one seldom tells the truth about things. If you didn't pay attention, things could be a little messy, but I really loved it. <br /> <br /> Louis Morneau is not so well known, but he has done a great job with this one. and I never really became impatient while watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Made men are worth checking out.
