I saw Sundance in Park City on Friday (1/19) and I was incredibly moved. To sit in a theater and hear first hand, the anxiety soldiers go through, was almost more than I could carry. Others in the audience were equally moved and while we wanted to turn away, the least we could do was testify to the fact that these men and women shared their experience with us. Robert Acosta, Paul Rieckhoff, Sean Huze, and Herold Noel, all the veterans of the Iraq war and the film, were present. While at home, you can say this war is still in them and will probably always be. Whether you support the war or not, it is our duty to support the troops with something other than a bumper sticker. See this movie!
