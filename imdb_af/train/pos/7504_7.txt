Hey guys, I'm actually in this movie! I didn't even know it was on this site until I looked a few years ago and I was so surprised! I played Pete, the main character boy. It was a good experience and I loved it every minute. During the filming they needed me to be in two places at the same time, so they used my twin sister as a body double! The finger pushing the radio button in the car is why it is not mine. I still act and do TV, but not so much. Oh, and if you want proof, my name is the first one at the top of the scroll. <br /> <br /> Overview: I thought the movie was good, but if I wasn't in it, it wouldn't be one. of my favorites. I thought the acting was really good, but the story line was just like that.
