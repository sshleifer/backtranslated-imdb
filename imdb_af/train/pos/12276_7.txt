Can such a surrounding production fail its primary goal, namely to correctly adapt Allende's novel? Of course yes. Bille Augustus has succeeded in making a shallow, shallow film where basic elements of South American mentality are simply presented as gatherings, leading to total incoherence. I can't believe there was a whole production team that couldn't understand the book! There is of course technical quality in this movie and I think the actors did their best with what they had in their hands, but there was something missing. And this was the most important part.
