I saw this movie with my dad. I should have been a little young, about 15. It was an afternoon at Star Movies. The movie started a bit vaguely, but you can see that the robbers come together for a score. It just got caught after the first half hour. <br /> <br /> All actors are big, especially Blades and Lou Diamond. I think it's the ensemble, they play just as well together. I can see this movie anytime. I think it's the relative stupidity of the plot and the characters are trying to handle a very strange score. The jokes are not wheat, but they are subtle and extreme at the same time they are so hilarious. <br /> <br /> A perfect comedy for a lazy afternoon.
