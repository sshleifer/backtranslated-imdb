High school friends Andre Kriegman and Cal Gabriel declare war against their classmates and plan a frightening assault on their high school. As they begin with the deadly countdown to their final act of revenge, the two begin a video diary to explain their feelings and proclaim their mission. <br /> <br /> There is another similar film like this, called Elephant. Why do I bring it up? To compare the two movies, of course. I have to say, though I liked "Elephant", it's a much better movie. What is the difference, you ask? Well, to start with, it's shot differently, much according to the lines of Cloverfield, Blair Witch Project and the Diary of the Dead. This makes the movie better, as it is much more painfully realistic. <br /> <br /> But what conquered me was how the movie was willing to show the "other side of the story." You learn to know these two shooters, unlike "Elephant." I actually cared for one of the shooters and could understand their actions and why they did what they did. This movie actually makes you sympathetic to these people and that's a good thing, because it's not always black and white. <br /> <br /> To be honest, that's why I almost cried in this movie. The characters are true people with logic and reasons behind their actions. You understand them. It's not like they want to kill people for attention. Overall, this film is emotionally gripping and very ghostly and much better than "Elephant."
