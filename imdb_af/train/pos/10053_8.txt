I must admit, when I read the description of the genre on Netflix as "Steamy Romance", I was a little skeptical. "Steaming"? In a 1968 movie ?? I was ready for disappointment. And when I realized that it was all shot in black and white, I knew my erotic hope was bumped. <br /> <br /> Boy, was I wrong! Not only does this film have all the elements of a steamy romance - the discovery of the first love, the fear of secret is invented, a sudden unexpected end - but this movie is sometimes erotic. You'll soon forget it's been shot in black and white. The cinematography deserves every award it has received over the years. And the performances of the two stars (Essy Persson and Anna Gael) are intense and memorable. OK, so they are both in the middle of the twenties and are trying to play schoolgirls. It's 1968. Do you really expect 60s teens to explore such a lesbian love story so effectively? Many adult women have still tried to tackle their sexuality. Anyone looking for real teens expects too much. <br /> <br /> I think this movie was far from his time. The erotic level was an unexpected pleasure; but it has nevertheless succeeded in giving much imagination, preferring to give rather poetic descriptions to add to what we have been shown. <br /> <br /> I have no doubt that lesbians will identify with the characters here. As for you straight guys who like to watch lesbians in action: Although not everything you expect, I think you won't be disappointed either.
