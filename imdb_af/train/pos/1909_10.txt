I originally watched 8 simple rules on the Disney Channel UK for the first series and got totally addicted. When they no longer showed it, it was very irritable, but then they showed the 2nd series. I didn't think another series would start after I read John Ritter's death, but the 2nd series wasn't great. The latest range is back to its excellent standard. I hope they will produce more performances soon, although I can see a thousand times every time. Kaley couco is my favorite character as airhead Bridget and also performs wonderfully in Charmed. Rory is also good, he shares my name and Grampa as well. I'll keep on watching until it ends up until then, I hope it's going as funny as ever
