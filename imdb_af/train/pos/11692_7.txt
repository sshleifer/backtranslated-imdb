I'm not saying I just want to say a Chris Rock fan as a low-expectation person in this movie and that's wrong. The first mistake was it was all-work-out that ended that everyone saw it coming. Error number two was I found that the chemistry between Regina King and Chris Rock was fake. Finally, the play in this movie was subordinate, with best actor Regina King and the worst being Mark Addy. but I saw that mistake and saw a solid comedy. In a heads-up scenario, watch the sky wait, it's better. So for all your Chris Rock fans out there, WATCH THIS MOVIE, you'll enjoy. He has good performance in this movie. <br /> <br /> Overall: 7 out of 10
