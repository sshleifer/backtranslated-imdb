I recently rented this document, as I remembered hearing it from IMDb.com and being the point of departure. I didn't know many of these tires very much, but I remember the time to hear "The Dandy Warhols was the last junkie on earth" and enjoyed it. It is said, this is my perspective on the document: <br /> <br /> One thing I found amazing about this movie is that it is not necessary to have any prior knowledge of any of these links. The director (Ondi Timoner) doesn't waste time entering the audience and familiarizing himself with the people in this movie. I quickly grew to the lives of Anton and Courtney as well as their respective bands, The Brian Jonestown Massacre and The Dandy Warhols. I think it's part of what makes this document so good, and what makes Ondi Timoner such a master documentary. <br /> <br /> I also loved how the "story" of these groups was told. Most of what you see is from the bands on tour. Both bands start playing small places and struggle to make it into the recording industry. During the film, each group strives to remain unique and unmanaged according to the norm. But this is what makes the two tires similar, and therefore the brilliant perspective on how two bands of a spring can go in such different directions. <br /> <br /> I would basically recommend it to anyone who likes film in general. You don't have to have a specific love for documentaries, or one of the bands. An appreciation for music help, but the music itself takes a backdrop to the love / hate relationship between The Brian Jonestown Massacre and The Dandy Warhols.
