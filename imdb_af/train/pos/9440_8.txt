"Liberation" is one of the best exploitation sites to come out of the wonderful 1970s, from which so many other exploits came. <br /> <br /> A group of friends are sitting on a canoe trip under a river in the south and they are plagued by a bunch of toothless hillbells that really try to destroy their lives. It is wonderful. <br /> <br /> We are treated to anal rape, evil addictions, bow and arrow murders, shooting, broken legs, etc. ... much like 1974's "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" to say that "Liberation" is credible would be immature. It could never and never happened, even in the dark ages of 1972. <br /> <br /> "Liberation" is a very entertaining ride and full of action. It is one of a great heap of mining films coming from the early 70's, and it's probably at the top of the podium with its great acting, excellent cinematography and excellent writing. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10, kids.
