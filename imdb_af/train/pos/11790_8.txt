David Lynch's new card is a very Lynchian piece, full of darkness, tension, silence, strategically but very textured background music. He again has two beautiful actresses, a blonde and a brunette, a recurring theme in his work. <Br /> <br /> Both characters create a very intriguing slave lover relationship that can be seen as a direct follow-up to the same kind of relationship that occurs in Mulholland Dr. <br /> <br /> Beautiful. For Lynch fan's. <br /> <br />
