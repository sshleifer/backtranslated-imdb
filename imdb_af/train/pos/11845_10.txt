I really like both Shrek movies. (Since they are both "PG" and have words in them, I'll never tell myself, so I didn't like them.) <br /> <br /> But when it comes to "Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron ", which I scarcely watched for the first time last month, I became a fan of animation films, except Pixar. *** Spoilers submit *** In "Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron," a horsefire is born and eventually becomes the leader of his audience. One night he saw a strange light in the distance, and he left there. These actions eventually lead to his capture, and several other things. Throughout the movie we hear a story. It is through the minds of Spirit, though the horses never speak. That's what makes the movie goo. They (the filmmakers) responded to real horses doing the sounds made by the horses; None of those sounds were made by humans. <br /> <br /> Spirit meets Rain, a beautiful mare, and Little Creek, a native American who owns Rain. Little Creek later releases Spirit and Rain, they go home. <br /> <br /> I've never been a big fan of Brian Adams, but I'm planning to buy the soundtrack to this movie in the near future. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie and you won't regret it. My Score: 10/10
