If there were two more beautiful artists than Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith who appeared in a more beautiful film in 1968, I don't know who they were. I first saw a beautiful satirical jewel 25 years ago at the age of 16 and I see a year in which I have not sat to see it again a mess. It is intelligent, peculiar, neat, capricious, sweet, softly subversive, and totally captivating. The romance of these two social misfits are both richly comic and terribly moving - never more than Maggie Smith's desperate attempt to pick up the right card in the deck, a scene that is both pretty funny and a perfect miniature portrait of heartbreaking loneliness is. And that final freezer on Ustinov's anxious, worried, loving face as he asks, "Are you right?" - Has anyone ever made the appearance and sound of dedication so perfect and naked? I never want to know anyone who didn't love this movie.
