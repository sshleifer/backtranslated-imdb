"Dressed To Kill" is one of the best thrillers ever made. Managing sex and violence makes it an adult movie. Brian De Palma once again proves why no other director can match his use of the camera to tell a story. He does many scenes without dialogue and tells a lot about his story, strictly through the use of his visual arts, and Pino Donnagio's brilliant score. Filmed in Panavision, the film has to be seen in widescreen, as De Palma uses the entire width of the film to tell his story. Cut up, on video, "Dressed To Kill" is hardly the same movie. Fixed shows from his cast, beautiful direction, and perhaps the best movie score ever written, make "Dressed To Kill" a must see.
