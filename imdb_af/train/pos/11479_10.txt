This movie was excellent, a bit scary, but excellent about it. For those who have heard of columbine and know the story, it gives you an idea of ​​what and why these children did what they did. In the rear, you know that people think of these things, but you never realize just how bad it is, and this movie makes you realize. It's serious as well. It also lets you think twice before making fun of someone who is sure. I read a book about the column killings and it made me think. This movie worries me and makes me scary. To the detriment it is like a way to kill someone's guide for serial killers. I recently got a threat, and I blew it to think nothing of it, but to this movie I think you should take everything seriously. Some people are crazy and you never know where they are, so take it seriously and don't estimate someone.
