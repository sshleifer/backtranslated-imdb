I only saw the Drugs Years on VH1 and I love it. I think it reflects the drug history very well and most importantly it has a strong message to the generations. There is woodstock, there are Joplin, Hendrix and Jim Morrison's deaths. There are many examples of drug use and drug abuse. It completely covers the timeline and evolution of drug use in America in both good and bad ways. In my opinion, this documentary is well done and I would like to congratulate his creators because it is exactly what is needed to play in the TV today. I'm waiting for the DVD edition. You should definitely see it !!! This movie is stunning - GREAT TIME!
