This game is one of the best RPGs. Fist, it is actually more amusing than any other because of the combat system (you are harming the enemy, depending on how you attempt the attack, you can turn into the dragon, the special attack, the magic ...). The writing is very good. Characters are all fun and you don't have a long dialogue to support, like in several Final Fintasy series games. I got bored with the dialogue about the past, if you just want to continue with the game's story. Ambientation is a jewel in this game, combining medieval fantasy with futuristic science fiction. It is remarkable that animation effects are just incredible, I like them more in other modern games (we can't remember Legend of the Dragoon being 8 years old). Then Map is big, there are all kinds of places an enemy. Lastly, music is not the best game mouse I've heard, but it's perfect for a game like this.
