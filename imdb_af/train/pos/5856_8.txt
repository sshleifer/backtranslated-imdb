Rated E (Contains Violence). <br /> <br /> For some years I have had the original spiderman game for the computer. I haven't hit it yet, because on Windows XP there's a glitch on one level that I can't beat because of it. So be warned if you are XP. But for those who don't have XP, this game makes an effort. This is a fun family game with action and it is ideal for any spiderman fan.In the game you play spiderman and you take on several criminals who commit crimes. Silver is a fun game and I recommend it to any spiderman fan or parent who wants a fun, clean game for their kids. <br /> <br /> 8/10
