This movie was highly entertaining. The soundtrack (Bian Adams) is simply beautiful and inspiring. Even more impressive is that Brian Adams does all the songs in French. The score is also exciting and dramatic. <br /> <br /> The movie is made up of a blend of traditional animation combined with computer-generated images. The result is truly amazing. I watch with my children at least once a week and we should not be tired of it. The story is compelling and good narrative. <br /> <br /> I don't understand anyone who would rank this movie less than a 7. Definitely a custodian in my household.
