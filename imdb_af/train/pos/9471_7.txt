Steve Carell plays Dan Burns, newspaper's uncle and dedicated single father to three girls. Returning to a large family, Dan meets his perfect wife, just to find out she is in a relationship with his brother. <br /> <br /> What is a man to do? <br /> <br /> I'd rather love "Then in real life", but I think the success or otherwise of this movie is going to be whether you are willing to accept Steve Carell who is a relatively straightforward and complex role play rather than go through the broad comedy movements. made him so successful. If you can't accept it, don't worry, "Get Smart" will be later this year, but for the record I thought he was very good. <br /> <br /> "Then In Real Life" starts like you typically, amusing, family drama, but it gets louder and louder as it goes and Carell's frustration with his situation grows. It is not massive originally (but if you only saw movies with original ideas, the screens would be very scarce.) But "Dan In Real Life" is entertaining and a good role (which would not fall in love with the first face with the light Juliette Binoche?) make the most of an insightful enough writing that contains much about the meaning and passion of love. <br /> <br /> I hope Steve Carell pushes himself and does something interesting again.
