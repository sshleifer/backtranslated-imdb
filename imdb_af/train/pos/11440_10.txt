I saw Rivers and Tides again today. This is the second time in two days and yes, I see movies that I like so many times. Yesterday I was struck by the splendor of the images and Goldsworthy's works. This morning when I threw the coins, I received # 29 The Abysmal (Water). Goldsworthy has an affinity with water, hence the title. I changed the 5th line that moved to # 7 The Army. Blake Art was a war. Anyway, I knew I had to see the movie again. <br /> <br /> I read one of the few reviews available online from the SF Examiner. The critic loved the movie, but said Goldsworthy's remarks had come in the way of his enjoyment of the movie. He'd rather just have the images and the wonderful soundtrack. So I was aware of this when I looked this second time. <br /> <br /> Yesterday I thought I'd vote for Andy Goldsworthy as King of the World. Well today I can get a bit past the images and listen to what he had to say. Can I enjoy the movie without his comment? What he does is go far beyond "art". His understanding of Water, Time, Stone, Change, and on and on made me think the man is the reincarnation of Lao Tsu or an Avatar. His work / words are Zen like. His knowledge ... <br /> <br /> In any case, the movie is only shown here (apparently) in the Bay Area. Be a Trend Setter. Go to your local theater and tell them, don't insist that they have a movie that you've heard from the backlands. It's called Rivers and Tides. <br /> <br />
