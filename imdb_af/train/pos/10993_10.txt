This movie is a jewel because it moves with soft but solid resolution. <br /> <br /> I note that while being billed as a Corporate Spy thriller, and Ms Liu is there, it moves at a deliberate, but calm pace. It's not about explosions, car hunting or flying bullets. You have to be patient and instead, pay attention to the details here. It's calm because it's the main character. The viewer must see him and think if this story unfolds. <br /> <br /> I won't give spoilers because it destroys the point to watch. The plot is what you read from the other posts: an average white-collar man looking for change and adventure, signs up for corporate espionage. Just go somewhere and secretly record records and submit them. <br /> <br /> Take it from there. <br /> <br /> This movie begins at a surrealistic walk - with a backdrop of corporate disillusionment that connects with the distinctive, underlying suburban paranoia. <br /> <br /> Then it starts accelerating. <br /> <br /> The action on all parts is wonderful - and yes, some of the acts are caricature characters. But they fit everyone and entertain them. And the light piano rhythm in the background is perfect like the soft, soft key sinister theme: Everything is not right at the beginning. <br /> <br /> And at the end: Everything is not what it seems. <Br /> <br /> Get comfortable and turn off the lights to see this one - and pick up the sound: This movie wants you to listen.
