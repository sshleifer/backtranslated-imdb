Sweet and charming, funny and enjoyable, plot less but meaningful, "Before Sunrise" (1995), the third film by Richard Linklater, is dedicated to anyone who ever fell in love, is in love, or never fell in love, but still has dreams of it and hope to find it. This is one of the very rare movies that will / will / will be equally interesting for teenagers, their parents and even grandparents. It seems like a very simple little movie with no spectacular visual effects, car hunting or long and steamy sex scenes. Two young people in their early 20s, two college students (American tourist Ethan Hawke returning to Europe in summer and French student Julie Delpy going to Paris to attend classes in Sorbonne) meet on a train. They are immediately attracted to each other, even before they start talking, they jump out of the train in Vienna where they explore the city all night long. They talk and fall in love. That's it, it's the movie. It could have been boring and stupid, but it's a beautiful, credible, clever and moving romance that just gets better with every viewer (at least for this viewer). High praise and my sincere gratitude go to the director and writers for delivering two charming characters, excellent writing, always interesting and witty dialogues, two fantastic performances and the atmosphere of magic that falls in love. Julie Delpy, who looks like a Botticelli's angel, is excellent in portraying smart, independent and incredibly attractive young women.
