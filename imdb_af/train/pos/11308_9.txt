TCM keeps me awake all the time ... they keep on watching movies I've never heard of ... Senso .... now Ossessione ... a very early movie by Visconti !! ... wow ... the Italian version of The Postman Altyd Rings Twice ... brilliant !! beautifully acted and directed ... Never heard of leaders who were excellent, Clara Calamai, as Giovanna, and especially Massimo Girotti as Gino ... what a sensual man !! more muscular and attractive than anyone else on the screen in 1943 !!! His appearance was before his time ... many masculine stars from the 1950s were probably inspired by him ... he had to be a great global star !! The movie is much better than the Jack Nicholson / Jessica Lange version and less glamorous than the MGM version (which I really like) with John Garfield and Lana Turner remembering that white outfit? who can forget .... This Italian version is different .. more realistic and with a completely different end ... see it look ... I'll buy it !!
