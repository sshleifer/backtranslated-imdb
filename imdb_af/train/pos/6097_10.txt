I don't see how you can say Freddy's Nightmares stocking and a rip-off. Of course you don't know good TV when you see it. The episodes are full of drama and blood. Freddy is creative in the way he kills people. I love Freddy's Nightmares and I hope to get all 44 episodes on DVD. The best episodes are: Saturday Night Special, School Daze and Love Stinks. If you think this series sucks then you are entitled to your opinion, but remember it's just your opinion and that means nothing. Freddy's Nightmares will always be one of the best ranges and you will soon accept that fact. If you don't like it, don't see it, but don't deny it brilliantly.
