First, don't go to the Revolver and expect another Snatch or Lock Stock. It's another kind of gangster movie. <br /> <br /> I saw the gala the other night and this movie definitely split the audience. It's the kind of movie where half of the audience will think. WHAT was it? It was terrible, and the other half would think. WHAT was it? It was cool. Personally, I like movies I don't understand, viz. Mullholland Drive, and Common Suspect, so I enjoyed Revolver. <br /> <br /> It was definitely not perfect. I saw how the big twist came a mile away, at least a part of it, and although sometimes a few unexplained points were good, Revolver made quite a few questions inexplicable because it didn't look right . Also, some scenes, such as the animation, and the scene where Sort goes on a deadly spree (actually one of my favorites), although amazing scenes to watch, seem to be just because they were wonderful to watch , not because they fit. with the movie. <br /> <br /> But there were also very good things. I thought the acting was excellent from all the major actors, Jason Stratham, Ray Liotta, Vincent Pastore, and even Andre Benjamin (who was a pleasant surprise). This movie certainly kept my interest, with one big, exciting, action-packed scene after another. When Ray Liotta was kept under the table, you should see it. The script was very well done, and the soundtrack, like most Guy Ritchie movies, was wonderful. <br /> <br /> Although a step among the movies like Fight Club, Mullholland Drive and Usual Suspects, it was still an incredibly fast, psychic, action movie, with many twists and turns and scenes that you will remember long after the movie is over.
