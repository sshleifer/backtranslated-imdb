This well-known story of an older man / younger woman is surprisingly difficult. Bikers, hippies, free love and jail bait surprisingly well in this forgotten black and white indie attempt. Lead actress Patricia Wymer, as the titular "Candy," gives the best performance of her career (tension all 3 enrollment epics). Wymer was provisional and picked up in THE YOUNG GRADE (1971), but gave a more serious performance in THE BABYSITTER. The occasional violence and periodic nudity is somewhat surprising, but well dealt with by the director. Leads Wymer and George E. Carey sell the May / December romance credibly. There are enough similarities between THE BABYSITTER and THE YOUNG GRADUATES to wonder if the same director also made the latter film clear. Patricia Wymer, where are you? <br /> <br /> From Wywyk, WA, Miss Wymer appeared as a dancer on the TV rock and roll show MALIBU U, before digging the cover (as well as in an eight page spread) of August , 1968 edition of "Best For Men", a tasteful adult-only magazine. She also appeared in the popular 1969 cult switch THE WITCHMAKER. <br /> <br /> The BABYSITTER finally made its debut in the home as part of the eight-film BCI box DRIVE-IN CULT CLASSIC VOL. 3, available from Amazon.com and some retailers like Best Buy.
