A serious comedy. Ross Hunter-made movie version of the French play "Les Joies de la famille" (later on "A Very Rich Woman") is beautiful, well-cast, sometimes funny ... and unfortunately timeless. A wealthy California widow, apparently releasing her money, is fed by her two grown, greedy daughters. Both are afraid that Mama Rosie will indulge in her inheritance. The whole thing of a vital but older woman, sent to a hustle and bustle afterwards and later to be wise in a court hearing, is persistent material for a comedy (and his credit, director David Lowell Rich do not overload the picture with crass gags or clear sentiment). Some of the humor is a bit broad and does not work, but Rosalind Russell understands the gravity inherent in this scenario and never touches a false note. Sandra Dee is also good as Rosalind's granddaughter, and James Farentino is very charming as a young lawyer. The film has so much to say about the importance of our elderly, and the ways in which they choose to spend their remaining time, that the seriousness of the "Rosie!" -Theme almost falls in love with a happy ending. The picture makes you smile - and at the same time wondering how many older ladies there are who have never been so happy. *** of ****
