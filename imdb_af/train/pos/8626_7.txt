"Der Todesking" is not exactly the kind of movie that makes you happy? Jörg Buttgereit's second cult monument in a row, which is actually much better than the infamous "Nekromantik", consists of seven short episodes ?? one for every day of the week ?? turn on unrelated people's suicide. Between these already disturbing episodes, Buttgereit adds truly horrific images of a severely decomposing male body. The episodes are not all equally strong, but as a healthy, "Der Todesking" is high on the list of all kinds of most depressing art house films. Especially the episodes on Wednesday, in which a man explains his sexual frustrations to a total stranger in the park, and one of Sunday, focusing on a younger man who kills him to death, is extremely intense and devastating to observe. The added value of this movie, or any other shock-like similar, is debatable and I don't even know if Buttught had any message to communicate here. There is a vague mention of a horrible chain letter that encourages readers to commit suicide, but most of the time we remain unaware of the people's motivation to end their lives so dramatically. Quite different to what I expected, "Der Todesking" is not exploitation or repulsive graphically! On the contrary, I never hoped Buttgereit would be so subtle and considerate of the depiction of pure human misery. The Thursday episode is a perfect example of this, as it shows stylishly different views of a famous German bridge, while the names, ages and occupations of people stormed on the screen appear on the screen. The production values ​​are inevitably poor and the editing often has professionalism, but that's not what really matters in this kind of cinema. The subject is strong and compels us to consider the less cheerful? but also indispensable ?? aspects of life. Great use of tragic music!
