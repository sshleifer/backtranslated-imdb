Rain or shine outside, you enter a movie house. It makes you happy. (If not, come straight.) Lights go off. You sit down with a bar of ice cream. Moving pictures start flashing on the screen. You feel content. In the dark you are back in the early days. To sit the campfire, watch the modern version of the flashing flames 24 times a second and share the joy of discovering the unknown turn and turning the scenario with the rest of your clan / spectators. <br /> <br /> Those who are not happy with themselves should not comment. (Live vibrant romantic comedies ...)
