The title of this movie was taken from a party game called "Seven Minutes in Heaven." The game was popular with my husband's friends when he was in high school in Brooklyn, NY. He describes it as something like "Spin-the-Bottle", "Lifesaver Relay" and other preteen kiss games. According to the rules, a boy's name and a girl will be drawn, and the elect will order to come in a dark closet and stay there for seven minutes. Meanwhile, there would be speculation among party guests or the two had the nerve to handle, hug and / or kiss each other in the privacy of the cupboard. At the end of seven minutes, the game manager would say, "Time's up" or knock on the cupboard door, and the couple will come out of the closet. After being questioned by the other guests, the couple must acknowledge what they did during their seven minutes in heaven. Then other couples will be selected to enter the cupboard until all the guests participate. The couple who have allowed the most to do will be the winners of the game. <br /> <br /> Such games have served as social "icebreakers" for kids and teens, but they can be embarrassing and intimidating to shameful individuals. The film is given this title because it deals with the teenager's first experiences with in love and romantic love.
