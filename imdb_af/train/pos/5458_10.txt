I really enjoyed this movie. I thought the movie's plot was realistic and relevant for any time in American history. There is always that woman who does what she has to do to climb the classroom. I feel the character of Lilly was portrayed correctly and couldn't be done better. What I had the most was when she realized what love really was. Throughout the movie, all the men who fell for her fell in love with her, gave her everything, even lost her careers. Until she met Cortland, she didn't understand why these men gave up everything for happiness. The way her life ended was far from what she expected to be possible. I would recommend this movie to someone from an adult audience so you can understand the content and the underlying meaning of the movie and plot.
