North Africa in the 1930s. Following a small Arabian town on the edge of the Sahara, a beautiful woman is looking for meaning for her life and an attractive Trappist monk who escapes his religious crisis. They will meet and passions are stirred, but even the Sand Diviner does not know if they will find happiness or sadness in the GARDEN OF ALLAH. <br /> <br /> The plot is pure hokum, but the movie is still very nice and beautiful to look at. Marlene Dietrich & Charles Boyer is an excellent matchmaker. She is, to put it simply, beautiful, and Boyer gives an effective, understated performance, and lets his sensitive face do much of his acting. <br /> <br /> The supporting role is excellent: Basil Rathbone, in a sympathetic role as a spade who loves the desert; Joseph Schildkraut as a friendly, conversation guide (all the "Arabic" he and others speak in the film is pure gibberish); Lucile Watson as a Soft Mother Superior; Alan Marshal as an Honorable Young French Officer; Tilly Losch as a Dangerous Dancer; Henry Brandon as a comic porter; John Carradine as the mysterious Sand Diviner; and beautiful Sir C. Aubrey Smith as a wise old priest. <br /> <br /> Movie mavens will recognize Helen Jerome Eddy as a nun; Marcia Mae Jones & Bonita Granville (look over the nun's shoulder) as monastic affairs; Nigel De Brulier watched as a convent lecturer; and Ferdinand Gottschalk as hotel clerk, everything unreasonable. <br /> <br /> Color films of the 1930s are scarce and beautiful to watch, and this movie is no exception - the movie is as colorful as the desert itself. THE GARDEN OF ALLAH was the first Technicolor movie to be shot in place. Yuma, Arizona, gave the filmmakers all the sand dunes they could desire, but contaminated drinking water and 135 degrees of heat soon upset the company. When the daily rush showed, Boyer's face burned a bright tomato throw, eventually producer David O. Selznick handed in. The rest of the film was shot at a Hollywood sound phase.
