An excellent example of "cowboy noir", as it is mentioned, in which unemployed Michael (Nicolas Cage) loses a job because he insists on being honest (he has a baby leg). With nothing more he can do, he decides that he will once lie. When he walks into a bar, and Mr Wayne (the old, big JT Walsh) misses him for a hit that Wayne hired in his sexy young wife, Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle in good shape), Michael plays along and accept Waynes money. * Then he goes to Suzanne and lifts her men's intentions and accepts * her * money to get rid of Wayne! If that didn't make things difficult enough, the real hit, "Lyle of Dallas" (Dennis Hopper, in a perfect role for him) and Michael is in even more trouble than before. <br /> <br /> "Red Rock West" gets lots of places. Director John Dahl, who wrote the writer with his brother Rick, was smart to realize the potential of a story in a truly isolated little town that could have seen better days and in which residents in any way involved schemes could be. . It is also an amusing idea of ​​the kind of problems that an honest person can get if they decide to abandon their principles and provide them in any temptation. It is a remarkably dark and winding story with a variety of main characters considered corrupt, at least moral compromise like Michael. The relief by kinographer Marc Reshovsky is wonderful in his temper; even the climax set in a cemetery gives a good morbid quality to the whole thing. Even if the writing is not particularly "logical or credible", the movie has a nice way to intrigue the viewer and just sign them straight. <br /> <br /> Cage is doing a good job in the lead, but his fellow stars have a great time sinking their teeth into their greasy and greedy motivated characters. Hopper, Boyle and Walsh are great to watch in these parts. Timothy Carhart and Dan Shor are fine as Walsh's delegates. In a particularly good turn, Walsh is also the local sheriff. And there is an entertaining cameo role for country and western star Dwight Yoakam, who also votes the movie with a nice end credit. <br /> <br /> It is quite a good movie worth checking out. It moves forward at an impressive pace, and if nothing else is definitely boring. <br /> <br /> 8/10
