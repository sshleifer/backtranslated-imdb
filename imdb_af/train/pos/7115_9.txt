A wonderful and eager war film focusing on the inner torment of the blind Al-Schmid. Although difficult and unpleasant, it is ultimately heroic - Schmid's triumph on disability and depression. The battlefield was wonderful. But one leg to choose. No matter how many .50 bullets they fired. I have never seen any water or dirt kicked by the impact! It hurt the realism, but I can live with it. Fine display by Eleanor Parker, again, as his girlfriend friend.
