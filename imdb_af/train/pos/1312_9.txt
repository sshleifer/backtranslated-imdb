Get this one in the winning column, it was a great movie. The appearances were wonderful and the writing was equally great. <br /> <br /> Helen Hunt was wonderful as the Riverside police officer, Gina Pulasky. Gina was a complex character. She was a firefighter with the Riverside Police Dept. She ended up in a relationship with a colleague that she knew she had a wife and children. She has taken on the dangerous task of catching a serial killer. <br /> <br /> Jeff Fahey (who looks like Ray Liotta) became a victim of the confused, often-tribal police officer who had a relationship with Gina. He was stoking as an officer, but he was quite the opposite when it comes to his feelings and his extra-marital relationship. <br /> <br /> Steven Weber, especially from the sitcom "Wings", has a good job as the quiet, meek, submissive sociopath. On the surface he was an innocent loser, but under the surface a cold heart killer lied. Weber really adopted the childish young adult with an unforgettable thirst to kill young boys. <br /> <br /> The whole movie was spectacular. Every scene, every oral exchange, lets us know more and more of the characters. The production team did a phenomenal work on condensing days, if not weeks worth of events in a 90 minute movie. This movie was a good example of many doing with little.
