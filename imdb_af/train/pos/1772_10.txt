what a relief to find out i don't propose this program! The summary of the taxman is wonderful. I also remember that it was haunting and not very family-owned. I had to be 10/11 when I looked at it. I think for a girl who has some attraction, was the blonde hair of the head, and his permanent sadness. The theme was played on a flute I remember - although I can't remember how it went. I think the intro showed him to play it - or maybe he played a flute in the program and especially when he was sad? Maybe I was destined to never know how it ended or to see the clip or hear the voice, but at least I know it's not just me.
