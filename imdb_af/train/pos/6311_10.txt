This movie is very hilarious, and it has a good compilation of actors such as William H. Macy, who has always performed these roles, perhaps his most representative, Fargo; and George Clooney, a very good actor who shows his comedian work in Cohen's brothers movie. "Oh brother, where are you?" leading to one of my favorite movies ever! But it was difficult to find "Welcome to Collinwood" here in Mexico. My city doesn't have good places to buy good movies. I tried to buy it at Blockbuster, but they don't know it according to the original name, so maybe it will be a little easier to find out if I know the name in Mexico, does anyone know? Because I can't remember! Cheers. A.
