and laughing out loud in many scenes. <br /> <br /> The movie's basic plot is well written, a story of opponents trying to find a way to survive each other in the near future. <br /> <br /> It is undoubtedly Lemmon and Matheau's best movie as co-stars, and the interaction between the sloppy Oscar and the OCD Felix is ​​classic. <br /> <br /> The scene where Oscar makes a double date, shortens the room and returns to find Felix and the two girls who all cry are pricelessly funny. <br /> <br /> For any fan of intelligent comedies, the Odd pair is a movie you can't see.
