ABC did more for this show by allowing television veterans James Garner and David Spade to join the movie of this show. Initially, the show was vigilant and even predictable with John Ritter and Katey Sagal. John's loss shocked the world. Katey and the three kids are really a solid professional cast. The hour lesson after John's death in real life went home. I lost my father for 17 years and could sympathize and understand their pain and pain. ABC must be proud to maintain this performance and even preserve it as John's final wish. This performance has evolved and developed due to such impossible circumstances. They must be rewarded with Emmys.
