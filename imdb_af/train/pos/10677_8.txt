This film was the first British teen movie to really address the reality of the violent rock and role society, rather than being a bright parody of the 1950s teenage life. In an effort to celebrate the work of Liverpool's Junior Liaison Officers, the opening title shows that 92% of potential criminals dealt with under this scheme did not commit a second crime. However, this is just an excuse for the next teenage drama to the film's epilogue where we are instructed that we should not feel responsible or sorry for such criminals, but they may look like it. <br /> <br /> Stanley Baker plays a tough detective who reluctantly takes up the position of the youthful liaison officer. This hard-boiled character is a role typical of Baker. On the trail of a notorious arson known as the firefighter and not entertaining the diversion. However, as in all the good police dramas, he is traced back by the remarkable event. Back to his original investigation. <br /> <br /> His first case led him to the home of two young children, Mary and Patrick Murphy (played by the actual brother and sister duo), who committed a small theft. Here he meets Cathie (depicted satisfactorily by Anne Heywood), his older sister, with whom he eventually becomes romantic. It soon becomes clear that the awkward environment of such inner-city estates is a breeding ground for juvenile delinquency. <br /> <br /> The older brother of the Murphy family, Johnny, is the leader of a gang of rock and roll street thugs. McCallum does a striking turn as the Americanized mixed-up child, who owes more to Marlon Brando than any previous British star. One is reminded of Brando's character Johnny of "The Wild One" who led a leather-clad gang of rebellious bikers, in the same way that the film's Johnny leads his gang. <br /> <br /> Luckily, the former Dearden crime drama's "The Blue Lamp" is not so clear. Instead, we are presented on several sides of the law, as the crimes of the criminals and the romantic interest between Heywood and Baker are at the forefront. <br /> <br /> The plot, while sometimes predictable. , delivering some memorable scenes. The disruptive influence that rock and roll music probably had, was played in a scene where Johnny abandoned himself to the music, causing a threatening police force. The most grim memorable piece of film, however, is the climate class scene where a lot of shocked school children, including Mary and Patrick, become hostage in Johnny's gun. Obviously, in the light of the real Dumblaine massacre, this scene looks all the horrors. Understandably, therefore, the film is rarely broadcast or available to modern audiences.
