I was a big fan of cinema verite and saw this movie because I heard how interesting it was. I can honestly say it was very interesting. The two main actors are wonderful, the movie is never boring, and the concept behind it (although naturally inspired by the Columbine murders and the home movies of the killers) is very interesting. There are some weaknesses, such as the last 20 minutes that really detract from the realism seen in the first hour or so and the end really doesn't make sense at all. The shaky camera can sometimes be distracted, but in the movie story it's a given. But I still think the movie is very well done and the director Ben Coccio deserves some credit.
