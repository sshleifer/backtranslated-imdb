Perhaps the most polished and perfect of all Indian films - Pakeezah does not fall into any of the Bollywood film-related traps (ie, stickiness, farce, wholesale and unsuccessful imitation of Western movie themes / genres). Pakeezah is native to the subcontinent and authentic, almost Mrs. Butterfly, in plot. Characters are well-developed, though sometimes refined by today's standards, perceptive and convincing. The Urdu milieux in the time of Pakeezah was master of understatement and how the dialogue brings the subtleties of old age! The acting (especially the "watching" and the dynamic between characters) is a pleasure to see, although the nuances of current peers are lost or those who are not familiar with the morals and customs of Indian India. <br /> <br /> Composed, with a fascinating screenplay, is a beautiful musical score, enhanced by the protagonist displaying the prominent command of classic Indian dance (kathak). As with most romantic tragedies, the heroine must die, but she takes her leave from the audience without the viewer feeling that he / she has participated in an unforgettable movie experience. Pakeezah is definitely the pinnacle of what Indian cinema has produced and is unlikely to be parallel.
