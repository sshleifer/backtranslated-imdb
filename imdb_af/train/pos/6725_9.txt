Noll's comfortable way to eradicate blunt comments, often with scouts, to describe things he has more knowledge than most, is quite refreshing. There is another character in the movie that constantly tries to conjure up complicated issues by using more language than needed. This guy should never be given a thesaurus. Cut to Noll and you know you're doing a surprise! <br /> <br /> The way the pioneers of wave are navigating is very tempting for a "lost era". Never remember the fact that no one knows how these guys made a living, far less attention paid to issues such as medical care. The use of old film clips throughout was done masterfully.
