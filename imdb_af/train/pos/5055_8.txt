I didn't expect much when I first saw the DVD cover. I mean, Pierce Brosnan as Gray Owl ?? <br /> <br /> Oh ... but then the story is underway, unfolding in a beautifully photographed and fast-paced movie. I was amazed and delighted at this (basically) true story. Let me read about this fascinating character, which means the director has achieved his goal and the movie was a success!
