Something happens to Sondra Pransky when she enters the wizard's box on the stage of a London theater. Little does Sondra know the spirit of the new-born journalist, Joe Strombel, who materializes to ask her to investigate the man someone has told him. On his journey to another dimension is the infamous Tarot killer in London. The only problem is that the man accused, for all appearances, is a respectable upper classmate. <br /> <br /> When Sondra tells her experience at the Great Splendini, whatever Sid is Aquarius, the wizard is amazed, but decides to go along. The two will be P.I.s an invitation to a club where Peter Lyman is going to swim. Sondra, who decays to drown, gets the attention of this hunger, which wants to see more of her. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, the two of them will come in all sorts of funny situations until the mystery is revealed at the end of the film. Few think the true Tarot killer thinks he can mislead a firm Sondra, proving that she is more resourceful than he gave her credit. <br /> <br /> The result is a perfect summer movie with lots of laughter just what you need to get out of the heat in a perfect time in a cool theater. Woody Allen did better, and yet this sunny comedy would justify him for past failures. In "Scoop" Mr. Allen took himself out of the romantic lead that paved his wonderful front lady. His trademark is something that this funny man will never get rid of, as it is apparently his trademark. The movie has some funny one linen that goes over the head of the viewers, which may not pay attention. <br /> <br /> Scarlett Johansson, the beautiful star of "Scoop", looks like the perfect foil for Woody. Allen. She plays the straight role while Mr. All his shake, a perfect combination. Both are excellent in their trigger through the movie. Me. Johansson is a knockout beauty in her red bathing suit, although she dressed her so dull in most of the costumes she wears on the screen. Hugh Jackman is seen as Peter Lyman a sophisticated man across the town with the proper pedigree. He makes a good appearance in the movie as the man who is mrs. Johansson pursues. Ian McShane plays the dead Fleet Street journalist on the road forever. <br /> <br /> "Scoop" is a light movie for the hot and humid summer, thanks Woody Allen.
