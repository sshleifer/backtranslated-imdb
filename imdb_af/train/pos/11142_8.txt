Not joking. <br /> <br /> Looking for greener pastures in the form of a boost in New York City, Jon Voight is a young cowboy optimist (nearly Forest Gump-like) Joe Buck of Texas. It doesn't take long for the Big Apple to devour it mercilessly and its ambitions completely and very quickly. Joe is the target of both New York colds and disadvantages of his street people. Given his pure heart, he takes pity on one of these villains, Ratso Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman), and later moves with him into his apartment wreck and the two struggle to survive. <br /> <br /> While being marked by a drama, Midnight Comedy is best described as a tragic comedy or a comic tragedy. It is especially a beautiful film that is stylish to capture the contemporary hippie atmosphere of the late 1960s with its compulsory, dull, Warhol party cinematography, along with ultra-urban New York City. The film falls somewhere in between Cowboy Joe Buck, thus emphasizing his position outside the place. We feel like fighting for it, but also getting enough money to feed Ratso Rizzo. <br /> <br /> Midnight Cowboy brought tears to my eyes because it is also rich in substance and projects. I think this movie should have inspired both Forest Gump with its pure sad and out-of-place main character and, to some extent, the Crocodile Dundee movies, as it is about the same kind of humor - a contrast between cowboy cowboys and smart New York cosmopolitans. Very compelling and sensational creative film that I highly recommend. <br /> <br /> 8.5 / 10
