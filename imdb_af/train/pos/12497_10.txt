If you haven't seen this movie of Mary-Kate and Ashley's yet, then all I can say is, "What are you waiting for?" This is another great and wonderful movie by the twin twins who all know and love us so much! It's fun, romantic, exciting and absolutely breathtaking (scenery)! Of course; As always, Mary-Kate and Ashley are the main scenery anyway! Would any true fan want it in any other way? Of course not! Anyway, this is a good movie in every sense of the word, so if you haven't seen it before, just do it now! I mean now! What are you waiting for? I promise you won't be disappointed! Sincerely, Rick Morris
