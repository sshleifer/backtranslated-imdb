In microphones, the stooges are the best there. In this brief, the trio of craftsmen working in a recording studio. They get a look at Alice Van Doren (Christine Mcintyre) who sings the voice of spring. The voice is wonderful. Curly in sleepers is by Mrs. Bixby (Symona Boniface) heard. Tired name Curly Senior Cucaracha. The three strokes end up going to festivals, where Curly is going to dress. They play a record of spring voices and everything goes well until Moe destroys the record on curly head. They end up with the lucia sexlet until the baritone recognizes and disconnects them. Alice Van Doren screams the boy and hides behind a curtain to help them. Though it's good until the baritone wonders how Curly sings without the help of a phonograph, which Alice discovers behind the curtain. The three strokes are considered fraud, but Alice's father discovers his daughter's talent and agrees to become a singer. The stubble is peeled from the room. Excellent.
