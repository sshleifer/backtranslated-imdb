It is a romantic comedy where Albert Einstein, played by Walter Matthau, played well and his loved ones play contender for his cousin (Meg Ryan) and a talented car mechanic (Tim Robbins). The interplay between these important roles is enhanced by tremendously supportive role players of well-known character actors. This movie is cute and fun ... a "feel-good"! Warm recommendations.
