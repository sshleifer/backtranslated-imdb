Michael Bowen plays an innocent young man who visits a thousand miles to visit his absent millionaire father (the spectacular Ray Wise) at a vast windmill industry and end up in the dangerous web of his young, scary and seductive stepmother from hell. (the nice Clare Wren), which causes problems for the already dysfunctional family. An Edgy, attractive and exciting drama that received no promotion and was sent directly to VHS and cable TV - where I saw it first. It is beautifully written, cleverly performed, and tightly directed at a script that bites you into your nails. I can't believe the judges who didn't have it ever saw it. It's an undiscovered classic.
