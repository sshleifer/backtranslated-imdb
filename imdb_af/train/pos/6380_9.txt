Atlantis: The Lost Empire is a better movie than I thought. I never thought this movie would lead to my expectations. True, this movie started slowly, but as the movie wore, it became more like my taste. The story takes place in 1914 and is about a man named Milo. Milo believes in the fabulous Atlantis. Together with his grandfather's friends, he began a wonderful adventure of his own. Along the way he must practice friendship, betrayal, trust and more. The voice throw is wonderful. They definitely know how to wear movies with their voice talent. The music is nothing special anyway. The animation is not the best, but it is still good enough. Overall, this is a good family movie for all ages. I rate this movie 9/10.
