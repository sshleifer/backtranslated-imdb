Michigan, Edgar Allen Poe, a toaster, and a frying pan. . . If you are not the psycho-thriller or horror movie genre, and you have a special place in your heart for the twist, this is the movie for you. An incredibly well-developed first film, 'Hatred of a Minute', has all the features of mainstream hits such as 'Silence of the Lambs' and of the classic cults such as 'Army of Darkness'. "The editing and effects are well done, better than many movies in the genre. Kallio weaves a complicated story of torment dealing with both the Bible and Poe's writings. At a time when big budget, big name films lacked, it is very unimportant, the independent film has raised this dying feature. If you like Michigan, a good story, or a decent thriller, check out "Hope a minute."
