A meteor crashes into Crater Lake, the heat of impact that causes a prehistoric egg to hatch. <br /> <br /> Well, so the plot is just trash. But in spite of the obvious low budget, it appears to be one of the most gripping and entertaining monster-on-the-go movies. There are also some good moments of humor. For centuries, so-called "monsters" that are no more than ridiculous men-in-rubber packers or lizards dressed in fringes and forced to rip each other (cheap exploitation style), are refreshing to discover it in This jewelry is an excellent Harryhausen style stop-motion creature. <br /> <br /> Quite a hard movie to find, but it's worth finding.
