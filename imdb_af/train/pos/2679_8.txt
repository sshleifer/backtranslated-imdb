Delirious, near plot-less mood piece and if it is more LSD inspired than the devil then we must remember when it's made! After an exciting SM opening (which is not even what it looks like) we move to soft focus and dream or imagination or remember. Many literary and film references and indeed, that is the Franco movie that Lang himself praised. Beautiful and exalted, the film unfolds at a leisurely pace, but has a wealth within each fold. A rare movie to fall into. Old Jess could do it if he tried. Fine central performances also include irreversible Jack Taylor and Howard Vernon. I didn't even mention the places in Lisbon - ah!
