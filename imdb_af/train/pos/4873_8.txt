For those who are not aware of the theme Kusturica is constantly investigating in its films - the Western assault on traditional Serbian values ​​- it will be impossible to understand its narratives. This ongoing theme, expressed by fantasy and outrageous comedy as his vehicle, is one that Kusturica chose to mandate. Since its fantastic work and Magnum Opus 'Underground', Kusturica's films 'Black Cat White Cat', 'Life a Miracle' and recently with 'Promise Me This', have highlighted the westernization of the Balkans with its slapstick carnival style. culture, its ambivalent arrival and assault on the traditional idiom. In the case of 'Promise Me This', the paradoxical world of city (urban space) and town (traditional idiom) contrasts. The world of the city reflects western features that illuminated the spatial and temporal environment; organized crime, sexual exploitation, a broken sense of identity and fierce disregard for traditional values ​​- as expressed against the young child village. The end of the film illustrates this idea further as we see a funeral mass and wedding on a one-way gravel road. They are roughly collided; The marriage, which represents the lifeline and pulse of the village, ie traditional values, is about to clash with the funeral mourners, illustrating the death of tradition in this context. Yet Kusturica explores this theme through its own unique, stylistic singularity. With its outrageous and flamboyant style that serves as a vehicle in its depiction.
