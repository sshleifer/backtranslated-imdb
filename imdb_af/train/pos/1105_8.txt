Manhattan apartment residents must get all kinds of inconvenience. The worst is the lack of storage space! Some people who eat all the time use their ranges and dishwashers as storage space, because the cupboards are already full! <br /> <br /> Melvin Frank and Norman Panama, a great comedy writing team of that era, have the potential in Eric Hodgins novel, whose hero, Jim Blandings, cannot stand the cramped apartment where he and his wife, Muriel, and two daughters have to share. <br /> <br /> Jim Blandings, a Madison Ave. CEO, had it! If he sees an advertisement for Connecticut, he decides to take a look. Obviously, a first-time owner, Jim, is being baptized by the real estate agent to buy the dilapidated house he'll inspect by an unscrupulous agent. It's just the beginning of his problems. <br /> <br /> Whatever may be wrong, go wrong. The architect is asked to come up with a plan that doesn't work for the new home, after the original one. Since one problem leads to another, more money is needed, and whatever the original cost will be, it comes at an inflated price that Jim couldn't really afford. <br /> <br /> The movie is nice because of the three principals in it. Cary Grant was an actor who clearly understood the character he played and made most of Jim Blandings. Myrna Loy, was a beautiful actress who was always effective towards Mr. Grant. The third character, Bill Cole, an old boyfriend of Myrna, has become the Bland's advocate, is suave and debonair, as Melvin Douglas portrayed him. One of the mixed girls, Joan, is played by Sharyn Moffett, who has an unusual deal with Eva Marie Saint. The big Louise Beavers plays Gussie, but doesn't have much to do. <br /> <br /> The film is lovingly photographed by James Wong Howe, who clearly knew what to do to make this movie look better. The direction of H.C. Potter is light and he has succeeded in this movie that will enjoy fans of classic comedies.
