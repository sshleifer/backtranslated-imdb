52-Pick-up never had the respect it had. It works on many levels, and has a complicated but persistent plot. The actors involved give some of their best performances. Ann-Margret, Roy Scheider, and John Glover are perfectly cast and offer deep character depictions. Also noticeable is Vanity, who had it in a serious acting, given the unexpected ability she shows, and Kelly Preston, whose character will haunt you for a few days. Anyone who likes action, combined with a complicated intricate story, will enjoy it.
