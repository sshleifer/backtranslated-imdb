For example, in 1933 it was a good year for satires (for example "Duck Soup") and this one fits in well, even if it's about the obsession with contract bridge. The tone is fitting like a humorous piece of The New Yorker, as the movie starts with the "Goings On About Town" page of that magazine. The only thing that is strange is decisive. A few years later, William Powell and Myrna Loy would have been perfect. But after 1934, you wouldn't have handled adultery in such a sophisticated manner, the young and beautiful Loretta Young in a pair of slanted and slim outfits, or a group of prostitutes listening to a bridge competition on the radio. Even if you don't know anything about the bridge, you might want to check out another rare example of Hollywood satire.
