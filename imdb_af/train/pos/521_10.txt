It is probably one of the most original love stories I have seen for centuries, especially for a war-based (short) movie. Actually, it's a two-world story, one of course, really, the other fictional, but the filmmakers say it's just a coincidence if it's a real place. Anyway, Peter Carter (the great David Niven) crashes into an airplane, he spoke to June (Planet of the Apes' Kim Hunter) before calling and said he loved her. He was planning to jump dead without a parachute, but somehow he survived, and now he sees and likes June in the flesh. This other place, like a heaven, is unhappy because he survived and was meant to come to their world, so they sent French Conductor 71 (Marius Goring) to persuade him to go, but of course he is in love. Peter suggests that he should appeal to keep his life to the other world court. He is awarded. It is clear that love dominates when the two lovers announce that they will die for each other, June even offers its place! Also with Robert Coote as Bob Trubshawe, Kathleen Byron as an Angel, a short (then unknown) Lord Sir Richard Attenborough as an English Pilot and Abraham Sofaer as Judge / Surgeon. David Niven was number 36 on the 50 largest British actors. The movie was number 86 on The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers for the happy ending. It was number 47 on The 100 Greatest War Films. It was number 46 on the 50 largest British films. It was number 59 on the 100 largest movies. Outstanding!
