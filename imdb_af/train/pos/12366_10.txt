Wonderful movie, one of the best horror movies of the 70's. She is realistic and atmospheric. As usual, it was inevitably the usual negative comment. I have noticed that many horror movies of a certain period often do not reach sufficiency. Clearly, most of the horror movies are old and must be denied is like a mental mechanism that moves the thoughts of the potential of music critics here. <br /> <br /> Before reading the review, you already knew what the final judgment was. In the film is a good gift because 10 was very well done. Raines reads pretty well and the movie as a way of producing it reminds me of many Kubrick movies. He's really impressed. Excellent movie really. I see a movie anthology of the 70s.
