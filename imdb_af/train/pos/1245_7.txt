When I see most reviews, it's called a miscarriage for Eddie Murphy. These critics want to take a look at some of the things he does today and perhaps mitigate their attitude in retrospect ... "The Golden Child" is not a high level of entertainment, but thanks to some of the role-players it becomes new life in old clichés, Murphy gives one of his best roles. I do not understand the staggering lack of "love" for his efforts. Perhaps it was released at a time when the foundation grew with some excitement-a-minute adventures? Steven Spielberg started it with Indiana Jones; It is unfair to make this one scapegoat if it is possibly the greatest sin is also completely harmless. There is nothing wrong with trying to capitalize on trends. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's stupid, but even an observer's opportunity to understand that "ridiculous" is where Hollywood's idea of ​​mysticism begins and ends. More important than credibility with a story like this is that the audience has entertaining tour guides at hand to show them the mysterious attractions. Michael Ritchie and Eddie Murphy fit the account for this capacity. My advice to you is to buy the ticket and take the ride.
