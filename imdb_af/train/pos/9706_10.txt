The League of Gentlemen is one of the funniest, strangest, darkest and most memorable comedies of our time. So much has paved the way for more comedies of his ilk, many of which have copied the style, but it has never succeeded. <br /> <br /> Unlike any other sketch, the characters of The League of Gentlemen are all loosely connected. First, they all live in the fictional town of Royston Vasey, in the back of northern England. <br /> <br /> The first characters to greet newcomers are Tubbs and Edwrad. The owners of a so-called local store that are so far away most probably did not know about its existence. Other peculiarities include: the Denton family, with an obsession with hygiene, chastity and frogs; Hillary Briss selling a special but unfortunately unknown meat brand; Pauline, a reboot with a sharp tongue and even sharper pens; Mr. Chinnery, lovely veterinarian and threatened with all four-legged things; Geoff Tipps, a plastic seller with a wicked sense of humor, often has guns, electric tubes and. . . . . . . PLUGS !!!!! <br /> <br /> Despite a comedy at heart, the League of Gents transgenic genres often, while never being spared or spoiled by other people's material. There are several horror references such as the disappearance of a hiker, some quiet twins, an obsessive circus owner, and a sudden outbreak of nasal blood. Even more striking are moments when the series assumes a more sobre tone and both characters such as Pauline and Geoff are shown in a more sympathetic, vulnerable light. The movie adaptation is the best demonstration of this, but some fans may decide they are local. <br /> <br /> The equally subordinate third series also takes another route, instead of sketches, invading each episode on an individual character with each storyline leading to a conclusion with a plastic bag and a runaway theater company. Although many fans cannot enjoy the structure of the movie or the third series as much as the first two, it is certainly evidence of how inventive the League of Gentlemen can be, and how careless it is to explore new areas. <br /> In short, the Meneers League is definitely a glance, as as the wellness signs say, YOU WILL NEVER LEAVE!
