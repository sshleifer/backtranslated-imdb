This movie is wonderfully beautiful. Goldsworthy's art really enjoys the medium of film because you can see the art of his most beautiful, moving and changing and flowering. I recommend this movie to everyone. I can't think of anything else to say about it. It's just the kind of movie you should see, because it is so visually compelling and very refreshing when I left the theater.
