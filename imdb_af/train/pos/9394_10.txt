"Red Rock West" was by far one of the finest 90's thrills with an excellent screenplay (by John and Rick Dahl) guessing for most of the movie on the side of your seat. It was brilliantly directed by John Dahl and has a wonderful film such as Nicolas Cage, Dennis Hopper, Lara Flynn Boyle and especially J. T. Walsh (in an unforgettable performance). This makes it an exciting and fascinating thriller that should not be missed. The movie never had much publicity on release (I first got it on TV) and is therefore one of those special gems you have to look for, but this unique movie is slowly becoming a cult success. <Br /> <br /> Nicolas Cage is Michael Williams who is broken and out of work when he is in the small town of Red Rock. Wrong for a contract killer named Lyle of Dallas, he is shocked to be offered $ 10,000 to kill the wife of bar owner Wayne Brown (the excellent J. T. Walsh). He plays with the plan and decides to warn Brown's wife, Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle), but then the plot thickens and there are so many twists, turns and surprises - and double relationships - that the Cage is in one crisis another is thrown. and find himself trapped in a terrible situation, he can't break out! Then it is just to complicate the issues, kill the real Lyle from the contract (played by everyone's favorite heavy Dennis Hopper). When Hopper discovers what has happened, he goes to Cage, but no one can follow the surprising events that follow. <br /> <br /> Some favorite movie lines: <br /> <br /> Nicolas Cage (after Lara Flynn Boyle): "I hate to see an innocent woman hurt, but it's a awful lot of money. " <br /> <br /> J. T. Walsh (after Cage): "Michael Williams. Well, Michael, you're going to spend time with us until we get to the bottom." <br /> <br /> Boyle (to Cage): "You're not a killer?" Cage: "That's right, no. But the man I'm supposed to just drive into town, you gotta get out of here." Boyle (after Cage): "OK, how are you?" will explain how to personalize a hired killer and take $ 10,000 off my husband? . An extraordinarily entertaining little thriller (only 98 minutes) with a storyline never made by the principals. Any movie with J. T. Walsh is O.K. In my book and "Red Rock West" was one of his best. How sad it was that this exceptional actor's career was tragically cut short by a heart attack in 1998. The most productive period for "film noir" was undoubtedly the forties, but "Red Rock West" is a good modern example of the genre and jumped into my "Top Ten" list of all time favorite movies. I look forward to more like this by director John Dahl. 10/10. Clive Roberts. <br /> <br />
