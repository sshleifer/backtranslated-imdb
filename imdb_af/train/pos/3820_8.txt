This is a story about Shin-ae, who moves to Seoul's Milyang with her young son Jun to start her husband's accidental death. Her husband was born here, and she opens a piano school, but also has ambitions to own land with the insurance money she received from death. If what the movie is about, it would probably have been like a Hollywood movie, falling for a local man and happy with her son in their new home. But it's not Hollywood. Her son is kidnapped and murdered, apparently because it is known to have cash from the settlement. The sad process, efforts to continue, attempts to violate her conscience are all done wonderfully, and the main roles are wonderful. The only warning, and it must be said, is that it is a depressing movie. You need to know it's going. You want Shin-ae to go through her grief and find some happiness. Again, it's not Hollywood, it's Korea and in the Korean movie, especially drama, they don't bump. Life is what happens to you. Great play, but sometimes a hard movie to watch, due to the runs. If you stay, you'll be rewarded. Do this.
