If you don't enjoy this movie, whether you die, or hate Adam Sandler or Don Cheadle. <br /> <br /> An excellent role, everyone who has performed well. This movie proved that Adam Sandler is a good actor, despite what critics say. Adam Sandler becomes a very respected actor. It all started with his performance in Big Daddy, then he did some bad movies, and then with a tremendous performance in 50 First Dates, the longest site, then Click and now over Me. <br /> <br /> Back to the movie. Adam Sandler plays a man who has lost everything. The closest family he has is a mother-in-law and father-in-law. After his old college roommate (Cheadle) ran into him, he or she looked back. I will not say anymore because I do not want to ruin the movie, but I strongly recommend this movie. One of the best movies of 2007.
