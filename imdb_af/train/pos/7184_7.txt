I absolutely love this show, but I only saw the second episode. After watching the first episode, I could see why people were off. The first episode's humor is not the best, and they struggle to start the series properly. However, I still like the light and humorous attitude of the show. The characters evolve much more after the episode and become really nice characters. As a first episode, it really doesn't represent the rest of the show that is really pretty good. The episode is not bad at all, but as the performance progresses, it gets better and better, so watch more episodes before any judgment on the quality of the performance is passed.
