This fantastic movie has to be watched to know that millions have scratched 10 cents to see it and forget about the dismal day-to-day economic conditions during the 30's. Remember, 10 cents bought another bread, so it was a little luxury for many. This is evidence of how Hollywood has done its best to make the US feel a little better about itself. You will notice that with the studio system in Hollywood, many actors and actresses were in similar films at the time. James Cagney, William Powell, Ruby Keeler, Frank McHugh, Joan Blondell and Guy Kibbee. In addition, the US Army branches are always affected with enthusiasm and patriotism as in the use of military precision that the great choreographer, Busby Berkeley, eventually markets.
