Do you like really inventive comedy, or do you like the wedding crashers? If the answer stops reading the latter now. I can't believe this movie isn't rated higher. Basically Meadows does not play a character other than Austin Powers. There are so many ingenious moments in this gagorama. From cruelty - Leon plays with himself on the stoep, the ex-girlfriend lured into the eatery. . Oh good. To inspire mystery-clown sex, the Broadway routine, the voice. Meadows are great like the childish, but very sweet Leon. Some big lines "don't blame the cheek," "freaky deaky sex world" too much. . . Why this movie wasn't great is a mystery. Great comedy.
