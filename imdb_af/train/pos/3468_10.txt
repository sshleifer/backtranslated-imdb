I absolutely loved this movie! I was reluctant to see it first, because I thought it would be too painful. I remember how difficult it was when John was shot. But looking at the "Two of us" I came back to a happier time when he was still alive and there was hope and possibility. I think the writer did a wonderful job depicting "maybe." Aidan Quinn was adorable like Paul and faced the challenge. I was impressed with his accent and manners. Jared Harris is also very talented and reasonably credible like John. My favorite items were the park and rooftop scene - which was so enjoyable. The movie left me with sadness and gratitude, and I believe the circumstances.
