This movie is really a mixed bag. On the one hand, the story and concept of the movie is really good, tense and has some pretty plot twists in it. But on the other hand, it is very slowly told, without style and uninvolved. Yet I just consider 'Just Cause' as a top average thriller simply because of the fine cast. <br /> <br /> Perhaps Sean Connery is in a bad mood. I mean, he's not as credible as a main hero and father of a young daughter (played by a still very young Scarlett Johansson) and Kate Capshaw's husband. I feel that he was simply too old for the role of being credible. But Sean Connerey is, of course, a good actor and that is the only reason he can still perform the movie so well. But of course he is helped by a very strong supporting role consisting of actors such as Laurence Fishburne, Blair Underwood, Ned Beatty, Hope Lange, Lynne Thigpen and Ed Harris. All actors are really good, but some of them are very underutilized, which is a real shame as well as a missed opportunity. Especially Ed Harris is just terrific in his role as a psychopathic serial killer. He is really cool and acting. Normally, he does not play these ruthless, different roles in movies, so he surprises his role in this one. His performance alone is more than enough reason to watch this movie. Due to the fact that the story is told without much style and too formal, none of the characters in the movie work well because it feels too far. <br /> <br /> It's really the way of storytelling It kills all the movie's fine potential. Arne Glimcher leads the small-style movie and sometimes keeps the tempo too low. As a result, we as viewers never really get involved with the story or any of its characters. <br /> <br /> It's really too bad, because "Just Cause" has more than enough potential. A good throw and a smooth story with some unexpected twists and turns in which nothing looks like it looks. The movie and story is the only reason why this movie is still an above average thriller, which will probably still be the fan of the genre. However, it is an eternal scandal that the film is lacking in its storytelling and style, otherwise this movie could have been a real classic in its genre. <br /> <br /> 7/10
