A young lawyer sent to a remote area to include the estate of a newly-killed client. When he arrived, he found that he was made less than welcome by the locals and that his late client was not happy. To speed things up, he decides to move from the local inn and live in her home, a house that is usually confused and approached only by a waterway that is most often blocked by the sea most of the day. Once there he sees visions of a woman in black, she is real or imaginary, he is also subjected to the blood-spreading cry of a weed and child who apparently drowns in the swamps. These events take their toll on him and he soon becomes very scared. Atmospheric TV adaptation of a famous play by Susan Hill, who first uses it to build his characters, before moving to the creepy country house, gives his poor color contrast instantly his TV roots, it really had to be in black and white but still as a ghost story it had a few disturbing moments, yet after waiting so long to see it, I had to say I was just a little underwhelmed.
