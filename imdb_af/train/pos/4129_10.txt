It's a cooking competition show, Americanized. It's not going to be the Japanese version. <br /> <br /> The show is great. I can cook less about cooking, but this show is just fun to watch ... From the intensity of the dishes by the chef to the goofy chair. Really a great way to spend time watching TV. <br /> <br /> You can criticize the show because you have guests like Marc Ecko as judge. But ... Meh. It's enough to watch and generally the winner gets the prize. <br /> <br /> Oh yes and I'm bitter. John Besh is not the new Iron Chef ... <br /> <br /> Ala Cuisine!
