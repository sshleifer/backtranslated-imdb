According to this advice, I think you love or hate it. Usually how it goes with all movies. However, there is no need to test others. All we do here is to give opinions. I rented this movie last night and I want to throw my opinion in the mix. However, I was amazed at how many people hit it. There is a difference between a movie fan and a horror movie fan. I'm a horror movie fan. Most ordinary movie fans do not like horror movies. So many low budget cam corder search movies come out these days. It's hard to keep up. And what makes it difficult to stay in these movies is how bad it is. I wanted to write a review on "Hood of the Living Dead" because it is pretty damn over the rest of the litter out there. It's nothing special, but it's the horror filmmakers who are trying to be too serious to make a horror movie. I really liked this one. You tell me there's no trouble in this one? And one more thing, I bet you all have nothing but Major Motion Pictures that you are so proud of? Nothing wrong with that, but you need to know how to value low-budget independently. I knew what I got when I watched this movie. I'm not going to be upset because I thought it would be about $ 100 million movie. Some of you might have to keep looking at the Matrix over and over and compare everything to the Matrix. And if most of you are under 24, explain it all. Good movie people, look it out.
