I didn't like the same director of Chandni Bar. <br /> <br /> I didn't watch his other movies. They came and went. <br /> <br /> But Page-3 is beautiful. Looks real. Like Satya from RGV. <br /> <br /> The mental illness of the so-called high society is the summary of the movie. In the midst of all the diseases it is difficult to live a normal life that the main character, Konkana Sen, does. Serious movie, not to be watched with children or expect women. Page-3 of newspapers is the usual place for reporting the activities that take place in the parties of the rich and elite, which enjoy even more filth than is reported. How this page-3 is also a business prospect is shown in the movie. Event management companies are paid to arrange parties and make a rich, but not familiar, well-known overnight, by clicking pictures with celebrities. <br /> <br /> Western culture has overtaken the high society of Mumabi. The movie shows it boldly, with no hold. <br /> <br /> Madhur Bhandarkar is starting a new journey from here.
