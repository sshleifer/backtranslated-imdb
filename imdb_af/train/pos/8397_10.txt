This movie deserves each of the ten voices I gave it! Thank you guys for making a movie worth watching. You've shown the world, you can still write, live, produce and die in a black movie without the negative stereotypes. The poetry was also fantastic, and it is available to poets and musicians. <br /> <br /> I watched it last night because I fell in love with my darling again. I will add it today to my movie collection and recommend it to my friends and family. <br /> <br /> Please continue to produce quality, don't worry about quantity. <br /> Thank you and best wishes and blessings for you!
