This view is good. I like the acting, funny pieces and the sweetness of it. The actors, Lee Pace, Ann Friel ... etc, all did well in the show. The show started well with his funny, illogical basic idea of ​​bringing the dead people back into the first series and honestly. As the people said, the first few episodes of the second series were a bit of a downside, but later it looked good anyway. And now I really hate the fact that it will be canceled. Why does ABC not just end when all the episodes are finished? I really want to know how the story will be. I think it should be given a chance because there are still so many viewers who like it.
