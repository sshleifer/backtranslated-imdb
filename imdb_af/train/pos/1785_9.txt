If you can't enjoy a chick, stop now. However, if you enjoy movies that illustrate complex characters and give extraordinary acting, read on. <br /> <br /> Ann Grant Lord dies. Her two daughters come to her bed. Ann starts talking about people of her past whose daughters are unaware, and they ask if these lost acquaintances are real or imagined. They realize that these people from their mother's past are indeed real. <br /> <br /> The story basically shifts between 1953 and about 2000 with a few glances at Ann's life between those years. In 1953, Ann met the love of her life and experienced her life's greatest tragedy. <br /> <br /> One of Ann's two best friends of college, Lila, is married. Ann's other best friend is Lila's brother, Buddy. Lila and Buddy are the children of a wealthy Newport family, while Ann is a cabaret singer who lives in Greenwich Village, who wants to be a free spirit, but is still bound by many of the 1950s. <br /> Shortly afterwards Ann comes as a bridesmaid at Lila's wedding, and meets the person who plays the lead role in the tri-Harris. He is the adult son of a former servant of the family who grew up with Lila and Buddy and became a doctor in a small town in New England. Ann is immediately welcomed by Harris, which results in a complication that Lila has always been in love with Harris and still remains. Buddy is also in love with Harris, but in 1953 he introduced homosexual desire for Harris to his good friend, Ann, for he cannot admit himself to have a sexual urge for another man. Buddy is showing his inner frustration outwardly by being the family's alcoholic, wicked son - much to the shame of his very proper and ceaseless parents. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, all expressed and suppressed Emotions lead to a tragedy. After all, it is a chick fly. <br /> <br /> At this time, Ann's daughters have done away with their mother and have their own life realizations and doubts. Constance works on emotional exhaustion to keep her role as perfect mother and wife. Nina, who always felt inferior, couldn't maintain a relationship. <br /> <br /> Stir all these relationships into a team of fifty years, and you get an intriguing look at society, its values ​​and its impact on the personalities and actions of the complex people involved . <br /> <br /> All the actors in the evening are excellent, but there are some extraordinary performances and scenes - along with two unique family relationships - making this movie so much, very special. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes plays the 1950s Ann and she does it in a style that clearly shows an intelligent woman of those times who is contrary to what she is supposed to do as opposed to what she wants do. Her performance is not easily forgotten. <br /> <br /> Vanessa Redgrave plays the dying Ann whose spirit moves from the present to the past into fantasy flights, and of course, Redgrave pulls everything off with a sterling style. <br /> <br /> Natasha Richardson - Redgrave's real daughter - plays Ann's daughter, Constance, in the movie. The scenes between this real-life mom and daughter playing fictional mom and daughter are an amazing surprise to watch. <br /> <br /> Toni Collette plays Ann's other daughter, Nina. Nina spends much of her time being depressed and feeling sorry for herself while emitting a good man who loves both her and her mother and sister. Collette is perfect for a part like this, but I have never seen her give a bad or incredible performance, no matter what part she plays. <br /> <br /> In 1950, Mamie Gummer plays Lila and shows us a woman who clashes even more with her expected role in life than her good friend, Ann. She is very good. <br /> <br /> Meryl Streep - Gummer's mother - play Lila today. What is there about Meryl Streep other than that she always gives an insightful and rewarding performance. <br /> <br /> Director Lajos Koltai puts in the DVD extras that he was looking for Glenn Close to play the relatively small part of Lila's mother. because he feels she is the only actress he can think of playing one scene in the movie. He definitely is right, and Close's performance in that one scene etches it into your mind. All the other scenes in which Close Lila's very good mother is, and you get another treasure. <br /> <br /> There are three other scenes in the movie, combined with the one described above, worth the whole movie. On Lila's wedding day, Ann gets into her room and crawls into bed with her friend to discuss Lila's misunderstandings about her upcoming wedding to a man she clearly doesn't love. This scene is repeated fifty years later when Lila comes and crawls into bed with her dying friend Ann to talk about the lives they have lived. In this last scene, Streep and Redgrave are surprising. <br /> <br /> The other memorable scene - at least for me - is when Buddy explains his love for Ann. Hugh Dancy as Buddy gives us a heartbreaking performance of a young man torn apart by his conflicting sexual feelings. His performance is better. <br /> <br /> Chick flick? Yes. A very special movie with amazing acting, directing and landscaping? Definitely. I can't go to the evening.
