I just saw this cartoon for the first time and recognized the caricature of famous black entertainers ... Cab Calloway, Bessie Smith (not Josephine Baker or Sophie Tucker, who was white), Thomas "Fats" Waller, Bill "Bojangles" Robinson, Stepin Fetchit (despite) Louis Armstrong and the choir girls are from the famous "Cotton Club" in Harlem. True ... stereotypes are there, but that was the way it was ... and these cartoons were meant as adult entertainment at your local theater before the main function. <br /> <br /> Harmann & Ising cartoons tended to be more "cutesy" and more exciting (after all ... we're talking about MGM) as the standard animated short of Warners, Paramount, Universal, Fox , RKO or Low Columbia. Even Disney's very early Mickey Mouse had a lot of abrasive humor before Uncle Walt cleared him just before he left Technicolor. <br /> <br /> Disney also has cartoons with caricatures of black entertainers. 1937's Silly Symphony "Woodland Cafe". But we must remember that these movies are part of a certain time and place. 50 years from now ... cuts from the Simpsons, Family Guy, and South Park will also be explored, analyzed ... and even ignored by future viewers.
