I watched the first 17 episodes and this series is simply amazing! I was not interested in an anime series since Neon Genesis Evangelion. This series is actually based on a h-game, which I am not sure whether it was done before or not, I did not play the game, but from what I heard, it follows very well. <br /> <br /> I give this series a 10/10. It has a wonderful story, interesting characters, and the best animation I've seen. It also has some good Japanese music! <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen this series yet, it goes out. You can find subbed episodes on some anime sites out there, it's straight from Japan.
