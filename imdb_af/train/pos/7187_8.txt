Serials were short subjects originally shown in theaters in conjunction with a feature film related to the serialized fiction of the pulp. Known as "chapter playing", they were expanded moving pictures broken into a number of segments called "chapters" or "episodes". Each chapter will be shown at the same theater for one week. The series would end with a stone hanger, as the hero and heroine found themselves in the latest dangerous situation from which there could be no escape. <br /> <br /> The audience will have to come back next week to find out how the hero and heroine will escape and resist the villain again. Serials were especially popular with children, and for many children in the first half of the 20th century a typical movie movie included a chapter of at least one series, along with animated cartoons, news rules and two feature films. <Br /> <br /> The golden era for magazines was 1936-1945. It was one of the best of the era. <br /> <br /> Zorro has been seen in many movies, but Reed Hadley ("The Racket Squad", The Undying Brain) was excellent in the role. <br /> <br /> The action is constant, and we are led chapter to chapter to the ultimate end where we find out the identity of the malicious. <br /> <br /> Zorro triumphs as he always does.
