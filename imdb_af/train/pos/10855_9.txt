Looking back over the past 28 years (since my first exposure to the show), I can only say: as soon as you get it, it stays forever. I remember my initial reaction was: 1) annoyingly aging, 2) under produced 3) untouchable characters <br /> <br /> Well, two years later I looked at a few more episodes and it hardly found it so irritating. A year later I was able to capture the whole series from the beginning and quickly see the bittersweet story of human errors and perspectives on happiness. Yes, the show has a style that is not for everyone, and I'm sure the dated production value will be difficult now. But at least once a month I think about the performance with a vague tear-eye that longs for what simpler times were ... <br /> <br /> VAT I'm a married man ... (for everyone who thinks this is a show for women)
