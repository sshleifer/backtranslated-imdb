Well, I wasn't sure how the movie would be as I just saw a small clip, but I thought it would be good and I was right, I watched it twice when I got it and that's me favorite movie. <br /> <br /> I think Alison Lohan played Beth's role well. She is such a grate actress and the author has done a lot of research to find out about bulimia, although the termination when it is concerned. In the hospital I have 2 Horus observations after meals because I am told that one house is good and that hospitals do not help bulimic, as I am told is probably why I am still at home, even if my sister and mom would like it to have me hospitalized because I have bulimia, but it is a lattice film that I recommend to someone with or without eating disorder or to people who know someone with eating disorders, seeing them in the lives of a bulimic person world how they do a bit about a timetable movie and I recommend it to any and every type of person
