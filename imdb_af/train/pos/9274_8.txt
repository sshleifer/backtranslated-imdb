Another fantastic film from a country, where due to decades of suppression of fundamentalist regimes, has no problem creating passionate subjects. This time Panahi takes a different approach with a mix of ironic comedy and an engaging, non-professional cast. While still talking about his message about what he considered inherently wrong with his country, he did it without the need for a heavy storyline. This is a positive attack on a country, especially its people, who desperately need the Iranian people. The biggest pity is that it won't be released soon. The insular, paranoid Iranian government claims that this fine filmmaker is only successful overseas because he is part of a worldwide conspiracy to embarrass them. Having risen in the last 25 years and watching the academics, artists and educators have "disappeared" over the past 25 years. He shows great courage to set up his work. The realism achieved by blasting at the real World Cup qualifying shooter really brings you to the event. The fact that he shot it at 35mm is incredible, as most will only try this project with a digital format. It looks fantastic. His insistence on using only non-professional actors also really works in this film. Fine performances all around. After watching many movies showing the problems Iran has, and also the news media reporting the facts, we can demonstrate both the people and the government. This film does the opposite. It shows us that they still love the same things and that by laughing themselves and the absurd rules of Sharia law that perhaps a change for the better is not too far. Some call Panahi a feminist filmmaker, but I think he's only fighting for the most repressed demographic in Iran. Young independent women.
