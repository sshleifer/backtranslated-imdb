I probably doubled my knowledge of Iran when I saw secret ballot (2001). Now I know about four times as much. I doubt I learned much from a whole series of Nie Sonder My Daughter (1991). Offside is a wonderful budget Iranian comedy about a group of girl (individual work) to attend a decisive soccer game for their country's place in the World Cup. Women are not allowed to attend soccer matches, so the nation's armed forces are mobilized to save any women who want to come out of themselves. Some (teen?) Girls try to crash the party by dressing as boys, but are caught. The film is usually placed on this container where the girls are kept by soldiers, in anticipation of an indefinite sentence (although the girl dressed as a soldier claims to have been one insignia to carry out!) /> <br /> The film explores the absurdity of the situation. The thoughts that women get out of soccer matches come down to the fact that it is too racial an experience for the cleaner sex. A philosophy not less than 100 years ago in the west unknown. This farce comes on a head when a girl has to go to the bathroom, such a soldier accompanies her claims to cover her eyes so she can't see the graffiti. The conflict is not entirely about the struggle of the sexes: at one stage there is a friction between a firmer, rural area and the urban girls. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, this movie was not too culturally esoteric that the Comedy was lost on this neighbor and cultural cousin of the Great Satan. You have to be there, but no one should avoid this movie because they think they won't.
