It's one of Disney's top five animated features, in my opinion. Cinderella was a perfect return to the full-length animation film (unlike the 40's compilation movies), and expensive depth via the multi-planet camera does not return to the movie in any other way. Although Disney adjusts the story somewhat liberally, you gather the idea of ​​the era through the dress and set styling --- a clear period that the story takes place. <br /> <br /> Sinderella is more mature than Snow White, and a multi-dimensional character. Actually, all the characters are somewhat well developed, except for the Prince - most flat - we know he has a sense of humor and a big smile, but it's about everyone. Like Snow White, Disney has a permanent impact on the popular culture story. In most versions of Cinderella, the stepchildren are attractive, not as beautiful as Cinderella, and their character takes away from their otherwise beautiful appearance. <Br /> <br /> Favorite Disney Additions: The Mice! Also appreciates the continuity - Cinderella always loses her shoe throughout the film. The addition of the homemade gown as well as the next assault of the stepchildren was always a horrible child - I remember View Master showing it with a black background and a big red light on it! The broken slipper shows the reluctance of the evil Lady Tremaine to give her hold on Cinderella and acknowledge the defeat. --- Audley would feature the most wicked of all Disney villains, satanic witch Maleficent, in Sleeping Beauty.
