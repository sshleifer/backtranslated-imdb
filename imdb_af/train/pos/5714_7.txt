I was so excited to see this movie because I have always heard it was very scary. <br /> <br /> What is interesting is that it is a Japanese film that they decided to bring to America, but they actually filmed it. Japan with the original crew! I think it made the movie ... more Japanese (that's probably why it was quite successful as opposed to most Japan-after-America horror movies), but it also made a bit inaccessible to American audiences. The difference in what frightened Japanese culture and what frightened American culture was felt throughout the film. It worked well in moments when they intended to capture the nervous fear of the main character: a horrible fish in a big, busy, unknown, Tokyo dam. <br /> <br /> The storyline was also confusing. In typical Japanese fashion, it is extremely complicated and confusing. The beginning of the movie is actually the middle of the story and from there we are constantly moving forward and backward until we see the end and the beginning of the story at the end of the film. This constant look through time was very confusing to me. I also didn't think some things were explained so well and I had to ask my friend to explain it to me (she has already seen it, as well as the successor who apparently reveals more of the story). <br /> <br /> Overall, there is plenty for American audiences to love, tons of freaky images and macabre details that make a healthy splash of bounces.
