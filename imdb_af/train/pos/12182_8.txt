I did no research on the movie before my first viewing because it was part of a Welles set I recently bought. I got a set of boxes mainly because I wanted to own a man for all seasons and also reconsidered Waterloo. So I keep Orson and Rita in the player and I am treated equally with class and confusion. <br /> <br /> On the surface, the story was a simple one, the man meets a beautiful woman and saves her from some of the thugs, they click right away and the man gets a job offer " a cruise with the woman and her famous lawyer husband, and then ............. <br /> <br /> .. well It becomes a murder of planned devil and many shenanigans. Michael O'Hara (Orson Welles) himself doesn't really know what's going on, he's as confused as the viewer is, and it's great to watch as he's almost all drawn into the movie. It is clear that the fights are drawn by a femme fatale of such beauty as Elsa Bannister (Rita Hayworth) has moments, but you just know things are going to go pearl-like. <br /> <br /> So many wonderful things In the film, Welles' visual style is everywhere, sees a scene in a wonderful aquarium and the finale in a fun house is majestic on the eye. The story of O'Hara is joyful and mocking. good light relief through a court case with Everett Sloane significantly litigated proceedings. <br /> <br /> But the movie is a stranger, and it's actually a slick viewing experience, because (as I had to find out later) studio workers cut the film almost an hour, and that's not just frustrating us for the viewer, but unfair for Welles' vision, I am positive that a full original movie of this film has been congratulated and respectful because it is tho, we have a very good and intriguing film one that unfortunately only shows with greatness, but remains a frightening movie I am glad I own to continue.
