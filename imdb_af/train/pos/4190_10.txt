Thelma Ritter stole the picture. I just finished looking at it again. I couldn't help getting emotional in her final scene. She didn't get the Oscar. Therefore, you should not put too much faith in Oscars. Richard Widmark never played a better role and was perfect as a 3-D defective person. Jean Peters was wonderful as the street fish, tough girl in her best role ever. And Richard Kiley had to be very good; Why would I have hated him like that? Yes, it was heavily handed over to patriotism; but without having much of a movie. Look at their faces! The top three stars don't need much script. I would like to see them do this movie without dialogue. If you've ever seen Ray Milland and Rita Gam in "The Thief", maybe you know what I mean. When I was a kid on my first trip to NYC in 1956, I drove my Bronx Uncle to the foot of South Street, looking for No. 66. Then I know Hollywood can't be trusted. But I found the river. <br /> <br /> I don't give away much of the story because I hate it if I know what happens before I see it for myself. If you saw it, it's not necessary. Perhaps someone who reads this comment did not see Pickup On South Street. You will love it; Don't just search for 66 South Street in New York City.
