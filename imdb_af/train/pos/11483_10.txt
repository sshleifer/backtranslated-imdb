The thing that makes this film so scary is the way it portrays André and Calvin as (relatively) ordinary guys. It's certainly not people who want to become professional filmmakers, as they move around in front of the camera, forget about written lines, etc. They just make the video a diary to show "the survivors" how normal their lives were. Their parents just think the guys are filming for a family home video. By examining other children's attacks on their schools, André and Calvin learn what they should not do and inform them (usually in a stupid 'This Old House' kind of way) any potential 'Andres and Calvin' who can watch this video To make bombs, get weapons, and don't get caught up before Zero Day (the day of the attack).
