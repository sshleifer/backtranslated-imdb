Cary Grant and Myrna Loy are perfectly thrown as a middle class couple who want to build the house of their dreams. It all starts with reasonable plans and expectations. Both are blown up by numerous complications and an explosion of the original budget. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of laughter (though the story is somewhat thin) sure to entertain the stars of the stars or the late 1940's Hollywood comedy style. A particular highlight comes when a contractor runs out of all expenses, which had to sound rather excessive for a 1948 audience. Leaving his exit, he assures the client (Grant) that he could reach a $ 100.00 reduction in total ... or at least $ 50.00 ... but definitely $ 25.00. Hilarious!
