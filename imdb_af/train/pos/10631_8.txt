This movie was seen by my wife and I when it came out in 1978. It was a revelation to us. We actually thought we were the only gay and lesbian couple who ever married and had children. It was clear that we were wrong. Love can come from where you don't expect it and may not want it. But we both preferred that love anyway. <br /> <br /> No, it never changed our sexual orientation. Those kinds of things are for the Christian wackos. <br /> <br /> When we were young, we both had issues but never with the opposite sex. As we got old, we stopped having extramarital affairs. <br /> <br /> This story is not far-fetched. The suggestion that they became heterosexual, however, seems to me unrealistic. My wife and I have been sleeping together for the past 40 years. We're still gay. End of the story.
