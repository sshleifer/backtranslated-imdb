A heart-warming film. The usual wonderful play by John Thaw, which recently passed. A man who was always so modest. He was one of England's top 10 actors, certainly of my time. <br /> <br /> He can be remembered for his well-known role of Inspector Morse. Like Jack Regan in the 1970s hit the TV series' The Sweeney and as a lawyer in Kavanah QC. A must have for the whole family and a great DVD for my collection. The filming will bring back a few memories to those who remind Britain of the war and certainly those who have been evacuated from London to escape the German attacks. The interaction between the two main characters. Tom and the boy William were really well behaved and trusted by the book by Michelle Magorian.
