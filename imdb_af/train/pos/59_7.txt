While I was in the video store, I ran through the one dollar and came to this jewel. I don't know what it was about, but I just had a gall and I was right. <br /> <br /> The story focuses on two girls who have just survived a school shooting. One of the girls is Alicia, a teenage rebel, who is the only witness to the full attack and the other is Deanna, another survivor who survived a bullet on the head by a miracle. Thrown together by fate, they slowly start a painful and beautiful display of healing and moving. <br /> <br /> I just hate it when amazing movies fall through the cracks. Because wow what a show by Busy Phillips and Erkia Christensen not to mention the rest of the role! My only complaint is that the DVD is lacking in special features. Oh yeah, and some of the jets in the movie were kind of stumbling blocks. But all in all an excellent movie.
