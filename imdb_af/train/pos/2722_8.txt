This recreation of the infamous 1959 murders in Kansas, based on the Capote book, is heavily filmed by Brooks and cinematographer Hall in black and white, giving it a documentary feel. There are good performances by Blake and Wilson as the killers and Forsythe as a cop they pursue. The scenes that led to the murders filmed at the real house where the crime occurred, with a soundtrack of whistling winds, are very intense and cool. Brooks leads with many paints and uses several interesting transitions between scenes. The only complaint is that it is a bit overgrown, with the unbundling pulled out and somewhat preachy.
