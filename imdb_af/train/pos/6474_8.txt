I pulled all the way in and couldn't wait for every episode. The acting has come to life how emotionally a missing person should be in the family, along with the consequences it will have on the neighbor. The only problem we had as a family was how quickly it was "explained". We couldn't clearly hear what was said and had no idea what Gary's role was in the whole thing? Why did Kyle phone him and why did he go with it? Having invested in a series for five hours, we deceived that only five minutes were held back for the conclusion. I asked and none of my friends who watched it were any wiser. Very strange, but maybe we missed something critical ????
