Jack Frost is about a serial killer sentenced to death. On the road to his death sentence, the prison truck he is driving collides with a chemical tanker filled with a chemical that changes its molecules with the snow on the ground and changes it into a snowman. To be a murderer who would turn him into a killer snowman. Jack now wants revenge on the sheriff who has caught him. Jack is now starting to kill his rampage people in a small town. <br /> <br /> I don't think Jack Frost has the chance to become a horror classic, but it's an entertaining movie. Just attach your brain and enjoy it, but don't take it too seriously.
