Well, some people will say this particular movie stinks ... but hey! It's not right, not right. The movie may not have the best special effects, and may not have the best actors. (Except for the Barbarian Bros.) Despite this little fact, I can honestly say that this is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen, and I've seen!
