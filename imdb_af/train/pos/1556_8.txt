Like other people commenting on "Fr√§ulein Doktor", I accidentally stumbled upon this nightmare on a post-TV without having heard it before. The strange mix of a pulp-fiction story about a sexy but unscrupulous anti-heroine on the one hand and a realistic and well-researched representation of war in the trenches, on the other hand, hacked me from the start. <br /> <br /> For me this is one of the five best movies about WWI (the other is "All Quiet On The Western Front", "Paths of Glory", "Gallipoli" and the post-war "La vie" et rien d'autre "). And the scene with the poison gas attack is really cooling; the horses and men look like riders of the apocalypse with their gas masks. <br /> <br /> I just wish I signed the movie.
