I will first say that I am very satisfied with this climax of the Bourne trilogy. Please, oh, please don't ruin it by doing a sequel from now on or a prequel. Leave it alone. Right .. move up. As talented and versatile as Matt Damon is, it seems he was just meant to play Jason Bourne. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of the first two Bourne movies, you won't be disappointed by the third installment. It sticks to what works and adds a little more. I was delighted to see how well all the information we get in 'Identity' and 'Supremacy' is all in the 'Ultimatum' to finally paint the full picture of Jason Bourne's troubled past. The action ranges are fast and keep you on the edge of your chair. The battles between Bourne and the assassins are always nice to watch. I've always been a fan of movies around CIA agents and how the CIA collects their Intel and this movie is right on the street. It makes me even more exciting for me. <br /> <br /> If you choose to watch The Bourne Ultimatum without looking at the previous 2 installments. You will still enjoy the movie thoroughly, but I still recommend watching them first. This will allow you to fully understand and attach the character Jason Bourne and be part of his world. It allows you to appreciate and enjoy the movie even more. I'm not sure which is the best of the first 2, but personally I think that 'Ultimatum' might have just the edge when comparing the trilogy.
