One of the last great musicals of the 60's. I was 7 years old the first time I saw this movie, and it's been a favorite ever since. The music numbers are all memorable. In the 60's, the people who were thrown into musicals actually had musical talent (as opposed to a certain academy-prize nominated current musical based in a large middle-western city). All the lead roles were beautifully cast ... Ron Moody shines like Fagin, like Shani Wallis as Nancy. Oliver Reed was a threatening Bill Sikes (who fortunately had no musical numbers) and Mark Lester as Oliver and Jack Wild as the Dodger were also great. Mark Lester comes across as an innocent waif, what was Dickens' intention when he wrote the book! Then there are, of course, the dozens of dancers who keep in mind: "I want to do something" "Who will buy" and "Get back soon!" Lots of kids! It's a great show for the whole family.
