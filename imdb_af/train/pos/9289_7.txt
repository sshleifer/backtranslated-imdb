In the BARBARIAN AND THE HISTORY John Wayne Townsend Harris, a true United States envoy responsible for the fact that Japan was opened to international relations in the late 1850s, is playing. In front of him, Commodore Perry pushed Japan mainly with rifles in 1853 and in 1853 applied a treaty to the Japanese. Harris, who just turned up a little later, worked through the details and helped ensure compliance - as many Japanese had no specific tendency to honor the first treaty. All this is true and is shown in the film. According to some other sources, I found that the romance between Harris and a Japanese Geisha is mostly fiction and this romance is much of the focus of this movie (thus the title). <br /> <br /> My first reaction first The time I have seen is one of the surprises. John Wayne as a diplomat?! When he is diplomatic in most films, he says please and thank you when he pummels people !! To see him play a man who is NOT a man of action and able to play the diplomatic game, it seems very strange. In fact, I can't think of too many actors in 1958, which would have been more unusual for this role. By the way, I've seen photos of Harris and Wayne has virtually no resemblance to him. <br /> <br /> But despite the story taking many freedoms with the truth and the strange casting, the film is still very viewable. The color kinematics are nice, the film shows some good insights into Japanese customs and culture, and the acting is not bad. All in all, a nice and viewable movie in spite of its strange casting. <br /> <br /> PS - Read through the trivia for this movie. You get a little more about the real characters, as well as an alleged battle between Wayne and the director (John Huston) where Wayne apparently challenged him !! Based on what I read about Huston and the way he came with actors, it's an incident I tend to believe. And it's also a good example of John Wayne's "diplomacy".
