Why Panic never had a good loss of theater is easy to see: it is far too clever, and audiences would probably have had a difficult time with it, comparing it to American Beauty in the midlife crisis investigation. Sopranos and Analyze it in his study. of illegal destruction in family life. Although Panic appears to be of original material, Brommel's vibrant characters, along with sophisticated dialogue and striking direction, play a realistic look at the withdrawal of a middle-aged man. <br /> <br /> William H. Macy stars as Alex, a hitman working for his father's (Sutherland) contract-killing business. He leads a double life, with his wife (Ullman) and son unaware of his true trade. In his middle age, he is increasingly frightened by what he has done throughout his life. Under his tranquility, advanced facade, suppressed resentment, gathered for his father's mastery of his life. When he meets a young woman (Campbell), he feels inspired and decides it's time to end the family business. <br /> <br /> The fact that writer / director Henry Brommel has decided to make the profession has tried to break his main character. away from contract murder is discarded. He could have easily replaced it with any unwanted occupation. His characters are so well developed and credible, scenes are so smoothly and realistically handled, and dialogue is so informative and, of course, that the focus is on Macy's conflicting character, rather than his work as a hitman. Brommel's script feels like a Shakespeare tragedy, with a definite theme of the lot that runs continuously. <br /> <br /> In Alex, Macy creates a tragic, easily sympathetic character, and becomes a breeding, good performance as always expected. Donald Sutherland is also effectively abusive and insulting as his remaining father, and Ullman's dramatic turn as Macy's wife is a welcome change for the comedian. Consider a scene in a bicycle shop, where her mood is subtly darkened and in an influential scene of emotional confusion. <br /> <br /> Henry Brommel's first feature, Panic, is a film that is well-crafted in its sincerity. With a first-class cast, probable writing, sharp dialogue and good direction, this character study is hopefully just a taste of Brommel's ability to create real-looking characters. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
