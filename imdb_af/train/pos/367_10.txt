"The Color Purple" is really great. There is no one like this, and I don't think there will ever be. It is a roller coster of emotion and pain that the viewer assumes. The actors are flawless and directing is wonderful. I absolutely loved it. A movie never made me so happy. It's beautiful, it's the best way to explain it.
