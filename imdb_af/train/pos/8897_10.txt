My sister and I rented this movie because we were in the mood for something noisy and not so demanding to watch. However, the film exceeded very few expectations. <br /> <br /> It is so much more than just a representation of a century. It has many real-life representations of the characters in it and most of the actors do a wonderful job. The various stories are baked along with the actual footage from the time it gives a very unique touch. As I watched it, I really felt I had care about what happened to the characters. <br /> <br /> I also want to endlessly praise Julia Stiles in her depiction of Katie, she was fantastic in a way that stands out! <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone.
