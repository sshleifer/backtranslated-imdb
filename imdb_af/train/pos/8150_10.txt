Me, Kasi Lemmings is definitely a fair woman. This movie is a lost jewel, a dead-end satire "mockumentary" of the early 90's Hip Hop scene, when MC Hammer just disappeared in that good night. We follow the three members of the NWH as they start their peak-rich journey of happy wealth and fame. And like Nickolas Nickleby, they end their journey not far from where they started, but at least a little wiser and much less naive. This is one of the best movies no one has ever heard of, but it's the kind of movie you love or hate, much like "Company Man" in this regard. I see this movie as the 1000 islands of New York. It's a wonderful little secret you want to keep for yourself.
