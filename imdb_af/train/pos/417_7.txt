This movie has Wild Bill Hickok, Calamity Jane, Buffalo Bill and General Custer all together. Gary Cooper plays Wild Bill and Jean Arthur plays Calamity Jane and Charles Bickford plays the bad man selling weapons to the Indians and you can barely recognize him. It was the first time that Cecil B. DeMille and Gary Cooper worked together and the next movie was basically the same, but at a different time. This movie begins with Lincoln's assassination and it is also about an Indian war. Calamity Jane is in love with Wild Bill and Buffalo Bill is married and now wants to stay home. This movie is also about Custer's last stand and is far from accurate. Gary Cooper is good as usual and I usually don't like Jean Arthur, but I kept her here.
