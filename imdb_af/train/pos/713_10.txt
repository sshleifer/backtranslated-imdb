this movie is great. sort of. This lecturer really says a lot, or does a lot, but it's a great movie to watch because of how stupid it is. the high school is taken over by the evil ms.togar who hates the one thing that all the students love, rock & roll. Riff Randle all gets tickets for the ramon show, and this movie peak with a takeover of the school led my riff randle and the ramone. This movie has everything, a bad writing, dubious directing, bad actors (ie clint howard & pj sole), an incredible soundtrack, extreme championship, these elements and more come together to make it what it is, a classic. <br /> <br /> Note - during the live ramonone set, note that there are crashes of germs in front of the crowd. neat-o.
