I had a good laugh reading all the idiotic comments for this movie, as it is clear that the people who criticized the movie never saw it or were stupid enough to pay to see it. <br /> <br /> The best reason to watch was a few years back on the Elvira show. Elvira has the movie laughing as much as he can. <br /> <br /> This is a good monster movie, compared to the hundreds of horrible American movies made. Much better !!!!
