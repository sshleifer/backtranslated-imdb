Oddly enough, this movie never made it on the big screen in Denmark, so I had to wait for the video release. My expectations were high, but they were in no way disappointed. As always with Ang Lee, there are fantastic plays, an intelligent and exciting plot that guesses right to the end and great filming. Along with Unforgiven, it is easily one of the two best westerns of the 90's. <br /> <br /> People who expect something along the line of Mel Gibson in The Patriot (corny) or Braveheart (acceptable) will be sour Disappointed, anyone who appreciates the above features will have a fantastic time to do so. look. 9 out of 10.
