I loved Long Way Round and wasn't even aware of Race to Dakar until I saw it on the shelves of my local supermarket. I bought it and after a little "hmm it would be so good" first episode I decided it was. Charlie Boorman was great like the other crew members. Great to see him again with Ewan. There was a fair share of it, but it didn't bother me. As for them no mention of it on the package. It's more to do with the stupid, exceptional classification certificate the BBFC has. They had only given it 15 for the language. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended series, I want more !!
