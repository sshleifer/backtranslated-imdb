"The intruder (L'Intrus)" is a visual pilgrimage through a mysterious life. <br /> <br /> Grizzled Michel Subor plays 'Louis Trebor' like Jason Bourne as an old man with a hidden past, living in an isolated hut in the woods, for just paranoid reasons (but pulling pretty young women that could be useful to him). We learn more about him through dreams, flashbacks and a journey that can unfold chronologically or not, as well as through its lively interactions with family, lovers, business partners and a striking nemesis. Like the "The Limey", the film with parent / kid jumble and a suspicious past is revealed through an old movie with the same actor as a young man (here is Paul Gégauff's 1965 adventure film Le Reflux). <br /> <br /> In a full contrast to moods, we meet his son Sidney (Grégoire Colin), who must be the most sought-after homemaker in the world, as he does sweet and seductive domestic repairs and cares for a baby. a toddler and each need his working wife. Certainly, director / co-writer Claire Denis had created him as a woman's fantasy if there was ever one and one lesson for other filmmakers about filming foreplay. There is an extra-large scene in which he looks for his father in the bush while carefully carrying his English baby in a bag. He is everything his father is not and has every relationship his father is unable to sustain; No wonder he thinks his father is ugly. I was terrified by the rest of the film that something would only happen to him, since the true nature of the heart of his estranged father is being played out very gradually before our eyes. <br /> <br /> The movie is a puzzle, but Subor is ruthlessly fascinating as we see him crossing countries and negotiating fraudulent negotiations, and the voice-over-telling for Denis's "Beau Travail" was anyway irritating. We need to find out about skylines and accidental signs that he travels to Geneva, Korea and the Southern Pacific. Over time is indicated by changing the seasons and scarring is created and healing. There are many images of water for cleaning and for distancing. <br /> <br /> By promoting her fascination with the morphing of colonialism in globalization, as well as playing on stereotypes of the Mysterious East and Russian criminals, Denis has elements of Robert Louis Stevenson, Paul Gauguin and Marlon Brando's Tahiti included. idyllic and a 40-page memo by French philosopher Jean-Luc Nancy, the last for the title and heart transplant diagram used for an ironic theme of limited immortality. <br /> <br /> While "Louis" thinks he has managed to be top boundaries, rules and morals, there is some entertainment in the last action, as locals don't quite know what to do with him. do not try and help him solve his mercury odyssey, even if he is in isolation again. <br /> <br /> Several people in the audience left frustration with the elliptical, but remarkably beautiful, story telling method. The unconventional narrative raises many questions about details.
