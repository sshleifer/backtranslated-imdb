Not that many movies really use the fear of going to the dentist who has many people. Those in the profession have some really intimidating search tools. Give writers Dennis Paoli, Stuart Gordon, and Charles Finch for achieving maximum value in their shoulder value. <br /> <br /> Corbin Bernsen, in a nicely nuanced performance, is Alan Feinstone, a dedicated dentist whose train jumps well in advance. An unbalanced obsessive-compulsive, he begins to dwell on thought of decay, even imagining where there is none, and likewise compares decay with corruption of society in general. After witnessing his unbelieving wife Brooke (Linda Hoffman), he decided to punish her. At the same time, he is under pressure from a smarmy I.R.S. agent (Earl Boen, known as Dr Silberman of the "Terminator" franchise) to do a favor in exchange for the agent holding his mouth over Feinstone's financial affairs. Feinstone is starting to find everyone around him, who somehow declines and he goes on a murder order if police detective Gibbs (the always welcome Ken Foree) picks up his path. <br /> <br /> Director Brian Yuzna clearly has fun with writing. It caters for some really nasty and remarkable entertaining gore scenes that make as well as sympathy for the victims to make the audience exciting. The writing gives the Feinstone character a few fine rules and is generally pretty clever and amusing, with huge doses of pitch-black humor (like Feinstone who ordered a victim to get their tongue out of the way!). Brooke and the I.R.S. agent figure in especially effective torture scenes. The makeup effects are usually pretty good. And the film does a fine job of retaining its forward momentum, as Feinstone, with his relentless running to perfection, switches from respected professional to unholy killer in record time. <br /> <br /> Foree, always cool and fun to watch, was rather wasted in a detective role, but there is a little pleasure watching Boen playing his smartball part. Hoffman and Christa Sauls offer very attractive eye cakes. And a pre-fame Mark Ruffalo can be seen in a small supporting role. But it's just as much Bernsen's performance as he sinks his teeth (forgiveness for using that expression) in his plum that is part of total conviction. <br /> <br /> The Dentist is one of the more original and interesting horror films from the 1990s. <br /> <br /> 8/10
