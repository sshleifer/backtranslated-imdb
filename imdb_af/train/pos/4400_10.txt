The star of this movie is the script. Attention to detail for the period in dress, language, social mores (we do not hurt women) and politics is remarkable. This is a reminder of Kosovo today. The subtle pieces in the action scenes are there for an attentive viewer and the choreography of these actions is wonderful. Perhaps this film is near the reality leg to receive the support it needed to receive. It is like a step of increasing violence, with good pauses of peace and tranquility between each step. A great movie.
