The original title means "The Birth of the Octopuses". I have to admit that I don't understand this title well. The English title is "Water Lilies". But after I wrote it, I read another user's comment: "The title in French is also suggestive:" Prieuve or octopus, suggest that an individual must pressurize at the same time. " Thank you for your explanation. <br /> <br /> The basic theme is the first sexual emotions of girls, when it is not clear if they are directed to the same or the other sex. It's no different for boys. I think both Floriane and Marie will eventually have heterosexual feelings without any additions. <br /> <br /> Much of the movie is water ballet. Sometimes the girls will have their heads down, and nothing above the water, except their feet and legs, so they will move and kick in the air. For people like me who have never seen such things, it was fascinating. - Floriane is the leader of one team "water lilies". <br /> <br /> Marie tells her she wants to see when Floriane is training. It seems to be their first contact, not just ordinary. Soon they will walk together. Floriane takes Marie to a garage where a boy is waiting for her and then goes away with him for an hour while Marie is waiting for her to return. Obviously I assumed that the couple slept with each other. But we'll learn from the movie later that they are doing less than that. <br /> <br /> I can provide information that few users will find elsewhere. There's a scene in which Marie secretly steals Floriane's garbage bag. In it she finds an apple, mostly eaten. And Marie continues to eat the rest. ?? There is a parallel scene in another movie, "Kazetachi no gogo" by Hitoshi Yazaki (Japan, 1980). It's about mature young women, and a clearly Lesbian woman is in vain in love with a heterosexual woman. She also steals a rubbish bag from the loved one, and also finds a more or less eaten apple and eats the rest. <br /> <br /> Later, Floriane tells Marie that she wants her first orgasm. Marie says she can't. <br /> <br /> Later, however, Marie says she is indeed prepared to do so. And she masturbated at Floriane. There is no nudity in this scene. <br /> <br /> Probably only a female director would have such a fine psychological performance or study of? I would like to hear Baudelaire, "Les Amours enfantines". <br /> <br /> Floriane is played by Ad√®le Haenel, who made the excellent performance as the autistic girl in "The Little Devils" by Christophe Ruggia (2002). ? a very underrated movie.
