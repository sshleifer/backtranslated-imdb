I love this episode of Columbo. Perhaps this is because Rut Gordon is in it and she is wonderful as a successful mystery writer Abigail Mitchell, an American version of Dame Agatha Christie. She is nice to watch as the beautiful, lovely writer who has suffered a terrible loss when her cousin died in a drowning accident. She blames her cousin's husband, the cousin. She plans to kill him to avenge her because the police have left her. I would love someone else than Mariette Hartley to play Veronica. I never love Hartley in anything personal. And of course with Columbo, there are a few laughs when he asks Veronica for a belly dance class. Ruth's Abigail is a clever sleuth herself and she fits wits with Columbo always played wonderfully by Peter Falk.
