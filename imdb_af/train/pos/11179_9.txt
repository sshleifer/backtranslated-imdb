"Pet Sematary" succeeds in two major situations. First of all, it's a scary Horror movie. Those who just aren't produced in these days. Secondly, it's an emotional, clever movie overall. So if you are looking for cold fever, scarecrows, creepiness and visually stunning institutions, great acting, dialing and horrific effects; this is the movie you're looking for. A classic now and truly a must see for any horror fan. <br /> <br /> Probably the best fit for any of King's novels. The events feel a bit rushed compared to the novel, but that doesn't mean that this underestimated movie isn't a complete Horror / Drama show. <br /> <br /> Stephen King's novel is widely known for being both emotional and abominable. The movie captures the same feeling mainly because there is a great character development and you can feel the loving relationship between its members. Then, if everything seems to be lucky (technically happy, because the title "Pet Sematary" does not offer!) A tragic event changes the film's atmosphere, now it becomes very dark. The film has a sinister feel since the opening credits, but after Gage dies, the film becomes sad, gray, creepy. Handling the loss of a baby boy is something that can ruin a family's whole life, and "Pet Sematary" proves it dramatically. <br /> <br /> The legend behind the pet sematrie is more than a myth that no one wants to experience, but sadness and despair lead an emotionally devastated father to give it a chance. Unfortunately, the legend becomes true and baby Gage comes back from death. The previous encounter with the pet-semantic legend seems to be a tragedy, but this time it is something, much worse. What will happen to the lives of our All American family? Can Pascow Avoid This Tragedy? What about these surreal nightmares? <br /> <br /> See "Pet Sematary" to see one of the most special, emotional Horror movies of the past. You will not regret it. The acting is very good, though I don't dig the actor who portrayed the father. He didn't look as if the situations were asking for his despair. But that's just my opinion. Denise Crosby really delivered a good performance and worked perfectly as the noble mother. Baby Gage was incredible, even on its creepy parts. * Shivering *. Overall, it's a tremendous classic of all time and a disturbing movie that touches people's deepest fears ... the loss of someone you love, the dead who return to life and a sense of despair. <br /> <br /> Something's for sure ... I don't want to be buried in a pet seminar!
