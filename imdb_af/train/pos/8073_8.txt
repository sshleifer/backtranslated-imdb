A brilliant portrait of a traitor (Victor McLaglen in Oscar winning performance) driven by his own conscience. McLaglen plays an IRA rouge who betrays his leader to raise a reward during Ireland's Sinn Fein Rebellion. The screens that indicate battles and mob actions are very realistic and focus on the despair within individuals. The lack of hope for a better future seems a lot worse than death. <br /> <br /> Director John Ford creates a dark and tense atmosphere, enhanced by the foggy and grim portrayal of the Irish landscape. Max Steiner's dramatic music party adds to the cinematic delight. Oscar Winner also for best script, nominated for best photo. It's one of Hollywood's Classic.
