Oh, dear, we don't like our superhero love being developed, do we have a brain? <br /> <br /> Something happened to people, they lost the ability to enjoy, a simple feel-good, love story / comedy? Kirsten Dunst is a revelation - funny, sexy and real. I laughed aloud at least five times and I am not ashamed to say that I also had a tear in my eye a few times. The movie, acting and writer is great, I watch a lot of movies across the board and I haven't seen one in this genre that was so successful. Those who disagree please tell me where I can find some! I'm sure the book is good too, but I think you should judge it on its own merit.
