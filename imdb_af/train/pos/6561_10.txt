Honestly, this is the best reality show anyone ever got. To win the money, you have to be INTELLIGENT. Not just that you have to be brave, athletic, smart, etc. It actually requires skill. Not like some lame-ass shows that these days. And yet they only have two seasons of that! Bull .. they have to bring this show back !! <br /> <br /> However, they will have a tough time pulling Anderson Cooper away from CNN. He was wonderful. <br /> <br /> But seriously, it was a great show. You never knew who was going to go. And it was so much fun to find the mole yourself! It was a show you could actually play if you wanted to! <br /> <br /> BRING BACK THE MOLE! BRING BACK THE MOLE!
