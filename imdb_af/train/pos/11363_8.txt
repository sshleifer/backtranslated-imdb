Imagine it being so hampered by a bureaucracy that one man spends 8 years of his life, and has a mental breakdown that tries to solve a massacre virtually himself! The murder technique is clear, but a government that doesn't want to admit the truth lets us destroy a monster dozens of lives. If I think my work is stressful, I just remember the true story behind this miracle movie. The dedication to serving the main character is portrayed masterfully by Rea. The comic (and almost tragic at times) relationship between Rea and the Sutherland character made this one of my favorite movies of the past 5 years. Catching one of the worst mass murderers in history had hit me on the edge of my seat. While not as well advertised and spoken as "Silence of the Lamb's", the plot was just as exciting. Rent or buy this movie today!
