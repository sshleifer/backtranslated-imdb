I just finished this fine thought, and beautifully acted / directed film. It was nice to see if I was going to waste my time watching a movie on the Lifetime Movie Network because of the horrible distracting ads. Reading the previous comments convinced me to give it a chance. The worst thing that can happen is that I can fall asleep during one of the boring but long bug spray ads. So why did I watch it? mainly because the IMDB gives a movie a "weighted average" of 5.8. WHAT STATISTIC AVERAGE WAS 7.3 It must be a definite hit. <br /> <br /> I was delighted to take the time to watch this movie, commercial smallpox and all. Helen Hunt remains amazed at her ability to tackle hard rolls that adjust her core person to fit every role. <br /> <br /> The portrait she painted in this movie was beautifully executed. When the scene calls for quick witted, delivered verbally in time, she can stand against the toes with any actor. Yet, she is proficient in delivering volumes of emotional response without expressing a word that is only used on facial expression and body language. Without the ads, which by design kills the continuity of any good movie, it would have been a real nail bit. I gave it a 9.0
