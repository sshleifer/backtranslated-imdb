This movie is great. If you like watching B-class movies, this is. This is a classic college 80's treasure movie, in which one song is played throughout the entire soundtrack. A horrible movie, but worth renting for fun, or just watching old men come out of the closet with knives. Maybe funny, if you ask me.
