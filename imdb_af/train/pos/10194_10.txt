It would have worked much better if it was made as "Mitchell in Malta." At least then we would have been the face of Joe Don Baker to save an otherwise picturesque Mediterranean dressed in that ridiculous search-cowboy outfit ... not to speak like an Old West gunslinger. Mitchell is Mitchell, the movie would also not suffer from a lack of gratuitous police brutality. Oh good. At least, the comic commentary by Mike and the Bots made this enjoyable journey as an episode of MST. However, I cannot imagine watching it on its own.
