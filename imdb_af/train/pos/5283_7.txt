The premise for this movie is simple and so is the writing: An elderly Muslim gets his teenage son to drive him in his similar older station wagon from France to the shark in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, so that he can make his holy Muslim commitment fulfilled before he dies. The father is religiously religious, but the son is unimportant; He accepts from his duty to his father rather than religion. He would rather be with his (non-Muslim) friend. The father is stubborn in many things the boy does not understand and the petulance between them is the device that maintains the drama, although it is often rather annoying. However, like any good road movie there are strange characters on the way; for example, a woman on a back road in Croatia who, after being asked for directions to Belgrade, simply comes in the back seat, shows her a word that they assume to be a place, but it cannot found on the map. In Bulgaria another man asking for directions confirms he can speak French, but then offers a comprehensive comment in Bulgarian. There is also occasional humor - in one country the boy has ribbons to eat egg sandwiches and wants meat - they are given a goat, but unfortunately (perhaps fortunate for the viewer), it goes away before the father goes to the Muslim slaughter ritual can execute. They eventually make it to Mecca - the Muslim equivalent of the Vatican, but on a much larger scale. For westerners this is bizarre but fascinating. The movie is not sophisticated, but is beautiful in its own way, a kind of National Geographic with soul.
