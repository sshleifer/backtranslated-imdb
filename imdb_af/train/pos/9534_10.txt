Acting This movie is a very well-activated movie. I will say that the performances are sometimes slightly weak; but for the most part the play is very good. The only actor who blew me away with his performance was Jude Law as Harlen Maguire. He was incredible! Tom Hanks was unclear at some points in the film, but he was also incredible. Paul Newman, good as always. Cinematography This is what made the movie a masterpiece (and I rarely use it). Conrad Hall is a true genius. If you were to interrupt it at any point in the movie, you would see the delicacy of this man. He sets up every shot so nothing is left out. When the camera is still there, there is a postcard like quality on the screen. When the camera moves, each shot is planned to underestimate perfection. But it doesn't stop there. The choice of colors and contrast between light and dark settings is a work of art. The way he relieves the set is the most wonderful lighting work I've seen. His work on this movie made it what it was. This movie is at the top of the list for the best movies with LOTR, Black Hawk Down, Hero, CTHD, Moulin Rouge and Vertigo. Story People will say this movie is a 1930 gangster movie, but I believe they missed the point of the movie. It is a love story of a hit that fails to protect his son from the life he has chosen. It is a brilliantly crafted story that unfolds in a beautiful bond between two people who have nothing but one another. The screenwriting is an Oscar worthy. Music Thomas Newman makes a sad but hopeful score to strengthen this sad but hopeful story. The music is of the most beautiful and moving scores I have. Direction Sam Mendes is a new director with the experience of an experienced director. The symbols he uses and the performances he gets from his actors are a rarity in the contemporary film world. I'll be on the lookout for the next Sam Mendes Film. 10/10 one of the most moving and beautiful movies I've ever seen.
