For a long time I haven't seen such a nice animated feature yet. If I have a healthy respect for Pixar, I must say that Ratatouille or any other movie made cannot be compared to this one. Animators have created an amazingly beautiful world here. The graphics are great, the background environment is blowing, almost every object in each frame is perfectly drawn. Sometimes I felt tingling next to my spine - so much I loved what I saw. <br /> <br /> The plot is absolutely romantic. As romantic as the animated movie plot may be. The characters love, especially Hector, the blue rabbit, he owns, pawns, rocks and rules! The other chars are also very nice. The humor is over. <br /> <br /> Generally speaking, creators didn't seem to have invested much in this. I mean it doesn't seem to be too different from Pixar & Dreamworks people, who try hard every time to think something new. And I am very pleased that a product of the European animation studio was so great. They made a wonderful movie, a candy for eye and heart. <br /> <br /> The only little is dumb start and that's why it's 9/10 or not 10/10.
