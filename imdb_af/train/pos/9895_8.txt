A lot of popular high school students are playing a cruel joke on Nerdy Marty (a sympathetic performance by Simon Scuddamore) that makes him terribly mutilated. Five years later, the gang returns to the now crumbling and deserted high school for a reunion. Of course, an angry and vengeful Marty shows up in a jester's costume to make a fiery revenge on his evildoers. Writers / directors Mark Ezra, Peter Litten and George Dugdale are pushing out all the engaging Corny Cliches that make these 80's slideshows flash, so many cheesy fun: fake jumping stories, Stewart's shots, a fierce storm, a crazy storm of hard rock soundtrack, a nice smattering of free female nudity, a totally ridiculous "what hell?" supernatural climax, sticky makeup f / x, and one of those loving lame, "it was all just a terrible dream". In addition, the extensive pieces of the murder contain the abominable goods: Gory highlights include a man's stomach exploding after drinking poisoned beer, a lady taking an acid bath, breaking a man under a big tractor and Two people in the middle electrolyze To have wild passionate sex. Thirty-year-old British cult horror siren Caroline Munro is hilariously miscast as an American teenager in the first third of the movie. The role-players give solid performances, with especially featured work by Carmine Iannaccone as clever writer Pollack, Billy Hartman, as faded Macho beef Frank, and Donna Yeager as an evil slut Stella. Co-producer Dick Randall has an amusing cameo as Munro's messy agent Manny. Harry Manfredini's moody, rattling music repeatedly recovers clues from his "Friday the 13th" scores. Alan Pudney's shining cinematography does the trick. Good, trashy fun.
