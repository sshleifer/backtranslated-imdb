Several years ago when I first saw "Gray Gardens" I remember laughing and finding this hilarious camp. Years later I still laugh aloud as I see it, but after many views I saw the beauty in the strange, twisted relationship between the inexperienced "Big" Edith Bouvier Beale and her daughter, "Little" Edith Bouvier Beale. br /> <br /> Mother and daughter living in their dilapidated 28-room East Hampton home add a new meaning to the term "Shabby Chic". With countless cats, wax plants and opossums as campsites for this auntie and cousin of Jackie O. filmmakers Albert and David Maysles in their home allowed them to live daily. The result is a hilarious, beautiful, sad and moving version of true love and anarchy rule. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Big and Little Edie proves the unbreakable bonds of love. And they live an example of driving, determination and free will. This movie recommended more than I could put into words. This is a rare experience you should see for yourself. <br /> <br />
