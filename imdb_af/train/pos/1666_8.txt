It is a film about Italian artists from the 17th century and an artist in particular, a woman Artemisia, an unprecedented profession for women at that time, and she dares to paint the male with his unique musculature. <br /> <br /> The camera work is mainly indoors, as this is where the artists worked. There are some good shots. Candlelight close-ups represent the beautiful work of classical painters and it is fascinating to watch the painters and their students supported by extensive scaffolding detailing religious frescoes. It is not surprising that the artistic elements of the film (costumes, faces, make-up) are very authentic, because the Italian churches have preserved all these details in their frescoes for centuries. The beautiful Artemisia is encouraged by her father to study among the great Florentine artist, Tassi. He has become expert in the art of perspective and landscape painting (something very new), but the unsuspecting Artemisia is introduced to more than new techniques in the painting. After she sat down, Tassi raped her violently. Her father is furious. Court proceedings follow. <br /> <br /> This romantic drama has a fairly simple story with an unsatisfactory ending. The outstanding feature of the film is its artistic presentation and attention to detail. Scenes such as women walking across a field with the wind wearing their bulky clothes add great effects. <br /> <br /> Artemisia says she paints to please herself; paint her dad to please others. As for this movie, it will please most, I think.
