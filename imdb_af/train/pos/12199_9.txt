The first riddle is to guess what Welles' original movie was. This makes it a real adventure - to see an incomplete skeleton and to use movie lovemaking, suggest the beautiful woman who once supported it. <br /> <br /> If you do, you might see and experience one of the best movies. mysteries ever. As mysteries go, the story is fairly common: a simple distraction, a jealous man as red herring. <br /> <br /> What is quite amazing is Welles's placement of the story in an artificial eye that sees a dark, dark, versatile world. The first real noir, but even darker. It is not a natural world, unless you think of the camera. What we see firsthand is someone who creates a vocabulary that later becomes commonplace. <br /> <br /> For all the celebrations, Kane was a success because of the great drama and story. The camera's eye was shocking, but experimental. Welles would go from there to investigating Shakespeare's mystery story and self-referencing with this eye. Othello and MacBeth both start this season and I see them as part of a single vision. <br /> <br /> The noir here depends on the idea that people are not in control of their lives, even a little - they are manipulated by random factors in the environment. So in telling this story, Welles has to make the environment a character. Several characters as suspects in the mystery. <br /> <br /> So we have the familiar lighting, blocking and corners we know (and have seen many times since). And we have the deliberate closed sets: the park, hunting, picnic area, aquarium, dock, courtroom, Chinese theater and pleasure. I'm sure what the barbarians cut was a lot of "external" narrative that was not of character, but with these strange environments. <br /> <br /> My own solution to the riddle is that the funhouse has done so, among the other character environments launched as suspects. In other words, the manipulation of Black Irish (which we know of notes and one play at the Union Hall was an aspiring novelist) was also not: a force of human conspiracy (the park or the civilized version, the courtroom) or nature (the picnic or civilized version, the aquarium). <br /> <br /> Instead, it was a matter of deliberate caprice by the gods for entertainment. It is, of course, a self-reference to what Welles does: to place these people (including himself) through hell for our own hood, a matter underlined by the Beijing Opera set with Welles. And, of course, this leads to the function where the environment is directly impacting perception. <br /> <br /> About Self-Reference: There is definitely a conscious comment about his relationship with his copy. But I believe there is strong subconscious on his own to explore the environment in which he worked, the studio environment. Certainly, Welles was so screwed, and in the same way as his character. And the screw took the form of the murder of this film and conveyed the rotting body mentioned at the beginning of this comment. <br /> <br /> The poor Rita comes from China, connecting the whole thing, the Chinese theater, the expected rape from above, the loss of the woman. The investment in the environment above all.
