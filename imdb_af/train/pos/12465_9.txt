I definitely recommend reading the book before watching the movie. This book won the National Book Award in 1978 and is a very poignant passage (words not intended). It's not too difficult to read for those who don't read often, don't be afraid! The book looks like the passion of the relationships is more than the movie and the movie will make more sense after the book is read. If I grew up in Melbourne, I could really relate to this book and film. Very few Australian female writers were around the 70's and therefore very little is documented about the way of life for a woman in an urban city in Australia during this era or class. It's a precious piece of Melbourne history. It is a pity that this is documented as one of the 80's soft porn movies. It's far from it and as the other reviewer mentioned, please don't read the DVD jacket, it doesn't represent what the movie is about. Those who rent the movie based on this description will only be disappointed. Just remember this movie was made in 1982, so don't expect the Hollywood to dramatize what they look like today. That's what I like about it. It's also great to see Noni Hazlehurst in this role, she's just fantastic like Nora and it's great to really act her, because if you're near my age, you'll remember her best for her bumps on Playschool and Better Homes and Gardens. Who knew she hid this talent? This movie gives you a whole new impression of her. A classic Australian story!
