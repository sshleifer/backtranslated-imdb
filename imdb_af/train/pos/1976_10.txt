The man who directed "The Third Man" also has the "Who Will Buy" series in "Oliver!" Aimed. Now it's talent. <br /> <br /> I'm raising my hat to Carol Reed. <br /> <br /> I know there are 'second units' involved, but still ... <br /> <br /> And he had to deal with Orson Welles and Oliver Reed ... <br /> <br /> I suppose the quality will come out. <br /> <br /> (It shows in the final scene with Nancy spoiler - everyone should see Oliver for the first time somewhere.) How many lines should I type. <br /> <br /> To encourage people to type too much should not be encouraged. <br /> <br /> I hope it counts as the "10th line".
