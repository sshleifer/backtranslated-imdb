Anna Christie (1931) <br /> <br /> On its own terms, this version of Garbo's Anna Christie, which was shot in German with a whole new role a year later, is only being refined and refined to improve works as the English version (both are US MGM productions). Garbo is more recommended (or more beautiful than a screen presence) and her acting is more limited. And she looks more at ease, probably for many reasons, but we can speculate that she is no longer making her first talk, adapted so quickly. <br /> <br /> Without ever comparing one movie to another, this Anna Christie is still the same O'Neill play with too many words. His themes of a woman who wants love without losing her independence are here, but it comes strange anyway. There are a few scenes missing - the Coney Island section has been shortened and not as good - but overall it's a direct echo of the first movie. The director, Jacques Feyder (Belgian-French), simply does what has already been done. It's a frustrating experience. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to see both movies sequentially because they are exactly blocked. in the same way (not just the sets, but the shots are all the same). There is sometimes a play from the previous film. From the storm, understandable, but also a short scene where Marie Dressler (of the English version), along with her friend on a board walk over a canal, drunk as it can be. But they are just silhouettes, and when the next scene shows their faces, we see the German actors taking their parts. There is definitely no substitute for Dressler, but for me the German father is more credible and honest in his performance. <br /> <br /> Clear the themes - immigration, walking fathers, girls changing to prostitution, and the problems of finding true love - have strong streams back then, especially with European threads (Garbo, appropriate, play a Swedish young woman).
