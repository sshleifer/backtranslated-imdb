I got the first Bill and Ted movie for Christmas and I had to get the second one when I saw it in a store. This one was (I think) just as funny as the first but a much wider story. It was funny how they had their own human hell and how they had to play death. The funny thing was that they played him in stupid little games like clues. The only thing I want to change is Station and Death in the band, but other than that, it was wonderful.
