Last year I saw the movie at the Taos Film Festival, and it was just overwhelmed. It is a rich, warm novel that has been screened, beautifully executed and well-directed. More than anything, it reminded me of the films of David Lean, both in his ability to handle a complex story, and his skill in creating powerful scenes that affect you on different levels. The best movie I've seen in years.
