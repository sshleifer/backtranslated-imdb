Japan is in serious trouble. Demons contaminated Edo, possessed earthly forms and bowed to their unholy will. In addition, the rebirth of Ashura, the Queen of the devils, is near. The only thing that stands against this serious threat is the Demon Wardens, a scary group of warriors, who may be just as bad as the demons themselves. <br /> <br /> Izumo is a retired Demon Warden, who took up theater five years ago instead of Demon Slaying after he accidentally killed an innocent child from Dusk to Dawn). One night through a casual encounter, he met a beautiful and mysterious woman named Tsubaki. Their fortunes distort (literally) and they are bound by fate to be lovers and enemies. <br /> <br /> If you think it sounds like your typical Japanese Fantasy / Swordplay epic, you would be wrong. In fact, there is nothing typical about Ashura. It's a hodge-podge of many different movie genres. Those just mentioned, as well as a comedy, drama and romance. Director Yojiro Takita (Onmyoji) fairly respects the genre (although the comedy is forced into some screens) and the end result is a ridiculous but really nice popcorn film. <br /> <br /> To be sure, there are errors in the movie. Some of the humor seems in vain, and out of place. And the acting isn't the greatest. But seriously, are you watching Fantasy / Swordplay / Comedy movies for the big play? No, we're watching them for the action and the crazy CG visuals that Ashura has in Spades. Not to be misleading, the movie is not all action, but it is spacious enough with many swordplay and buckets of green blood to keep the average viewer happy. <br /> <br /> Bottom line; The movies have errors and are not a martial artist, but they do not try to be and it contains interesting footage and good sword play. The reason why the movie worked for me is that it never takes too much, and if the viewer does the same, they are sure to be delighted by this fun and silly sword-play fantasy action movie. <br /> <br /> My rating 7 out of 10. Fun popcorn movie.
