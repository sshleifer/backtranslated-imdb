I must say I wanted to see this movie long ago, and I wasn't disappointed. Dominic Monaghan's acting is simply fantastic. As part of myself, I can relate to how the story evolves. I have never experienced such a thing, but some awake moments overlap and it can be scary. It was a good movie, worth every penny. I hope one day I can work with Tess, it would be an honor and more. I can recommend it to everyone. Maybe not small children as they might be scared. But if you are an insomniac like me, you will understand the world, the mysteries and the fear. You will like it. <br /> <br /> F.
