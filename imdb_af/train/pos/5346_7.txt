Carol, the young girl in the middle of the story, is being transplanted into a foreign country, Spain, in the late 30's, at the height of the Civil War conflict. For this girl everything is new, in his stranger. The war and her father are her constant worries, as she has to immerse herself in a provincial culture. It's been years behind what she's in New York. <br /> <br /> Imanol Uribe directs this movie through the numbers. Carol's family is, of course, divorced, while Carol's mother is married to someone who is a left-wing air force pilot. The rest of the family's sympathy is with the Franco and the fascists who won the conflict. <br /> <br /> The story doesn't add much to what has been said, much better, but it's an easy movie to watch. Northern Spain's beautiful landscape is shown. Don't expect much action, as most of what happens, revolves around Carol and the young boys she's befriended. <br /> <br /> Clara Lago plays Carol with sincerity and sincerity. Maria Barranco is Carol's mother Aurora, the one who went to America. Rosa Maria Sarda is Maruja, the teacher who loves Carol. Carmelo Gomez, plays Alfonso, the man who left Aurora when she leaves for America. This actor, who usually plays major roles in most Spanish films, has nothing to do, as he remains a mystery in the film.
