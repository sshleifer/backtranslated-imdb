Kiera Nightly went directly from the P&P to this action movie ... she could hardly choose to try her image more dramatically. A great success in Love Actually and as Lizie in Jane Austen's classic, she is again a "throw". Just as her bikini-dressed warrior woman in King Arthur was more skin-like than muscle, it's hard to imagine that this delicate framework is a bounty hunters life ... but then that's exactly what Domino Harvey ( the right one), and I (one of Nags' biggest supporters) believe she's wearing it. <br /> <br /> Stuff .... <br /> * 90210 (for the non-American world) is the postal code of Beverly Hills in LA, where all movie stars live. * Domino Harvey's father's best-known film was Manchurian Candidate (featured in the film). * Domino Harvey died in a drug overdose in her bath before the film came out in June 2005 after being arrested for drug trafficking. She just completed the negotiation for some of her music to be included in the film. * Kiera Knightly refers to Domino Harvey's sexuality in her interview with Lucy Liu. <br /> <br /> If you get this movie a bit far-fetched, then look at Domino Harvey, as the facts are more amazing than fiction.
