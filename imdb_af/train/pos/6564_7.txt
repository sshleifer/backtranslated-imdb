Jake Speed ​​(1986) was an amusing parody of Indiana Jones and other adventurous films popular in the eighties. Wayne Crawford dies as Jake Speed, an adventurer who is always fighting fights wherever he goes. With his assistant Desmond Floyd (Dennis Christopher), they tried the world to act for some action (and some decent story lines). The duo meets a young woman named Margaret (Karen Kopins) whose sister was kidnapped by an evil white slave trader (John Hurt). Can she find Jake and Desmond and convince her to save her brother and sister? <br /> <br /> A juicy and cheesy movie that doesn't pretend to be something it isn't. I have to give this one a recommendation. That's when you enjoy movies that want fun and for those who don't take everything at face value. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
