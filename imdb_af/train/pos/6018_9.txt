I saw it in the early 70's (when I was 16), and in spite of the long slow setup, meetings, riots, etc. Once the desert division started, everyone fell in context and I loved it. (Still, it got very old.) Then I was in a small minority. All criticism seems to focus on the lack of action and narration. Fortunately, I am no longer in such a minority. <br /> <br /> In a somewhat prophetic way, it reveals the political fragmentation, unrest, confrontation, brutal oppression, commercialization and deception. <br /> <br /> Appreciation for this magical movie has grown, and I'm happy about it.
