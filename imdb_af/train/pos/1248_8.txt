"The Golden Child" was Eddie Murphy's first film since his megahit "Beverly Hills Cop". And although it's not as good as "Cop", it's a fun comic adventure. Murphy stars as a find of lost children who have assigned a most unusual case. His command: to find the title character, a child with mystical powers. This movie was titled "Beverly Hills Cop and The Temple of Doom", as parts of this movie play like a Spielberg adventure, like an Indiana Jones comedy. It has comedy with laughter and adventure with special effects. Great fun. <br /> <br /> *** (out of four)
