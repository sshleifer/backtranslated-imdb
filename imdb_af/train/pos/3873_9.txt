This movie is light, funny and beautifully filmed. The lightning is absolutely fantastic, and the colors convincingly convince Vermeer's paintings. <br /> <br /> It is sentimental comedy at its best, above American and French standards, and probably better than English. <br /> <br /> Every character touches, and interpretation is close to perfection. Isabelle Blais is beautiful, Sylvie Moreau is better than the Catherine series, Stephane Gagnon is beautiful, Emmanuel Bilodeau is wonderful in that weird role, and Genevi√®ve Laroche is the perfect best friend! <br /> <br /> I could go hours before getting any negative comments on this movie, so give it a chance and add your own review.
