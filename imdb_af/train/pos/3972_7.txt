In the tradition of G-Men, The House On 92nd Street, The Street With No Name, the FBI story comes as one of the carefully watched movies, showing the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the best possible light. While it was 48-year-old director, J. Edgar Hoover, it would not be displayed in any other light. <br /> <br /> The book by Don Whitehead on which this movie is based is a straightforward story from the desk from which it was founded in 1907 until about the time the movie The FBI Story came out. It is important to remember sometimes there was an FBI before J. Edgar Hoover led it. Some of that time is also covered in the movie. <br /> <br /> But Warner Brothers didn't make a documentary version to give the FBI flesh and blood. The fictional character of John 'Chip' Hardesty was created. Hardesty as played by James Stewart is a career FBI man who has graduated from law school and, rather than working in practice, started working at the desk early in the early twenties. <br /> <br /> In real life, the Bureau was led by William J Burns of the Burns Private Detective Agency. This was actually a major political operation than shown in the film. Burns was at the brink of the Harding administration scandals. When Hoover was appointed in 1924 to bring professional law enforcement techniques and strict standards of competence, he did the same. <br /> <br /> Through the Hardesty family that Stewart and Vera Miles are, we see the FBI's history unfold. In addition, we see much of their personal family history that is completely integrated into the FBI's story itself. Stewart and Miles are certainly an American couple. We follow the FBI through some of the cases where Stewart is involved in the arrest of Ku Klux Klan members, a plot to kill oil rich Indians, the infamous criminals of the thirties, their involvement in the arrest of Nazi imperialists in World War II and against Communist espionage in the Cold War. <br /> <br /> There's a kind of prologue section where Stewart tells a class at the FBI Academy before going into the desk's history, as it interferes with his own. It involves a bomb placed on an airline by a boy who bought a lot of life insurance on his mother before his flight. Nick Adams will give you the creations as the offender and the story is disappointing today. <br /> <br /> Of course, if the FBI story is written and produced today, it will suggest something different and not so American. Yet the FBI has a story to tell and it is not negative at all. <br /> <br /> The FBI Story is not one of Jimmy Stewart's best movies, but it's the first thing I've ever seen with my favorite actor in it so it has a special love for me. If the whole FBI made Jimmy Stewarts, I feel much better about it. There is also a good performance by Murray Hamilton as his friend and co-agent who is killed in a shooting with Baby Face Nelson. <br /> <br /> Vera Miles didn't just marry Stewart, she married the FBI. movie show. It's mostly dated, but still has a good and interesting story to tell.
