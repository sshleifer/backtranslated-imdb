This movie definitely gets an inch from me. These are greasy jokes and even sometimes stereotypical and deviant views of Eastern European people are ignored by most of the movie. The plot is clever and 100% original and will guess you throughout the movie. The one person I was most impressed with was Hilary Duff. It's simple and easy to see that she took a step beyond faith, beyond the 'chick-flick' genre she was accustomed to. Her accent is excellent and her performance was surprisingly sharp and well performed. This is the best thing I've ever seen from Hilary, and I've seen most of her movies. Her character, Yonica Babyyeah, is described as 'The Britney Spears of Eastern Europe' and it is seen in some of her ways and the song, "I want to blow you ... ... ...". You also feel sorry for her, since her performance really understands you, Yonica is a very complex and confused character. Joan Cusack laughed me through the whole movie with her sometimes humor, but also her facial expressions and so on. John Cusack's humorous dialogue will probably make your joists. I highly recommend this movie.
