The film is based on Kipling's heroic lines that inspire Hollywood's largest film in 1939. From the threshold rhythms of Kipling's best-known 85 lines, a picture that will be known as the one big film of the year rises. Great on counting his armies in battle, his war elephants, his bandit hordes, his fright temples Thugs and mystical mountains of India. The picture is bigger than its size and whip, excitement and action, but biggest of all in life is breathtaking by three (Gary Grant, Victor McLagen and Douglas Fairbanks Jr.) roaring, reckless, gossiping boys of thundering gunfighters men who pushing his mighty scenes into the flesh and blood of high adventure, it's an honest movie of all that makes Gunga Din a new entertainment experience. Joan Fontaine founded her against the brave Sergeant three. The romance between Fontaine and Fairbanks Jr denies by dangerous days and nights of terror in a country where anything can happen. The movie has a thrill for a thousand movies being plundered for one mighty performance. It is a fantastic, furious and advanced adventure with the red-blooded and herbaceous creatures emerging from the exalted mystery of India and the screen with the lusty, robust life sphere of men fighting for their love and love for their pleasure. The pictures are interpreted for the brave and roggy Gary Grant who rounded out hundreds of villains Thugs and the average Guru (Eduardo Ciannelli), Grant shouts: You were arrested. Except the heroic waterman, Sam Jaffe, whose regiment colonel (Montagu Love) says of him: You are a better man than I, Gunga Din!
