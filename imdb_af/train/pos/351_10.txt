It's a colorful slasher movie. It's about it. <br /> <br /> It has the puzzle element that SCREAM made so popular in slasher movies, but I never care for such things. To find out who the bad man is is not that interesting, as the clues are in any case misleading. <br /> <br /> The screenshots were resourceful and greedy, bringing back memories of 80's horror movies, such as Friday the 13th. <br /> <br /> Another nice thing about this movie is that it's hard to determine the surviving girl, unlike SCREAM and IKWYDLS where it was clear. <br /> <br /> People who don't like bad movies don't like this movie. As simple as that. I really enjoyed it and I plan to watch it again while waiting for more of the same. <br /> <br /> - MB
