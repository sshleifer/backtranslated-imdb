The bill was essentially a cultural fountain, from which emerged a beautiful rainbow of socio-introspection, which inspired such famous derivatives as Cop Land, The Departed, The Godfather 3 and most recently The Wire. <br /> <br /> With multicolored characters and story lines described as '4-dimensional Shakespeare', the bill gripped you by the collars of episode 1 and didn't just let you go. <br /> <br /> The show covered, expected, and even occasionally caused all the major global events between 1984 and 2010. The best-known former moment is episode 19 of Series 5 that was broadcast on the eve of the second Gulf War . Detective Jim Carver's deceived - and ultimately career ending - drug attack on Craig 'Fun Boy' Richardson's Jasmine Allen Estate apartment early in 2003, was widely regarded as a predictive allegory for the coalition's failure to find weapons of mass destruction after the invasion of Iraq a few months later. <br /> <br /> However, this was the work the bill did to alleviate some of the lesser-known problems experienced by police officers, which won the most praise. It was sympathetic drama about such sensitive areas as helmet phobia, subuniform cross-bandage, in-homosexuality, lost truncheons, accidental drunken bestiality, siren aversion syndrome (SAS), suspects caused by suspects while carrying excessive striped uniform and many, much more problems that still experience, disturb, haunt and excite officials. <br /> <br /> The last word should go to one of the bill's best-known supporters, Nelson Mandela: "It is not exaggerated to say that I would not have made it through the dark rage of loneliness, what my last years of seizure on Robben Island if it was not for heart warming, the accidental buffoon of Reg Hollis.
