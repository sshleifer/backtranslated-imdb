Clara Lago is wonderful as the title character of the film, essentially a film about a Spanish / American girl traveling to Spain with her mother after the Spanish Civil War. It seems the mother goes home to die, and she's gone with her grandfather. She also makes many friends and experiences a lot in a short time. Tomiche (Juan Jose Ballestra) is initially a nuisance to her, then they get close. The film is beautifully shot, mostly bathed in soft colors. Carol longs for her father, who is a pilot in the war, and you can feel love for him. While the war itself is similar to a rear seat in this movie, it encloses the character's life. I think you will like it. See it especially for Clara Lago, who does a good job as Carol. She is definitely one to watch.
