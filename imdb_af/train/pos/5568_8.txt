A typical skirt by Cheech and Chong's reality, which includes drugs, singing, more drugs, cars and driving, even more drugs, Pee Wee, aliens, petrol, laundry, comedy, surprisingly more drugs and SPACE COKE !!. It's not as coherent or acceptable as Up in Smoke, but it's still incredibly funny, without being as strange as Nice Dreams. There are some classic scenes, which include the opening scene where they get gas for their car and the drive to work. Also funny is Cheech's song (Mexican Americans) and Chong's sequel. Another notable scene is the welfare office with Jones (human sound machine), the Police Academy series and the old laugh. All in all, this is a good follow-up of Up in Smoke and is fairly noticeable when sober or not. <br /> <br /> -Celluloid Rehab
