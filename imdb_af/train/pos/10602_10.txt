I must say I really love the movie. It had funny moments, some heartwarming parts, just fine. Personally, I loved the movie very much because it is something I can eventually handle with my childhood. This film, in my opinion, is more focused on the young gay population. It shows how a young gay boy will be treated while growing up. All the tough, name calling, and not knowing, is something I will always remember, like most other young female boys, and finally a movie that illustrates how difficult it is to become gay. So, I would definitely recommend watching this movie. It probably shouldn't really look until a person is old and mature to understand it
