'Moonstruck' is a love story. There is not one romance, there are at least three, but they all do with the same family. Loretta's family. Loretta (Cher) marries Johnny Cammareri (Danny Aiello). She doesn't love him, but he is sweet and good man. When he leaves his dying mother in Italy, Loretta meets Johnny's brother Ronny (Nicolas Cage). He and Johnny didn't talk to each other in five years and Loretta wanted to invite him to the wedding. Of course, they immediately fall apart. <br /> <br /> How this story and love stories of Loretta's parents and uncle and aunt develops is something you just have to see for yourself. Every sight is a pleasure to watch, with Cher as the bright star in the middle of everything. She won the Oscar that year and really earned it. The cage is pretty good, and cute, and Olympia Dukakis as Loretta's mother and Vincent Gardenia as her dad are great. This movie is funny, charming and therefore very enjoyable.
