<br /> <br /> The first thing I have to say is that I own Jake Speed. I saw it at least 10 times. This movie is one of the nicest movies ever made. The movie starts with Margaret (Karen Kopins) to find her sister. Her sister was abducted in Paris and the family didn't hear anything. Along Jake Speed ​​(Wayne Crawford) she knows exactly where her sister is and makes an offer to find her. Jake Speed ​​is a hero. He doesn't work for money because he just wants to help and have a good adventure. His partner (Dennis Christopher) follows him and writes their adventures in novels. This movie is a great adventure. It's hilarious, it's action packs, it's just fantastic. I think it's a cult movie with a very small cult that follows. Crawford is perfect as Jake Speed ​​and throws out some one-liners you'll never forget. Kopins and Christopher are also good as the girl and the sidekick, respectively. John Hurt, the man whose stomach was blown up in Alien, plays the devilish, twisted villain who just adds to the fun. In many ways, this movie is similar to Indiana Jones, in some ways similar to James Bond movies. Maybe it should be called Indiana Bond, but whatever it is is a very enjoyable movie.
