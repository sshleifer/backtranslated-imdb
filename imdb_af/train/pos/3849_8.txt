This last Dutch movie from Verhooven made me laugh well. If a movie buff searches for all the small details and cross-references etc. in any movie I can assure everyone is interested in filming that this piece entertaines all the senses. I didn't read the book by Gerard Reves on which the film is based, but I still believe we get a real picture of a somewhat confident poet / writer she (in a way - no spoil here) gets. An anti-hero surrounded by characters who have their ambiguous intentions, as he did. All this in a wonderfully packaged film art, Paul Verhopven succeeds in turning the otherwise pretty cute "sociable (?)" Dutch places into an exciting movie-noir setting, impressive work!
