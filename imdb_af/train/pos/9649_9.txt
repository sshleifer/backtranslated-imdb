Screened at the San Francisco International Film Festival entitled 'Come Undone', 25, 26, 27, 2001. The filmmaker uses techniques that add storytelling. Even with the autumn / winter backgrounds for the 'present' and spring summer for the flashbacks, there may be some difficulty in following the continuity. <br /> <br /> Whether lead is gay, the actors portray the emerging relationship well. in real life; of physical violence towards one another after their passionate love ability. The story slows you down a bit in the beginning of the characters. But as the end approaches, you really care where these guys will be next summer! You will also want to find a successor.
