Many of these other viewers complain that the storyline has already been attempted. It may be so, but the narrator and dr. Sweet as landscape makes this show a must see. With adult statues throughout the series and a bit of childhood through the set, the show is both reminiscent and refreshing. The investigative part of the show is not what the viewers are attracting. The twisted plot and lines of love spreading through this apparent paradise is what loyal viewers return for more. It's a success that ABC should never let go of. Bravo ABC. Lost was old, way to revive for the first time. 9 episodes before the authors strike left audiences want more.
