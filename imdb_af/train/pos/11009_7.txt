There was an attractive approach to this film by director Vincenzo Natali with interesting camera angles and effective close-ups. It was also refreshing to see Jeremy Northam and Lucy Liu starring and expanding their range as artists. This film also features one of the most imaginative "escape" scenes over the past few years. The efforts of the director and the actors combined into an effective thriller. <br /> <br /> Though the movie's plot was over, the story progressed very clearly, as the low corporate greed and skullery was revealed. <Br /> <br /> In 1949, George Orwell proposed in his famous novel "1984" that the future be controlled by the totalitarian state, which will control thoughts and reduce human freedom. Interestingly, it was not in this intriguing futuristic film, but rather the corporate world that controls and degrades the human worker.
