My comments for VIVAH: - It's a beautiful, idealistic love story with Shahid Kapoor and Amrita Rao. The film takes us back to small pleasures like the bride and groom's families sleeping on the floor, chatting, their friendly banter and mutual respect. Vivah is about the sanctity of marriage and the importance of engagement between two individuals. Yes, the central romance is naively visualized. But the intricate romantic moments between the married couple and their stubborn resistance to modern courtship play the idealism. The film ends predictably with the wedding and the groom, on the wedding day, tells his new bride who suffers from burn injuries: "Let me put on your garment" <br /> <br /> VIVAH - show great things. - beauty of regular marriage, beauty of Indian culture, beauty of the Indian woman, last but not least, a beautiful IDEALISM of the over-to-be-couple waiting to marry .... playing according to the rules! Simple but Beautiful; Such a simple story .... no plot ... no villain - as with most Sooraj Barjatya movies. Sooraj sir is back to what he does best. He made the film with FULL CONVENTION. It's a very nice movie - teaching the current generation a lot of good stuff in the regular marriage and the union of 2 families. I think AMRITA RAO looks very good and she did very well. She has most of the good screens - although I thought the half-hour was completely up to Shahid Kapur - which gives a very limited performance for a change. I also liked the acting of all other people. the Choti, namely Amrita Prakash, Alok Nath, Anupam Kher, Shahid's brother and sis-in-law. It almost looks as right and recognizable as it can. Sooraj has another nice family movie after his credit after Maine Pyar Kiya, HAHK & Hum Saath Saath Hain. The chemistry between Shahid & Amrita is AWESOME. <br /> <br /> Piece like Holiness in Marriage / Relationship, Avoid Courtesy, Mutual Respect, Care and Space, Wait for Married "Official", Pray / Sacrficing for Ur Beloved - All these and more are displayed in Vivah . There is still a good audience going to enjoy the movie. Some of the people / audiences are already excited after seeing them think of Reel Marriage :) It's Success if you ask me. AMRITA RAO - our actress-of-Vivah (Good Performance Score) seems to have donated the prestigious DADSAHEB PHALKE 2006 award! Hats off to her for this performance Chalo, although Vivah, Shahid or Amrita did not receive any of the film and other awards; @ least it's news about CHEER over !! Congratulations to AMRITA RAO - for us to be a visual image of the Indian bride in the purest form and of course for Sooraj Barjatya to portray her the best way. Don't forget Shahid Kapur and all the others that make VIVAH so enjoyable and legendary as it is today !! Imagine sharing the same pedestal as the legendary Dilip Kumar .......... It's not an average feat !! Congratulations to Amrita Rao - to take her career to another level with this award .... I personally feel - she just has to go with Shahid Kapur! They make a cute couple and their on-screen chemistry reminds me of {SRK-kajol} or {Aamir Khan & Juhi Chawla} ................. <br /> < Some points I observed, few of the elements: - # 1 If you pay close attention, Amrita Rao looks so good because she always wears traditional dresses. She gives every bit of Indian Woman Essence - in this movie !! Perfect Fit # 2 Shahid Kapur is like most of us - not exactly ready for marriage or early marriage .... but PREM listens to the step-by-step conversation given by its DAD - with full faith in Anupam Kher. Ultimately, "Honesty" and "Confidence" are the key words he reflected in his first talk with Amrita. Most people think such a first encounter with a total stranger plus for a limited time is never enough to judge anyone. But according to what I saw in this movie, I have a feeling - that two people made for each other can join in a 1st meeting, it's possible !!! # 3 In the whole movie - there are basically 4 or 5 series where Shahid & Amrita are together - or shown together. It's different from most other romantic / wedding-based movies where Hero & Heroine is always singing / dancing or these days - doing cheap things. But the beauty of each of these 5 series: - Characterized by restraint, innocence and respect for the other! # 4 I really saw the relationship between Chacha ALOK NATH & Amrita Rao. These kind of movies should highlight the indifference of girls / girl children in some parts of India. # 5 Romantic scenes between main pairs are shot very nicely - no cheap scenes, songs are beautifully depicted !! Words such as "Jal", "praarhana" e.t.c. will be buzzwords for all girls who like this movie :) Personally, I love many dialogues in this movie. # 6 Last but not least - The whole hospital scene where Shahid hears about Amrita as she struggles for life is great. The dialogues between the couple are so touching and you feel the LOVE / I-cant-do-without-U; This is a Hats Off feeling !!! <br /> <br /> *** In many ways, VIVAH reminded me of Maine Pyar Kiya, DDLJ, Qayamat's Qayamat Tak, Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam - for the LEAD pair freshness / screen chemistry:) :) *** IF YOU PLEASE: - Along with movies like Rang De Basanti, Low Raho Munnabhai, DOR, CORPORATE and Kabul Express, VIVAH is one of the best films made in 2006. In fact, I think Vivah deserves better. viewing / business like Dhoom2 or Fanaa or Golmaal or all that time / fuzzy / style / crap movies !!
