It has some excellent spots, but the length of the film cannot sustain the wafer thin plot. This is another sailor on leave film, zippier than Astaire's 'Follow the Fleet', but not as good as 'On The Town'. <br /> <br /> Kathryn Grayson is sparse, but Kelly and Sinatra work well together. Their "If You Won Susie" number is hilarious if they make the song while singing it. "I thanked her" is also nice with Sinatra who shows how competent he was on the need. Sinatra's solo songs are boring and apparently inserted to show his song rather than as part of the story. Fortunately, there are sustained supporting actors such as Grady Sutton, Rags Ragland, Carlos Ramirez and Pamela Britton and an unlikely but impertubable Jose Iturbi like himself, to watch one. <br /> <br /> Kelly is the star of the movie, although third billed and it is interesting to see him communicate with kids, which Astaire never did. Dean Stockwell plays a child who wants to be in the navy and goes on the Kelly character. He also visits a school that gives the children a fictional story of his life in the Pomeranian (!) Marine leading to his wonderful dance with an animated Jerry Mouse. In another scene, he is dancing a charming Mexican hat with a sublime tomb, girl, Sharon McManus, who is so enthusiastic and sweet. <br /> <br /> Very pleasant then a little too long. A taster of better musical to come.
