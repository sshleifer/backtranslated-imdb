This movie is great. <br /> <br /> Now, I tend to like my movies heavily on the story and dialogue, but now and then something like Moonwalker comes along, and it's awake, despite numerous mistakes. /> <br /> This movie is no more than a highly entertaining Michael Jackson ad. Start with a sickly video on 'Man in the Mirror', a montage calling his achievements, pieces and bobs from his career, go through all the heights of his life and then fall into a really entertaining segment that is like a funny music video for 'Bad' and 'Speed ​​Demon', following the adventures of MJ, as he runs manic stop-motion fans, and finally dance to a rabbit costume. The stop motion is not that bad, because some will believe you. This is acceptable. <br /> <br /> Then we see the big video for 'Leave me alone', and straight into the main function. <br /> <br /> Yes, the plot is stackable. Lots of laughs. We see Michael running out of a building and then being shot by thousands of troops. Then we hit back, with MJ and three children bumping on an underground lower. 'Mr Big' (Joe Pesci) is the deadly villain who has a plan to get every child in the world 'drugs' at an early age. MJ and the little girl he is being caught, then chased ... yada yada yada. The plot is not really the important part. We get two very cool rows where MJ becomes a car, then a robot spaceship, and of course the amazing Smooth Criminal sequence. <br /> <br /> It's a so-so movie, but it's great for everyone who loves MJ. It has most of its biggest hits, and a few fine pieces, and some very good special effects (the Robot / Space drive sequence in particular). It's worth it, especially if you can pick it up on ebay forever. This will keep the children quiet for a few hours, as well as most of the 20 somethings that were children when it was first released.
