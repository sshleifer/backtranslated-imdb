A lovely soft comic coal, up to the last five minutes, which broke through in the runner of the British TV farce mill. For the last five minutes, it has cost 2 points in my rating. Despite this great plot and style error, it is worth looking for the character display and the unique Cornwall setting. Very nice pieces to enjoy, like the tense eternity we are all going to wait for bank approval after the clerk scraped the credit card ... made more spicy if we were not - sure the card was not maxed.
