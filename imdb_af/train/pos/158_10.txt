I've seen this movie more than once, and there is always someone complaining about the "obvious construction" of the plot. But then it's part of Petzold's game: he plays with the rules of genre. <br /> <br /> It's very nice, how is the highly unlikely story of how the two girls (Timoteo / Hummer) meet each other reflected in another, even more unlikely story, that the girls play a decisive role play. This film is a journey between facts and fiction. It is more about potential, things that have happened in the past or maybe happening in the future, than about real costs. It's a reverie, kind - as good enough there are lots of motives, Freud might have been interesting for his dream analysis, like all the "doppelganger" constellations. <br /> <br /> Also, I think "Gespenster" may be interesting to watch compared to the current Asian theater of the incredible: Petzold's everyday urban architecture also feels unobtrusive, strange familiar way . This movie is not about the obvious. Describing this as the story of two girls who meet and eventually become friends and lovers, or as the story of an orphaned mother seeking Europe for her lost daughter, does not say much about the nature of "ghost" . .
