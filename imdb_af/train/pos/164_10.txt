Don't say I didn't warn you, but you'll laugh. Probably enough to hurt your stomach. Sure, it has a little bloodshed, even though it's been in good fun. So, it has no budget, which requires a budget when you get such a script. <br /> <br /> Take the time and look at it. Worth a two hour viewing If everyone can laugh as much as I did during this movie, the world would be a much happier place to live. <br /> <br />
