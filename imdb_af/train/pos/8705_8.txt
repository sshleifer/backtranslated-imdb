Despite the title, The Sword Bearer and the DVD cover (action / herioc of The Sword Bearer), it's not a superhero movie. <br /> <br /> (Minor Spoilers) This follows the story of Sasha, The Swaard Bearer, who was cursed with a retractable sword in his forearm. Cool you say, but no, it's real life. If you had this power as a child, you can control it when you say you are a crazy man or when your mother's boyfriend hits her. And if you don't control it, how about you being a two-time killer at age 12? <br /> <br /> This is essentially where Sasha is when we meet him. Killing aimlessly after another (much like A Bout de Souffle). He meets Katya, and the couple immediately fall in love, offering Sasha a real reason to live and try to change his ways. But his past is still chasing him in the form of two police officers. <br /> <br /> This is essentially the story, and there is virtually no action on the screen, though many are suggested. <br /> <br /> I really like this movie. Unlike many Hollywood superhero movies, we get very little storytelling, there is no bad guy (unless you count the swordman himself) there is a lot of heart and good character development. <br /> <br /> Finding out if you can find it.
