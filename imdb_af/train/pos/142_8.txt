Second part (actually episode 4-8) of the Danish TV series is slightly inferior to the first one, but also has a lot of laughter and fright. This time Udo Kier plays two parts, such as the monster baby and his devilish dad. Other outstanding parts this time are Dr. Krogshoj, Søren Pilmark, who revenge the heroes of dr. Helmer must face, and again try patiently. Drusse the mystery, Mrs. Marple style, solve. Ending on a stone hanger and following the deaths of starring Ernst Hugo Järegård (Dr Helmer) and Kirsten Rolffes (Mrs. Drusse), you wonder how they can ever make Part III, but I hope Von Trier will give it a shot . Unfortunately, Morten Rotne Leffers, the Downs Syndrome Dishwasher # 2, died shortly afterwards. Search for Stellan Skarsgård in a cameo. ***
