It's a difficult thing to play a queen. On the one hand, the actress must be majestic and imposing, and on the other hand, she must show vulnerability in a difficult situation, as well as the collection of courage and resolution to overcome the odds, as almost all films about queens are that basic plot . <br /> <br /> Emily Blunt is pretty radiant like Victoria, but it's not as full a show as I want, no blame for her. I can't help but feel like this is a Mills & Boon novel adaptation compared to a darker, more dramatic movie about another young queen, Elizabeth. Hence, Blunt does not get the size of Queen's emotions, at least not to the fullest, as she is the Victoria. To see the old Victoria, see Mrs Brown. <br /> <br /> Jean-Marc Vallee is an interesting choice for the director for the movie. He last made C.R.A.Z.Y., which was excellent and announced him. It was quite a different movie, but I remember it was nice and probably the most important match between the two movies. But while Vallee C.R.A.Z.Y. wrote this one by Julian Fellowes, and although I really enjoyed his Gosford Park, the story for this movie was much less interesting. I soon lost all government politics. Perhaps it was less encouraging because there was no possible removal of the monarchy. I'm not saying either.
