Neil Simon had a talent for dialogue and nowhere is it clearer than the lines he gives WALTER MATTHAU and JACK LEMON as opposite types in THE ODD COUPLE - a mix of comedy and sadness that is totally dependent on the credibility of two such mismatched friends sharing a flat. <br /> <br /> Lemmon is neatnik Felix Ungar. He sued suicide after his wife's divorce and agreed unwillingly to share an apartment with Oscar Madison (Matthau) with somewhat disastrous results. Looks like everything Felix says and Oscar drives on the wall, and no one can stand the other's ways. Oscar is the best male imaginable and Felix the opposite. <br /> <br /> The finest scene for me was when the giggle Dove sisters in the apartment above visited them on a dinner date. The valuable interaction between Lemmon, Matthau and Carole Shelley and Monica Evans is enough to put you down. The talented pigeon sisters are the gals who did the voices for the Gabble sisters (a few geese) in Disney's THE ARISTOCATS, and here is their comic timing over Lemmon's sad story of despair enough to film the movie. where it stays most of the time. <br /> <br /> If you're a Neil Simon fan and have enjoyed other screen treatments of his work, don't miss it. Matthau and Lemmon were thrown perfectly (although they were considering changing roles before filming began) and of course it's easy to see why it became a top-rated TV show later. <br /> <br /> Summary: Don't miss out on top Simon comedy.
