This is a great American martial art film. The fighter screens were pretty impressive for American movies made in the 90's. Of course, the scenes aren't as good as in Honk Kong movies, actually there are just a few American movies that combat screens that are as good as in Honk Kong movies, even nowadays. Looking at the American martial arts movie, you expect less impressive battles, but still good movements, which can sometimes be surprisingly good, or at least, that's what I expect from these movies. I was impressed with this movie. Some fighting scenes were really impressive, the acting, the direction and the plot was good enough, so it's a worth watching movie if you like American martial arts movies of the 90s.
