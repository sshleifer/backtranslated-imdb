This is one of those creepiest, scariest and most heartbreaking horror movies ever! <br /> <br /> Dr Creed (Louise) and his family move to a new home with his wife (Rachel), daughter (Ellie) and little boy (Gage). Everything seems normal until Dr Creed loses his patient who had a terrible head injury. Then he is followed by the ghost, because Victor takes him to the Pet Sematarty and shows him where the dead come to life. <br /> <br /> Louis doesn't know if it's all about dreaming. talks to Ellie who is worried about her cat being murdered by the truck and then later Rachel tells Louis that it is really difficult to talk about death because of her sister, Zelda, who was really sick (Like us in a look back, how sick her sister really was and this is one of the most creepiest scenes ever!) <br /> <br /> The next day Louis gets a call from Jed and says there is a cat by the truck was killed and Jed took him to the place where Victor told the Spirit. He shouldn't go! And burying the cat, his wife and children going to see their grandparents and Louise is alone at home, shocked to see the cat is back and now it is so angry in his eyes that he will see Jed, then Jed says to him that he also buried his grave Dog there too (As we saw other flashbacks). <br /> <br /> Later in the movie The Family has picnic, Gage plays with kite and Gage says, I drop it. "The wind blows the rod near the road where a truck comes fast, Gage is closer to the road, Louis hurries to get him. Most HARTBREAKING scene in any horror movie will leave your jaw on the floor or Shivers will go behind your back if you hear Louis shouting. Soon he will miss him so much Louis buried Gage in the same place where the Cat is buried. <br /> <br /> The frightening thing about this movie is that some scenes in this movie not too far from real life. <br /> <br /> This movie is just amazing and the acting of all was great! 10 out of 10
