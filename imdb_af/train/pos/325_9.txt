This is a good movie - especially when compared to the sometimes difficult seriousness of today's politically sensible filmmakers. A movie that can easily combine sex, gender relations, politics and art is a rarity nowadays. While the builder's optimism cannot be recovered from the 1960s, I think we can at least learn a lesson from the faint energy and charm of the movie. I don't know what those who call the movie "watch" look - there's so much packing that it never remains the same movie as 15 minutes at a time.
