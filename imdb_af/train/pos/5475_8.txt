Lastly, the uncut version of "Baby Face" surfaces and which source? The Library of Congress. The restored four minutes, snippets here and there, make for a much better movie. We now know that Baby Face was pumped by her old man from the time she was at least fourteen years old. Another reason for her behavior and cold, calculating outside. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwyck is indeed wonderful in the role of Lily Powers (note the moniker), a part mentioned for just the right amount of sexuality covered with power, crap and revenge, yet with virginity pretenses testify when called, a very difficult portrayal to make convincing. Barbara Stanwyck provided the necessary nuances to show that she was still sleeping at the top (literally), she was still good at her heart - note how she treated the few who were good to her like Chico (the wonderful actress Theresa Harris) and the old philosopher. And although she exploits her sexuality to make wealth and wealth of men, they try the same men for their carnal desires, without the intention of permanent bonds until they fall in love with her. <br /> <br /> Lily powers don't even understand that emotions are hard to drive, it's easy to lose control. One possible consequence is death. Of course, hitting a car to a star can take the one to a destination where nothing else exists, but the ephemeral, and it's a cold lonely place. <br /> <br /> A word has to be said about Friedrich Nietzsche's philosophy whose In the "Baby Face" of the elderly philosopher, talked to Lilly, his power is triggered when she is still tricks make her old man. "Baby Face" was released the same year. Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany. Although it is highly unlikely that semi-literate Hitler understood much about Nietzsche, he regarded himself as a Nietzschean to the ninth grade and put it next to his other rantings. "Baby Face" serves as a charge of the popular interpretation of Nietzsche's will to power concept, especially in the final scene. <br /> <br /> Although "You have the best little baby face." is a theme for 'Baby Face', an even more well-known and appropriate melody is WC Handy's "St. Louis Blues" played by the movie, especially at times when the camera drifts away from what would otherwise be sexually explicit scenes . "St. Louis Blues" is also used wisely at the end, as Lily looks beyond materialism to eternal values. Chico sings a raw, fresh version of "St Louis Blues" when Lily, who doesn't agree with the lyrics, recommends her stop. <br /> <br /> The restored version of "Baby Face" makes the movie more modern in its approach and attitude towards sex than power as a very new Hollywood release. Anyway, look at the gem of the distant past and enjoy it.
