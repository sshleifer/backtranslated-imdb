Some of the recognized Altman masterpieces now seem sadder to me. Maybe it's me. Like the last reviewer, I even like this "lesser" Altman (recently shown to FMC), although I don't think he looked at a wide audience. Organization politics as a "microcosm" for public campaigns. Some of these satirical "docudrama" are now dated, as Dick Cavett looks at the Tonight Show, but I found a lot of the dialogue funny and informative (eg, "You're really. This means you're not threatening anyone"). The story is not "deep" but I liked it. And the performances are funny, especially Cavett (as "himself"), Lauren Bacall as an obsolete conservative figurehead, Glenda Jackson (who has actually become a member of Parliament) as a leftist ideologue (in the opening scene that someone like dressed a carrot) on the holiness of politics), and Carol Burnett as a basket case. Already in the inimitable Altman style, though not quite as inevitable as usual. But pretty incomprehensible.
