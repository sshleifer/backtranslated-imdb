For Urban Cowboy, John Travolta plays one of the stronger alpha men ever portrayed on the big screen. He is a decent enough young child who leaves his parent's home and leaves the Dallas city where his uncle Barry Corbin has promised to find himself in the petrochemical industry. In 1980, it began to increase and Texas was definitely a growing place in the US. <br /> <br /> Travolta does a good job of caring for his character who, if you are straight, is a sexist pig. He meets and marries Debra Winger who is of the same background, but she has some ideas that women should not be shadows of their husbands. And if she hits him at Gilley's mechanical bull, it's a man's game, it's for him. <br /> <br /> Scott Glenn, a former culprit, works at Gilley's and this film was his outbreak role. He is a real snake in Urban Cowboy, he gets Travolta's goat with a bare look and he moves on Winger. Travolta resumes with a rich girl, Madolyn Smith Osborne, slumbering at Gilley's. <br /> <br /> Despite the characters, Urban Cowboy was really a giant commercial for the self-employed greatest base tonk in the world. Gilley's is no longer there in the Texas community of Pasadena, but the memories continue. And the best thing about Urban Cowboy is the wonderful score of the country / western songs that appeared in the movie. I'm not sure if some of the songs aren't specifically written for Urban Cowboy, but that's the only reason I can think of why the Motion Picture Academy ignored the musical aspects of this movie. I especially love Johnny Lee's quest for love, if specifically written for this movie, it is a shame that it was not nominated for Best Song. <br /> <br /> I liked Debra Winger's character best in this movie. She does not lose a trace of femininity, but she stands up for Travolta and does so in style. And this review is dedicated to an unknown woman who will one day be the first women's builder in the Professional Bull Riders.
