In the war, Inc., we find the logical expansion of the current outsourcing of all the war-related activities we are currently doing in Afghanistan and Iraq. If you're familiar with the devastation of Halliburton, Kellogg, Brown & Root and Blackwater overseas, you're already halfway home to appreciate the satire of Cusack's latest piece. Cusack is playing a corporate hit, named Brand Hauser, who finds himself in Turiquistan, who organizes a bursary in the newly populated country as his cover while waiting to gain access to his latest target. While standing, he was played by the anti-government reporter, Marisa Tomei, and followed by the over-sexual pop star played by Hilary Duff. We are introduced to Hauser's past, which includes a tragedy that has been pursuing since then, and the corporate assistant named Marsha Dillon, who actually performs the entire operation (and hilariously played by Joan Cusack). While some moments are played appropriately over the top, it is not always the moments you expect and the small touch often surprises you. All the principals turn into solid achievements. Duff's accent comes and goes but otherwise she does a very good job and goes a long way to obscure her Disney image. Tomei is funny but underestimated while Cusack's own almost every scene they are in. To be fair, they are given good material. The authors make a good script with enough twists and turns and visual gags to make you giggle all the way to the predictable conclusion. In fact, the predictability of the end is the only thing I like to rate it higher, as the story turns and it turns into the expected conclusion. <br /> <br /> If you like your comedy widely and physically, there is probably not enough here to get you interested in the whole movie. On the other hand, if you want dear comedy and broad satire, this is for you.
