When I was very young at a local TV station, they showed kung fu movies of all kinds on Saturdays. I saw many Kung Fu movies over weekends. I remember a lot of them. I saw big flashes like Crippled Masters, Bruce Blind Fist, Kung Fu Zombie, Shaolin Drunk Monk, Master Craze, Tattoo Dragon, and ... Five Deadly Venoms. I remember the day clearly. Me and my dad just got lunch at Burger King. We were home to see what movie this Saturday would be. We ran into the house and jumped on the couch, turned on the device and looked at 56. The usual intro of many kung fu movies in the background with the words Kung Fu Saturday about it. Then under it was the title of the movie. It said five deadly venoms. Then the movie started. I am a bit amused in my citizen with the pre-credit order. I loved this movie. The moment has come. My favorite character was the Toad Venom. The plot was hard to follow at that age, but it wasn't what attracted me ... it was the battle. The battles were so ... amazin G. I was confronted every time a commercial came and soon the 2 hours of the best movie I ever saw ended.
