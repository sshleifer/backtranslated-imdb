When I started watching the show, I said, "Oh no! It's just as eleven as Elfen Song and not even so bloody!". And indeed, the setup is almost identical, with the single young boy living alone in a big house and then suddenly engaging in a fantastic adventure while sexy young girls come to him. <br /> <br /> But this is where the similarity stops. The love story is almost as subtle and intense as the one in Inuiyasha, while childish remarks and behaviors are very few. The magical set-up is a little stick, because it is about seven people, with seven servants fighting for the Holy Grail, all servants are famous, half of all masters are of the same school, rules of engagement, etc. descends and disappears from the beauty of the drawing and the writing. <br /> <br /> One day I watched 24 episodes and without comparing them to animes I liked more, but of other genres, I must say I was very happy.
