I must admit that I didn't expect anything at first. I just expected a cheesy movie to promote Gackt and Hyde's image, but I'm happy to say it has a lot more to offer. <br /> <br /> Yes, the play is not that good, but it doesn't suck either, all the role players are well-disciplined and they give enough power to their characters. Effects don't have consistency, but action scenes are enough satisfactory. <br /> <br /> What really chopped me off was the core of the storyline, though it blends fantastic elements, it's also a rough reality. The development of the characters, their doubts and their feelings really touched me and I think this is the key to this movie. It sets you up to think and it is good to convey all the anxiety. <br /> <br /> It meets any expectations for a good drama. I would definitely recommend it to everyone.
