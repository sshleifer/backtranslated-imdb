Well, let me just say something about these actors, they were really a good decision, and from experience, actress has really brought the dialogue to life. If you let go in this even fifteen minutes, you'll be in shock, the movie will already have started. You don't want to miss the first few jokes, as if you came to miss any jokes. <br /> <br /> Wow! I have never seen a movie that ended with such a final end. Not too hard, I mean, I loved it, but it just surprised me that it really stayed until it stopped! But I come before myself, starting with the beginning, when it started. The plot outline is as follows, there is this man, not a spoil, (* Spoiler Alert !! *) (he has never had sex!) They use this plot device to move the story, and there is (deliberately or not, it can go either). Some funny situations have the main characters, which contain irony and jokes and awkward situations, of which you know. <br /> <br /> The director uses the technological advancement by combining the film shot on the set and written dialogue, music and jokes to make a funny movie designed as a comedy where he travels us on the opening credits to the end with a completely full movie in between. I went into this movie to see a funny comedy because of what I already knew about it and felt like I just left a theater that just played a funny comedy.
