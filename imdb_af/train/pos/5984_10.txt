It's a big movie if it's seen in the right context. It was meant to be a parody of teenage horror devil worship movies (and the 80's saw many of them)! I saw this movie when it first came out and kept it right away. To be a big fan of KISS, it was great to see Gene in the movie. And anything with OZZY as a metal-hate preacher can't be bad! Also, Fastway was already a favorite of mine, so it was great to hear it on the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> The original VHS (it was pre-DVD) cover for Trick or Treat has an illustration of Sammi kneeling, playing his guitar in a ring of fire with a "demon". It was a special order, and the price for the VHS copy at that time (about 1987) was $ 90! I really wanted the movie, but not at that ridiculous price. The 'OZZY-Gene' cover has just been created for the $ 5 release. The company that released it apparently knew Gene and OZZY were the only recognizable people in the movie, so they'd better put them on the cover! The same thing with the original "Small Shop of Horror" - Jack Nicholson had been there for five minutes, but now they were on the front as if he were the chief star. <br /> <br /> I have a "Trick or Treat" site, and it's amazing how many people believe Sammi Curr was a real person! Fastway helped make the myth worse by wearing their soundtrack album "Sammi Curr". <br /> <br /> All-in-all, it was just a good time, rock-n-roll movie. Definitely not taken too seriously, but just enjoy!
