1939 was universally accepted as the biggest year in Hollywood history, with more classic films released than in any other, and John Ford has three of the best, "Stagecoach", "Drums Along the Mohawk" and this beautiful tribute Border Days and a young backwoods lawyer who will eventually save the Union, "Young Mr. Lincoln". <br /> <br /> With the world plunged into war that America feared, but knew it would be revoked, Abraham Lincoln was much on people's minds, in 1939, as someone in his own life faced the same dilemma. On Broadway, Robert E. Sherwood's award-winning "Abe Lincoln in Illinois", featuring Raymond Massey's physical painted performance, played in packed homes (filmed in 1940). Carl Sandburg's continuation of his epic biography, "Abraham Lincoln: The War Years", was published, and quickly became a best seller. President Roosevelt regularly refers to Lincoln in speeches, and the Lincoln Memorial, in Washington, DC, has become the most popular landmark in town (a fact that Frank Capra made good use of "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"). /> All this was not lost to Darryl F. Zanuck, at 20th Century Fox; as soon as he read Lamar Trotti's performance of Lincoln's early days as a lawyer, he called it a prestigious production, and appointed John Ford to direct, and Henry Fonda, died. <br /> <br /> Fonda does NOT want to play Lincoln; He felt he could not do the Great Emancipator right and fear that a bad performance would damage his career. Even a filmed make-up test, in which he was amazed at how much he would look like Lincoln, would not change his mind. According to Fonda, John Ford, with whom he had never worked, pointed out at his first meeting royally and explained that he had not portrayed the Lincoln or Legend, but a young "jackanape" land lawyer facing his first murder trial. . . Humbled, Fonda played the role. (John Ford presented another scenario of the events, but the outcome was the same!) It was clear that they found a chemistry that worked, as almost all of their events would be classic. <br /> <br /> Unlike Ford's vision, the introverted, melancholy-ruling Lincoln of "Abe Lincoln in Illinois" was. It was a granted but lovely young lawyer, who made easy friends and lost the mother, too young (resulting in a bond with a pioneer mother who becomes an important part of the story). Iniquity shakes him, and he speaks 'common sense' to endure violence, interlaced with doses of humor. Both productions play at Lincoln's (undocumented) relationship with Ann Rutledge; In Ford's version, the couple are really in love, and connect them to each other. After her death Lincoln will regularly visit her grave to share his life with her "spirit" (a theme Ford would continue in "She has a Yellow Ribbon".) <br /> <br /> a Murder trial is the centerpiece of the film, showing the wonderful talents of the star and director. Fonda puts Lincoln's inexperienced image, yet a serious conviction in righteousness, and Ford emphasizes the gulf between the metropolitan intellectuals (represented by the pumping DA Donald Meek and his smooth "adviser", Stephen Douglas, has a young son played Milburn Stone, and Lincoln's informal, rule-bending land signal. With Ford's regular Ward Bond as a key witness, the trial is unconventional and sound. <br /> <br /> With the film stop as Lincoln progresses in the stormy distance and fate of the statue at the Lincoln Memorial, audiences can have comfort in the movie's message, if it goes well, it will eventually triumph. <br /> <br /> "Young Mr. Lincoln" is a remarkable movie, of a wonderful year!
