I loved this movie. Great storyline and actors and good movie sets. It has told the story in a way that I can easily understand and pay attention to without falling asleep. I'd like to know where I could find the soundtrack. I can't find it anywhere. Please email me if you know where to get the soundtrack. Unlike finding the soundtrack, I thought the movie was fascinating. Swayze did a good job. I think it's some of his best work. His past movies were OK, but this one really told a story for a change. It goes down in history as one of the best TV movies ever broadcast. Congratulations to the producers and writers of such a great piece of work.
