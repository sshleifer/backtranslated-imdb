My only little thing about the movie I was growing up was the fact that the amazing RAYMOND MASSEY was rejected in the trial for the last twenty minutes. And the trial itself, IMO, is the least interesting part of this fascinating fantasy. <br /> <br /> David NIVEN and KIM HUNTER are wonderfully cast as young lovers, but it is ROGER LIVESEY that gives the most vigorous and credible performance. . The French accent MARIUS GORING is a joy (he even gets a comment on Technicolor) as the heavenly messenger sent to get Niven back if his war war is unreported because of an overview. Goring has some of the wittiest lines and delivers it with yummy. <br /> <br /> See it tonight on TCM for the first time in twenty years, I think it's a great example of what a wonderful year 1946 was for movies. The Technicolor photography, slightly muted and not crazy, is excellent and the way it moves to B&W for the heavenly rows is done with great imagination and effectiveness. <br /> <br /> The opening scene is the kind that really draws a glimpse of the fantasy aspects of the story - and Niven's tense conversation with the radio operator Hunter as his plane crashed into the ground unexpectedly leads to " an unforgettable romantic encounter. Actually a great movie from start to finish, another win for Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger.
