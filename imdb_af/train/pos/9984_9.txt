I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this most thought-out drama, which I almost missed because of its rather unbelievable 6.6 rating; as I rarely give the time of day to any movie classified under 7/10. Having said this, I'm so glad I gave Stone Angel the viewing it deserved. And so if you are one of the scarcely sensitive, soulful and thoughtful types of person on this earth, you should be in living form. <br /> <br /> I have to say this in many ways (though not all), viz. his themes, performance, style, production etc, Stone Angel reminded me of the promised "The Notebook". I am so surprised that other commentators have not picked up on the many similarities that have struck me throughout this movie, so I can only assume that those who commented have not seen the notebook yet. They may not share an Alzheimer's theme, but I can confidently say that if you really enjoy the notebook, you will certainly find plenty of time to engage with the Stone Angel. But even if you haven't seen the Notebook, don't even read the book on which this move is based, and you definitely need a lot to keep your attention firm - as long as your favorite genres don't include quick action thrillers. It's a movie for thinkers and those who like to remind you of the passage of time, how life changes as the years go by, and what happened in your life, as one looks over the years. <br /> <br /> This bizarre underrated big movie really earns a score of about 8/10. I can only blame his current low rating of 6.6 / 10 on the 11% of idiots giving it 1/10. After all, this recorded less than 300 votes when I wrote this comment. Nevertheless, if the 11% who gave it the lowest possible position, did the car hunt and explosions really expect why they didn't look ... Even a few seconds in the front and front lines of the movie? Oh, dear ... Whatever the world does, don't miss this most underrated jewel of a movie - just * if * you have a brain (ie your top ten doesn't include Transformers, Fight Club or The Terminator not).
