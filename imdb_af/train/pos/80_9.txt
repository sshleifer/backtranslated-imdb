I really enjoyed the reunion! I would have classified it a 10 if they had "Hassie" and "Little Luke". There was not even an indication of where they are today or why they did not participate in the reunion. They were very popular characters and I think it was a mistake not to give an explanation of their lack of appearance. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I was glad TNN ran the series again! For years, I was looking for episodes and a joy to paste the whole series (I may have missed a few episodes). Jenny Hanahan
