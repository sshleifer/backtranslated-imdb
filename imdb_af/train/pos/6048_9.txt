What a class of British movie! It's about time. And a side-jump comedy to get started! <br /> <br /> Anyone looking for some freedom from their failing youth will prove this road movie the ticket. <br /> <br /> It's a mix between "Withnail and I" and "Easy Rider". The movie runs at a steady pace and doesn't let you drift for too long. Sometimes there are reflective moments, but I think they are well justified and add to the characters that the actors portray. I was initially a little concerned about the character of Phil Daniels, but luckily I won more than half in what was one of the funniest scenes of the whole movie! In general, I found myself laughing at the stomach, which may be irritating to some people around me. Oh good. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it. It will be a cult British comedy. Worth visiting.
