Without a doubt, Private Lessons II is the biggest movie I've ever seen. A Japanese import (poor) translates into English, it's a joy to watch. Not much makes sense, but it doesn't matter. It's the greatest comedy without ever being intentionally funny. <br /> <br /> The movie is scarce and not available on video, but I caught it a few times late at night on payroll. My sound copy has been watched dozens and dozens of times as I slowly, personally for person, introduce this movie storm to the world. <br /> <br /> Joanna Pacula plays the tutor / lover to Ken, our hero. (She apparently only worked for her check.) Ken is played by Goro Inagaki, the Japanese pop band SMAP, who gives it all to him and has great hair through the film. Stacy Edwards, of "In the Company of Men", also appears in the movie and is probably fortunate to have found other film work afterwards. <br /> <br /> It takes at least three views to sort out what the plot is. With repeated looks you can keep elements such as the abnormal amount of vases Ken has in his home (at least 50) or that Ken wears a shirt with embroidered corn grains in the movie's final. <br /> <br /> The movie is predictable but highly quotable. My friends and I reenact whole scenes. Yes, we seem to be lame losers and we are ... but we are lame losers who have seen "Private Lessons II". Be one of ten people in the world who saw this movie. You will thank me for that.
