One of my favorite programs in the 80's. After the first season it started downhill when they decided to add Jean Bruce Scott. Deborah Pratt was wonderful and it was nice to look at her and Ernest Borgnine's character goes along with it. The last episode in which she appeared was one of my favorites in the second season. Unfortunately, blacks have not been on television for a long time. Some of the episodes in the second season, where okay but the third season, were more about the human characters than Airwolf, and it has not been shown to almost the end of the show. When it was in the US, it was disgusting !!!
