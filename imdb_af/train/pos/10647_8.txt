I can't understand what it is that fans of the genre don't like this movie. It was really fun. The special effects were wonderful. I generally agree with reviews and with IMDB voters, but not this time. I waited until it came to the home video, which I felt was another reason I wouldn't enjoy the movie. I believe that special effects movies should be seen on the big screen, but again this was not the case. For me, the movie is compared to two movies released about the same time. Blair Witch and The Mummy. Both movies I thought were terrible. Blair was probably the most overrated horror movie of all time. The mum made money and it was pure drinking. People liked it because it has special effects. Movies like the Mummy and the Haunting are not rich in character development, they are more like a rock battle. Well with the analogy, the Mummy was a B-ticket to the Haunting E-ticket.
