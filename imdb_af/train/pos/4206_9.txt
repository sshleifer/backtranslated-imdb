Saving McCoy is a three-time ransom bag, which can't fight his instincts back on the street, he grabs Candy's purse on a subway train. What he doesn't realize is that Candy carries top secret microfilm, microfilm, which is of great importance to many organizations. <br /> <br /> Director Samuel Fuller created an exceptional drama under the cunning New York world. City. Communist spies and shady government operators are all merging to make Pickup On South Street a very first-minute look. Based on a Dwight Taylor story called Blaze Of Glory, Fuller inspired this adaptation with a heavily set political agenda, something that many felt at the time was over, but just focusing on his anti-communist railings made it a great disservice. /> <br /> Dig a little deeper and you'll find characters as intriguing as anyone who directed Fuller. The main character display for one is the hero of the piece, a crook and a shallow man, his heroism is not born love for his country, they were born out of his sheer stubborn streak. It's quite an achievement that Fuller made one of the best anti-heroes of the fifties and I'm sure he was grateful for the performance of Richard Widmark as McCoy, all gray and icy cold heart, interacting with the wonderful Jean Peters like Candy is excellent, and the movies are hearty. However, it is Oscar nominee Thelma Ritter who takes acting honors, her Moe is strong and as seedy as the surrounding characters, but there is a tired warmth for her that Ritter majestically watches. <br /> <br /> It's a B film in texture, but an A movie in progress, Pickup On South Street is a real, classic and entertaining movie that is the best of its most intriguing director. 9/10
