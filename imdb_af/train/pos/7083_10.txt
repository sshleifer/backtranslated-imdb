A good addition to anyone's collection. <br /> <br /> 12 monkeys are a movie you don't see every day. It has excellent actors with an excellent story to go. It's not a normal role for Bruce Willis, but he plays the role of John McClane. <br /> <br /> The virus kills everyone on earth and leaves a few hundred survivors' stories not a new one, but the story takes a fresh new direction. <br /> <br /> A man (Bruce) is sent back in time to get information about a virus that has wiped out most of the people. <br /> <br /> The actors in this were wonderful. I have to give an indication to Brad Pitt who was hilarious when the mental patient meets James Cole (Bruce) in a mental hospital. <br /> <br /> The director has done a wonderful job making us a disturbing picture of a future devastated by a man-made virus. <br /> <br /> The animals seen in the virus world made them feel like they were driving the world when traveling in underground facilities. <br /> <br /> This movie was excellent. and must see it and also be its own. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it. <br /> <br /> 10/10
