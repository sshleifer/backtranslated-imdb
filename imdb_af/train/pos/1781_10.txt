... here comes the Romeo section to change the paradigm. <br /> <br /> Let me just say that I was gone by this short film. I saw it randomly when I was in Boston at a film festival and I thanked God every day for it. I really believe that I was part of an event, such as reading a Tarantino script before someone else did the first performance of Mean Streets. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure which festival is short on the next or what the creative team has on the typing for future products, but I hope I can be there. <br /> <br /> Another amazing piece of film.
