Intriguing. Exciting. Dramatically. Explosive. Complex. Epic. Words that just touch the tip of the iceberg, in terms of the great story lost, are told. <br /> <br /> From acting to rare visual effects, LOS is the essential television show for scientific fans. Fiction, fantasy, action, adventure and lots of mystery. <br /> <br /> Every governor is so well-chosen, and so good in their roles that you don't love or hate them, or they just want to be dead. <br /> <br /> The visual effects, when used (which are scarce) are actually pretty good, considering the usual production of performances. Whether it's the "smoke monster", up to the polar bears, LOS is credible in terms of eye candy. <br /> <br /> Nothing compares to the great complexity this show made for viewers. I endure. Almost to the end, continuity is almost perfect, characters are evolving, and the ever-changing story slowly gives the answers to his questions so much. Overall, there is virtually no mistake in losing. It does for dramatic / sci-fi television that Arrested Development did for comedy: it set the bar. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend those who are patient, intellectual, and love every moment of the ride, no matter how long it takes to reach the end. <br /> <br /> See this show.
