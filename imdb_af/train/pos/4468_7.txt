Two sailors are on leave - ladies man Joseph Brady (Gene Kelly) and shy innocent Clarence Doolittle (Frank Sinatra). They meet beautiful Susan Abbott (Kathryn Grayson) and they both fall in love with her. There's more, but you probably guessed it. <br /> <br /> The story (even for a 1940 music game) is ridiculous and everything is so nice and healthy - getting boring pretty fast. This movie is too long. It's 140 minutes and it's too much for such a silly story. There are also some boring numbers by Jose Iturbi and his band. Yet it is worth catching. <br /> <br /> When Kelly sings or Sinatra or Grayson sings, it becomes magic. None of the songs is especially memorable, but Sinatra has such a beautiful voice that you will not give. It was shot in rich Technicolor with all the glamor MGM. The play is OK - Kelly is good (although he sees him as a ladies man, prints it) and Sinatra is just fine (although he sees HIM as a shy guy, push it too!). Grayson is given nothing to do, but she is incredibly beautiful to look at. Some shots of her pulled my breath away! There are many highlights here: Sinatra and Kelly's great dance and singing number; Sinatra sings anything; Grayson's two songs and the straight-paced animated sequence in which Kelly is dancing with Jerry - an animated mouse! Tom also came up with a funny one. There is also little Dean Stockwell who steals every scene he is in. <br /> <br /> So it's too long and the plot just doesn't stop, but it's still worth catching. It was a big hit in his day.
