This movie had a large ensemble of adult actors, along with a role-players of youth actors who have long been in movies if right. Directing and editing was wonderful. I can look at the book it is adapted to, it must have been good. (I liked it.) Sigourney Weaver, Jon Voight, and Tim Blake Nelson were a blast to watch! Henry Winkler and Nathan Davis were not seen enough, but were fun when they were on the screen. The children at the camp couldn't have been better. (as I said, I liked it!)
