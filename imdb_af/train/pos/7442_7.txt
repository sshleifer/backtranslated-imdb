I hired the movie (I don't think it has a theatrical release here) and expects the worst. The previews made the movie look awful. I was really surprised, it was worth looking at; It was loosely written, almost like an ensemble piece of film. It had some very funny moments in it and although flawed, it is an effective satire on the show and people on the show without being indignant. It is flawed, mainly due to the terrible soundtrack of bludgeoning 'comedy' effects, but in general it is as honest and generic as the form of the show on an altmanesque or Larry Sanders way. <br /> <br /> At the moment, it's the way to be critical of Jerry Springer, he's also an easy target. Springer could have made Citizen Kane and it will be proclaimed "the worst movie ever made". I recommend this movie to anyone interested in the show. A defective but innovative and interesting piece of film.
