I know I know it was a good end but it was wonderful. I love when a movie ends in a terribly dark nature, but this time I was impressed with Darth Vader, who turned against the emperor. I was really surprised. The frightening sequence in that movie was when Luke was tortured and defeated by Emperor / Darth Sidious. He is about to be destroyed when Darth Vader, Dark Lord of the Sith, eliminates his dark master. A good sacrifice. The movies of this film are impressive. I was surprised with all the objects of the Rebel Battle ships and all Imperial War Ships and Super Star Destroyers. I loved the new race they brought on the screen, the Mon Calomari, the ewoks, the sullesteian (Lando's co-pilot) and many more. Most of my favorite scenes are in the movie: 1-When the Father destroys the Emperor and is deadly wounded. 2- When Luke sees the spirits of Obi-Wan and Yoda and then it appears Anakin Skywalker (Sebastian Shaw) (the biggest scene in Star Wars). 3 - When LEia kills Jabba, who strangles the Hutt crime shepherd. <br /> <br /> I personally love the storyline and the battle of Endor that offers ground and space combat, as well as the best match of Star Wars between Darth Vader Vs Luke Skywalker on Death Star. Post-script: The screens with Leia in the slave bikini are unforgettable. 9/10.
