I just watched the first disc in a 4-disc (26 episodes) collection created in conjunction with the UCLA Film & Television Archive (S'More Entertainment, Inc.). So far (apart from the 1 episode), the picture quality is pretty good. The DVD box is here on IMDb's title page. <br /> <br /> "Mr. Peepers" is just as charming as when I first saw it (5 years old) and Wally Cox is truly engaging in this role. If you are in the mood for quiet comedy that comes to mind, instead of hitting you, you will have the chance to experience all the wonderful characters you can remember from your childhood. Although some of the gags are a little corny, most are ingenious and well executed ... and even the corny ones are fun. It's a TV series that reminds me of my early childhood.
