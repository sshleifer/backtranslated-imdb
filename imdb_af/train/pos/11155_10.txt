Young, handsome, muscular Joe Buck (Jon Voight) moves from Texas to New York and thinks he'll make a living by being a stud. He comes there and quickly finds out that it won't be easy - he goes through one humiliating experience to another. At the end of his rope he hangs with lame, sloppy Ratso Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman). Together they try to survive and get out of the city and move to Florida. But will they make it? <br /> <br /> Very dark, disturbing but fascinating movie. Director John Schelsinger paints a very funny portrait of NYC and its residents. That way it is dated - the city may have been so bad in 1969, but it's now being cleaned up considerably. He also uses every camera trick in the book - color changes to black and white; trippy dream order; flash forward; flash back (especially a rape); shock cuts; strange sound effects ... you call it. It keeps you disoriented and from the middle, but I couldn't stop looking. <br /> <br /> There's not much of a story - it basically focuses on the friendship between Rizzo and Buck. There is an implication that they may have been lovers (the last shot of shows). It's just a portrait of two damaged characters trying to survive in a cold, cruel, urban jungle. <br /> <br /> It was originally rated X in 1969 - the only reason being that the MPAA didn't think parents wanted their kids to see it. Nevertheless, it was a big hit with high school professionals (then X didn't mean one under 17). It was also the only X-rated movie ever to win an Oscar award as best photo. Hoffman and Voight were aware of acting awards such as Sylvia Miles (mysterious) in the picture for a total of (maybe) 5 minutes! It was eventually reduced to an R (without cuts) when it was reissued in 1980. <br /> <br /> The excellent song "Everybody's Talkin" has also been launched in this movie and has become a big hit. <br /> <br /> A great movie --- but very dark. I give it a 10. Don't see it on commercial TV - it's cut on ribbons and incomprehensible.
