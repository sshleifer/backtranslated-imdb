Since Education Rita, Julie Walters was one of my role models, and her performance as a woman helping the man she loves with his feminine side is wonderful. I would never have believed her character in the hands of a lesser actress, but Walters pulled it off with gusto and panache. Adrian Pasdar gives his best performance to date in the male head.
