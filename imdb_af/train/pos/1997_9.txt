As a lifelong fan of Dickens, I am always disappointed by adjustments to his novels. <br /> <br /> Although his works featured a very accurate repetition of human life at every level in Victorian Britain, it was all a continuous thread of humor that can be both playful or sarcastic as the story dictates. In a way, he was a literary caricature and cartoonist. He can be serious and hilarious in the same sense. He provoked pride, had arrogance in the lamps, celebrated celebrity and implied loneliness and poverty. It could be a clich√©, but he was a writer of people. <br /> <br /> And that's the comedy that's so often missing from its interpretations. By the time of writing, Oliver Twist is being dramatized in serial form on BBC television. All the misery and cruelty are they, but not of humor, irony and wilderness. The result is just a dark, gloomy experience: the story is written by a journalist rather than a novelist. It's not really Dickens. <br /> <br /> 'Oliver!' On the other hand, much closer to the point. The mockery of officials is completely interpreted, from the budding beadle to the drunken magistrate. The classic stand-off between the beadle and Mr Brownlow, in which the law is described as an ass, an idiot, could not have been better done. Harry Secombe is an ideal choice. <br /> <br /> But the blinding cruelty is also there, the careless indifference of the state, the cold, hunger, poverty and loneliness are all just as surely offered as the Master would have wanted. <br /> <br /> And then there is crime. Ron Moody is a treasure than the sloppy Jewish fence, while Oliver Reid has Bill Sykes to perfection. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it's not surprising, Lionel Bart - himself a Jew from the eastern end of London - takes freedom with Fagin by reinterpreting him as a much more benign man than Dicken's original . In the novel he was completely relentless and sent him from his own sons to the gallows to protect himself (although he was also caught and hung). While being featured in the film, it is something of a passionate father figure, a kind of charitable thief, rather than a corrupt child. The latter is a long antisemitic sentiment. Otherwise, very few freedoms are taken with Dickens' original. All the memorable elements are included. Just enough threats and violence are retained to ensure confidential fidelity, while at the same time providing for children's sensitivity. Nancy is still being beaten, Bullseye escapes narrowly, and Bill Sykes gets a faithful graphic turnout. <br /> <br /> Every song is excellent, although they tend to skmaltz. Mark Lester mime her wonderful. Both his and my favorite scene is the one in which the world is alive for "who will buy". It's skemaltie, but it's Dickens through and through. <br /> <br /> I can continue. I could praise the wonderful set pieces, the contrast of the rich and the poor. There is top quality that comes from more British tribes than you can shake a stick. <br /> <br /> I should give it 10 points, but I feel more like Scrooge today. Enjoy it with your Christmas dinner. No original is better realized.
