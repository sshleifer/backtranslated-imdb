I just found the IMDb and searched for this movie and I was almost teared by the comments of all the people who saw this movie when I did it 6 or so years old in 1967? I saw it before the Jungle Book, so I was Eagle Boy for a few hours and then Mowgli for the next year. I burst into tears when the boy turned in the Eagle and wanted to see the movie again. When we got home we had a fried chicken dinner and I have the wishbone and guess who I wanted to be? My dad then said, "I'm sure you wanted to be an eagle" and of course we all know that wishes are broken if someone is guessing so much tears and a little resentment until today because they can't fly away ...
