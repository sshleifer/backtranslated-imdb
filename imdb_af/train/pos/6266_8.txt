This photo for me is very high as it is a very enjoyable and entertaining spoof of Alien Invaders that takes over a town and many of its men. <br /> <br /> The town and the players are all chosen. of the 1950s style and the whole movie has a deliberate and kitschy feel to it. Some of the screens are hilarious as with the birth of an alien being. <br /> <br /> All actors give full-blooded and serious performances that make the movie even harder and the special effects and strangers at least I deliberately 3rd rate to add to the entertainment. <br /> <br /> These types of movies often earn a cult that follows: <br /> <br /> 8/10.
