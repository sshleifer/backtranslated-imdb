Perhaps one of the most important and enjoyable Greek films I have seen over the last ten years is. Excellent performances (especially Yiannis zouganelis is wonderful), well-written manuscript and effective direction of a very special, for Greek very average standards, author. A film that is naturally influenced by Sam Peckinpah's Straw Dogs can be a masterpiece if it ultimately avoids striking and exaggerated situations and symbolization. Yet it is a movie that deserves our attention and belongs to that rare category of Greek movies to be watched outside Greece. It is a pity that Greece did not work commercially, with other fake and flowing productions such as Politiki Kouzina.
