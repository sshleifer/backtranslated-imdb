The fluttering of wing wings in the Atlantic can unleash a hurricane in the Pacific. According to this theory (which somehow relates to the Chaos Theory, I'm not sure exactly how), any action, no matter how small or insignificant, will start a chain reaction that can lead to big events. This little jewel of a movie shows us a series of seemingly unrelated characters, most of them in Paris, whose actions will affect each other's lives. (The six degrees of separation theory can also be applied.) Every story is a facet of the jewel this movie is. The acting is fine-tuned and nuanced (Audrey Tautou is light), the stories are probably on, the humor is just right, and the viewer makes the theater nod in agreement.
