Unfortunately, SpaceCamp came out about the same time as the Challenger Explosion. What really shrinks when it comes out or even if they need to, bring it out. I'm glad they did. I first looked at SpaceCamp at an entry-level movie. This greatly improved the performance. <br /> <br /> While I heard from Lea Thompson and Tom Skerritt. I've never heard of others in the movie. So, it was a great shock to me to find all those young people who are acting and working really well! Of course, Kate Capshaw was also excellent. <br /> <br /> I especially liked the scenes, where the kids showed how to act as a team. The screens of the children are being prepared for a journey for which they can only hope. The actual launch of a spacecraft is, of course, old news for us. However, this one was different. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is one of my most beautiful films. It's incredibly incredible, but it was great for a space nut like me. After that probably rent 30 to 40 times. I eventually found it and bought it in a certain store. Now, if it just comes on DVD. I'll have it forever. This movie gets a 9 out of 10 of me.
