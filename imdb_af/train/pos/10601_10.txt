This very funny British comedy shows what can happen if a part of London, in this case Pimlico, has to declare itself independent of the rest of the UK and its laws, taxes and post-war restrictions. The explosion of a war boom led to the discovery of ancient documents showing that Pimlico was ceded to the Duchy of Burgundy centuries ago, a long-forgotten historical footnote. However, for the new Burgundians it is an unexpected opportunity to live as happy as they are, free from any interference by Whitehall. <br /> <br /> Stanley Holloway is excellent as the small city politician who suddenly leads him as one of the world's smallest nations. Lady Margaret Rutherford is a delight as the history professor who is tilting with Pimlico. Others in the chosen role players include Hermione Baddeley, Paul Duplis, Naughton Wayne, Basil Radford and Sir Michael Hordern. <br /> <br /> Welcome to Burgundy!
