Elvira, the Mistress of the Dark, is a fun, camp grudge comedy in which the fourth wall is broken a few times and the jokes often stay under the navel. And Cassandra Peterson's breasts become a character of their own. <br /> <br /> Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) is stacked with horror show hostess, learning that she inherited her aunt Morgana. So she goes to a small town of Fallwell, which is controlled by the most terrible monster ever to embrace the earth: Morality comity. Elviras boobacious appearance is of course too much for the prunes, but the children of the village get a kick from her different approach to life. And of course there is even more sinister evil, her uncle Vincent (William Morgan Sheppard), who is after Elvira's mother's book of proverbs. Look, Elvira is actually a real witch, she just doesn't know it. Still. <br /> <br /> For what it is, Elvira is quite funny movie, though the writing offers plenty of room for improvement. Most laughs come from the difference between Elvira and the people of good morals, but there are also some good visual gags. The whole direction is okay, but it never rises any more. In everything, a good, deliberate camp, comedy. If you like this kind of thing, it is.
