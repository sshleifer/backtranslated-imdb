I voted 8 for this movie due to some minor childish defects. Other than that, this movie is one of my favorites! It is entertaining to say the least. However, the shooting scene is ridiculous, and I think Gackt (who wrote the book) takes a bit too much of his "Matrix obsession" in it. Their enemies seem to be standing there ... waiting to be shot. However, this film touches on and it always makes me cry. It has a lot of BIG humor in it, so it also makes me laugh. Gackt is an excellent actor I have to say .. he shows so much emotion. It was Hyde's first time acting and he did well. The role suits him. Wang Lee is absolutely wonderful. The whole role is what I would say, perfect for this movie. Do not miss it! YOU RIDE THIS!
