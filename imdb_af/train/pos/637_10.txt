Well, this show is nothing but AWESOME! It has a good story line and plot and great actors and actresses. Jeremy Sumpter is so hot and he is perfect for the role! He is gunna big in Hollywood. He has a bright future! This show is better for a long time, because I really love this show, and I hope it has a lot of success! It's so interesting. I waited to get it out for about 6 or 7 months and it is finally here, and it's great! I paste it too. I can see it when I want to! Just bad once a week. I wish it was at least twice a week, because now I wish it was Tuesday every day! Hope you all love this show! <br /> <br /> ~ Ashley ~
