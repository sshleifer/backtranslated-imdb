Like the great classic Bugs Bunny cartoons, this movie has humor at different levels. I just introduced it to my 10-year-old daughter and 11-year-old son. Both enjoyed the movie - laughed a few times ... and my daughter is not much of a sci-fi fan. The movie made me laugh, although I saw several times ... the humor on the adult level (it's humor that adults will get simply because of bigger life experiences, no jacket or R-rated stuff that can be found here ) keep the movie just as fun for adults. For example, from the adult-level humor, the Martian voices are based on characters from different movies / actors. The Martian pilot, Blaznee, has the voice and manners of Jack Nicholson; the scientist, Peter Seller's dr. Strangelove. The special effects are surprisingly good for this movie. The lack of top 10 actors actually works in the movie's favor, and actors / actresses play their part well. In fact, I would say the producers chose actors and their skills for the roles needs over the box-drawing power (an excellent example is Wayne Alexander's "Vern" character). I had to write this review ... the kids play it for the third time in 4 days over dinner. Good for a rainy day or a weekend weekend, there is nothing on-the-go movie.
