I loved BATMAN a lot: DEAD END, I thought it had a theatrical form and it gave a chance to make Collora a fine movie. This trailer didn't give me the same impression. The story line or potential story line was pretty good, but because of the plays and special effects I felt such a good TV or television program. <br /> <br /> First, Michael O'Hearn is not as good a Superman. I actually thought he made a decent Clark Kent in his short look. Sorry, I just don't think of SuperMan as the buff. The suit that Kent wore has masked its size. Batman can have the bodybuilder's body, but not Superman. Supes were undoubtedly shown, but not bulk. Anyway, I didn't care about all his post and his transformation from Kent to Superman was nice. Now it may not be just O'Hearn's fault, but Collora may need the credit for poor scripts and direction. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the special effects for the flying were cheezy. Superman flying through the air. If it was clear that this Superman had flown near the ground, with the telephone cables and buildings above him. I don't think there was a complete body shot of Superman flying. Apparently, the armor and scaffolding should be O'Hearn on its lower torso. <br /> <br /> All in all, it was a good trailer. I'll probably pay to see a movie, if ever made, and it'll be sure to catch it on television. The story line, an alliance between Lexcorp and Wayne Industries, Superman who is jealous of Lois's attraction on Wayne, Lex and Twoface to hit Superman and joining forces between Batman and Superman, is a good one. I'm sure with a bigger budget and approval for a full movie Collora and company, even O'Hearn can deliver a decent movie. Surely one better than most of the comic-based crap that has come out of Hollywood lately.
