I enjoy every moment of this beautiful film and have been intrigued by this female painter I have never heard before. So I look out for her life and then work. As can be expected, I found out that the film was not exactly historically accurate. However, I was a little surprised at the many negative comments on the movie because of this inaccuracy. Come on, guys, a movie isn't and shouldn't be a biography (another novel!). Any historical film distorts reality because it should be a work of art in its own right. A film director is fully entitled to use elements of reality and history to create a world of its own. Artemisia is a wonderful movie and I think it brought many people (including some who are now giving negative comments) to explore the life and work of this fascinating artist.
