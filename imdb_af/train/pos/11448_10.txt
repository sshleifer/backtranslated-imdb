For the first time I saw this absolutely sounding documentary in its initial release in 2001, and it really affected me a lot, so much so that I caught up with several of my friends to repeat it with me. The bottom line: None of my friends disappointed (ever!). This star film is about Scottish conceptual artist, Andy Goldsworthy, who creates some wonderful works of art using natural materials (wood, water, flowers, rocks, etc.) to create pieces that eventually return to their natural shape. temporary state of all?). We see that Goldsworthy creates several temporary works of art, as well as his long-term installations in large galleries around the world, as well as some pieces in the natural world. The German filmmaker, Thomas Riedelsheimer, commands, photographs and edits this meditation on the creative process, which is a real surprise to both the eye and the eye (with a surrounding musical score, compiled and performed by Fred Frith, whose music is generally edgy experimental / noise texture guitar, as well as a skilled ensemble of musicians). Although this movie has been available on DVD for years, if you can find a theater that relieves a revival of this fine movie, you should definitely find out (it is easily a movie made for the big screen, with a skillful sound system to really experience this movie). No MPAA rating but does not contain anything to insult (unless the live birth of a sheep on the screen is intended to insult or disturb)
