This show has all the typical characters in a comedy: the good guy, the idiot, the pervert, the rich girl ... but it's on the 70's. It's the only difference it has with other TV comedies. I don't know how to keep this show. His humor is pathetic! I mean, the jokes are so direct ... A typical dialogue is this: Fez: Oh, Jackie, I want sex with you. (Hearing laughs) Jackie: Fez you're a pervert. (The audience laughs) Fez: Oh yes, I am. (Hearing and shouting) "It's not funny. I think if it didn't have that laugh (I don't know how to call it in English, sorry), you won't laugh at all. It's not a intelligent comedy, it is an insult to the public, I like most American comedies, but it's not good at all, I'll give it 4 out of 10. (Sorry for my poor English again.)
