The fourth of five western Anthony Mann played with James Stewart. This one involves a hard beetle, Jeff Webster, who takes a road from Wyoming to Alaska, via Seattle. He holds in Seattle along with his partners Ben Tatum (Walter Brennan) and Rube Morris (Jay C. Flippen) whom he sent ahead of time to make preparations for the boat trip in the north. <br /> <br /> But first, he has to get careless trail hands, boat captains and Coy's charm, manipulative Ronda castle (Ruth Roman), who believes Jeff can be a valuable ally in the future. That's why she hides him on the boat while the captain looks for the earlier (and justifiable) killing of a drag hand. <br /> <br /> Jeff also crashes into a rogue Gannon (John McIntire) who runs the town of Skagway, Alaska. Gannon closes Jeff to disrupt his public hanging by running his cattle through the town. He fined Jeff the ownership of his cattle and Jeff just had to eat for the moment. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Jeff agrees to drive Ronda to Dawson to stock up. But it's just a ruse, so Jeff, Ben and Rube can slide back into Skagway and steal his cattle back. Judge Gannon, of course, finds out about this and is right behind, but is delayed by Jeff with a gun while Ben scans the Canadian border from Gannon's reach. <br /> <br /> After avoiding an avalanche and another shooting some other Skagway men eventually reach Dawson, where Jeff sells his cattle to the highest bidder. It only seems to be Ronda who immediately set up a new gambling house in Dawson. Jeff then took his money and bought himself as a claim and started picking gold. <br /> <br /> But then Judge Gannon came to Dawson to get the golden action out there and told Jeff that he was getting a bit bored with Skagway and trying his luck in the Klondike. It entails that some armed armed men come to him and steal some of the other miners' claims. Jeff and Ben now feel it's time to wipe out while the runs are good, so Rube can defend himself as a most ineffective sheriff against Gannon and his gang. <br /> <br /> They just look for a way back to find themselves captured by Gannon's men because Ben made the mistake of opening his big mouth. Ben is killed and Jeff is seriously injured, but it does not save Judge Gannon from his pace. The last night's shooting at the muddy Dawson Street takes care of it. First Jeff killed two of Gannon's best armed man (Jack Elam and Robert Wilkie). When Ronda came out to warn Jeff that Gannon wanted to slide behind him, Gannon shot her in the back and she died there in Jeff's arms. Then Jeff Gannon murdered while hiding under a wooden pavement. Revenge said. <br /> <br /> It's another frostworm that is just there with the NAKED SPUR and THE MAN OF LARAMY. Why the Universal DVD uses a pan-and-scan image instead of the widescreen print that TCM uses is beyond me. You will evade half of the glorious Alberta cinematography by William Daniels. So if you like well-written 50s westerns then this one is an A list holder. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
