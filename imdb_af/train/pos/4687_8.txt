Lizzie Borden's love crimes are an important film, dealing with the dark side of female sexuality (and with full feminine nudity in front, knocking the male type). It flirts with sadomasochism and the prisoners fall in love with the captor theory. <br /> <br /> This treatment of female libido is sometimes shallow and jerky, but Borden has traveled past feminist dogma of women gaining power through their insatiable lust. <br /> <br /> One striking scene exposes the female fetish to horses, when the antagonist, a fake fashion photographer, seduces an older woman wearing her pants by asking her to show her riding a horse . He kicks a reed crop between her legs, pushes it against her cross, and it raises her excitement. <br /> <br /> Then suddenly he left her house and swung her abjectly at the closed door. <br /> <Patrick Bergin plays the artist, and even though he is a long distance away, he chooses plain Janes and has enough screen presence to make the women swallow his line. At all reports, Sean Young proves a stranger, and she is hardly beautiful. In this film as the district attorney, her intense face and long-lasting slender body and emphasized hips and periodic relentless movement alive to erotic fascination. Her performance is powerful and complex. <br /> <br /> Signs feature an intriguing worldview and the fact that it's so contrary to the modern, fearless boy, I really appreciate.
