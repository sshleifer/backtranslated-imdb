Given the low budget and production constraints, this movie is very good. It is credible, realistic and shows how the Csikos (Hungarian horsemen who lived on the plains) lived their lives to save a resigned US pilot from the relentless and wild Nazis. We were drawn into strong feelings for the young, impressive but very brave boy - who admired the American pilot. If you are looking for special effects, superman heroes and magical ends - this movie is not for you. If you want to feel the need for the persistent, amorous Nazis and their lack of compassion, then you will be comforted by this movie. I really enjoyed it and for those who love horses, dogs and humble, helpful people who appreciate the freedom and those who strive for, this movie will be one you will remember long ago.
