Bruce Almighty is the best Jim Carrey has been working since The Truman Show, and was a pleasant surprise to some of his recent "Hey Hollywood - see how good I can act!" counter disappointments. It's good to see Jim recognize and embrace his strengths. He will not receive an Oscar award, but the film itself will last longer than many of the Academy's "awarded films". He is at the top of his form in this most recent movie. It's like returning an old friend. <br /> <br /> Carrey, Freeman and Aniston all do a good job together - comfortable in their comedy roles, beautiful comic timing, and of course fun together, but without the "hey mom - see how funny I am" kind of comedy. A real surprise was Steven Carrell as Carrey's nemesis (Carrell or The Daily Show celebrity), who walked away with the best and funniest plays of the film. For the past three years I have been laughing harder at Carell than anyone else. <br /> <br /> I can foresee that the religious nuts in the US will be about treating God, but the bottom line of the movie is true to all the great theological beliefs - we are masses of protoplasms trying to get through us come short lives by exercising our free will. Without Marrying Children, do not complain, it will probably be a target of people with wrong priorities (who knows the types - men who decorated gold watches on Sunday morning and last night, sell prayers to God). And again, about 0.5% of the country will look after and 80% of the media will report it. <br /> <br /> The bottom line: It's a pure entertaining movie, every audience laughs and wonders what they will do, and a feel-good feeling at the movie conclusion. A step in a big street in America must confirm that God has a great sense of humor. What better comic genius to remind us than Jim Carry. <br /> <br /> Again, Jim - it's great to have you back !!
