Gung Ho tries to express many ideas while entertaining with a wiseguy comedy. The result is uneven, but generally entertaining. Keaton balances all three aspects of his main character fairly well. Wantabedde is even better. One warning: George Wendt is very poor in his supporting role. Otherwise, this is quite a pleasant time capsule.
