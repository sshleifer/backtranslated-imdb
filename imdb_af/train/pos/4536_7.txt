Written by the author who wrote the excellent Murder Rooms series that wrote ACD's adventures with Dr. Joseph Bell, I looked forward to it and I was not disappointed. It was pretty slow, with a lot of emphasis on Doyle's frustration at Sherlock Holmes, which was very accurate and excellently portrayed. It was an interesting character study and very well shot (on digital video, unusual for a period piece). The acting was excellent, especially Tim McInnery and Brian Cox, although the actor who portrayed ACD, whose name I can't remember, impressed me. An excellent character study that has about the same amount of coils as any normal Sherlock Holmes case. See it if you get the chance
