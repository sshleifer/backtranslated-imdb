Although it is widely acknowledged that Terrible Symmetry is heavily influenced by the Kolchak episode, they, they are, they will be, whether it be a deterrent or a tribute, is a far more controversial point. As a big fan of both series, I endorse the latter belief, though the less charity may not. James Whitmore was brave to tackle the task of such a difficult episode, invisible elephants and gorilla packs sound like a recipe for disaster, but he pulls it down with style, the teaser is an absolute gem. Lance Guest does a great job of making a credible character from Kyle Lang and Jack Rader, with a threat than Ed Meecham. Forget about dubious symmetry's dubious originality and just enjoy it as a deeply satisfying X-file.
