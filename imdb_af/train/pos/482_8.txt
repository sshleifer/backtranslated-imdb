It is a poem on film, beautifully presented and photographed with sensitive artworks. It perfectly captures the atmosphere of time and place. (Italy's more district in the twenties.) This is a love story with a twist. The characters are unique and credible. The settings are exotic. Some of the scenes --- the funeral boat in the fog --- the tall long shot of the chessboard in the middle of a complicated pattern floor --- are beautiful images. And rather than the compulsory happy ending, this story has a bitter one. If film is an art, it's close to a masterpiece. <br /> <br />
