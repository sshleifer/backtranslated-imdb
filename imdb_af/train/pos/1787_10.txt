The Dance character makes your Buddy finally have the terrible truth. "Leave me alone, kiss men if you want," she screamed at all, and destroyed the man who had been so in love with her. Nice girl. It could be the place to reconsider everything about the giggly charm that the Danne falls into in this character. Great reason to feel sympathy for her lying down in bed, but hey, remember, there are no mistakes, except perhaps, see this movie. <br /> <br /> Wait a minute. This irony is meant! It's actually a masterpiece of ironic, yes! But I doubt if this is what the creators of this film had in mind. Maybe there are some mistakes.
