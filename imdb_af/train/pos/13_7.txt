The production quality, movie, foreground, authentic New England (Waterbury, CT?) -Based and sumptuous John Williams score had led to a 3-4 star collection item. Unfortunately, all we got was a pleasant 2-star "decent" movie, mostly unforgettable for what it tried ......... bring a mainstream movie house style film. The small town and the story of ordinary people is a genre for itself, and if done well, it will satisfy most adults. Jane Fonda couldn't hide her brain enough to make her character credible. I wondered why she didn't do a postgraduate degree at Yale, instead of working in a dead-end factory in Waterbury. Robert DiNiro's character was just a little confronted. An illiterate, old-fashioned loser who apparently has a little help from Jane's character, a 1990 version of Henry Ford or Thomas Edison. <br /> <br /> This genre was handled more successfully by "Nobody's Fool" in the mid 90's and this year (2003) "About Schmidt." I wish the mainstream studios would try more for adolescents and " will put some screens at the multi-theater complexes for those efforts. <br /> <br /> I'll give it an "A" for effort.
