Incredibly intriguing and engaging, I found it impossible to turn away as soon as I started watching. I'm usually one of the hardest critics, but for me this movie was just brilliant, weird, because I might almost smell the air and feel the textures of the places. <br /> <br /> Of a cinematographic I thought there was great use of light and texture. From the orange glow from the summer light to the plastic-wrapped couch, everyone has a clear air of realism. <br /> <br /> From a character perspective, I thought of Victor Vargas as almost the glue that is being connected. the story was very inspired, each of the other family members who had a more complete background, simply caused bigger intrigues in the main character itself. <br /> <br /> In addition, someone like the grandmother has known and been at the end of such a situation I can say the situation feels particularly realistic. The uneasiness, the accent, the cooking and even the comments I made made me feel so authentic. <br /> <br /> I think this movie worked for me because I started watching it unexpectedly and completely immersing it and brought back memories of teenager emotion, worth a watch.
