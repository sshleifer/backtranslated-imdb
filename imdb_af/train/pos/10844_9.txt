It reminded me of a more serious level of spinal tap. This is the story of a group doing a reunion tour, but things are not harmonious between them. I was especially impressed with Bill Nighy's performance as Ray. You were sorry for him, but he had some civilization over him. It's a good movie to see if you've ever seen your favorite band, it's painful, old and pathetic. Bittersweet, highly recommended.
