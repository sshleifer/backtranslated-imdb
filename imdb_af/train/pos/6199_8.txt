As someone who has seen and followed Hartley's public work for several years, I think much of what fiction was being told by true stories has been elevated to obscure philosophical mind games. <br /> <br /> While entertaining, Fay Grim is yet another step in the Henry Fool line of thought, where the film reflects the quality of an object within the movie itself. In Henry Fool, the object is the memoir. In Fay Grim, the object is encrypted memoirs - stolen, forged and mutated into something that is so unclear, it can't really make sense - that is, the writing process and film in the modern era - where the Most blocking films are not much more than a mash-up of the past. This is in philosophical sense about which Fay Grim goes. The object, perhaps, is the tragedy that shock is now clich√© and boring (as shown in the opening performances at the publisher office). <br /> <br /> That being said, much of the movie is lost when you don't understand Henry's character and the meaning of the memoirs being searched. Henry is a thinly-covered devil, first visiting Simon as a modern Faust, and so on. Without understanding how tragic Henry's character is, much of the quality of Fay Grim's plot and story is lost. <br /> <br /> There is not enough "detail" expressed by oral flashbacks. Know that Henry Fool's plot cannot compare to the quality of characters he did in Henry Fool. And so I think for someone who's going to be in this movie, there are about 10 minutes of "so" reactions to a highly-composed dialogue and then it is. <br /> <br /> But Henry Fool was also my least favorite Hartley movie until I realized it was bad - uncomfortable and contaminated - exactly because Henry Fool's Confessions were bad ... not just racial or dirty, but unceasingly broken. Henry can't even be a proper villain - and that's perhaps the tragic mistake that makes him most enjoyable ... like Gollum in Tolkien's works, Henry is spicy. <br /> <br /> It doesn't come in for Fay Grim, though Henry's dialogue is excellent. What matters is that the whole movie is built as an encryption - a form of another plot that is ultimately a bad story to add to henry's confessions. It's an interesting twist, but one that can't really be consumed without viewing the first movie. Perhaps more of Henry would have been earlier than describing the publisher the basic storyline of the first movie, although this plot is not what the first movie is about, unless perhaps one is a casual observer. <br /> <br /> Share the encryption? Hard to say ... A little disappointed at the sex gums. Wink.
