How you can say that Peaches, with its complex story dealing with a variety of issues, is "a small TV idea" is beyond me. In addition, I can think of many movies that have a "small TV idea" in their stands. Your obvious dislike of the TV industry ("Sue Smith didn't rise above her TV background") is confusing. especially because you have such a "good time" in TV. If we can all just be as talented as Ms Smith (no, I'm not a friend or family member) - AFI Award-winning Brides of Christ, Road from Coorain, etc. All made for TV. Think about it, what about the other "small TV ideas" such as "Teen the wind", "Bodyline", "The Dismissal", "Scales of Justice", "Blue Murder", "Water under the Bridge", etc. . I think Peaches is a good entertaining movie that interests me, and most of my friends, from start to finish. It's far from flawless, but I think it's one of the best Australian movies I've seen in the past few years. Who knows, with a few more views (there is so much to think about), it can only be with classic such as "The Year My Voice Broke", "The Devil's Playground". I enjoyed this movie much more than "Somersault" and "Three Dollars". These movies, I think, have their moments-surreal, atmospheric, realistic, and dealing with important contemporary issues, but like pure entertainment for Mr. A mrs. Average moviegoer and I, it was very ordinary, if not boring. When I go to a movie, I'm always aware of the audience's response to a movie (through initiative responses and obey conversations in the foyer and loo). Some came from Peaches and beaten their heads, some with negative criticism, but many enjoyed the experience.
