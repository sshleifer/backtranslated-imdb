I have no doubt that the critics have placed this movie, especially the artsy speed art that needs a laxative. It's an excellent movie in the Abbot & Costello tradition or more recently Don Knotts. It won't shake the world or change films forever. What it will do is entertainment. When everything is said and done, it is the most important thing anyway. Watch this movie and forget about your problems. It even has a simple and friendly moral message at no extra cost. I always loved Elvira's TV show when I lived in LA. She didn't really save her Vampira sktick any more than Vampira from the original, Theda Bara. This kind of mythical character belongs to whom it does best; & Cassandra Peterson does it best. Long live Elvira; We need more of these movies. There is never enough. The villain, William Morgan Sheppard, was also excellent. He emanates a wonderful refined evil. I couldn't find any technical errors. The performance is as close to flawless as the art form gets. My great compliments to the director, James Signorelli, and all his crew members.
