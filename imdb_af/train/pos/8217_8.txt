With this movie the only Dirty Harry movie that Clint Eastwood not only produces and regulates, but also produces, you know it should be fine. Although some say The Enforcer is the best in the series, I totally disagree. In my opinion, apart from the original Dirty Harry, Sudden Impact and Magnum Force, the only two are worthy of being in the series. Although The Enforcer is a good movie with some good action sequences, it doesn't get the dirty and eager effects the other three movies do. This movie captures all the excitement that a Clint Eastwood movie makes, and it has the quotes that make a Dirty Harry movie good. In Diry Harry it's "Well, do you, punk?"; in Magnum Force "A man must know his limitations"; and here it is: "Go ahead, make my day." Also in this movie it is nice to see a change as you get a little tired of seeing the same old San Francisco streets in the other movies in the series. With the great acting of Clint Eastwood and co-star Sandra Locke, and good directing by Clint, it's in my opinion the best Dirty Harry successor ever.
