WOW. One of the greatest movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Absolutely loved! Before the opening credits were done, I was glued to the screen. <br /> <br /> It's a Sci-Fi thriller - and the edge of your Whodunnit chair. Unbelievable. <br /> <br /> I wish it would never end. <br /> <br /> Lucy Liu is a discarded role. Anyone could have played it. Chief actor Jeremy Northram was the perfect jerky man. <br /> <br /> This movie appeals to me to love War Games, Sneakers and Track Down. <br /> <br /> Amazing! <br /> <br /> 8-22-06. Walt D in LV
