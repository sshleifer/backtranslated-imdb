I was never a big fan of horror movies. They usually try cheap tricks to scare their audiences like loud noises and creepy kids. They usually have originality and contain a large excess. The only horror movie I liked was Stir of Echoes with Kevin Bacon. It was well behaved and had a wonderful story. But it's all together and maybe even surpassed by Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, probably the scariest movie ever. <br /> <br /> The movie follows a writer (Jack Nicholson) and his family who agree to watch a hotel while it is closed for the winter. There were rumors that the place was haunting and the last resident went mad and killed his family. But Jack is convinced it will be right and he can use the silence to overcome his writer's block. However, after months of loneliness and silence, Jack becomes a grumpy and later violent. Is it cabin fever or is there anything in the hotel that makes him angry? <br /> <br /> One of the most beautiful parts of the movie is the feeling of isolation that Kubrick makes. The hotel is very quiet and the rooms are big but always empty. It's also frankly calm when Jack's son drives his bike through the dry corridors. Jack Nicholson's performance is also one of his best, the scare of me and sure to come out once. My favorite scene is when he speaks with a ghost inside a walk-in fridge. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the Shining is tops for horror movies and knocks the snot out of the crap like the Ring and The Blair Gate Project. It can be cute, but is definitely a goodie. 8/10
