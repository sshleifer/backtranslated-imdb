Riget II is a good successor, but not as good as the first. This series doesn't look as serious as the first one. However, there is much more comedy in this, good one. <br /> <br /> We are back at the Danish Rigshospitalet, the Danish national hospital. Mrs. Drusse will leave the hospital because her work has been done, but fate wants it differently. She haunts ghosts quickly and Helmer makes everyone angry and soon gets worse when black forces in the kingdom are unleashed. <br /> <br /> This story involves much more comedy like the previous one. Anyway, a lot of fun, but it makes you a little less serious. The story featured many elements of the last series and added some new ones. It's well written, but some of the new elements are just as stupid, but they save it by making it more like a comedy. Good story, but not as good, original and exciting as the first series. <br /> <br /> The actors are the same with a little addition to the regular cast. They are all very good. This is a strange story and institution. Some parts are a total freak show and the characters change during the show, to keep it serious and really keep it is not an easy job. Yet, these actors handle this whole situation perfectly. <br /> <br /> Many of the good features of the first series are kept intact. The cinematography is one of those features. Trier's world-renowned hand camera brings excitement and reality to the range. This gives the camera a unique ability to move and follow the characters and Trier uses these capabilities. Good, moving, good lightning and good composition and editing make it enjoyable to watch. <br /> <br /> Prepare to see better effect in this successor who is in the first. Also, be prepared to see more. I didn't think the green thing looked too good at all. Think it's original and does not fit. However, the effects of the ghosts are really good. The non-digital effects also look good. Little one just looks strange, but you accept it. Generally, I want to say that the effects of OK are good. <br /> <br /> The music is also very good. Moody and beautiful. Some of it really touches. It really fits in well. As the first one there is little music in the action scenes and it works very well. <br /> <br /> Along the way, it's a good successor. If you have seen Riget, you can see this one without being disappointed. It has many of the same features as the first series. However, I would recommend seeing the first series before I see it. These two are a series that you don't want to miss.
