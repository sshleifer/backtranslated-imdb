This was my first introduction to the world of Bollywood and I'm now addicted! Well, it requires the acceptance of another mindset to watch American movies, but once you enjoy it, it won't be disappointed. The songs are wonderful, melodic and very catchy. The actors are visually compelling especially Karisma Kapoor, who is certainly one of the most beautiful actresses anywhere in the film world. Places, color are spell binding. If you want something else and are looking for upliftment, it is encouraged and stimulated. I recommend catching this movie.
