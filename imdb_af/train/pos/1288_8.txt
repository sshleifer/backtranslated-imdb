Preston Waters is off to a bad summer. Except for her birthday, nothing else looks promising. <br /> <br /> First, he has to share his own room with his brothers who will run a business. They can't do it in their rooms because they don't have enough space. Down to a birthday party, he only gets $ 6 tokens while others get $ 32, $ 35 and even $ 50. When one of his birthday cards arrives early, he only gets a check for $ 11. <br /> <br /> Going to the bank, he learns that he needs at least $ 200 to start an account. To leave the bank, a bully crosses the check. Following up on the child, he is almost running (definitely destroying his bike) by a criminal named Quigley (played by Miguel Ferrer). Quigley's also comes from the bank to give the owner $ 1,000,000 to give this man tomorrow. Quigley starts writing a check for the damage, but only manages to write his name before a police car surrounds the area. Frightened, he gives Preston the check, informs him to give it to his father to carry it out. <br /> <br /> That night, however, Preston tells his dad that he doesn't want a new bike, he wants to return his own room, better his own home. His father restrained him for the rest of the night at his room. Moping in his room Preston figures things can't get worse, he realizes he's forgotten the check, because it's still in his shirt. This is empty. <br /> <br /> Using the computer and after careful consideration, it accounts for $ 1,000,000. The next day, while trying to pay it to the bank, he was taken to the owner who thought he was the one he was supposed to give and do the $ 1,000,000. He's not all, as the right person named Juice comes in a moment later. <br /> <br /> Now the three Preston must be put down. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Preston bought all the stuff. including his own home and even on dates with a disguised bank lady who is really an FBI agent (trying to track down the 3 bad guys). He makes this person the name of Mr. Macintosh, for which he works, and even plans a feast for him on his birthday. <br /> <br /> But eventually things get up (the money runs out, the bad guys get it). <br /> <br /> Overall, a pretty funny movie. Miguel Ferrer plays his part very well. If you enjoyed him in another Stakeout, you'll love him here. He does all kinds of evil mad things. <br /> <br /> Rick Ducommun (the tense boss of Ghost in the Machine) plays a wonderful friendly driver in this movie.
