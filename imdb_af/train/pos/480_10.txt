The primary aspect of this movie that most people miss is that Luhzin lives his life as a chess game. So many people saw this movie and didn't get it, and I don't understand why. While watching this movie, I was taken on a private trip that cursed me. I will try to explain it without any spoilers, but be warned. I'm talking about things happening in the movie. <br /> <br /> **** Possible Spoilers **** Be warned! **** <br /> <br /> She is a "big move" life versus "small move". He chose Natalia as his queen, and he and she acted when she first described Tannie the King and Queen and moved them when she announced to chess him as a boy. Now listen to that description. <br /> <br /> When someone asks him a question, he flashes back to the past as if he was exploring the past. (The flashbacks are beautifully illuminated.) The flashbacks are also very interesting, as they not only give their point of view as a child, but also the point of view of the other character. It is beautiful. <br /> <br /> Several characters become either his helpers or his enemies, pawns, bishops and knights, their actions brighten your side. Even their placement in a scene is crucial to understanding what's going on. Beautifully done. <br /> <br /> I will no longer comment on what happens to the character of Luhzin, but I hope it will ease what actually happens at the end. <br /> <br /> This film is constantly working on many levels, so I endorse it. It was a surprise and a joy to watch. <br /> <br /> If you like this movie, I'd recommend a movie called Vars. The only way these movies are similar is to use chess and the characters are treated as pieces. <br /> <br />
