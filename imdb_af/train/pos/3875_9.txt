This movie was made by one of the most absurd comedians in Canada, Yves P. Pelletier. I was shocked for a moment when he made a ROMAN comedy, but he knew he was a heavy cinefile, was seen at every local festival and in the local movie I had a positive feeling about this movie. <br /> <br /> Hell, I'm right. To the right of the bat is the scenario (written by Pelletier himself) a little twisted and difficult to follow, but in the Pelletier fashion it is a 90 minute in-box 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Lastly inspired and mostly transformed allusion to Dangerous Liaison (at Laclos). "Les Aimants" consists of a twisted game writing note on the fridge. Throughout the movie you get the opportunity to find out who is who and who writes to whom on the goddam fridge .... which appears in an interesting love affair. <br /> <br /> Great storyline, good photography, great quotes from other movies. Should we ask more for a first movie?
