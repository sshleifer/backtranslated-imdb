Jafar Panahi's comedy drama "Offside" depicts some women entering a Tehran sports arena from which women are banned. The official reason: very dirty language, and soccer players have their legs. But of course this is a case of sexism. So, most of the film consists of light comic relief, as the women try to ask the men serious questions about why women are banned from the stadium, and one woman even comes up with her own scheme to cheat the men. . <br /> <br /> As I understand, all of Jafar Panahi's movies (this one included) have been banned in Iran. The real tragedy is that the CIA's 1953 overthrow of the prime minister and the subsequent backlog of brutal shah Ayatollah Khomeini apologized for using his close interpretation of the Qur'an to establish a chauvinist society and that George W Bush's current policy on Iran gives Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, an excuse to act the cowboy and relieve censorship. <br /> <br /> Above all, it's a neat look at people who are getting ways to challenge the system. Not a good movie, but worth seeing. Since all Jafar Panahi's movies are banned, I wonder how he can even make it.
