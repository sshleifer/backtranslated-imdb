this movie was almost a great imaginative movie. A mix of Shakespeare, pop, jazz and faerie stories. This movie was an imaginative twist on the Cinderella theme. With a strong film, led by the perfect Cast Kathleen Turner, this movie did everything for it. Everything except production values. I hardly ever think that a movie needs special effects or big budgets, but with an over-the-top production like this, it has the same seedy quality as everybody else for TV movie. In addition to better cinematography, this film was almost perfect. <br /> <br />
