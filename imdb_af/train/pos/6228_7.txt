Another fun, greasy, foamy RKO musical game with Astaire and Rogers, VOLLED THE VLEET is a beautiful movie. Although it does not have the strikingly large songs of SWNG TIME (although the final number "Face the music and dance" is one of the best and straightforward of the team), it is very enjoyable as these two could hardly work together the 1930s. Again, the plot is lightweight and forgetful, but watching Fred and Ginger dance together is bare sky. These two have conveyed more romance and magic to dance than many couples in movies in a great love story. While there's better Fred and Ginger musicals, it's definitely a must-see.
