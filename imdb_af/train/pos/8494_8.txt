I saw this movie again as a command for my management class. Will mainly comment on the different management styles and ideas about quality (of the product). I hired this one in the eighties and I remember that it was good (but not big) film. I always liked Michael Keaton's style and delivery. He was a perfect fit for the movie. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised to see some of the low ratings for this movie. I give you yes, it's not an Oscar winner, but it has decent comic value. It's more of a subtle comedy rather than an all-out comedy farce. I also find some of those who felt it was an inaccurate film about cultural and business differences. I differ. I give you again that there are many general and dramatizations, but then this Hollywood movie is not a documentary. From what I read about the differences between automakers on both sides of the Pacific, many of the principles were at the time accurate. <br /> <br /> Some of the basic differences were that Japanese workers made to feel as part of the company as a whole. Teamwork is emphasized. They may have made the company above all else. Where American workers had more of a management record, the type of relationship was. The individual was more important than the company. I'll probably get some hate emails about the comments. I'm sure. <br /> <br /> Another difference was how quality was looked at and whose responsibility it was to recover. In many Japanese plants, defects or problems are investigated and determined at the time they are discovered. Rather than one character in the movie it said, "It was the dealer (which means car dealer) problem." <br /> <br /> Many of these things are probably dated, but I'm sure some are still so many US cars The manufacturers are still struggling to keep up with the Japanese. If one is more interested in the subject of American, European and Japanese automakers, I can recommend a book that explores in more detail on this topic and done about the same period. The book is called "The Machine That Changed The World" by James Womack, Daniel Jones and Daniel Roos. It's about a car manufacturer's study during and before the time this movie covers. Portions are a little dry, but I think you will find that is also the movie of the movie.
