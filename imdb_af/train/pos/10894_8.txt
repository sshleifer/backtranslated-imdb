I had a few reservations about this movie, I thought it would be the usual billing card --- a formula movie over Christmas. In the middle of a heatwave in late June, we decided to give it a shot anyway, maybe we saw some snow. <br /> <br /> This movie was one laugh after another. Ben Affleck was credible in his character, but the true star of this one is James Gandofini. He gave his lines a real white over him and made a good "dad". <br /> <br /> If you want a nice few hours, definitely check this one.
