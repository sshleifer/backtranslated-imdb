For Columbo fans, like myself, it's the episode of episodes that made Columbo so popular and just how good it really was. Ruth Gordon has a field day (as ever) to play the wittily intelligent crime story writer Abigail Mitchell. Looks like Abigail calls her son-in-law a few papers to make him her heir. She never came across her cousin's death and is convinced her dead cousin's husband (Charles Frank) did the dirty act. To tell more will be unthinkable. Mariette Hartley has a clever role as Abigail's personal assistant. This episode of Columbo is in itself a class. It's a really well-made television movie. I strongly recommend it.
