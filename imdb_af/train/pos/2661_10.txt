... This is not the first time Stanley has blurred the distinction between genres to such a great effect. In Dr Strangelove, you had a comedy about an abominable situation, and here the base is a frightening scenario that actually produces very funny moments. Slowly burning madness and trying to kill your family is of course not hilarious, but the dialogue is very knowing ("five months of peace is just what I want ...") and there is a tremendous drinking scene that is countless would be. If you have just included one kind of spirit, but it is backbone when you are in the other factor. <br /> <br /> I disagree with those who say the hotel has an insignificant effect on Jack Torrance in the filmed version. The clues Nicholson gives the audience as an actor just a hint of the potential for madness. It is only strengthened when we learn that the head of the family has struggled with alcoholism and is emotionally distant from his wife and son. The environment he participates in, however, absorbs those personality defects and leaves them unconscious. In the same way that buildings are sometimes thought to educate the events that are happening there, the hotel brings with it the discomfort of a troubled but healthy man and uses his weaknesses against him to ultimately take him out of the point of no return . He may have dormant deficiencies in his personality before arriving, but for me, the Review itself is the trigger that turns them off. <br /> <br /> Kubrick's cold and stand-alone approach to work wonderfully for a cold horror movie, and The Unpredictable Power of Nature Jack Jack Nicholson, has all the time between making your giggle and mind from you. When he explodes, you won't be sure how far he can go. Together they made a good team and with a blend of their talents we gave a classic. If you want a good viewing experience, then this is a good and really good example ...
