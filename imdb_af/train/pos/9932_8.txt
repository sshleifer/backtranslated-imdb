If you go to this movie, expect something that is not, you will be disappointed, like with any movie. This film contains what Hemmingway describes as the "iceberg effect". On the surface, it just merged a cupboard of random movie clips to make a movie. If it were written in a book, it would be a short story because the action in the movie is very fast, and unless you actually try to catch it, the reasoning behind the plot (along with some subtle shadow) very good past you. Definitely a movie you have to see twice to fully appreciate. Experimental cinematography hardly describes this film. The camera work and post production adds a lot to the overall flavor of the movie, which makes it reasonably artistic on some points and on other interpretations (which may be too much in American movies). Although, on some parts, it may be a bit raunchy, gruesome and too harsh for some audiences, the movie is never quite unrealistic. The only aspect of the movie I would write off as "needs improvement" is the soundtrack selection. No movie is ever good without a proper soundtrack, and although the soundtrack is very appropriate, the opening is a bit too long, and the other rap songs in the movie could really be replaced with something more appropriate (heavy grungy rock or psychedelic electronica would have made this movie a real trip). The flood of images and dynamic ... color palettes add another "artistic" aspect to it, also combined with the events that take place throughout the film. It's not a movie that you can miss and still miss. But it also makes it much more of a desirable movie to watch, and not one of which you will quickly get bored. 8.5 / 10
