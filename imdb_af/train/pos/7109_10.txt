First, let's start with the negative points: 1) There is BIG, yawning wholesaler in the story line and questions raised will not get where close to being answered; 2) The movie is not for all people, so rude viewers will become restless and start during the movie. <br /> <br /> Point two above is important because the movie is very quiet. In an older type of theater (like the one I went to), you can sometimes hear the coil through the projector. I loved it. The movie doesn't keep you busy with music or effects: it reminds you of what's happening. <br /> <br /> There is a lack of rhythm that generates an atmosphere that is fascinating for a very pleasant one. Same kind of atmosphere generated by Stanley Kubrick in Eyes Wide Shut. Not for all people. <br /> <br /> I would highly recommend this to fans of the theater, as the cinematographic work is incredible. Those who base their appreciation for a movie exclusively on the story will be totally disappointed. This is the kind of story you have to make the links afterwards. (My version is pretty darn cool, but probably quite rounded!) If you catch the movie, there is one very cool part: when the two police talk to each other on their cell phones. An ultra-cool sound effect that really sets you up right now. Hate to the person who thought to do it.
