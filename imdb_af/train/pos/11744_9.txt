'Mr. Harvey Lights a Candle is anchored by a brilliant performance by Timothy Spall. <br /> <br /> While we can predict that his titular, sincere teacher will have some sort of breakdown or catharsis, based on some deeply secret of his past, how his emotions are revealed, is surprising. Spall's variety of feelings being conveyed is moving much more and more than he usually portrays as part of the Mike Leigh repertoire. <br /> <br /> While an expected boring school bus ride was used only for comic purposes, such as "The Simpsons", this central situation of a visit to the Salisbury Cathedral in Rhidian Brook's writing is well recorded and structured for dramatic purposes, and is almost formally divided into deeds. <br /> <br /> We are introduced to the urban British variety races and religiously diverse children (with their uniforms I couldn't say whether it's a "private" or "public" school), as they come together? the beating black kids, the serious South Asians and Muslims, the white bulls and the girls ?? but reasonably natural and individually transmitted. The young actors, some of whom acknowledged British TV like "Skaamteloos", were exuberant to represent the regular range of junior high social pressures. Celia Imrie gives more warmth to the supervisor's role as the martinettes she usually has to play. <br /> <br /> A break in the journey leads to a transforming crisis for some while others remain amusingly unaware. We think, like the teacher portrayed by Ben Miles from "Coupling", that we are going to conduct a didactic lesson on religious tolerance, but it is much more about faith in both people and God. That's why the BBC showed it in England. at Easter and BBC America it showed in the US over Christmas. <br /> <br /> Nathalie Press, who was also so good in the summer of love, played an important role in Mr Harvey's salvation which could have been played for the film-of-the-week sermon, but touch as they unexpectedly reach out to each other (unfortunately I interrupted their intense scene by advertising). <br /> <br /> While it's a bit of a pilgrimage, a pilgrimage, a pilgrimage, an attempt to attempt, the best appearance of a good will is against men than I have seen on a holiday theme in most TV movies.
