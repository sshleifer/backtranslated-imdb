The thing about my people is a wonderful movie about relationships - firstly an adult boy and his father, but also that boy with his wife, his sisters and his mother. Paul Reiser wrote a semi-autobiographical film about his relationship with his father. The movie is funny, offensive and tempting. It led me to evaluate my own relationship with both my late-deceased father and my adult son. Peter Falk is excellent as Paul's father - the role could not be thrown better. I hope both mr. Falk and Mr. Reiser's next year's film awards for their efforts - Falk for his performance and Reiser for his screenplay.
