I was a Star Trek fan for as long as I can remember. When they announced the planning and premiere of the fifth series, I was very excited. <br /> <br /> The premiere of Enterprise was worth waiting for. It was well done with the perfect environment and a great working job by all the characters. The NX-01, Enterprise is the perfect vessel to show you how many people have come to love. <br /> <br /> Scott Bakula was better than Captain Jonathan Archer. Jolene Blalock instructed Subcommander T'Pol. That it's just two people from this wonderful new crew that we pick up right away in the great history of Star Fleet. <br /> <br /> The business looks like it's a good series worth watching, and I recommend that. Beware.
