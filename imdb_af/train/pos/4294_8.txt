There was no dry eye under the audience yesterday after I left the cinema. I saw this jewel of a movie in a chosen house as part of the Hamburg film festival of the year. And the tears spilled, everyone was laughing. This movie was hilarious, there is no other way to say it. There was not one boring bit in it, I laughed right through it and with me all three hundred lovers of French cinema. Alain Chabat was absolutely wonderful. A great clown if needed and serious if the situation requires it. Of course, the show was quite up, but it was exactly what the story needed and what made it so good. Equally big was Charlotte Gainsbourg, whom I love to see, and the mother was also a very strong show. The sisters could be a bit more detailed in character in writing, but in addition there is nothing to complain about. I saw a good afternoon while this film was in Hamburg, while I drowned outside in the rain and I wish movies like this from France would get a regular release in Germany. But the distributors of this country do not look as if the French are making good films. At least I can't wait to find a DVD that offers subtitles (Hello Australia? Please?), Because that movie I need at home to watch a few times!
