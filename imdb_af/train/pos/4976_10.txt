A distant cry of the dry black-and-white feed came so often on young scholars. The Capra movies would provide both live scripts and striking visuals in Technicolor. The four movies - our mr. SUN (1956), THE GREAT CASE OF THE COSMIC RAYS (1957), HEMO THE MAGNIFICENT (1957), THE UNDERGROUND GODDESS (1958) - quickly became school home favorites, where they were shown endlessly in 16mm format. <br /> <br /> The star of the series was dr. Frank C. Baxter (1896-1982), a proficient English professor at the University of Southern California. This devious pedagogy was the perfect film instructor, who sometimes gave the audience the sometimes complex facts in his way. It never made them look boring or boring.

Film star Richard Carlson appears as the Fiction writer, who dr. Baxter helps to tell the story of Hemo. <br /> <br /> Movie mavens will recognize Sterling Holloway as part of the TV production crew, and the voices of Marvin Miller, Mel Blanc, June Foray & Pinto Colvig as different cartoon characters, all unreasonable. <br /> <br /> The devotional scripture that the film starts is completely in line with the tenor and tone of production.
