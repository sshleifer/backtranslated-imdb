I found this movie to be very funny, I loved how it was made from the politics of contemporary sports. This movie isn't as funny as South Park, but it's pretty funny. And since I'm a sportswoman, I loved how they made fun of the more ridiculous things in sports. This movie is also ideal for non-sports fans, probably better for them, as they have to wonder about life and wonder why people are following sports, so close when there are so many crazy rules and developments for sport and the fact that it means absolutely nothing no. I also found that the real game they gained was interesting, it's like a horse with bases and psyche-outs (for the person who shoots). Overall I recommend you to watch this movie and believe you will love this movie. But if this style of comedy isn't your favorite, you probably won't like it. (but it's with any comedy movie)
