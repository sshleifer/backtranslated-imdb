The Bourne Ultimatum starts recklessly mid-chase and explodes it in pulsating fashion as Jason Bourne (Matt Damon, absolutely excellent) traces in the masterminds behind the CIA black jump that turned him into a final effort into the perfect killer. to learn his true identity. A devastating icy David Strathairn as the "man behind the curtain" is added to the return of regulars, including Joan Allen (excellent) and Julia Stiles (non-existent). <br /> <br /> Like the second entry in the series, I wanted Paul Greengrass to be a shaky hand camera at least for a few minutes of downtime. However, it is said to be a perfect way to capture the tense, claustrophobic feel of the intimate hand-to-hand combat screens and work equally well in the hunting scenes that are mostly on foot and over roofs, with the down and down then big cart-up. Part of the fun of the Bourne series is the constant world-hopping and manipulation of technology and communication that prevents the laws of physics and current abilities. The Bourne films seem to be in a kind of keen hyper-reality that is full of technology-based magic. It doesn't make sense that everyone is in the right place at the right time, but I will be condemned if it is not an explosion to see if they are there. <br /> <br /> With the absence of the emotional and Franka Potente involved, the writers are trying to create an emotional connection between Damon and Stiles, but she is so empty faced that an actress never really leads it to anything. Yet it can be forgiven. Unlike the "Identity" and the "Supreme", this "Ultimatum" reveals everything and ultimately teaches us the truth about Bourne's past. This is an entertaining and satisfying conclusion to the series, and if they have good sense, and Damon gets his wish, it will be the perfect end to it.
