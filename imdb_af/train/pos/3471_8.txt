Recently, on cable television, the movie is showing an indemnity questioning him from any real-life collaboration; It is in itself an eye catcher. Still, the script and acting of the main characters are excellent and I got through it all the time. Do not in any way pursue the sharp, thoughtful and interesting dialogue. The film will then be divorced in one day between two real musical legends that were compiled earlier. The film captures the essence of their lives and philosophies, in a story that gives an explanation for their initial "split". What is so impressive is that the actors give such seemingly realistic portrayals of the characters they play, bugs and everything, that this viewer has at least left to believe I was a real event in almost every detail. The great skill of this play is that with a spectacular writer and a movie can be a movie, basically two of us can make an excellent picture. Value of at least 8 out of 10.
