I got to know this one from the library, and was very pleasantly surprised. Very tight, expressionist camera work, an equally stiff script and two beautiful actors all make one fine piece of film. Not for the reptile multiplex brain, but rather the true aficionado of the theater. If Hollywood ever gets its grim hands on it, it's sure it'll ruin it. A choice covers all the way. Other posters here praised more than enough praise, so I don't have to duplicate their roads; just take their advice and mine, and don't miss this jewel. Call it what you want; I call it two hours of entertainment well spent. Read my lips: Don't miss it.
