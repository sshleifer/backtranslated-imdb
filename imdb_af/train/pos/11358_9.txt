The poor DVD video quality is the only reason I gave this movie a 9 instead of a 10. It could have been so much better, this movie deserves it. <br /> <br /> It's really a movie that has several themes at once. If you don't like movies about serial killers, but are fascinated by the astonishing bureaucratic culture in the former Soviet Union, this movie is a must-see anyway. <br /> <br /> I can't compare it to "Silence of the Lambs" for various reasons. The way the serial killer is portrayed is much better done in Citizen X. You see several details of his private life, because you travel with the killer, giving you an idea of ​​the source of his constant anger and sexual frustration. <br /> <br /> The only other movie I've seen is as realistic as this one was "Henry - a portrait of a serial killer". If you're fascinated by the movie, you should definitely have a look at Citizen X.
