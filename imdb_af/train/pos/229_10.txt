In today's world of digital manufacturing, there is no computer to replace the actor and writer. Unfortunately, this type of "character-driven" movie is too scarce these days. Duvall's performance as well as James Earl Jones are true to their audience's high expectations. I wonder if this movie was made for TV? It has a "close-up" personal quality for the narrative. It's an understatement to say that the performances are all Outstanding. The only thing it likes to be a cinema masterpiece is the lack of a big movie, but beautiful pictures are not all. How can talent such as Jones and Duvall continue to deliver such good work in an era in which actors sit for digitization?
