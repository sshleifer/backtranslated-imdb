If I saw Charley Boorman in Long Way Round with Ewan McGregor, I was very interested to see Charley appear in his own show. I thought Charley had come as a lovely man who was very ground and down to earth. It's great to see celebrities struggling with their weight and fitness, just showing their people! I don't know much about bicycles, but this show has gripped me from the beginning. The preparation and organization for this event looks great. The event itself looks very dangerous and I am fascinated to see why Charley and everyone else do it and how far he gets. I like the pace of the show and the fast music. I can't believe he broke his collar bone, I really hope it's not the end, I can't wait to see the next episode ...
