I haven't written a review on IMDb lately, but I forced myself to write it! When I looked up this movie, I found a specific review that urged people NOT to see this movie. Don't pay attention to this ignorant person! Nothing is a fantastic movie, full of laughter and above all ... imagination! Are you not sick and tired of getting power, are the same old cycle of bubble-gum trash movies being fed? Sometimes a movie comes along like NOTHING and gives you something you've never seen before. I don't even care if you don't want to hate the movie (even hate), but no one has the right to discredit the movie. IMDb has a monumental impact on reputations and no negative review should discredit the film. Just say you hate it and why you hate it ... but don't tell people they shouldn't see it. We have thoughts of our own and will thank our own thoughts. <br /> <br /> If my judgment is good, I would say that more people will enjoy this movie unlike those who hate it. <br /> <br /> Treat your mind with a little eyebrow! See nothing!
