This movie took a lot of stick. It was criticized by critics when it came out and was found guilty of destroying Nicolas Cage's career. The thing I don't think people get is that it's not meant to be an epic Oscar contender for a movie. It's just a brilliant Bruck buster action at its best. Fast cars, quick editing and a good soundtrack - it does exactly what it says. For everyone who likes cars, it's a pure deal. It has forgotten everything: Ferraris, Mercs, a Hummer and Eleanor! I think you will be hard pressed to find a better action movie, and personally, a better movie !! Then maybe it's just me!
