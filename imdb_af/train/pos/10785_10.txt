I saw it when I was little and it was excellent. Kelsey White as Lisa and the Meecy Mices where cute. Susan Bonde as Doodle and Sandra Dee Heidecke as Snoodle where Hilarius. Karen Boettcher-Tate as Prophet was interesting. Burl Ross as Little Bunny Foo Foo was funny. Gregory Donavon as Kaiso was brilliant. What is Hilarius that Snoodle and Doodle eat too much candy. What is sad is that Little Bunny Foo Foo who hits the Meecy Mice on the head with a fairy tale will give Little Bunny Foo Foo some wishes, then he gets into the throw. This story is about when Lisa, Snoodle, goes to Doodle to the Big Rock Candy Mountains. This show is excellent. The kids will keep this show, new words, songs and watch them play.
