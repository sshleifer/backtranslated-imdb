This is an excellent movie, and is the kind of treasure one can only catch through sporadic theater shows, as it is not available on video / DVD. The way the movie starts with the two lovers arriving and ending with their departure (although there is a lot between them and they don't stay in one place during this time) gives you a sense of closure and a feeling that everything is right with the world. If you get a chance to watch this movie, then. I can't wait to see it again, and wish it can be placed on a general edition.
