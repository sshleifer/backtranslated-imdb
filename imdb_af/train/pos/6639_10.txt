You use the IMDb. <br /> <br /> You've got some solid voices for some of your favorite movies. <br /> <br /> It's something you enjoy doing. <br /> <br /> And that's all because of this. Fifty seconds. One world ends, another begins. <br /> <br /> How can it not be given a ten? I wonder with those who give it a seven or eight ... exactly how can the FIRST FILM ever be done? For the record, the long, stationary shot is an excellent performance, an excellent innovation that is perfectly suited to the situation. And the dog on the bike is a beautiful touch. All this in fifty seconds. <br /> <br /> The word genius is often overused. <br /> <br /> THIS is genius.
