This is undoubtedly one of the funniest movies ever made. Amitabh as a farmer's pot, Arjun Singh, is hilarious. The best thing is that the laugh never stops. The plot is a centuries-old story where the child is divorced from mother who sacrifices everything for her duty - with a happy reunion at the end. There are villains (Ranjit) and there are brothers (Sashi Kapoor) and there are vixens (Parveen Babhi) and there are lovers (Smita Patil) and a blind brother and a grandfather thrown in well. But this movie is about Amitabh and it's all you remember to finish. <br /> <br /> Amitabh comes to the city to live a decent life and his dialogue and ways are hilarious. Later in the movie he became in the Angry Young Man where he was known, but remained humorous. Memorable parts include she walks, speaks and speaks English, the song (road gungaroo re bhand, meera nachi thi) and everything with his dadoo. <br /> <br /> All in all, I roll through the film. If you want 3 hours of entertainment with Amitabh at its best - that's it. This will easily give it a 10/10.
