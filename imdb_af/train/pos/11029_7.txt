I'm far from a Sylvester Stallone fan and I think the only time I really appreciated his appearance was in the French movie Taxi 3, which is an almost non-existent minor role. And yet I have to admit that this movie wasn't really that bad, though I fear the worst. <br /> <br /> When Gabe (Stallone) doesn't save a friend of one of his friends, she falls to her death. For almost a year he does not put food in the reserve, but when he returns. Shortly after returning, they received an emergency call from a group of hikers caught in a snowstorm. At least, that's what the rangers believe. In fact, it is a group of robbers who crashed with their plane in the mountains after their daring plan to steal cases full of money from a flying government aircraft failed. The cases are spread over the reserve and they need the help of professional climbers to recover them ... <br /> <br /> Of course, this is not one of the most intelligent movies ever, but in its genre it is " a pleasant one. I especially enjoyed John Lithgow as the evil master mind and leader of the gang of robbers. I know him best from the TV series "3rd Rock from the Sun", but I also enjoyed his performance in this movie. Overall, the acting is OK, it has lots of action and of course also one-liners, but it also offers a very nice decor. This movie is filmed in a wonderful natural environment. I loved the snowy mountains and valleys, the mountain rivers and the forests. Maybe that's why I give this movie a score higher than I normally give to an action / adventure movie. I give it a 6.5 / 10. If you don't expect too much, it's a nice movie.
