Goldeneye always goes off as one of your most legendary games in UK history. They are no doubt about it. But this game, though quite different, can be the contemporary Bond champion of his time. <br /> <br /> It was not a band game based on another medium. It was a completely new one; written game. What even had its own theme song! (It wouldn't be, haha!) The game was excellent, and if you're a fan of the band games or movies, you'll enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Unlike some / most games, these role-players are portraying their characters themselves, as opposed to fictional creations for the game. This gives it more kinematic feel. With a very concise story, you feel like you're in the game as much as you get lost in a movie. <br /> <br /> Enjoy in every way, from start to finish. Even after the match is over, there is much more to be done. With the ranking system and unlockables to achieve, as well as its multi-player missions, this is a knockout game. Despite being quite old, in video game years. It's still a great game you can pick up and play when you have the need to get a bit more Bond in your life. Even just thinking about it, I got the theme song in my head. Such a great movie and well-written story. <br /> <br /> The story comes to life on the screen, almost as if the actors were in front of you, and is just as entertaining as the game itself. Well done, in true band fashion. It can only be called Awesome, Completely Awesome. <br /> <br /> Now I have to throw this game. If you haven't played it yet, you miss out!
