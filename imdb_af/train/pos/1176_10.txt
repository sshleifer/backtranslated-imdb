First, let me say that I didn't have the fact that The Rock won the title so gay. Next, I feel that Regal had to get his European title, Jeff Hardy is a crappy champion. Rob Van Dam had the Intercontinental title too long, though Brock had to win it. I'm happy with Storm and Christian who are tag champs, the best match was the Booker T and Big Show game in my opinion.
