I believe they have told the truth all the time. You can't trust anything in nature ... Their family went through hell. These poor boys were too young to understand what was going on. But still dealing with the rumors. As well as dealing with the loss of their little sister. I can't believe this thing went so long. As the jury could not see the truth, even though it bit them on the ass. I feel for this family. And if I could let them know, I hate what happened. They want me. I have no idea what they went through, I can't even imagine. After watching this movie, I was in tears and had to look at my daughter in bed ... I think everyone should see it.
