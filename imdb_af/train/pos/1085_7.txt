This movie was a rather entertaining comedy about Murphy's law applied to home property and construction. If a movie like this is made today, the family will no doubt be dysfunctional. Being set in the 'simpler' forties, we get what is supposed to be a typical family of the era. Grant obviously combines the comic and dramatic elements perfectly and he works with a more than capable supporting role highlighted by Loy and Douglas. Their shenanigans make for a solid ninety minute entertainment, 7/10.
