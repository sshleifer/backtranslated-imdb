When I first read the plot of this drama, I assumed it was going to be like Sex and the City, but this drama is nothing like that. The stories the characters look more real and you empathize with the situations more. The concept of the drama is similar, celebrating something that leads women through friendships and relationships with problems and controversy along the way. Katie, the general practitioner, is a dark and breeding character that you find difficult to relate to and is best friends with Trudi a widow. Trudi's character is heart warming, as you can handle problems with her, which she is the only mother of the four. Jessica is the party girl, very single-minded and knows what she wants and how to get it. She is a peculiar character and is the closest to Siobhan's new bet, while loving her husband, can't help blowing her work colleague. Over all the drama is surprisingly addictive and if the BBC produces the series, it can do well. This is different from other female dramas such as sex and the city, or desperate housewives. Playing it right can be the next cold feet. Plus the male is also not bad.
