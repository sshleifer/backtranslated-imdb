Here is another beauty in the queue of beautiful films directed by Eytan Fox. The film presents the story of star-crossed lovers (one Israeli, one Palestinian) in modern Tel Aviv. The film's effectiveness comes not only from its portrayal of ethnic conflict, but also from conflicts that are personal and political within ethnic groups. For example, there is a talking moment when one of the secondary characters, openly gay, is visited in hospital by his boyfriend who brings him flowers and tries to kiss him in front of his visiting family and suddenly we see a wave of uncomfortable discomfort was coming through. the room. Obviously the young man is not as open as he seems, and the family is not as acceptable as he wants them to be, while the boyfriend is confused and rejected. A good complexity is packed in a flashy moment. As we know from Yossi & Jagger, Fox is a master to tackle emotional and psychological complexity effectively in short lines. The film is also effective for the one-day way it offers the mutual atrocities that Israel and Palestinians exert on each other. If you're not heartless, you'll cry through the last third of the movie. Although the plot is melodramatic, it is so intelligently written and acted that it reminds us of how satisfactorily good melodrama can be.
