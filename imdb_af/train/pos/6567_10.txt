Most people (36) gave this movie a 10 and those who were not too critical or might have expected something else. It's one of my favorite movies from the 80's, it grows on you and has everything. I just got it on DVD and 20 years later it didn't disappoint, with lots of action, drama, romance and even comedy. Add to that the great motor jackals, automatic gunshots and lots of things to blow up and you have a fun side of your chair experience!

And this is worth the price of a ticket.
