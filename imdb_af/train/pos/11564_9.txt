I've seen this movie many times and I like that all bad teachers want to give it ten out of ten, but feel that it would be unfair to other good movies. However, I think it is one of those rare jewels: a perfect comedy. It is I will dare to become one of the biggest cartoon films of all time. Matthau and Lemmon are perfectly matched and mismatched. The writing is so sharp that you have to understand the bleeding. The story is known and has already been described in other comments. The two leaders give extraordinary performances, the girls are wonderful and the situations are somehow funny. Not one swear word in sight (note that Hollywood, you don't have to dig to be funny, you have to be funny) and the move from stage to movie is seamless. They don't make it any more. Timeless.
