When I first saw the movie in the early 1970s, I was rid of this movie. Visually it was wonderful and the events on campuses in Europe and the USA made you hear about what Antonioni tried so visually in the last 15 minutes of the movie: the "tyrannical" institutions and big business interests emerging. The repeated blowing of the beautiful house in the middle of a desert, the main female character enjoying the natural stream of cold water, is a plane in psychedelic designs (even the solid British Airways did it a few years ago) Some of the images that have been copied by advertising staff all over the world for decades. Even Pink Floyd added their fan after the movie was released. <br /> <br /> You see this movie about 30 years later and you're wondering why the same movie lost its appeal. Today, anti-settling films have more dust - facts, documentation, fine performances, and excellent screens. Antonioni seems to be outdated; a defective genius. Even if you see Antonioni's "Blow Up" today, you give the same feeling that he is over. <br /> <br /> "Zabriski Point" should be evaluated for what it was when released. It was a great movie if you saw it on a wide Panavision screen, as opposed to the dwarf TV screens. The visual and obedient (Mick Jagger, Kieth Richards, Pink Floyd, et al.). The main couple were not good actors, but they were cute and of course. One of them (Mark Frechette) went to prison in the US and prolonged the reality of the non-conforming values ​​he embodied in the film. <br /> <br /> Today, Antonioni looks like "sync". But look carefully and you'll hear the muted sounds of the regular actors - Rod Taylor, G.D. Spradling, the ladies at the pool, the police at the airline appreciated. The actual sounds in contrast come from the non-conformists. Antonioni was relevant 30 years ago but his understanding of the medium cannot be questioned today. He knew what he had done.
