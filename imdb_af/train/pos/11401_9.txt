An American in Paris was in many ways the ultimate mix of art and Hollywood music. Made up of MGM's powers as a musical power station, the movie features memorable Gershwins music, rightly called the 20th Century equivalent of Beethoven and Mozart. <br /> <br /> Gene Kelly was also aware of his powers in this movie, but it can rightly be argued that this movie was just warming up for his best work in Singin 'in the Rain (1952). . The two movies are actually linked now. Apart from the Arthur Freed connection, the Broadway Melody segment in "Rain" is owed to the incredible American Paris Ballet series in this movie. It may be the only time a dance number is specifically mentioned in the opening credits of the movie. And it deserves to be because it shows Gene Kelly's dancer and choreographer skills to their fullest. <br /> <br /> The film's cast is uniformly excellent. Leslie Caron, who makes her movie debut incredibly, shows a maturity that makes you think she's been making movies for years. Her introductory dance series, and later her work on the Ballet, offers some surprisingly sexy moments that are featured in MGM Musicals, just by Cyd Charisse's work in Singin 'in the Rain and the Bandwagon. Oscar Levant is hilarious like Kelly's stoic guy, who gets two of the movie's best moments: during the final party series (which I won't give to anyone who hasn't seen the movie) and one of the movie's most memorable musical numbers honoring his amazing piano skills with the latest (for time) special effects. <br /> <br /> Less memorable is Georges Guetary as Kelly's romantic contender, though he gets some musical highlights, and Nina Foch as Leslie Caron's romantic contender. The May-December relationship between Kelly's character and Nina's reminded me of the same "love man" relationship seen between George Peppard and Patricia Neal in Breakfast at Tiffany's. <br /> <br /> There are some elements of the movie that made it less satisfying for me than Singin 'in the Rain. The Ballet, though exaggerated and well-produced, doesn't really fit the rest of the movie. Without giving away the plot, the Ballet just happens, with no real rhyme or reason. And unlike the Broadway Melody series, it really has nothing to do with the plot - and in the best musicals the songs always have a kind of raison d'etre. <br /> <br /> To make matters worse, is the end of the movie that happens immediately after the Ballet. Although the end would not be a surprise (it's an MGM musical, after all), I was hoping for a little more ... movie after the ballet ended. It's like director Vincente Minnelli felt he couldn't follow the Ballet with anything else. The film literally left me down. <br /> <br /> The negative side, an American in Paris, is right next to the best of Hollywood's musicals. It doesn't reach the height of Singin 'in the Rain, but it comes closer and proves Gene Gene's skills as one of the best dancers of all time.
