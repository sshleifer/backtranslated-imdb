In another one of Bugs Bunny's stupid shorts, the well-known leprosy * works in a mall's showcase, when owner Gildersleeve decides to fuck him. Of course, this seems impossible, as Bugs apparently knows the store better than Gildersleeve (and knows when to dress). As always, they keep everything at the highest speed, and so you have to wonder how hilarious this cartoon should have been when it first debuted! Among other things, "Hare Conditioned" is a good example of how the Looney Tunes watched in the 40's before the Termite Terrace crowd polished them. But don't get me wrong, the cartoons were still very good after the refined forms arrived. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's a great thing. <br /> <br /> * Leopards are rabbits and rabbits.
