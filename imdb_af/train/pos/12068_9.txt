If you appreciate any character and dialogue, and any sense of American cultural history, you get a lot of absorbent material in this movie. It was probably originally a play, which is why it is a dialogue difficult, but I cannot stress enough how these icons that we just understood a level are made in truly complex and wonderful characters. <br /> <br /> This movie is better than any college course to tell you how to create a character-driven story. <br /> <br />
