Enjoy the movie a lot. Surely the audience will want to know more, and there is really much more to find out about! <br /> <br /> Has the production team been tempted by dramatization, especially from the shooting event? There is a ton of interesting, accurate material being suggested? Prince Albert's contribution to the United Kingdom and the monarchy justify a movie on its own, but has granted it. This was apparently not part of the intention here. <br /> <br /> The costumes and sets are especially good, but I am only in the opinion that this production (which was by the end of the titles was definitely not a cheap one) wanted bad for a British court historical label expert outside the Duchess of York? ie, Princess Victoria Victoria really packed a whole truffle / rissole (?) into her mouth while talking to the prime minister in the company of His Majesty with her mouth full? <br /> <br /> "It could never really have been so sympathetic to Victoriain this movie, or even in her shoes. Yet, the rulers of the principals loved, whose play was convincing, so did the writing really get to know us well? I always felt like a totally detached, uninformed outside observer, much more so with "Mrs. Brown" or even "The Queen". Still, to be honest, I couldn't take my eyes off the screen, except for some of the more avant-garde camera techniques that were distracting from time to time.
