The problem with the 1985 version of this movie is simple; Indiana Jones was so modeled after Alan Quartermain (or at least an Alan Quartermain TYPE character), that the '85 director made the mistake of plundering the IJ movies for dialogue and story too. What you got as a final product was a whacked mess of the name Alan Quartermain, in an uneven hodge podge of a cheap implied IJ saga (with a touch of Austin Powers-esquire cheese here and there). <br /> <br /> It was marked by many critics as a "big parody" or "unintentional comedy." Unconscious is the word. This movie was never meant to be humorous; Sharp, yes, but not humorous. Unfortunately, it is incomprehensible rather than spectacular. <br /> <br /> With this new M4TV mini series, you get much more story, headline character development, solid portrayals, and a fine, even entertaining blend. This story is a bit long; much longer than its predecessors, but deserving, as this version carries a real story and not just action and Eye Candy. While it contains both action and Eye Candy, it also improves the bug created in the 1985 version, by forgetting everyone to go back to the source material for AQ, which makes a fine, well thought out plot and a few good complement sub-plots. <br /> <br /> Now, this effort is not the all-out action extravaganza that Indiana Jones is. It's not a bad attempt to be like that either. This vehicle is plot and character driven and is a beautiful version of the AQ / KSM saga. Filmed on the spot in South Africa, the audience becomes beautiful (as abandoned) views, SA native cultures, and some beautiful wildlife material to blend the performances and storyline right. <br /> <br /> Steve Boyum totally surprised me. with this one, as I have never been to endorse his vision. In fact, I rejected most of his work as a director, to this end. I hope this is more a new level of talent and less the flies it seems to be. <br /> <br /> This version is 9.8 / 10 on the "TV" scale of ... <br /> <br /> The Enemy :.
