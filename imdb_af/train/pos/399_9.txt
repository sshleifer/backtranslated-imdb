This movie is very cool. If you are a fan of Tsui Hark and Chinese fantasy movies, you should love it. This film is the Asian Lord of the Rings: A high fantasy story, based in real Chinese mythology. (I realize many critics mentioned this movie plot-less, I think they probably have no knowledge of Chinese mythology.) If you chose Stormriders or Warriors or Heaven & Earth, this one should be upright. This movie is still very hard to find in the US, although it was bought for US distribution, along with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Iron Monkey. Worth it! This DVD is also worthy of possession.
