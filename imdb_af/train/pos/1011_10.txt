I love Jack's jokes like "The cliché is ..." or "About the top cliché old, black, oily skin, a little spooky ...". He's just hilarious! Daniel is catching up with him! Good thing Jack is no longer on the team, otherwise it would be sarcasm mania. I just love all the plots (season 8, a little less, I have to admit), the characters are great, the actors are great, I start to pick up facial expressions (and more) from Jack, Daniel and Teal'c ... It is only theoretically possible and exciting ... oops! I'm going again !!! Sorry, I also start to add features from Carter, and all this makes my parents NUTZ !!!!!!! Well, to decide, I think it's good for another three seasons or so, especially if they continue the episodes with all this humor, drama, action and so on !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !
