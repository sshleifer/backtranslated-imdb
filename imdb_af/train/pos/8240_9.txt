I was also on hand for the Toronto premiere. This movie was kind of comfort when I thought I wouldn't be able to go in to see my first choice. Well, I was completely blown away. By the time I got to the theater, I could remember little other than the basic plot of the movie (yes, I actually forgot who even was in it.) Great performances of the whole role. Carrie-Anne Moss was great in a true departure from her days as the Trinity. As for Billy Connolly, I don't think since Chaplin played an actor so brilliantly with no-lines-so-ever. The kids were also wonderful. Definitely this one if you get the chance. <br /> <br /> And by the way, I got my first choice anyway - and it was better.
