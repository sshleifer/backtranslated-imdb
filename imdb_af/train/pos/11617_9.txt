The premise is simple. These movies look like your average lame chick flick about two attractive young people meeting at an airport, then taking a 180-degree turn ... <br /> <br /> I for one, really like that sensible annoying love story news that pollutes the average cinema. And it is my humble opinion that Wes Craven, based on his previous meta-horror films (Sceam) also ... <br /> <br /> Following this logic, it is not surprising to find that Craven sardonically take up a nauseatingly sweet sepeipity love story, just to make an AWESOME Cillian Murphy wreck that covers the entire sugar-covered dream world ... <br /> <br /> The scope of his character Jackson Ripner (Jack the Ripper , get it? Lame, right?) In this movie, it's going to be quite charming as a twisted nihilistic sicko, which is a plus in my book. As he continues to see his victim (Jennifer Garner Lookalike Rachel McAdams, who I found disappointingly on the road), you can't help sympathizing with the guy. <br /> <br /> It is Wes Craven, embodied in Jackson Ripner, by Cillian Murphy, who bashes all mindless chicks ... <br /> <br /> Mr. Craven, I salute you. <br /> <br /> Best Quote: <br /> <br /> Jackson Ripner (after hitting the snot from Rachel McAdams in the airplane toilet): "Thanks for the fast!"
