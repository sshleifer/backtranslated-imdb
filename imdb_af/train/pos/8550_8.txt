Now I love American Pie 1 and 2, while 3 big was just for Seann William Scott's performance as Stifler, but then the quality dropped. Band Camp kept the standard pretty high with characters you really cared about, but Naked Mile was the same joke and plot lines that are being recycled. (Erik Stifler's sex problem is like Jim's). It had some entertaining moments like the soccer match against the midgets and the "penalty" of Coozeman, but overall it didn't have originality and the "Mile" was just stupid and moronous. Not to mention the annoying girlfriend who doesn't want sex. <br /> <br /> Anyway enough about the Naked Mile. I saw Beta House with fear because I thought it could take the series to a new layer, but I was pleasantly surprised. To be honest there is no real plot, but it's full of hot girls (Ashley is incredible) and sex is very evil. Yes, it's formula and the jokes are old, but Dwight Stifler (Steve Talley) raises the bar with an exciting show. The Greek Olympiad especially enjoys the penultimate and final events while Christopher McDonald's cameo is hilarious. However, there are weak points. Coozeman is as annoying as he was in the first place, I'm still surprised how he ever participated. <br /> <br /> While Coozeman is bad, Erik Stifler is worse. John White had a painful look at Naked Mile, but at Beta House he took his performance to a whole new low. In the first place he lacks charisma, a prerequisite of Stifler. You really can't care about him anymore. The only reason I was concerned about his relationship was that Ashley could be on the screen! She shines above him and the rest of the role. Seriously, John White is the best in bad acting and has about as much charisma as a dead fish. <br /> <br /> Say the movie is entertaining and Coozeman's fear that his girlfriend isn't exactly a girl is gorgeous. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is worth renting, getting some of your friends in and having a laugh at the brand new event and provoking your anger at Erik 'loser' Stifler .
