I'm not aware of "Largo Winch" as a cartoon (or is it a graphic novel? I really don't know), but I have to admit that I hear an agent / hero movie, I expected something different, than what I actually got. <br /> <br /> While it was beginning to see it, it was nice to watch this move. You can never really know where it is going (some turns are predictable, but you can never really tell where it's going). An over star performance of the main actor and a very good support cast makes it a pleasant watch. Not packed as action as some may hope or expect for a movie like this, but a very good mix.
