It is a true character and story-driven drama on a level that is most shameful of what we see on TV with the mother. <br /> <br /> I was impressed from the beginning. Don't be put off if you're not a scientist (like me ...) It can happen on earth, the fact that it makes the shoulder more interesting in another galaxy. There are no space ships or rifles (not yet anyway) so far I've seen s01 e04 and I'm trapped and wondering what's going to happen next because there are so many possibilities. <br /> <br /> The cast plays roles with passion. Eric stoltz is especially strong. <br /> <br /> This show is really good, no matter if you watched SCG or not, in fact it is very different. I have read some negative reviews from scientists who have less drama and more strangers and jet guns, etc. Expected, but I will ignore it. <br /> <br /> It's a very positive start to a show. Let's hope they can't do it after 1 or 2 seasons, as they normally do with good performances.
