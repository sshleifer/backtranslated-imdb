Question: How do you steal a drama of expert playwright Walther Mathau in full, furious and brilliant Grumpy Old Man fashion? Answer: Quiet, deadly and with perfect timing as George Burns does here. <br /> <br /> I don't know anything about Vaudeville, but it remains a favorite movie, the two guides are hilarious, the writing is funny, the direction and pacing very fine. Richard Benjamin is very funny as a straight man - trying to get to Burns through the window. Even the small parts are wonderful. <br /> <br /> There are so many funny scenes, Mathau breaks the commercial, Burns repeats his Answers as if senile ... <br /> <br /> A pleasure. <br /> <br /> Enterrrrrr!
