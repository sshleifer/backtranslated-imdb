"Yes, Georgio" is a light-hearted and enjoyable movie / comedy that features beautiful settings and beautiful music. It's not my favorite movie, but it's a movie I enjoyed more than once. Some reviewers suggested if one wanted to enjoy Pavarotti, they would probably be better served by picking up an opera DVD. Although a complete opera can be a better representation of Pavarotti's operational talents, an opera often requires costumes and has story lines that completely obscure the appearance and nature of the person. "Yes, Georgio" allows Pavarotti to use his speaking voice and point out a personality and character in a way that an opera would not be. <br /> <br /> Many reviewers have seen the story incredible; I do not agree. Huge talented people can be both self-centered and charming - enough to enchant intelligent and beautiful people. In addition, people who are very different from each other often get insight into themselves and grow positively from interacting with people they stretch or taking in commands they have not chosen on their own. Both Georgio and Pamela become more open to untapped parts of themselves in relation to the other. <br /> <br /> Relax and leave yourself in a visual and aurally rewarding movie featuring Pavarotti at the height of his vocal abilities. The end scenes of Puccini's Turandot alone are worth getting there.
