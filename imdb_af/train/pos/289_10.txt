I love all the movies by Michael Landon Jr. And Michael Landon Jr's decision by Dale Midkiff as "Clark Davis" couldn't have been better. Dale Midkiff has the ways to draw this character. <br /> <br /> This movie hit me from scratch. <br /> <br /> The death of Mission & Willies baby girl with Clarks timing was just God's timing. How they dealt with death and how Clark helped them was a father's love. <br /> <br /> Although there are 3 movies for this one, [Love Comes Softly, Loves Enduring Promise & Loves Long Journey], I feel you can see this movie and easily understand it. But leave and want to see the previous 3 movies because of the history that all the characters have behind them. <br /> <br /> Michael Landon Jr. is an excellent director <br /> <br /> I look forward to many more movies from him in the future.
