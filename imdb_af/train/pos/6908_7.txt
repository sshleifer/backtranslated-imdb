Richard Dreyfuss stars in the "Moon Over Parador", a 1988 Paul Mazursky film which also starred Raul Julia, Sonia Braga, Jonathan Winters and Charo. Dreyfuss plays a New York actor, Jonathan Nolan, in the Caribbean country of Parador to make a movie. When the dictator suddenly dies, the secret police chief (Julia) is the one who actually controls the dictator and the country. Jonathan sets up the dictator and plays the similarities between them. Soon Jonathan will be informed in the palace like Alphonse Simms and Simms prostitute friend Madonna (Braga). He realizes the switch promises to help him in any way she can. <br /> <br /> Mazursky, who appears in drag as Simms mom, gives us a glimpse of how the CIA works in third world countries. The Winters character, presumably a salesman, is actually a CIA operation. The movie thrives but doesn't really touch a very serious ground level and is more of a upload and a funny one. <br /> <br /> Richard Dreyfuss does a fantastic job as Jonathan the actor and Alphonse the dictator, creating two separate characters and nail both. The beautiful Sonia Braga is wonderful like Madonna, and Raul Julia handles an evil funny show like Strausmann, the man behind the dictator. It is one of those actions that you never quite know what the character thinks - he can be happy or become a psychologist at any time. Charo is on hand as a girl and also manages to be funny and unobtrusive at the same time. <br /> <br /> A very good movie, not a big blocker, but very entertaining.
