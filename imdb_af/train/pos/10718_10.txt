Spacecamp is my favorite movie. It's a wonderful story and inspires others. <br /> <br /> The acting was excellent and my wife and I later saw Lea Thompson in Cabaret because of her performance in the movie. It is a pity that the Challenger Accident delayed and hurt the film. <br /> <br /> The 20th anniversary of the Challenger Accident occurs. Since childhood, I knew on the Carnegie Mellon campus, one of the Challenger astronauts, where my dad went to school; I also know a good friend of the late pilot. <br /> <br /> Last year I was technical review for the National BSA for the Boy Scout Astronomy Merit Badge and I still find Spacecamp a great movie to recommend to the Scouts. Space-related merit badges I learn. <br /> <br /> I ran again as an adult in the late astronaut and follow a schedule of engineering training we compiled when Challenger inflated. I wound up to deal with Willard Rockwell and his engineers, "invisible", followed by the accident at the Astrotech shareholders meeting, followed by the accident. So I am much closer to the Accident and any similar movie. I made sure that I was a good student and completed the degree four years later on the recommendation of the Rockwell engineer. He said they should not fly Challenger in 1986 and later built Endeavor.
