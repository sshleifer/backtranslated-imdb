*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Packed with unforgettable moments (like the quotation above, immortal by Primus), Deliverance tells the story of four guys taking a trip to the wild forests with rafting and get off the big city for a while to see that their fun soon gets a bad turn. It's not a Hollywood movie. There are virtually no special effects, the setting is extremely realistic and nothing is sugar-coated or beautiful. The city boys look like city boys, and even the tough old Louis, who is accurately portrayed by Burt Reynolds, is clear about the grace of the game on this journey. It's a perfect example of what-if-movie. What if a few friends in an area of ​​the forest who were in the forest did rafting without being familiar and trying to prevent them from being tried and found guilty of murder that they had to be forced to save their own lives? <Br /> <br /> There is clearly a very strong element of the film dealing with community and class structure and the relationship (or lack thereof) between rural and urban peoples. When the four guys arrive in the forest early in the film, they clearly do not know how to talk to the people out there, and they talk to them as if they are not sure whether they will understand or can communicate no. This communication block is illustrated most memorably in the scene of banners, trying to pick up the car and truck and get someone to drive the vehicles for them. While Drew and the naturally innate and probably mentally deficient boy on the veranda with their guitar and banjo duel (one of the best scenes in the film), Louis is worth buying the gas, and Bobby comments on genetic deficiencies and how pathetic it is all. When Drew's son turned away, offering to shake his hand after the bad confectionery session, Bobby told him to give the child a few bucks, because no one knows how to react. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of thing we see in Liberation that puts so much of the tension that follows. This wonderful scene where lots of fun (including the funniest 'redneck dance scene to O Brother, where art you?) Is uncomfortable with everyone about what to do. These people are apples and oranges, and they live by completely different rules of life. The people who met Louis, Bobby, Drew and Ed in the hills, separated from modern society and modern laws, and live by the natural rules that do not include, you should not kill. Confused by their awkward behavior, the four friends walked out on the river, hoping that the aliens will end and start the adventure. <br /> <br /> (spoilers) When they are briefly separated and Ed and Bobby run in the hills along the river that quickly become unpleasant, the uncertainty about how these people live - set up by the scene above is - playing the most stress during the scene. I think a good sign of a quality player like this is that the tragic element of the movie, namely the attacks and the actual murders, takes up a very small screen time, but remains some of the most memorable parts of the movie . There is no outrageous violence here, it's all there for an obvious purpose and it achieves a tremendous power. <br /> <br /> The move is about the violent clash of two very different kinds of people and what can happen when they accidentally find themselves at war with each other. The journey to the rest of the river after the assault, which captures the majority of the film, delivers a spectacularly effective tension, keeping you on the edge of your seat while not attacking so much that you are numb. It is surprisingly effective when we find out that Ed could kill the very wrong man there on the cliff, and the tension in the movie cannot even go up when the three surviving members of the team reach the bottom of the river because they gives a dubious statement to the police about what happened on the river and why the deputy's son-in-law is missing. <br /> <br /> It's a very disturbing movie, proving his success, because it's pretty clear that a movie like this is meant to shake people a bit. The hillbillies are the human (ie more realistic) version of the sub-human rednecks seen in childlike but fairly similar films such as Gator Bait and Gator Bait 2. None of them can ever be compared to a timeless movie like Deliverance. When we follow these four men through their fateful weekend in the woods, the natural element is so realistic and we teach the men as well and in such a subtle way that it almost like us as individuals of the audience really a fifth member of the team. It's not often that a movie can come across the road.
