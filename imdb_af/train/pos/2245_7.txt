Salva and his couple Bigardo are on the side of the law in most of their lives. We see their pan action in a car of the underground, where their place to get donations is so lame, nobody gives them anything! Salva, who is a hardened little criminal, doesn't even have a redeeming feature, that is, until he discovers a reality program on television that gives him the idea of ​​what to do next. Religion and show business seem to be a winning combination, something that Salva capitalizes on. <br /> <br /> He and Bigardo were in jail after the accidental death of a priest criticizing the duo. Salva shows he is natural to the reality program. He transforms himself into a Christian figure that is an immediate success in the program. Espe, who is a bunch of women who is a show producer, cannot escape the way Salva pays her unusual attention. Eventually, Salva is ultimately the victim of his own success. <br /> <br /> Jordi Molla, whose first legal work is this film, has had some success in the way the film fulfills the role of television. Spain, which was vulnerable to these types of programs, saw its part of the bizarre. This is what the director felt, was an attack on the public and wanted to tell his story from the point of view of the people who were lucky in the naive. <br /> <br /> The ensemble cast has some good moments in the movie. Mr. Molla, like any actor who decides to direct his first feature, would have been more effective focusing on the photo in front of the camera. Good actress Candela Pena is one of the best reasons to watch the movie. Juan Carlos Villedo, David Gimenez Cacho, Franco Francescoantonio, Florinda Chico and the rest responded well to the new director.
