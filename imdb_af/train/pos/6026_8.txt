This film has a powerful philosophical end. But the end just makes sense if you watch the movie from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Youth alienation in the late 1960s, from the point of view of a young man and a young woman, is the obvious theme of Zabriskie Point ". No one Mark Frechette or Daria Halprin has much acting experience, a fact that really enhances the message of the film. Wearing untrained actors brings a sense of realism, as both players are emotionally detached from the unrest around them. <br /> <br /> This is Not a rotating movie, except for the first ten minutes, it is mostly visual, with beautiful cinematography, and the beautiful naturalistic images look different and perfectly in line with the emotional debauchery of Mark and Daria. <br /> <br /> I would have replaced the theme-poor Pink Floyd music with the more thorough music of The Doors, many scenes calling for "Riders On The Storm. <br /> <br /> So, I like this movie. It's different, it's unique, it's artistic and imaginative, and the desert bathlands are p ragtig. <br /> <br /> As the years are over, Zabriskie Point still looks more attractive. It carries the mood of the late 1960s in America. It is surprisingly artistic, in a bohemian way. And the last eight minutes of the film are philosophically fascinating.
