{Possible spoilers come on ... you've been warned.} <br /> <br /> It's absolutely one of my all-time favorite music and movies! (The other is Damn Yankees with Gwen Verdon, Tab Hunter and Ray Walston). As we all know, the glare (not to mention the songs) of a show is lost in the transition from the scene to the screen. For the most part, this is definitely not the case here. <br /> <br /> The sets are divine, bright and colorful, the characters are bigger than life and you can't help but love them, and Michael Kidd's choreography is absolutely stunning. (So ​​glad to know they used the original Broadway choreographer) <br /> <br /> All the actors "reflect the ball" (it's insatiable chemistry) perfect in this movie. Frank and Marlon are absolutely credible as the owner of the oldest established permanent swinging game in New York, and the most notorious player to enter even the smallest things - as his fever goes up to 104 if he doesn't take penicillin. Sweet, fresh face Jean Simmons is perfect for Sarah's role (though true, her singing pipes aren't as outstanding as those of Isabel Bigley or Josie de Guzman) - the mop with a heart of gold and a ride to heal everything. And last but not the least (on my list anyway) is Miss Vivian Blaine, depicting her Broadway role as Mrs Adelaide - the Hot Box lead singer and dancer who eventually married her 14-year-old fiancé with Nathan wanting to stop herself from the psychosomatic colds he gave her. <br /> <br /> First, kudos to Stubby Kaye and BS Pulley as they roll their Broadway roles like Nicely-Nicely Johnson and Benny Southstreet. There have never been two more sweet players than those guys. <br /> <br /> Brando is great, as usual, and although he doesn't have the voice of Robert Alda or Peter Gallagher, you forget it - because he has this sense of determination for everything he can to his role. Bring Sky Masterson. 'Luck be a lady' gives me chills every time I see him perform the number. Especially pleasant to hear him say, "Daddy, I have cake in my ear." <br /> <br /> Simmons is charming and enjoyable in a role suited to her look, voice and the way she carries her. You long for her not only to win Sky (or, at the end, believe him), but to help people overcome their gambling, drinking and other sins and living a life with God. Her version of "If I was a Bell" is great to say the least! Sinatra is the man. He is so perfect for the role of Nathan Detroit - and here he sings parts that Sam Levene of the Broadway cast could never do (awesome actor, but the boyfriend was pounding ... going figure). I really enjoyed adding the song "Adelaide" ... wish someone would sing to ME. Frankie's cool, smooth performance spans the boundaries of this movie. But most importantly, you must marry Adelaide. <br /> <br /> And if you talk about Adelaide, Vivian Blaine is just perfect in this role. From the emphasis on her "Adelaide's Lament" she is just fantastic. And she is also my favorite part of the whole movie. She really makes you Adelaide ... especially when she's crying right before and then "Sue Me" again. I have not yet decided whether I want "Pet Me Poppa" better than "Bushel and a Peck". Maybe I like them too. Either way, she does fantastic with that as well as "Take Back Your Mink." (I'm sad that they left the hollanderize movie out.) She's absolutely wonderful, not to mention hilarious, and my favorite part of the whole movie. <br /> <br /> One of the best things about this movie is their lingo. It is a mixture of high class and street snake. They never use "It is", "I will" or "It's." It's always "It's", "I'll" and "It's." Overall, Guys & Dolls is one of my favorite all time movies and musicals, and this is one you need to take time to watch every time it comes. My only complaint? No, "Marry The Man Today." Now it's a good song.
