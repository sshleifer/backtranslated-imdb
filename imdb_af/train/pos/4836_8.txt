I watched the movie a few days back on a videotape and although it was difficult to devour it at once (due to its length and story), I liked it very much. I was first impressed by the writing and then by the realization of this scripture. The movie takes you on a ride, but it's not an easy, joyous ride; It goes through time and different political regimes and shows its influence on ordinary people's lives. What I loved was the inner logic that followed the film; Logic, which was just like logic in life, was rather illogical and confusing at times, but in the end, when I thought about it, all the events and twists made sense. However, it is not wise to tell the story again because it spreads over more than 50 years. I also liked many of Nikita Mikhalkov's character Aleksei and the way he played it, as some critics have seen, with disturbing abandonment. What I didn't like was that I later played characters reminding me of Alexei in films like "Cruel Romance" (which I actually love) and to some extent in "The Insulted and the Injured" ( "Unizhennye i oskorblyonnye"). "Sibiriada" shows, I think, who was a great filmmaker Andrei Konchalovski before going to Hollywood and making forgetful movies like "Tango and Cash" and less forgotten like "Runaway train". I prefer "Kurochka Ryaba" to them ...
