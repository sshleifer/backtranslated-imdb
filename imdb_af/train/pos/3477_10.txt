some think the second series was where scooby was destroyed. I totally disagree. The display quality has not gone up and down and scrappy, wins my opinion, as a very good chrecter. I watched a poll on jumpedtheshark.com and 72% of people said scrappys' second series was scoobys downfall. OK, so many said yes, but 28% still can't be wrong. I like the way most episodes focused on comedy. I believe the show would have gone rubbish if it riddled the same 5 people / dog solution in the same formula. Scrappy was a fresh air after the show.sure, some people agreed, but when Scrappy was set up, look-figures DUBBEL looked back. All the episodes and segments were very funny. . I was in the hands of the yabba shorts and. But at the end of the day it is a matter of opinion if you like scrappy or not, there is a matter of opinion. There is definitely no fact. But in my opinion, it was an excellent series that started to draw, showing a new formula and lease of life. Nuff said.
