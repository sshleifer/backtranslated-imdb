This is a fantastic movie! I've played the Nancy Drew games and read the books, and I never expected the movie to be so exciting and funny! If you've never heard of Nancy Drew, read the first book (Secret of the Old Clock) so you can get used to Nancy, then you can see the movie because in the movie they don't really represent the characters call fast. ;) My whole family enjoyed it and the plot was very interesting. This is an eventual return from the previous Nancy Drew movies, which the Nancy Drew actor does not look like. This movie is much like Alex Rider: Stormbreaker. It's so cool! Nancy Drew lovers, you have to watch it!
