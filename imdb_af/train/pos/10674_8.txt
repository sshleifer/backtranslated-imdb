I disagree with one of the reviewers who compared this movie to American International Photos. Basil Deardon directed a brutal realistic film with an honest attempt to portray the rise of juvenile delinquency in post-war England (but without the Blackboard Jungle sentimentality). The cinematography was excellent as it really caught the scarcity and isolation of the large housing complex. The estate looked like an old jail. Stanley Baker was excellent as the hardened detective, assigned to the youth section - "Urgent, Urgent - Larceny - Five Ice Lollipops" !!!! He thinks he's the buttocks of many jokes. David McCallum showed he was one of Britain's top young fifties talents. (He had a very different role in another Stanley Baker movie "Hell Drivers"). His portrayal of Johnny and the fanatic following he inspired was very frightening. Ann Heywood was also very good like the cynical Cathie. I wouldn't say there was a romantic subplot in it. <br /> <br /> Detective Jack Truman investigates a series of arson attacks by someone called the "Firefly". Just as he finds evidence that can lead to a breakthrough, he is assigned to the youth department. He was very scared of what he didn't feel was proper police work. In the midst of all the heckling he gets his first call - the 6-year-old Murphy twins work a scam at local lollipops! <br /> <br /> With the twin home he meets their brother, the charismatic Johnny, and their bitter sister Cathie. He began to appreciate how life on the terrible housing offices can change young children into criminals. As he becomes more involved with the family, he realizes that there is a strong connection between the fires, Johnny and a scared Chinese youth working for a laundry. The local priest (Peter Cushing in an unusual role, away from the Hammer horrors) explains that when Johnny was younger, some saved some of a burning building and a hero was enveloped. He wanted to relive the sense of importance and be useful and feel he could burn by fire. The school siege was filmed in a very real way and the viewer felt the children's fear - the teacher (think only of her own safety) walked off and locked them in the room with the scared gun !!! <br /> <br /> I thought it was a very good movie trying to show some of the social problems that Britain experienced after the war. <br /> <br /> Highly Recommended.
