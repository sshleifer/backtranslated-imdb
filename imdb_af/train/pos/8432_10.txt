I didn't read anything about the movie until I looked at it on Saturday night. And when I saw it, I felt the misery of Lena and Boesman in my legs. I was so captivated by the acting and the tone and the filming that I only listened to the dialogues. My husband fell asleep shortly after we went to bed and I was sleepless under the film's impact. I wanted to wake him up just to say, "If I ever voted for an Oscar nomination, it would be for these two actors." I decided to wait until the next day. Then I read more about the movie on IMDb and was sad to hear that Mr. Berry died before the release of the film and he probably never saw the last version of his brilliant masterpiece. I still want to tell him that my film is a truly independent film, in its concept and spirit. The actors should not only be praised for their brilliant performance, but also to accept a part without shining, and it is not clear, and indeed the true image of human depression. Sad but gripping.
