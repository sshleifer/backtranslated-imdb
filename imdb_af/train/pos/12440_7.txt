Review: It's business as usual at Louche's casino in Tangier. The casino will be close and ready the next day for a big deal. Mr Louche and some staff members leave for the night, with modesty in control. Suddenly, a group of armed gangsters are pushing the casino and shooting game. Unknown to modesty, they have already killed Louche and are now looking for the money hidden in the safe. But no one present, and still alive, at the casino knows the code to open the safe. The safe itself is heavy booby caught with explosives, so the attackers can't blow the door as planned. Suddenly, modesty finds its eye on the gangster leader Miklos in a game of roulette with their lives in danger. <br /> <br /> Comment: This is a review that has been written without any connection to any other published media about Modesty Blaise, as I have not seen or read it. The first point I would like to make is that it is slightly classified. For the first time I thought it was a thrill with a battle of mind between Modesty and Miklos as the main plot. Sure, there are a few actions, but it's not really an integral or important part of the story. <br /> <br /> As mentioned, the game is between Modesty and Miklos. It's an innovative and intriguing way to reveal the backdrop of a character, and so much of the story takes place much earlier than the casino. Someone said it was almost like a pilot for a TV series, and the feeling was that it could be used as such. But I felt it was a much better way to represent a character than many others did. I was by no means disappointed by the lack of action, but I enjoyed this game, history much more than a simple action movie. <br /> <br /> I think the two main stars, Alexandra Staden and Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau did very well. Staden shows particular modesty very well and carries this self-confidence and talented character. <br /> <br /> 7/10
