Christopher Lloyd is funny and really credible as "All the main angel". This movie is much better than the first, but it has great special effects that the first one didn't have as well, but also a much better plot and writing. <br /> <br /> OK - it's written for kids, but adults have as much fun as the kids do. Tony Danza does a very realistic job in his role - but this is NOT a taxi reunion. <br /> <br /> Danny Glover is actually good and even looks very human in his emotions, as well as showing a real working talent. for a change, a pleasant change. <br /> <br /> Look at least once - it's worth catching it.
