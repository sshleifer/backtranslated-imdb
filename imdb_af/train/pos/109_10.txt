This is the movie for those who believe cinema is the seventh art, not an entertainment business. Lars von Trier creates a noir atmosphere of post-war Germany quite fascinating. You are absorbed into the dream and you are only released at the end credits. The plot necessarily comes second, but it is still an exciting story with difficult issues raised. Just wonderful.
