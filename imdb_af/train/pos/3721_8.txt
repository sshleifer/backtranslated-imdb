It was one of the best war movies I saw because it focused on the characters more than the real war. All the role-players do an excellent job and because most of them are relatively unknown, it makes everything more credible. The camera footage was great, so was pacing and editing. This movie will actually come to you and cause the audience to care for the charcters.
