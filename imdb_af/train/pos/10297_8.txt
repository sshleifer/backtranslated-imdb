Well, not really. However, this movie is very entertaining. Went and saw it with the girl last night and had to be the routine of "I think there might be something in my eye". The movie is a great combination of comedy and typical romance. Jim Carey is wonderful as a discount on his happiness reporter who is given the power to change himself and the city he lives in. In fact, all the characters are wonderful. The movie is not funny or juicy, good movie to watch with the woman. <br /> <br /> Everything in Al 8/10 .... Note * I'm not an easy grader. It's all about BigV over and over!
