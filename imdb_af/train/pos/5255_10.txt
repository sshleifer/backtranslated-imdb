Tim Meadows must be the most underrated SNL's recent cast members. What was initially a low-brown look on a thin gigilo, developed into a thoroughly entertaining 90-minute run, though, still low-brow. Don't focus this on the anticipated stunning cinematography or Oscar-worthy performances. Walk in it with a brilliant confusion with Tim Meadows and Will Ferrell doing what they do best. Let the audience laugh. <br /> <br /> Leon "The Ladies' Man" Phelps is a naive, nice radio sex show host who knows very little about anything except the ways of the cheek. As a gifted lady, he beat the women of many saps who have bound together to hunt him. The director does an inspired job to guide the actors on a comical trick that is entirely up to the lack of plot development. How much plot would one expect from a SNL skit? While some scenes are a bit off-the-beaten, Meadows' one linen and absurd sexual remarks hit the funny leg squarely. For example, in one scene, Meadows compares himself to Mother Theresa, but to bonin '. Surely it's scary, but don't we all get a chuckle from his advice to an entire city in the privacy of our homes to do it in the butt? In another scene, he immediately remembers a sad kiss with the female head, the name of his benefactor, a woman he slept years ago. He stood in front of the woman who had apparently fallen for him and stated that "The Ladiesman is back," to her obvious crook. <br /> <br /> Billy Dee Williams hits the ball from the park as the bartender / narrator. Will Ferrell walk around the suppressed homosexual solid performances. <br /> <br /> See this movie if you're adult humor. If not, stay away with extreme prejudice.
