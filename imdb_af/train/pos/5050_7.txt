We really enjoyed Gray Owl: a simple story well-spoken in the classic Attenborough fashion: a bit over-romantic, with archetypes, humor and a stress of dignity and values. <br /> <br /> Beautifully shot and tell a nice This is the true story of Archie, an English man who became Indian, and flew in Canada. <br /> <br /> Fixed showings of everyone make this movie an easy show. <br /> <br /> Two of the movie's stars are without a doubt the cutest we've ever seen - and the message is a good one with its ecolabels. It was wonderful to meet or read Gray Owl in the 1930s, a unique character and it is a fitting film tribute.
