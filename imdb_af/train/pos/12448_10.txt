First; I am a dedicated fan of Modesty's, and have read the comics since I was a kid, and I found the previous films about our heroine unsatisfactory, but where they fail, this one ROCK! <br /> <br /> Well then we go here: Me. Blaise works for a casino, a gang of robbers come together and she starts playing for her friends' lives. If the robber wins one round, she must tell him about herself. If she wins twice in a row, one of the staff members is released. (Sounds stupid, yes, I'm also not that good at explaining it.);) <br /> <br /> She tells him that she is growing up in a war zone, without parents or friends old man in the refugee camp and how they escape, by nature's own rules. They seek food, and he teaches her to read and fight. As they approach civilization, they are caught in a war and if they are taken up for rioting, they are shot and the old man dies, leaving her to meet the city itself. <br /> <br /> Then she meets the man whose casino she is now working on, and the story ends. <br /> <br /> What is to follow is that there is a wonderful battle and the line is completely cool. Alexandra Staden is a TERRIFIC Modesty Blaise! Just as modest and strong, graceful and intellectual as the comic one. <br /> <br /> Feel uncomfortable, but also hear that Modesty speaks with a slightly broken accent, but it is not relevant, as the comic book cannot speak aloud, but should definitely have a somewhat existing accent. (Not to mention that it is strange that everyone speaks English in the Balkans.) <br /> <br /> The play is really good, even the child who personalizes the young Blaise must have an applaud! <br /> <br /> My favorite part should be where she puts her dress up to kick the stupid ass's ass! Totally awesome! : D I can't wait for the right adventure to start in the next movie! <br /> <br /> Look, you won't be disappointed!
