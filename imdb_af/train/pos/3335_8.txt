The movie shocked me. Personally, I usually had bad buzz. Well, after I owned the DVD for months, I plugged it into a sleepless night. Though the dragging movie used the extra footage with purpose, the seriousness of his passion and restoration of the game would have been less realistic if they left out any scenes. The best aspect of the movie is the consistency of the relationship. There were no ex's popping up or characters threatening the relationship. I usually mean we see the girl meet the boy by an incredible turn of fate, they date, something we've seen, break them up and then they come back together in the last five minutes of the movie. but this movie did not follow that form. We actually experienced the relationship and these are mistakes and although the characters have moments of anti-love they didn't have dramatic breaks, they went down and did a montage every 15 years and fell in love again. I didn't feel the movie was as predictable as the rest of the romance films. The story was unique and truth to reality in the way I felt these people in the movie was the most credible I saw in a novels movie of modern times. And it didn't hurt that all the baseball games were actually and they were at the real world series also kicking the lot there in a bit. This is not "my honest lady", but it is a passionate and honest movie. I'll just say I like it.
