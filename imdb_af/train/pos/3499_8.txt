Increase Victor Vargas is a movie you definitely need to watch. It was a very warm feeling and has a lot of humor that makes you suck. It's as much as real life with which teenagers should go. Victor, a cocky teen, but with a good heart at the end, deals with love in all the right places that deal with girls and family. In the end, Victor learns the true meaning of love after dealing with an old-fashioned grandmother and a girl he wants to use, actually use it. I recommend people watch this movie because it will be like watching a real family. That's how much the feeling of this movie is. One heart felt when Victor's grandmother threw the victory over something simple. Victor was really warm and couldn't believe she would do such a thing. It really made me feel sorry for him as though it was. Overall I give this movie a B +
