STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Miss the Market *** That A Little Inside ** Laughs Behind * The Wells <br /> <br /> Mike Atherton (Dudikoff) makes his peace peaceful . Road in the Wild West when he catches a group of men who abuse a woman. As a gentleman, of course he enters and puts an end to this and kills the son of a nasty coach. It's just the beginning of a firearm that comes to an end, from which only one winner will be. <br /> <br /> M Dudikoff is an action star who never really managed to go down with me. Maybe I had him discovered and after the other movie I saw with him on Monday, The Human Shield, it was just another Dud (ha ha) added to the list. But I have a thing for westerners, movies that just transport me to a different time and place, and I am actually a savior, and with this Dudikoff one of his better scripts has been chosen, as his films are anyway. <br /> <br /> The film hits some low points in the form of a naff central villain, which sounds like an empty Marlon Brando, and some that mostly act on some of the role players. with the mandatory cheap searches. But if your life is ever based on a Dudikoff movie, it would be one of your best choices. ***
