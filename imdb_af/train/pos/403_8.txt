I remember that the trailer for Legend of Zu was quite impressive and a fan of a Man Called Hero (my all time favorite), Storm Riders, I decided to watch this one. I know there is a lot of criticism of Ekin Cheng's acting ability, but he is my favorite Hong Kong moviestar so far (better than Nicolas Tse) and he is one of the factors I enjoyed about this movie. This film is without a doubt an artwork from beginning to end. I even thought that only the actors were real and everything else was computer generated by the end of this movie. They have done a lot of work in this one and they deserve good credit for this. The storyline of the movie was a fairy tale between good and evil with a love story being thrown in. I think Ekin Cheng pulls the girls easily. The story is not very intellectual and deep, but it is not what you expect when an action movie blows. I wanted there to be more martial arts with fists and fists instead of fights with magical abilities, but it is life and it never goes the way you want it. And why did they end up listening in the battle like supersonic planes? It's too funny. Legend of Zu cannot be a man named in my eyes, but it feels like a videogame and it's not a bad thing. If a company decides to publish games on this movie, I won't be surprised, as it bears all the video game elements. Good work. Please make more fantasy movies like this
