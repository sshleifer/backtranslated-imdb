I used to see Zu: Warriors of the Magic Mountain. In the film, the environment takes place in the mountains of China, the Legend of Zu looks like another dimension! Thanks to Tsui Hark's extensive use of CGI effects. He is able to see his vision of mountains floating above the clouds, a land where creatures fly freely, and forces ranging from razor-colored blades, cleft swords and the ultra-cool Moon Orb. <br /> <br /> While there are many characters in this one, the focus is mainly on King Sky and Enigma. The romantic aspect is there, although the film looks much darker than its predecessor. Cecilia Cheung is beautiful and her screen presence makes this movie worth watching. In the beginning I love how she looks like the Countess (of Zu Warriors) and she plays well Enigma as she looks at her previous life. Oh, by the way, did I mention that Cecilia is very attractive to the eye? <br /> <br /> In fact, Zu Warriors had more comedy elements and its special effects were limited due to its time in 1983. Tsui Hark takes it on a whole new level and sets a new standard in the theater.
