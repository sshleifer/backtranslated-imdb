A well-cast summary of a real event! Well, actually, I wasn't there, but I think that's how it was. I think there are two typically American views in the film: "communist obsession" and parallel to Adolf Hitler. This should be clear to most independent observers. Anyway, Boothe does a good performance, and so do many other well-known actors. The last twenty minutes of the movie is unbearable - and I mean it! Anyone who can sleep well is abnormal. (That's why it's so awful - it all happened, and it probably looks like that). But, actually, did the last scene on the airline really happen?
