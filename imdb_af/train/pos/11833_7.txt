Witman + progress + industrialization = BAD. First Nations + Nature + Animals = GOOD. Simple formula. Actually, in recent days, the same kind of propaganda has been used to defend the status quo; Now it is used to attack it. But this is being said, I think the movie succeeds in overcoming cut politics because it plays the themes of freedom and original nature in a way that addresses everyone. You may not have lost the film's wasteful revisionism of how the West was won. But anyone can feel a sense of the day when horses ride on the western plains. (The movie also facilitates the fact that there were no horses in America before the evil white man brought them there). Anyway, I liked it. The quality of the animation - especially the opening shot - is incredible.
