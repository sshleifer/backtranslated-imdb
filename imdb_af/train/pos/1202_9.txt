I really enjoyed this documentary by Kenny and Spencer's attempt to "The Dawn". Was a good look at how outsiders are trying to get inside to raise it. <br /> <br /> The story is well-crafted and organized in an interesting way that made the movie flow good. Well worth a watch. My only complaint is that they seem to have no closure. Maybe it's part of the point. We expect it but in reality it is not what happened (or usually happens). <br /> <br /> The movie is also a great way to see the personality of Kenny and Spencer outside their Canadian television program. You can see a little what's to come. <br /> <br /> I'm looking forward to a chance to see The Papal Chase.
