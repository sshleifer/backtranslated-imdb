I bought this game on an impulse from walmart bought. I'm glad I did. It was very entertaining to listen to Sean Connery and play the game. I thought the graphics were the best I have ever seen in a movie / game recovery. The bonus levels were very difficult! The sniper I think was too loud, made me so frustrated that I didn't play the game for a week and a half. There were too many people shooting at you with nothing to hide behind or live to handle it. <br /> <br /> The only thing I could change was the upgrade system. I didn't see a difference of ungraded equipment after the upgrade, like buying an armor upgrade doesn't look like the weapon is stronger or more on my meter. I really liked the Q copter. I think the developers did a good job.
