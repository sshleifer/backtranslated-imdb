I think it's meant to be some kind of reworking or updating of "Beauty and the Beast", but I can't say I've ever watched a movie that starts with a few minutes of graphic horse racing. Wow. Anyway, it looks like a young woman and her. Traveled to this castle in France where the woman must be married to the owner of the castle, who is the man who makes the horses turn off their rocks. There seem to be legends in the area of ​​an animal that was rather, sorry, with the ladies, or at least one, I can say. There are all sorts of references sinking in that respect, but every time the golden blond young bride gets her curious little hands, the groom removes her from her face. Anyway, the young bride goes on top to sleep while the family is waiting for a cardinal to look at the wedding (a family member, I guess) and when she dreams dreams of an animal in the forest she is leaving with her. The effects of this leave a little to be desired, and an attempt at eroticism (not that I know it very much) is a kind of laughter, especially when certain appearance screens look about as realistic as a bed post or a baseball bat. It has a rather weird and sudden but turning end, with not really any clues or buildup, but it was kind of fitting and certainly not what I expected. I don't know, it's kind of a tough one to go through, but it has its moments and is definitely strange. 7 out of 10.
