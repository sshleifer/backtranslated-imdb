Let's put one thing straight: this movie doesn't try to redefine the genre, it's not Dr Strangelove o Young Frankenstein. It's a dull movie, with three great female leaders (can't remember any other comedy with similar features), Rachel Dracht and Amy Poehler of SNL and Indie Queen Parker Posey, as always. The story is basic: the three gals were "losers" in college, and are still behind. Poehler is a dog trainer (who can't even get a date with a blind man), Posey is an assistant to a senator (who has not been touched by a man since Clinton was in the office. .. I caught it a few minutes later ... I'm a little slow, okay!), and Dracht has a gay fiance (Seth Meyers of SNL, funny). They have to prevent the senator's "uncool" daughter (the always cute Amber Tamblyn from the TV series "Joan of Arcadia") to break her during the spring. Of course, they have to watch over her, and there is some hilariousness. All in all, a light, simple comedy, very short, and very pleasant
