Diane Keaton has played a few "heavy" parts on the big screen in her many years, but she is mostly known for the "light and fluffy" stuff with Woody Allen, like Annie Hall. She earned an Oscar for best actress in a drama for this effort, and no matter how the competition was the year it first showed it. Try and find a scene in which she doesn't appear. And it was all heavy drama, exhausting in its pace and revival, action, all at full speed. The make-up made her as young as possible and she even fit the 30-year-old category even in close-ups, but she played her half of her age and at a very fast pace. The movie, overall, was pretty well done, performed and shot well with a strong supporting role, but Keaton carried the burden.
