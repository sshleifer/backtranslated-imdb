The latest film in Lucas's saga is a cute, spectacular production. This is often considered the ugly duckling of the original trilogy, but I think it's a notch above episode IV (and just a notch under episodes III and V). In fact, I think it's the third best movie in the 6-part saga. As far as I'm concerned, it's still a wonderful entertaining movie. It's not a movie with a start, climax and end; The film's mechanism works with just one purpose in its mind: bring closure to Lucas's universe. There is a final air to the whole thing, which makes the film a bit too sentimental, but emotionally rewarding. Also, it's great fun. New characters are introduced and old people face new, unexpected challenges. C3PO and R2D2 provide (as usual) great comic relief. Leia and Solo are a wonderful romantic duo, and Luke is still a good character to identify. Again, this is Luke's (and Father's) inner conflict that gives the saga its backbone. Lucas's aggressive imagination is still very clear, and the film's themes of loyalty, hope and redemption resonate strongly. I am happy that Lucas finally dropped the idea of ​​episodes VII, VIII and IX, because this film is a good book for a long, fascinating and engaging saga. Not a perfect movie, but fun in the best matinee style.
