It's a sublime piece of film. It just flows right. The accompanying music fits perfectly and is very enjoyable for the ear. The humorous parts are hilarious and even more made by the largely depressed tragic nature of the film. <br /> <br /> Despite much comment on the inherent tragedy of the storyline, it was nothing but depressed for me to look at. I thoroughly enjoyed it in a way I haven't experienced long ago. That is, it is wonderful and yet without the general bumps of modern films like; sex, violence and unnecessary special effects. <br /> <br /> Then in real life, nothing is missing without the regular vices. It has a mature plot that just doesn't need, and would indeed be ruined by any further decoration. At the same time, the theme is completely mature. It is an art in itself that completely encapsulates you and you want nothing more than it already offers. <br /> <br /> There are a few scenes that feel a little 'Waltons', but actually make perfect sense in the long run as they contrast the more dysfunctional moments. The rose child accommodates the tragic that is then transmitted to the idyllic who changes to the darker. This rolling landscape of emotional cinematography creates a perfect balance and keeps the viewer in a state of lithium-like stability. The peaks and doors are soft, but more than adequate in the fun that keeps them busy. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend watching this movie, no matter what genre you usually enjoy. Put aside any prejudices because this is a must see!
