I saw a preview of Freebird at the Isle of Man TT, as I heard in a few motorcycle murders. Although I was mostly out for the race, the desire to see Phil Daniels in a motorcycle movie (yes I love Quadrophenia like everyone) was enough to get me away from the beer and party. Finally! we did it! our British actually made a big motorcycle movie (and no it's not like Torque). It is there with the best British comedy. Mark my words, this is Phil Daniels best screen performance. And as far as Geoff Bell is concerned, there is a new British legend that makes its name feel. I loved Gary Stretch in Shane Meadows' fantastic Dead Mans Shoes and here he gives a quiet touch that he can proudly add to his growing film reputation. It's a movie not just for our cyclists, but I think for everyone (even my girlfriend loved it). I hope it gets the same brilliant response to the continent as it got to the Isle of Man. I don't look into the details of some classic scenes that this movie has (look out for the store) as it will spoil the fun, but I'll say, go see, enjoy, and have one of the best nights in it the theater you've had for a while. I really think it can be a cult classic. As they say at the TT ... C'Mon Freebird!
