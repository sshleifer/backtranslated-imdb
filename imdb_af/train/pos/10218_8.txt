We must remember that the 50's were almost an empty slate when it came to movies. Hollywood was in transition from patriotic war movies, noir, two rule oaters, etc. To movies with a message. We had Blackboard Jungle, on the waterfront and so on. Some people might think it was an improvement. I don't. Who was the magul who said: If you want to send a message, call Western Union? He was right. These psychological thrillers are less entertained than some kind of remote therapy. <br /> <br /> This one is a pipe. It's about three sisters trying to distort the control of their dead father's estate. One of them, perhaps the only one worth salvation, is supporting the company's pilot to help keep the rest of the family in the bay. He is initially for the money, but eventually falls to her. Meanwhile, the rest of the family have schemes to sabotage the romance. The results are predictable. You get a bit of everything in this movie. Sexual tension between the sisters. A little subtle masochism. Hereditary madness - if there is such a thing. We never get to meet the parents, but they really have to be screwed. The throw is virtually unknown. One or two of the actors sound vaguely known. The acting is so bad, it's hard to believe. It was released under the United Artists umbrella by a company called Bel-Air Productions. It was shot especially in the night around and around LA and probably without permits. The end was so bizarre that I thought it was a joke. It was as if they were running out of money and the producer decided to pack it in the middle of a scene. <br /> <br /> I can't explain it - not even to myself - but I have this stack of trash an 8/10. I'm familiar with the term "It's so bad it's good", but I don't think I've ever run the phenomenon before. Well, maybe, "Hot Rods to Hell", but this one definitely fits. You might try it if you like movies that seem to have been made in someone's basement.
