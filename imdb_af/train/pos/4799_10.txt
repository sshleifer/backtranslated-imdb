Maybe more than many movies, this one is not for everyone. For some, the idea of ​​delaying, reflecting, and allowing things to happen in their own time is a good description of their personal hell. For others, an approach like this speaks to a deep part of themselves that they know, a part of which they want contact. <br /> <br /> I suppose this is a function of where I am today in my own life, but I count myself in the camp of the latter group. I found the meditative pass of this film almost hypnotic, and softly lead me to some area almost mythologically. It is indeed a travel story, a rich portrayal of the distance many of us have to travel when we come full circle at the end of our days. <br /> <br /> Much as written by Mr Farnsworth's presentation by Alvin Reguit, although I am not sure, there are words to express the beautiful balance of sad sadness and wise innocence he has witnessed to us . Because I knew that he had indeed envisaged his own deaths when he was sitting on the tractor seat, I wish I had the opportunity to spend time with him before his departure. I hope he has a bit of a glimpse of the satisfaction and truth he has brought to so many people, not just for "acting" but sharing his absolute humanity with such a brutal honesty. <br /> <br /> Given the realities of manufacturing economy, I'm not sure full credit was given to Mr Lynch for the courage he showed to make the story evolve so slowly. An outsider for film production, I understand that there are few areas of modern life where the expression 'time money' is, is so descriptive. To go deep into our hearts is not an adventure that can be rushed. Mr. Lynch apparently understood that he was not just telling a story. He invited his viewers to spend time with their own deaths. No easy task. <br /> <br /> If you want to experience the power of the movie, you will find yourself in a valuable part of yourself, be worse than spending a few hours with The Straight Story. And then give yourself some time for the next little while and just listen to his echoes in the small hours of the night.
