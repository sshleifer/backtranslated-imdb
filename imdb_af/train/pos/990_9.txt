I really like this movie. Of course, the idea is pretty much out there ... the federal government arranges for a temporary thief tracker to have a more dangerous thief / computer hacker out. But Alvin Sanders, the man who implanted the feds "voluntarily" with the device, is a very nice person and it seems fun to get with him for a while. Alvin even proves far more than a good sense of humor but passive or one-dimensional character when he shows that he is not as easily manipulated as he may seem. Worth a watch.
