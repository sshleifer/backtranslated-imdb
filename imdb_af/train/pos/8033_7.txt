Zane and Beringer will keep you on the edge of your seats. I don't usually go for military / war movies, but it was worth my time. <br /> <br /> It was serious, but it was also humorous. Beringer's character was heroic and honest. No matter what you know, he has your back. <br /> <br /> Zane's character developed throughout the film. Not only was he not a suit, he certainly proved that he could be a hero and could handle a gun. <br /> <br /> The finish by me a little. It didn't really go with the action, but I'm glad I saw it. <br /> <br /> It is worth checking out.
