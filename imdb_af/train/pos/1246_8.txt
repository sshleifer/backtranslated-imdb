The point of view may be goofy, but since Murphy's character does not take it seriously, it helps the audience in this mix of mysticism and contemporary hard-boiled kidnapping. Excellent cast, especially Charles Dance and Charlotte Lewis, and Murphy is at the height of his 80's peak in comedy / action. There are also some great F / X, a very surreal dream sequence, and a pretty original plot. Often overlooked in the pantheon of Murphy flicks, but this one is worth it.
