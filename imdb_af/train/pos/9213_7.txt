Gomez Pereira is responsible for some of the most despicable comedies of the latest Spanish theater (just look at his curriculum vitae), so I didn't expect so much from Cosas Que Hacen. Don't know why I decided to see it in the world. Anyway, I just did ... And what a surprise. GÃ³mez Pereira seems to have become obsolete, and now he can make a good movie. His last job is about the midlife crisis, the disappointing, and the second chance after destroying it all. The last half hour of the movie (how dramatic) is the best part, and it's just worth watching the movie. We also starred Eduard Fernandez, and I think he is the best actor of his generation (far). <br /> <br /> * My rate: 7/10
