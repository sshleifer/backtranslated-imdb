I remember remembering this movie, thinking was so interesting. I really wanted to know what happened next. I was amazed at how much they could fit in an 8 minute short. We start in a school grounds. . Two friends discussing class. Kid B says to Kid A "Let's not go to class today." And Child A refuses and claims they can miss something really important. So child B jumps and child A goes to class. When he gets there, the teacher tells him that today they will learn the only lesson they will ever learn. They are going to learn the meaning of life. She gives everyone a pamphlet, and when she comes to child A, she goes out and tells the boy next to him to share. Well, the kid won't share, so Kid A goes to the teacher's search. When he finally gets her, he gets a shocking revelation about what the true meaning of life is. I suggest everyone see it short. It will only take 8 minutes of your life, but the message is so important, it can help you for a lifetime.
