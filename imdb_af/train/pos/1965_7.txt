I found this movie in all areas very well. The acting was brilliant of all characters, especially Ms. Stone and Morissey. Tramell's character just becomes smarter and more psychologically distorted by the minute. The plot is interesting, though this film is more for the minds of the main characters and how Catherine continues her writing with new ways and twists for her novels. The environment was also fantastic and the whole atmosphere of the movie was that mysterious, excitement like masterpiece. Go watch this movie now, it deserves better than it got from the audience, which has been misled by some flawed horrible reviews about the movie (before it even started) ..... Don't regret it if you go don't look This ...
