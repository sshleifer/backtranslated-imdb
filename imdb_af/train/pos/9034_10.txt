This movie was absolutely BRILLIANT !! Every show in this movie is excellent, especially Jake Gyllenhaal and Chris Cooper. It looks like Mr. Gyllenhaal will have a BIG movie career if it's something to go. I thought Joe Johnston was a strange choice as a director, as he is usually big budget busters (Jumanji, Honey, I've shrunk the kids). He draws from every scene with mere class. My favorite scene was where Homer goes into the mini-screw and looks at the sky, running down, as all his dreams were, it was beautiful. Joe Johnston has to do more of these brilliant, acting, driven films, as well as his Big Budget blockbuster fair, which is also excellent. Kudos !! to everyone involved in this masterpiece!
