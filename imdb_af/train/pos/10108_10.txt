An absolute classic !! The direction is flawless, the acting is just fantastic. Words fall short for this great work. The most definitive film about the Mumbai police. This movie was the test of times. <br /> <br /> To give Puri a star performance, Smita Patil is no less. All the actors did their best and the movie is excited at any moment. This movie shakes your whole being heavy and forces you to think of many problems that confront our society. <br /> <br /> This is the story of a cop (Om Puri) who started his honest man career, but eventually turned into a murderer. The first attempt in Bollywood to get behind the scenes and uncover the oppressive truth about Mumbai police. Kudos na Nihalani !! <br /> <br /> After this movie, a bunch of Bollywood films were released that exposed criminal-politicians-police nexus. So this movie was really a trend setter. This trend has dominated the Hindi movie for over a decade. <br /> <br /> This movie was a moderate checkout hit. <br /> <br /> A must-see for sensible movie fans.
