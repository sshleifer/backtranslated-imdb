In this 1943 film, Judy Garland is not considered ready for the big time, but by the man who loves Van Heflin. This movie was definitely a big change for Mr. Heflin, especially after his supporting Oscar won last year in Johnny Eager. <br /> <br /> Was Spring Byington too old to be the widow of 5 children, with four of them looking like her grandchildren? <br /> <br /> The singing and dancing is just amazing, but the way the thriving romance between Heflin and Garland is portrayed has left much to be desired. It was a Gigi-like one, after which a young girl was eventually wiped out of her feet by a charmer.
