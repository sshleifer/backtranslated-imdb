This one grew on me. I love the R. Burman music and despite the rough elements of the story, I have found myself moving around while watching the movie again. The brother-sister plot line is powerful, I thought; there are also more likely compulsory things, such as bar fights, a rewarding crime story, etc. which is not distracting. (Although it is not a particular point of departure.) The English translation was also decided by someone for whom it was a bit stretchy, and so rewarding for that. <br /> <Like many of the Bollywood movies I've seen, this one is melodramatic and opera-like, including here a song that was first sung by a little boy to encourage his abused and unhappy sister and then the same song sang 12. or so many years later by the man who traveled to Kathmandu to join this girl again, grew up and upset (she said her brother and mother were dead) and evaporated her pain with drugs. <br /> A superior thing about this 1971 movie is that it is about the hippie movement that brought India's hordes of seekers to India. It sees them as being driven to India by a spiritual hunger caused by the failures of their own societies, yet in India, which only lives for the moment. The hippie-singing dance-pressing scenes are truly wonderful and accurate in their tone (I'm old enough to remember), and I'm pretty sure the masses of young white zoned kids are real hippie extras, as I remember <br /> < (It's not about the actual Hare Krishna movement, although the movie hippies sing a Krishna / Rama song, just like a group of real Indian devotees, not related to the hippies, in the opening scene. from the movie.) <br /> <br /> ~ Virginia
