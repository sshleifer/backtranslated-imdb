The 4th Pokémon movie made me cry when Celebi died. Don't Dare Say Pokemon Sucks! I don't like it when people say it. I've been holding Pokemon for 5 or 6 years, so everyone should enjoy Pokémon, including this movie and other Pokémon movies. So, without further ado, please say that Pokemon is great and must be enjoyed by people for all ages. And also why do Pokemon haters have low ratings for most of the Pokémon movies? I don't understand .... They shouldn't. There is absolutely no reason why people should just vote without proving that Pokemon sucks except the fact that: 1) Pokemon is only for small children. 2) Pokemon is stupid. and 3) People should not like Pokemon. I think that's why people don't like Pokemon.
