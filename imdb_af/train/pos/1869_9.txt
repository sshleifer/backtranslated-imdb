Antwone Fisher's story of childless neglect and abuse is an inspiration to all of us who have experienced or even experienced the fate of foster children. Antwone never met his father. Growing up with "churchgoers" who use the "n-word" to not only intimidate and hurt, but also as a term of oppression, as a young man who sees his best friend murdered , Antwone's anger is slowly changing into positive power when consulted by a Navy psychiatrist, and becomes a love in his life. <br /> <br /> The scene where Antwone meets his maternal mother is one of the most powerful moments in the film. Surprised by the unexpected confrontation, the woman listens in silence to hear how the young man tells her how he lived a life without crime, addiction to drugs, father and children, left and right, despite his completely negative circumstances. <br /> <br /> If the scene wasn't powerful enough, drive the next one home (and open the gates): A welcome to welcome the house Antwone; dozens of smiling faces and open arms, announcing that HE is part of this great family. <br /> <br /> One of the messages provided by this wonderful movie is that there are many well-meaning and sincere people who help orphans and unwanted children. Even if some of the homes and administrators do not seem to care and self-service, many give them all. The character found by Antwone's "file" after revealing the circumstances of his birth is one of the "bright lights" in the darkness of the system. <br /> <br /> The DVD contains a French language course, various captions, as well as additional features and information about foster parents. <br /> <br /> As a Clevelander, I appreciated the place movements. No matter where you come from, you will be deeply disturbed by this autobiographical gem.
