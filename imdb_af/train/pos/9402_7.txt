I only saw this movie after hearing raves about it for years. Needless to say, the real experience was a little anticlimactic. But still, Alec Guiness energetically leads a wonderful role in a jolly, if formal, by industrial post-WWII England. It is the well-known story of the misery to find the perfect everyday product. Remember the car running on water? Remember the promise of nuclear energy? In this case, it is a substance that does not get apart, wrinkles or even dirty! Of course, fabric manufacturers and their workers are shocked at the prospect of being out of business and therefore the plot becomes a bit thick. <br /> <br /> Guiness makes the whole business worthwhile and watches it blow up a little. factory research lab over and over is quite an explosion! (The British ... always the stiff upper lip when it's under fire.) The movie might find out just like Guiness's goofy invention, but it's a good ride.
