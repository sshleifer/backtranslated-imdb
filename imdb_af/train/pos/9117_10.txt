This film gives us an interesting reminder of how easy it is for so many to get caught up in the busy profession of doing nothing. As an Afrikaner descent, we owe it to ourselves to make a change in this cycle of "all talk and no action" and to realize making a change, there must be less talk and more action. This is a powerful statement from the sections of our people about small issues and our failures to recognize the bigger picture and the need to unite to make a difference. Despite the reference to the black community, all viewers can learn something from the message that this film wants to portray.
