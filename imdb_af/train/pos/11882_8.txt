This movie was in my collection for a while, but it wasn't until a friend of mine reminded me ?? until I decided I should see it. I didn't know much about close to Leo? just that it was supposed to be excellent from the age movie and it is about a very serious subject ?? AIDS. <br /> <br /> Although the person who has the tools ?? is Leo ?? The scenario revolves around the way Marcel (Leo's youngest brother) participates in the illness of his relative. First, do everyone try to hide Marcel's truth? He is believed to be too young to understand his brother's disease? The fact that Leo is also a homosexual contributes to the reluctance of parents to discuss the matter with the young Marcel. I know from experience that most older people do not accept the fact that sometimes even when someone is young, it does not automatically mean that he cannot accept reality and act more appropriately even himself. With the exception of the fact that the family tried to hide Marcel's truth, did they leave me with a reasonable impression? how did they support their son? even after discovering the truth about his sexuality and his illness. The fact that they allowed the young Marcel to travel with Leo to Paris to meet his former boyfriend was quite a gesture of them? Most families I know will be reluctant to do so. There are lots of warmth in the screens in which the brothers spend time together? you can see they are real friends, concern about each other. <br /> <br /> Near Leo is an excellent drama, which I highly recommend
