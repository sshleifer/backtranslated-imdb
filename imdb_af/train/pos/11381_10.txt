The best part of an American In Paris, the long ballet sequence is at the end, where Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron are the living personalization of several great painters. Kelly was previously established as a pavement artist in Paris, so the sequence is the logical end to a musical outburst with life and energy, Gershwin songs, and cast members like Georges Guetary and Oscar Levant. Kelly was at its best here - it's a little different to Singin in the Rain, and the effect of all the movies being covered with the ballet gives it a definite wow factor. No wonder the series 'That's Entertainment' ended after all the other MGM musical highlights were over!
