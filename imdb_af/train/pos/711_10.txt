"Rock a 'Roll High School' is likely to be in history as the ultimate rebellious party. To portray a lot of high school students who use the Ramones' music as inspiration to stand up against their despotic principal (Mary Woronov, of "Eating Raoul" fame), the whole movie is a mile per minute. It's basically a big excuse to have fun, and I'm sure you'll. Bullied young men? Cheque. A brave music teacher (Paul Bartel, also from "Eating Raoul" *)? Cheque. Explosive mice? Checkmate. <br /> <br /> Anyway, these are the things that make life worth living. Even for someone like me who doesn't know the Ramones music, it's pure fun. With how Roger Corman executive producer and Joe Dante co-director, how can we expect something less? Bad that director Allan Arkush has hit through, like Caddyshack II. <br /> <br /> Also starring PJ Soles, Vincent Van Patten, Clint Howard, Dey Young, Dick Miller (who appeared in each of them featured Joe Dante's movies, and much of Roger Corman's), Don Steele, and of course the Ramones. A real treat. <br /> <br /> * It seems Bartel and Woronov always have fellow students. They also co-star in Joe Dante's "Hollywood Boulevard" and the slasher movie "Chopping Mall" (also starring Dick Miller) ... rejecting their roles of "Eating Raoul".
