The Japanese cyber-punk movies never really did me much, but most of the handful I saw was at least visually interesting and at least mostly entertaining. Meatball machine is no exception. <br /> <br /> The storyline deals with some kind of parasites that take over human hosts, control their bodies, turn them into "necroborgs" and cause them to eat with the only purpose of eating one another - apparently as a "game" for the enjoyment of said parasites. The film revolves around a shy guy and bell who fall apart, but whose love affair is cut short by both being infected with the parasites and being forced to fight each other. It becomes a test of human will against the control of the parasite over their physical bodies. <br /> <br /> MEATBALL MACHINE will always be compared to TETSUO (like most cyberpunk films) and for good reason. There are certainly some thematic parallels, although the movies are definitely different. There are lots of fun, splash moments in MEATBALL MACHINE, and the creature / sponsor FX is definitely the highlight - a mix of TETSUO gauges GWAR that are both expanded and resourceful. Depending on your taste for these types of movies, the MEATBALL MACHINE can be your thing or not. If you enjoy kinetic cyber-punk movies with a healthy dose of splash, it's for you ... 7/10
