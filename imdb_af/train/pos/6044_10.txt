A great British Indy movie! Fantastic chemistry among the 3 main characters makes for some hilarious drug-fired pieces that Cheech and Chong will be proud of. Great to see Phil Daniels again on the big screen (even though he has replaced his sides since Quadrophenia!) And Gary Stretch is surprisingly good and a treat for the ladies! I knelt the final battle scene because it was cut for Zulu and now I know what happened to Arthur Brown after he set fire to Top of the Pops ... He doesn't ... he's really a bona fide british hippie !!! You don't have to be a cyclist to enjoy it and it's right in my Friday night after-bar repetition collection. <br /> <br /> Give this movie a go and you won't be disappointed.
