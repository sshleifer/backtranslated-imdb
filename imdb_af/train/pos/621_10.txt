As a massive fanatic of fantasy in general and of the work of Neil Gaiman * in particular *, I have been so passionate, so hungry and with such a bittersweet mix of anticipation and fear of disappointment that I can look forward to, looked ahead. hardly believe it is finally here. And you know what? I don't have to be afraid, the movie version is awesome. Different from the book, but in a good way - less whimsical, more comical, still very sweet and enchanting. <br /> <br /> The special effects are absolutely spot-on, making magic a natural and real part of the world of the Wall without being overtly spectacular and intrusive. <br /> <br /> Due attention is paid to storytelling and pacing, and the decisive chapter is a triumph, with the haunting Princess (whose call almost reads As a Who's Who of the latest British comedy - Rupert Everett, Little Britain's David Walliams celebrity, two blocks from Green Wing, etc.) steal most of the best lines and almost all the funniest moments of the movies that exist in abundance. <br /> <br /> In fact, the one small criticism I have with all the film is that the comedy elements sometimes become a bit OTT, subtly going out of the window to the derivation of the main story. Ricky Gervais's cameo, for example, was too much just like "Ricky Gervais does his usual David Brent from the Office comedy persona" to my liking and, in my opinion, created an unwelcome and turbulent break from the magical game of the progressing story (though I am fair, I think the Ferdy character in the original book was nice "Ricky Gervais" inquiry when I think about it. <br /> <br /> But this is a small issue in an otherwise impeccably cast and written fairy tale with a good mix of action and romance. Charlie Cox, as the protagonist Tristan, captures the right mix of naivety, subtle comedy and self-realization needed for a story like this where a "humble young boy begins with life-changing quest"; Claire Danes as Yvaine is beautiful, feisty and just as strange or ethical, a perfect interpretation of her star role; Indeed, Robert De Niro, in the comedy that every reviewer speaks, deserves praise, nice fun (looks like he has a ball too) ... and Michelle Pfeiffer is triumphantly cool and nasty like a wicked witch Lamia, my favorite performance of the movie overall. If you enjoyed her lovely little fun in the recent "Hairspray", you'll also enjoy her. <br /> <br /> To round off this review: you will surely laugh, you will certainly smile, and you may even cry - Stardust is a beautiful, heartwarming fairy tale for the whole family, with a heart of gold and more sass smarts than are immediately visible. One of my all-time favorite movies is the absolutely fabulous Princess Bride, and Stardust is compared with good reason, as it is a very similar kind of movie that explores similar themes and territories .... and just like The Princess Bride remains twenty years after its initial release fresh, fresh and funny, I believe that the delicious tongue-in-cheek sweetness of Stardust will appear for many years as a family favorite on our televisions (or similar future device!).
