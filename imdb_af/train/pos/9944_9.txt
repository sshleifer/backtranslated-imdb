Certainly, the plot is not Oldboy. It seems like the only "big" movies these days are incredibly shocking or high budget / hyped. <br /> <br /> Spin Kick is a drama / comedy about a group of people who decide to throw in their hearts. Regardless of what you expect from this movie, you are warned to feel through the work, pain and expectations that the characters experience to experience. Although comic at times, many moments and characters are beautifully donated: there is the old guard character who takes things too seriously; He only won once in his life, and many other well-rounded characters with their own problems - but most importantly, their own hopes and dreams. While the plot and the goals of the movie are simple, these aspects of the movie merely show the development of the characters while overcoming their personal and interpersonal struggle. <br /> <br /> In short, this movie will make you feel fresh, determined and content.
