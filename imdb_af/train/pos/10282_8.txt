If your idea of ​​an excitement is motor yacht, explosions and dozens of people being cut by gunfire, "House of Games" is definitely not the movie for you. If you like and appreciate psychological drama and tension, then you see it. <br /> <br /> "House of Games" tells the story of a esteemed psychologist and writer, dr. Margaret Ford (Lindsay Crouse), who is trying to help a patient and become involved in the shady world of people led by the charismatic Mike (Joe Mantegna). To say something more about the plot will ruin the tension. Frankly, I find it hard to believe someone who says they saw the twists. Just like a clever artist, this movie draws you into its web and draws your vigilance. <br /> <br /> The story is made stiff and good, the dialogue smart and laconic, acting uniformly good (Mantegna is wonderfully charismatic). Some complained that dr. Ford is not a very sympathetic character, and wondered why Mamet Lindsay Crouse would look so physically unattractive. But dr. Ford is supposed to be cold and separate; Moreover, her wealth is somehow essential to the plot (at one point I believe an injury to her sexual self-esteem is an important part of her motivation.) I will no longer say. <br /> <br /> "House of Games" is a dark glance at the bottom of human nature that comes to an end with an awkward ambiguity. It keeps your attention every second while you look, and stays with you for a long time.
