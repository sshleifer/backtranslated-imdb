I have been running a wide range of Scoop reviews over the past few days, and I went to the theater prepared for a departure from Woody. Luckily I couldn't be wrong anymore. Admittedly, Woody slows the artist down a couple or two, but Woody, the author / director, is in good shape. He found a credible way to integrate his 70-year-old self into the story. Because of the laughter and governor, the audience ate Allen's one-liners and dialogue in a way I didn't see in several years. <br /> <br /> In a movie landscape dominated by software-approved story bows, twenty-and-one and compounding formula for kids, it is a source of satisfaction and inspiration to see that Allen is his highly personalized and still rewarding path.
