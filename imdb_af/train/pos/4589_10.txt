Well, I'll consider Police Story as one of Jackie Chan's best movie. The plot, the fenders and the stuntworks are excellent. In this film, Jackie himself acted as a police officer called Chan Ka Kui (Kevin Chan in some versions) who successfully arrested a criminal. After the crime released the Lord for lack of evidence, he took Chan for the murder of a police officer. As a result, he was with the police. Later, Salina (Brigitte Lin), the secretary of the crime lord, went to a shopping mall and started stealing the evidence of the crime's crimes from his computer and preparing to send them to Chan. However, the crime officer knew that Salina had downloaded his incriminating data and hired his henchmen to catch her. Later, Chan appears at the screens and starts fighting all the henchmen and defeating them one by one. At the last scene, Chan was seen defeating the criminal. Lastly, this is the best action and comedy film. Everyone should see it. Highly recommended.
