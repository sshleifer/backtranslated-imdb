Wow! Wow! Wow! I have never seen a non-ministerial documentary on globalization until I saw MARDI GRAS: Made in China. This film has zero story and combines sham-based footage with sensitive interviews with four teen workers in China who live in a factory association. They play with toys, jump rope and dance. Still, the majority of their days and nights consist of work, work and work - but the visuals of their work are enlightening and fascinating to watch. The owner of the factory in China is incredibly open, so much so that he hits the consequences of globalization while "punishing" the workers. The Mardi Gras beads from China after the carnival show how the local world is linked by humor and interesting, compelling footage of both cultures. One of the most interesting parts of this film is the cross-cultural introduction of factory workers and Mardi Gras revelers through pictures. Here comes the film full of circles and shows how images can be a point of communication and transformation. The film is never a minister, is not debt-driven, and everyone's position is present. Eventually, we - the viewers - make our own conclusions about the complexity of the film and globalization.
