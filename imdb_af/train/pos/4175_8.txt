I always wondered what happened to the magical kind of feeling the old Slovenian movies looked like in them ... Well, I wondered if it just felt like the nostalgia. Or did that "feel" decide to pack his bags and say "somewhere" in the middle of our film history, and then I never came back? Or did it? Because for me it was the first time I saw "Express, Express". And it was old again. <br /> <br /> There are three features of this movie that make it somewhat unique and so enjoyable as it is to watch - the smooth flow of the story, the warmth of the colors and, most appreciated - The lack of excessive use of verbal communication (something many others (not just) Slovenian writers should at least consider). There is no use for words, if you can understand each other as well (yes or better) in other ways in use. Just look at Bakovic and Cerar. Uh. <br /> <br /> So, in just as many words, why I would recommend "Express, Express" to all of you, as a Slovenian movie, whatever you heard from Slovenian. movies (if you've ever heard anything, that's ...). <br /> <br /> Oh, and that scene, where Bakovic is dancing to Vivaldi's music ... A treat. <br /> <br /> Treat yourself. Beware.
