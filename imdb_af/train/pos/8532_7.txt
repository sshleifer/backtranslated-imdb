Lupine leaves for Morocco and finds a legendary treasure. His only idea is an interesting jewel that an old man gave him. It is a nice place for Lupine, with the desert and that warm exotic feeling. <br /> <br /> One interesting thing about this movie is that Jigen has a much smaller role than usual, usually in a different place from Lupine. On the one hand, their classic dynamic together is missed, but it is a change of pace. Plus, in this way, Lupine can focus on the ladies ... <br /> <br /> Fujiko governs this. Throughout the function she seduces Lupine, and our viewers. Then there is Lara, the girl of this particular story, and she is very nice. This one has more nudity than any other Lupine anime, which is a fun distinction. <br /> <br /> There is a very entertaining, slight, ninja guy who is the best villain in it, and of course he has some good fighting with Goemon. as well as some fun scenes with Fujiko. Inspector Zenigata is of course also in fine shape here. <br /> <br /> Much, it's a smooth ride with Lupine. The plot is average and there are a few slow spots, but all in all this movie is a real pleasure. Enjoy.
