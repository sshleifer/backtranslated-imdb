Before I start, I must point out that I know the editor of this movie. We have never met, but we belong to the same fanzine (the things that came before message boards), and we talked about the phone, so I have a bias here. Anyway ... <br /> <br /> Somehow it is ironic how the role of the Rat Pack culture from the late 50s and early mid-60s back in the mid-90s, this movie, of the son of One of the original Rat Pack, and similarly made, was a flop. Not only that, it was a critical flop; I believe that Rolling Stone's Peter Travers was the only one who didn't mess it up (he gave it a mixed review, as I recall). And while I don't think it's the biggest movie in the world, and I'm not a fan of the Rat Pack, or a "cocktail" culture, I think it's worth seeing. <br /> <br /> For one thing, it looks stylish and moves right. For others, the core achievements are all good. Richard Dreyfus is held here surprisingly when the front door of a sanatorium comes, and has a drop edge on him. Jeff Goldblum goes back to the quiet ironic performances he gave in his pre-blockbuster days, such as The Big Chill. And while Ellen Barkin just has to vampel in this movie, she does it entertaining. It is not a good movie, though; The dialogue consists mainly of words, and many of them do not work (like the whole "Zen of Ben" speech). And Gabriel Byrne and Kyle MacLachlan are terrible here. Yet I am entertained, and if you like gangster movies, you can be too.
