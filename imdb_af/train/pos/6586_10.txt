Jeremy Brett is simply the best Holmes ever, carefully sticking out the great Basil Rathbone, which is probably the best fit for a short story by Conon-Doyle. <br /> <br /> A length adjustment includes some new plot strings. It fits well with the surrounding drama and increases the hate one feels for Milverton. <br /> <br /> Excellent performances all around, especially of Robert Hardy, and both Brett and Hardwick fully rounded and comfortable in their roles, make it a beautiful piece of drama.
