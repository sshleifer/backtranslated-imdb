It's the best range of its kind I've seen all year. I can't help thinking it's just my luck. A series I love gets 6 episodes (and more next year) and the constant stream of cookie cutter police programs never gets ending episodes. <br /> <br /> I think the Reasons New Tricks succeed. The scripts are good, and the combination of characters is wonderful. The play is top flight, and the combination of comedy and drama is a treat. The stories aren't so memorable, but that's not why I look like this one. <br /> <br /> The theme song is a favorite, and we were disappointed to find it unavailable in any published edition. Big things, BBC - a triumph over sex appeal (apart from the young constable, no one is there as a eyelid, and even if he IS, he can still act!).
