If you think "Weird Al" Yankovic is hilarious, you will not be disappointed by THE COMPLEX AL. Not only does this spectacular movie have much of Yankovic's more memorable videos (such as a surgeon) and "I love Rocky Road" among them, but they are connected with funny vignettes that are supposed to be the parody's rise to fame to emphasize. Yankovic is not for all tastes, but his humor is harmless and imaginative enough that even non-supporters will at least be lightly amused. The hard fans will not only love it for its content, but also for its relatively early look at Yankovic's now nearly three-decade career. Suitable for all ages, kiddies will undoubtedly like the funny footage.
