It is short and to the point. The story writing used for Star Trek: Hidden Frontier is surprisingly good. Acting across the map, the main characters have apparently worked over the years to improve their skills. It is hard to believe that this series has been going on for almost 7 years and will come until mid-May 2007. <br /> <br /> I won't repeat what has already been said about the sets and graphics. Considering this is all voluntary, for no profit, it's pretty wonderful. <br /> <br /> If viewed as a professional production, I should give it 5 for a good story, but terrible sets. But as a fan-based production, I have to give it an excellent score, with the exception of a few other attempts, it's in its own league. For mere volume, I don't think it has been adjusted. Congratulations to the cast and crew for a lot of admiration.
