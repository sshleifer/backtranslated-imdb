Watch movie I was in a very light mood and this film is also light, but the end of the movie is just unexpected, leaving a long-lasting memory in your mind. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with Abhay and his call to be witness during marriage registrar. Soha comes for the marriage and his boyfriend doesn't, Soha leaves alone on the street, she can't go back home and she has nothing here to live here. Abahy seems to be a helper for her, this is the basis of the story. <br /> <br /> The rest is just visible and the end of the story is bitterly sweet that Abhay has to see that keeps you on the edge of the seat. <br /> <br /> Dialogues and music are good songs are OK direction is good and like the script you feel, the movie is slow but watching the question of the story, that's right. <br /> <br /> A real warning especially with light showers I enjoyed it at home with Coke and peanuts. My rating for this is 8/10
