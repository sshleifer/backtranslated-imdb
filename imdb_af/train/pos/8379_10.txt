I remember this movie from when I was 12, it was incredible. I remember it until the day, not like most I watched, I even tried to buy it, but it's like rocking horse sh * t! Anyway, the play is a bit tough, but the story is great, as it was a real low-budget B movie and the attacks were great to watch. I had to watch it about 20 times. It was a very well-made movie and I loved the idea of ​​fighting giant man-controlled robots, sorry to spoil it by making a crappy spin "Crash and Burn". Don't see that movie with the way it's total pants. ! If you look at a true Sci-Fi movie fan, watch it if it's made again today. It will be a winner. I really want to see a remake or even release the DVD.
