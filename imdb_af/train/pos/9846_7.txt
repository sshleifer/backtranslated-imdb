Okay, at first it looked like "Shrek" - the loneliness that is constantly being followed by comic relief. Then it develops into something really compelling, since the gauntlet is set. And the result is a pleasant movie, which has moments that I agree that it's a bit too dramatic for kids to watch (for example, Manny's past). The point of departure has apparently worked long so they can succeed in making a movie set with virtually no other sets (only ice and rocks) and three characters. It is a good thing to know that they are able to do something emotionally. As I said, sometimes it can be torn, so children are being warned. The real decay is the animation. It wasn't as sweet as the toy story movies or shrek, and it shows. The people are unrealistic, and we have seen better examples of CGI before. But don't let this record stain: as a solo effort, "Ice Age" is commendable. And it will gather many fans, I have no doubt. Oh yes, the moments with that little mouse are priceless and stupid.
