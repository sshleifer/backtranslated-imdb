In the northeast of Brazil, the father of twelve-year-old illiterate Maria (Fernanda Carvalho) sells his daughter to the middleman of a prostitution organization, Tadeu (Chico Dias), to be employed as a domestic and a better life have. However, the girl is being sold to the farmer Lourenço (Otávio Augusto) who bleeds her, and he gives the abused girl to his teenage son to have his first sexual experience. Then she is sent to a brothel in a golden field in Amazonas and investigates his owner, the despicable Saraiva (Antonio Calloni). When Maria escapes to Rio de Janeiro, expecting a better life, she is explored by the Cáften Vera (Darlene Glória). <br /> <br /> "Anjos do Sol" exposes the sad and shameful reality of child prostitution in Brazil through the fate of the girl Maria. Last year I saw "Lilja 4-ever" telling an identical story in the former Soviet Union; therefore, this problem exists in third world countries. Director and writer Rudi Lagemann presents a good film that exposes reality but never shows nudity or explicit sexual scenes. This is the debut of the promising Fernanda Carvalho, who has an excellent performance in the role of a scared child fighting for survival. Most prostitutes are amateurs, and it is impossible to recognize the well-known Darlene Glória so differently that they are very plastic. The bitter and hopeless end of the story is also very realistic. My voice is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Anjos do Sol" ("Angels of the Sun")
