Sad story of a B-17 pilot. Brady is being shot over the occupied territory. The local farmers have extended their kindness and protection to the cost of their own lives. I have never heard of this movie and it hit me for two hours. After the film is over, I'm glad I took the time. It's a whole story told to explain Brady's face at the beginning of the movie.
