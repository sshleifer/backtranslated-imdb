I loved this movie. It was almost the same as the first (cabin at the lake), just to kill women, he also killed men. And the screens are much more interesting. Two of my favorite scenes are first when Stanley and Allison are in the dance club and he describes Kimberly's last moments before being thrown to the water. And secondly, when Stanley visits Allison in his cellar, just before they go to the set, when she kisses him. Those scenes were very intense and sound to me. I gave the movie a score of 8/10, not because the movie was bad, but because the filming was bad, I mean, there were times when you noticed that nothing was wrong, like the way a movie usually shot is shot, you will not see the "live" camera shoot, but then, very little, you will see the filming errors. what went wrong ??
