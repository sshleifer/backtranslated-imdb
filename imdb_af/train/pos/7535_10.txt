The 700 Club offers a good perspective on world events. Some have described it as dishonest or cruel. I find the program informative and inspiring. Of course, many people throw mud on a program that has proven so successful. There are very few shows that can indicate a 40-year record of success in the world of television media and the 700 club is one of them. While Mr. Robertson could have been wrong to say that someone should be murdered, I find it curious that so many people will literally travel for themselves to jump on the bandwagon of criticism. I definitely said foolish things in my life. I will definitely be prepared to Forgive Robertson, as he brings out a good performance.
