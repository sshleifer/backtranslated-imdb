Spoilers! Classic 70's sex garbage! The Swedish gal (Helga) was what made this movie so great. She was beautiful, but what I really was was how sexual she was. She washed out massive sexuality sizes throughout the film. Her best scenes were when she stimulated her. Every time she was on the screen, I transferred. <br /> <br /> Also, Doctor Julia (sister of the darkened male focus of the film) was very interesting visually. Although most 12-year-old girls have bigger breasts than Julia, she knew how to use what she had and her plays (especially the silk-blue and black-skirted scenes) grabbed my attention relentlessly. You must also love the big hoaky scene where the bats stripped her neck. I don't know if I've ever seen more ridiculous and sexy at the same time. Classic stuff!
