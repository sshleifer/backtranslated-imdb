It's cute, it's creepy, it's gross, but it makes it so much fun. It's about the top melodramatic moments that are just really laughable. This movie is great to have fun. Rent it for a good laugh. <br /> <br /> The movie is about three women's newswriters, during a time before cell phones. They go to a small town to cover a festival, but they can't get a room to stay the night. And that's when they meet Ernest Keller. He's creepy in a psycho-type way. And he offers to leave them at his home. But he doesn't tell them the truth about who lives there. <br /> <br /> Stephen Furst's performance is as wonderful as "The Unseen" that he really wears this movie. Most of the movie is so boring, although the truth of Ernest's family is interesting. <br /> <br /> To see this role in these scenes makes it worth a look. Barbara Bach and Doug Barr make delicious eye candy. <br /> <br /> I see the movie as an old jewel, hard to find and worth it.
