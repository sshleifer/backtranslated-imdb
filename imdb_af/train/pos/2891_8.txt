This night we watched the wonderful world of Disney on ABC last night, and I have come to the conclusion that things there at the "Mouse" need to be stricter than usual. <br /> <br /> As this movie only runs for 74 minutes, and they had to broadcast it after 2 hours of broadcast time, they had, and I didn't stop, commercial breaks lasting 6 to 7 minutes. And during this commercial break, they had another ad under the prospect of a TV show hosted by the over-annoying Kelly Rippa, who proclaimed the magical wonders of "Cinderella 2: Dreams Come True". <br /> <br /> Once again, break after break, Disney took time out of the real movie to tell us, the loyal viewers, that we needed a copy of the successor. Thanks, Disney, for making us a service to create a sequel to your beloved jewel of a movie. <br /> <br /> In any case, all this commercialism and cash register rings made it difficult to get into the real movie of "Cinderella" because by the time the ads were over, I forgot where the story left . <br /> <br /> But of course the original "Cinderella" still holds its magic, and the Story is still a good one, although we've all seen it many times. It is a pity that they have to cheapen it with all the marketing that seems to be a lame follow-up.
