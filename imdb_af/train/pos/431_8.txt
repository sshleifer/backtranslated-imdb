It starts slowly and shows the sad lives of the two housewives who decide to rent a castle in Italy for April, but don't give up. Nothing much happens, but time passes, and there are many shitty jokes (my favorite is the coach ride in the storm, which I find hilaries). The film is wonderfully romantic in many sentences, the landscape is beautiful (like Polly Walker), and the decisions made in the movie are very satisfying. <br /> <br /> The film takes some liberties with the book, the biggest being with the Arbuthnot / Briggs / Dester business, but I actually prefer the movie's version of this (it can be more sentimental, but I felt that it was more consistent with the tone of the story, and anyway, I like sentiment when it's done well). <br /> <br /> An excellent movie, especially as a date movie during turbulent weather.
