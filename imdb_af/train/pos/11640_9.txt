What I liked best in this film is that like Hitchcock's movies, it's a thrill that doesn't take him too seriously. <br /> <br /> Hitchcock understood that people are getting the movies to have a good time. Something that Hollywood has forgotten in recent years. It's a thrill, but it has a lot of laughter and always has one eye cut at the camera. <br /> <br /> Rachel McAdams is wonderful as always. Cillian Murphy is creepier than he was in Batman Begins. In the old days there were guys who always played the bad guy. We don't see much of it, because I suspect the Hollywood agents regard it as a bad career, but Cillian Murphy is really good at being bad. <br /> <br /> Directing is surprisingly stylish. The story is good, but the dialogue could use some sprucing. <br /> <br /> "Red Eye" is a very funny movie and people were applauded when the closing credits started rolling. If you're in the mood for a nice escapist thriller, the red eyes can be your ticket.
