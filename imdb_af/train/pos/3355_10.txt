May 1938. Hitler in Italy. Preparations for historic appointments with Mussolini.Emotions, tension and forms of self-affirmation. an empty village, a housewife and a journalist. Meeting two different worlds. Refuge for a mother with a sad life. Short filling for a classic victim. A story about loneliness and silence. About the shape of life's angles and desire as the form of the battle. The great character - a book gifted in the spring. This movie is a poem, remarkable for the art of describing the shades of general loneliness. A plea for a relentless relationship with reality. And with your interior. The photos of Il Duce, the clumsiness of Antonietta, the patience and the poor tension of Gabriele, the art of director to give the feeling of grace, are two great actors. This movie is sublime, predicted by subtle delicacy, a wonderful film about hypocrisy and arbitrary pronunciation, about the essence of life and repulsion of any tyranny. Loren and Mastroianni are the masters of a wonderful intelligent play. A clear masterpiece.
