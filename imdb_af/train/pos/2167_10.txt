I saw this movie back in 1984, we first looked at "This is Spinal Tap" and after 5 minutes we were ready to fall asleep. So we went to see this movie. If you have any conspiracy theory in your head, you will want to see this one. <br /> <br /> The question you have to ask yourself when you watch this movie is: Do you think government can do this? (In my opinion there is no doubt they can't) <br /> <br /> But I don't want to give too much information because it would be a devastator and I think you should watch the movie for yourself. <br /> <br /> Just to let you know, we're talking about this movie another 20 years later and trying to explain it to people is not the easiest thing to do in the world.
