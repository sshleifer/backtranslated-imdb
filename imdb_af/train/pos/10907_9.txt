Was turned around the TV, and HBO showed a double rage of incredibly terrible medical conditions. So I went to my twin sister and said, "Hey, it looks nice," I really love documentaries, so we started watching. Initially I thought Jonni Kennedy was a young man, but then it was explained that because of his condition he never went through puberty, so the high voice and smaller body. He was on a crusade to raise money for his cause. He combined the most beautiful sense of humor with a beautiful sense of spirituality. I cried, looked, laughed, got up to get another Kleenex and then called out again. As soon as Jonni Kennedy's "time came" he flew to heaven to be with the angels. He was more than right; He learned his lessons from this life and he was free. I highly recommend it. If you do not fall in love with this man, you have no heart.
