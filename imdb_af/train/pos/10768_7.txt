I saw these ages when I was younger and never remembered the title, until one day I browse through John Candy's movie credits on IMDb and noticed an entry called "Once Upon a Crime ...". Something rang a bell and I clicked on it and after reading the plot summary brought back many memories. <br /> <br /> I found it to be very outdated despite the fact that it doesn't mean a "big" comedy. However, it is pleasantly pleasing and is a good riff on a Hitchcock formula of wrong identity and global excitement. <br /> <br /> The movie has great role-players, including an American couple who finds a woman's dog. while living in Europe and deciding to give it back to her for a reward - just to get her dead body on arrival. From there, the plot gets more and more quirky and goes after the police think they are the killers. <br /> <br /> Kind of a mix between "It's a crazy, crazy crazy world" and a lighter Hitchcock feature, it was directed by Eugene Levy and he managed to get some of his good friends. Get John Candy to die in it. The movie is mostly going on because of its cast, and the end has a funny little twist that is not completely unpredictable, but also unexpected.
