Steve Carell stars as a person you can relate to (kind) in Dan in real life, a movie I didn't expect to keep, but eventually liked it. Not that the movie is aloud, it's just that it has a big heart. We all like Steve Carell, that's not what fans of the office would expect from him, but you know what I like about this movie. <br /> <br /> Carell stars like Dan Burns, a widowed father who doesn't really love him. One weekend he and his daughters travel to see his family. As he goes there, he goes to a bookshop and falls to a woman. When he returns to his home, he finds out that his brother Mitch (Played by Dane Cook) is this woman (played by Juliette Binoche). <br /> <br /> Then in real life, at times, I found a little incredible. Is the Burns family really the kind of people who work together and play board games together and do a lot of other family things? I would doubt it very much. I don't know any family like this. Is it me to give it a thumb? No <br /> <br /> Then in real life: *** / ****
