Jane Austen will definitely approve of this one! <br /> <br /> Gwyneth Paltrow does a great job of capturing Emma's attitude. She is funny without being stupid, but elegant. She puts a very convincing British accent (I'm not British myself, maybe I'm not the best judge, but she misled me ... she was also excellent in "Sliding doors" ... sometimes I forget she's American ~!). <br /> <br /> Also brilliant are Jeremy Northam and Sophie Thompson and Phyllida Law (Emma Thompson's sister and mother) as the Bates wife. They almost steal the show ... and Mrs. Law doesn't even have any lines! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
