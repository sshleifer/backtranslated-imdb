This movie, while apparently based on a movie of the same title released by MGM in 1951 and exhibited by Janet Leigh, is still a good movie. In one of his best performances, Danny Glover brings George Knox, a short-tempered coach on his ballet, to life. As if this movie is being stacked, how about adding Christopher Lloyd (his stage experience working and displaying on screen performances, a wonderful actor), Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Third Rock of the Sun), Brenda Fricker and Good seasoned Irish actress), Tony Danza (even he is good at this movie), Matthew McConaughey (he stole the show in Dazed and Confused and his role may not be in the film, but he had exposure) Adrien Brody ( what I said about Matthew McConaughey is the same for Adrien, except the Dazed and Confused part, some great character actors like Taylor Negron (David), Tony Longo (Messmer), Jay O. Sanders (Ranch Wilder), Neal McDonough (Whitt Bass) and a seasoned veteran in one of his final appearances, Ben Johnson (Hank Murphy, owner of the California angels), and the rest of the film, do a good job, plus a great story that elevate to pretty much someone, I don't care what depressions you are in depression have not. I loved filming it as a child, and it brings back memories when I see it today. I need it on DVD. I recommend it to any parent who is looking for something their children haven't seen, and everyone else, for the matter.
