Sharp, keen, funny, fast, sexy, extravagant, sloppy, erotic, cordial and slick, Footlight Parade is a first-class entertainment that the movies are about. <br /> <br /> The realistic, satirical treatment gives a fresh edge to the fabric and its fit and line delivery is breathtaking. To think that they only started writing pictures 7 years before it started. The brilliance of the dialogue cannot match anywhere in the world, especially since realism has taken over the current play. <br /> <br /> This movie was created at a time when the Hayes content-restricted code was ignored and the result is a fresh, self-referring, critical and vibrant cinema that spoke directly to contemporary audiences, through depression and general anxiety disorders. I would recommend watching any movie of this period, that is, 1930-1935, for a vision of what popular theater might be.
