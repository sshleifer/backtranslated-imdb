Brilliant overwork by Lesley Ann Warren. Best dramatic oboe lady I've ever seen, and love scenes in clothing store is unmatched. The maize on the face is a classic, as good as anything in Blazing Saddles. The inciting of lawyers is also excellent. When he was accused of being a jacket, selling his boss and being dishonest, Pepto Bolt's lawyer kicked in, "I'm a lawyer," he says. Three funny words. Jeffrey Tambor, a favorite of the later Larry Sanders show, is also fantastic here as a crazy millionaire who wants to crush the ghetto. His character is more malicious than usual. The hospital scene, and the scene where the homeless enter a demolition station, are classic magazines. Look for the legs scene and the two big diggers fight (one bleeding). This movie gets better every time I see it (it's very often).
