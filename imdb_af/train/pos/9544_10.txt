Meatball Machine is an incredible splatter movie, it has an original plot with young love, buckets of blood and strange cruelty that change people into freaky robot war machines. <br /> <br /> Now the movie isn't for everyone. , people who like explosive movies or the movie Tetsuo: the Iron Man will delight it. <br /> <br /> The special effects can be on some points of the movie cheese, but don't suppose to take the movie very seriously. . <br /> <br /> All in all, it's great fun if you find budding romantics infected with slender crops like gobbles trying to destroy each other in bloody alien fights.
