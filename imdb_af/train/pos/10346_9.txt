What was there about 1939 that helped produce so many great Hollywood movies? Well, whatever, the magic can also be found in this Columbia picture. It's a long forgotten screwball comedy that Turner Classic Movies has started to show. (Maltin's movie book doesn't include it.) In almost every department, Amazing is Mr. Williams a jewel. <br /> <br /> This is the story of a first-rate police detective who can never get the time to marry his marriage. mean. As the wedding bells ring, he was called to the scene of a murder. The lady in question must learn the difficult way not only to pursue the crime, but to belong to the police force. There is a lot of laughter in the process. <br /> <br /> Once again, Melvyn Douglas proved that he had few bodies in light comedy. Joan Blondell was at the height of her career and is a pleasure. Edward Brophy and Donald McBride are hilarious. <br /> <br /> The movie goes a little too long, but who cares? The screw-ball comedies are always able to entertain, and this movie belongs right there with the best.
