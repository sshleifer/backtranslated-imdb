I remember remembering promotions for this show before it appeared in 1993. I was 8 and now at the age of 22 it feels strange to see this cult show begin and end and then look back. The 90's all of a sudden look so far away, that's a good decade. Anyway, I've always watched MonsterVision, as I am a huge fan of monster flashes and horror movies. It was like the 90's version of the Chiller Theater. If MST3K can get DVDs, why not Joe Bob's performance, MonsterVision was at least interesting and informative. Many of Joe Bob's remarks and information about the movies was just hilarious. Most of the films shown at the show were B or C grades, but it also showed many home movies, as well as the Hammer movies from England that were Toptop, as well as many with Ray Harryhausen's majestic stop motif. Many were oddball flicks that you didn't see anywhere else like the Japanese Sci-Fi movies, of course Godzilla known for almost everyone and independent movies like Metal Storm and Motel Hell. With the new decade of film conservation and more independent sensible directors, I think MonsterVision will be a great show for IFC to pick up, as they have already hit the IFC gazebo show. I'm sure this one day will be picked up again for nostalgic reasons, I'll have to wait and see. Until then, "It's Big Television"!
