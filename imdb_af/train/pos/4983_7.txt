A SHIRLEY TEMPEL short topic. <br /> <br /> It can ripen vigorously at Cabbage Milk Pete's Cafe when the local occurrence of diaper war BABIES comes for their afternoon milk break. <br /> <br /> This primitive little movie - a ghost of military movies - offers a few chuckles, but little else: small tots talk hard can start falling in a short time. Shirley Temple, who plays a double hip-swinging French fog, doesn't have much to do in this pre-celebrity performance. Highlights: The true signs of toddler hearing when some of the babies are unexpectedly soaked well and thoroughly with milk. <br /> <br /> Often overlooked or neglected, the one and two-line short subjects were helpful to the studios. As important training grounds for new or emerging talents, both in front of and behind the camera. The dynamics of creating a successful short topic was quite different from that of a film of a characteristic length, something similar to writing a short note short story rather than a novel. Economical to produce in terms of both budget and schedule and able to portray a wide variety of materials, short subjects were the perfect complement to the studio's feature films.
