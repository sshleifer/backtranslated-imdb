I only saw this movie in 1994 when it came out in 1994 and watched it recently and it is quite funny. I don't know if you need to understand hip hop in the 90's, but it helps if you do it. In the 90's when NWA and Public Enemy were at the top, there were internal quarrels within the groups and members as their separate ways (Ice Cube, Easy E, etc.). There was also the will of bs, accessible rappers who started the scene (Vanilla Ice, Freedom Williams from C & C Music Factory, etc.). This movie makes fun of everything in a way that looks like a real documentary. Kasi Lemmons plays an interviewer who spent a year in the life of a fictitious rap group name N.W.H. The members of the group are Ice Code (Rusty Condieff / director), Tasty Taste (Larry B Scott / Revenge of the Nerds and Tone Def (Mark Christopher Lawrence). They are an emerging rap group whose politics makes them controversial. nice to this movie is that it is so continually depicting the hip hop industry of the 80s, and the way it is fun, but if you know the 80's / 90's, you know how many of these things Yet, on its own, without hip-hop knowledge, it's still a funny, funny movie, and for all those who ask, yes, Spinal Tap comes first, but Spinal Tap is also not the first haunting movie. just as funny and in some ways, better than spinal tapes. Like spinal tapes for heavy metal, the fear of a black planet is to rap and the songs are also off hook. The DVD is lime full of extras to music videos from NWH as a group and solo artists Brilliant performances by Rusty Condieff and Larry B Scott.
