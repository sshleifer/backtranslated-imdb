It may be the best rockumentary ever - a British, better, it is spinal tap. The characters are credible, the plot is great, and you can really empathize with some of the events - like Ray's problem with the fit in the band. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is excellent. Real-time stuff, even if it's in the same key, will humming you for days for days. What I wanted was almost all the British role, with some of the favorite household names. Ray's wife is priceless. <br /> <br /> The movie never drags, it just fits in the right, and has some real funny parts in it. A generator of some very good catches! <br /> <br /> It's a hidden diamond.
