This movie gets it right. As a former USF Aviation Cadet, I can tell you this movie has it all. The stage of the application process. Waiting for word. The joy of acceptance. Worry about making it through the course. The sadness of watching your friends (maybe the best of them) was out. The fear of paying the ultimate prize - the death of those who participate at the end of the day. The glory of graduation. Always the fly, the fly, the fly. Many are called, but few are chosen. We paid to pay what we wanted to pay.
