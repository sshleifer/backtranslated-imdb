The title says it all. <br /> <br /> I'm not a film critic, and I won't act like the rest of the hilarious people commenting on this movie. <br /> <br /> Obviously this movie isn't "I have a multi-million dollar budget, but the plot was very well done, the acting was great and the cinematography was great! It looked like you had a lot of fun making this movie! I voted 9 out of 10 because the sound was strong on only one channel, rather than both, but I think it might be a mistake in recording the DVD. <br /> <br /> I'll definitely watch Other movies produced by Brain Damage Movies! <br /> <br /> Dylan O'Leary, role and crew, thank you!
