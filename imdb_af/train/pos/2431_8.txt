Famous was "known" for the tension and release style of the cartoon where the semi-main character is in a terrible danger, but being saved the last moment by the hero. This particular Casper is the only one I can remember where death actually takes a hand. But even in death there is another happy ending. <br /> <br /> The constant in the well-known cartoons is that "virtue always prevails". Popeye always comes in time in his spinach, Baby Huey always pushes the fox, Little Audery always teaches her lesson. And some FS cartoons are really dark and depressed. <br /> <br /> You have to give them credit. I love Looney Tunes and "Tom and Jerry" I don't think anyone has released a better cartoon product at that time than Paramount. Color, animation, music (the great Winston Sharples), editing, voices. a glowing example of the best that the art form had to offer.
