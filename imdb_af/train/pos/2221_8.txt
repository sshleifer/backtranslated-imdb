One night I stumbled upon the Bravo satellite station. Initially, I decided to see it from curiosity. To be honest, I wasn't disappointed. The main character is beautiful and her body is well displayed. You'd think her talents would be wasted if a shiver was wasted, but apparently not seen in the whole movie! My only real grip is the play of the supporting role, especially the actor playing Melnik. Christian is bad! The prison guard Hank is also tired. All he ever does is get drunk and make a bad attempt at his co-guard Wanda, but fortunately for us, the viewer and for Hank he comes off and dirty with Wanda near the end. The music used is quite tense and creates the perfect atmosphere for the executions. This movie looks good only for the beautiful, talented and very sexy Jennifer Thomas
