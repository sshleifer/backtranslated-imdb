The movie felt a lot from the beginning. I think it will play a better game than a movie, because the set and dramatization make a movie version look a bit too artificial. But it's pretty good, and the story and especially the dialogue is interesting. They took the dialogue pretty much exactly as it was from the real play. Perhaps this is a good introduction to Shaw's plays. <br /> <br /> The main character Raina has her head in the clouds & and a flair for the dramatic, and Helena Bonham Carter's acting here is a good job. Her fianc√©, Serges, is a bit too embarrassing to be a very attractive figure. Her parents are enough to entertain.
