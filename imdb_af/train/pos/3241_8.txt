Action. Comedy. Stress. This movie has it all. <br /> <br /> The plot is going to be 4 professional prophets, invited to take part in a lift in a small Montana town. every kind of crime movie archetype character is here. Frank, the master thought. Carlos, the weapon expert. Max, the explosive expert. Nick, the safe and Ray, the motor man. Unfortunately for Frank, he was attacked by 2 lomper detectives (depicted by Ed O'Niel and Daniel Roebuck) who drove him from New Jersey after sending the letters to the other. <br /> <br /> Our 4 characters meet at the station and from the beginning keep nobody apart or trust each other. At the mix, Frank is the fact that they are gone and they do not know why they have called together. <br /> <br /> Now, Frank is being taken back by the 2 detectives to New Jersey, but soon arrives on foot and tries to escape. to come back to the guys who have all sorts of problems of their own. <br /> <br /> Actually a good movie loaded with laughter and great acting. Just an overall good movie for anyone looking for a laugh or something a little different
