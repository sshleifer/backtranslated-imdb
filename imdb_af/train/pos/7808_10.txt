It's a movie that everyone should watch. Apart from the fact that South Africa is on its way to recovery, many countries are still in similar situations. It's been wonderfully aimed while Denzel Washington, in my opinion, has given the best performance in his career so far. Kline also gives a good performance, although perhaps not as stunning as Washington. John Thaw is also a good turn as the Chief of Police. <br /> <br /> There are so many possible areas where a film can fall over apartheid, but all of this is avoided. It would be easy to portray white people as the bad guys and blacks as the good guys, but Attenborough didn't. Certainly, there were some white characters who were inherently angry, like the Captain at the Soweto Uprising, but adding extra characters to all the characters made the movie unbearably long. Some people complain about the length of the movie as it is, but I think it takes two and a half hours to tell the whole story, because it's really an incredible one. <br /> <br /> The best scene In the film is that of Steve Biko's funeral. When the whole crowd starts singing the South African national anthem, it's probably one of, or not the most moving scenes I've seen. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen this movie yet, watch it. It may not be comfortable, but it's definitely worth it.
