My charity for Chris Rock varies with his movies, I hated him after Lethal Weapon 4, but then I hated everyone in that movie. I love him when he is himself and does not hold back, as in Dogma. Well, it's his best yet, didn't expect it to be so good. I took the ass all the time. Chris Rock delivers a wonderful story that is backed up by some of the funniest comedies I've seen for some time. Was crazy about it.
