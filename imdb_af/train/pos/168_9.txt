This is one of Joan Crawford's best talkies. It was the first Gable-Crawford pair, and made it clear to MGM and audiences that they were a sizzling team. The studio made seven more films with them as co-workers. <br /> <br /> The movie convincingly shows the downward move of a brother and sister who, after their father lost everything in the stock market accident, needs to care for and work for a life. Life is difficult in the Depression, and even their efforts to find just work are unpredictable and they use underworld. <br /> <br /> Joan Crawford is excellent as a socialist. She is smart, complex and credible. She even presses the theatrical stiffness of the other actors' early Talkie plays. Clark Gable is a diamond-in-the-rough, masculine and gruff than the non-nonsense gangster who gets involved in Crawford's character. In the same year he played a similar and even more successful role towards Norma Shearer in a free soul. He assures his position as top male gender symbol at MGM. <br /> <br /> If you like Crawford in this type of roll, don't miss 'Pay', which she did a year earlier, which is also among her best early talkie shows. <br /> <br />
