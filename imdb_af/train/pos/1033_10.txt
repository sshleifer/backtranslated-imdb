Say what you want about schmaltz. One beauty of this movie is that it is not pro-American. It is a morality that some Americans are called to high end and how they rose at the occasion. It is inspiring because it is about people with noble purpose. <br /> <br /> For me, the most interesting part of the movie is the education of Fanny and David Farrelly (Bette Davis's mother and brother). As Fanny says, "We were shaken out of the magnolias." <br /> <br /> In today's political climate, where a president has led us who lied to us and used 9/11 to bring out the absolute worst traits of people, we have sunk to the level of 9/11 killers to seek bloodthirsty revenge. It can't all happen to Mr. Bush attributed - we allowed him to lead us in that direction and even re-elected him after his lies were revealed. Now, with full justification, we're banned Americans around the world. <br /> <br /> Today we are watching this movie with a new awareness: That the rise of the power of Nazis in Germany was not due to a mistake in the German character, but a mistake in the man who allows us to rationalize everything that will commit our unfair and abominable acts. I don't compare George Bush with Adolph Hitler. But I point out how a leader can take us in a frenzy of terror, hatred, and hypnationalism to do contemptuous things. <br /> <br /> No matter how indecent, the extortionist, who will do everything that needs to be done for their own custody, is like the leaders of our country, those who support, and those who buried their heads so deep in the sand, that they can't even bother to vote. <br /> <br /> A movie like Watch on the Rhine reminds us of what we once wanted - a force for improving humanity - and having it in us to aim again for goals. exalted. <br /> <br /> Geoff
