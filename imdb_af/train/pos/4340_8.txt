I enjoyed this movie, maybe because I didn't see any reviews. It was lovely and a bit of a skirt. I don't know why it didn't splash any more than it did. Regarding the story, I can relate to some aspects of the Paul Reiser character, and I could "see my dad" in Falk's character. Remembered me a lot last time when I was a child and also listened to my grandparents. If you enjoy movies like Grumpy Old Men or On Golden Pound, this is your movie. A "sleeper", in my opinion, and one of those good stories. Peter Falk and Paul Reiser had many wonderful oral, but nothing was exaggerated. I'd say it's at least 8, maybe higher.
