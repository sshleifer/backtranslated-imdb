Hollywood North is a satirical look at the time in Canadian film history when the Canadian government hosted major tax routes for films in Canada. Most of the time it was treated as a tax safe or a cheap way to get American movies. For example, Porky's came out of it. In any case, Matthew Modine plays a beginner producer who wants to make an adaptation of a beloved Canadian novel. However, to get the money, he needs an American name. He gets a loose canon and learns to compromise to the point where the movie no longer looks like the book on which it was originally based. It plays well in Canada, but can't be understood outside the Great White. Americans will think we are satirizing ourselves, but will miss the point that we are actually satirizing. For Canadians 8/10 for the rest of the world 5/10.
