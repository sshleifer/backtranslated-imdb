This show has escaped reality over the past ten years. Unfortunately I will miss it. Although Atlantis filled the hole a bit. <br /> <br /> The last episode of SG1 (on television anyway) was beautiful. Robert wrote something that felt close to reality. As if trying to explain how it was on the set of the show. (Everyone who's been working together for so long is tied up and downs, but over the years they have become a family). I thought it was a great way to end in spite of anyone else's criticism. <br /> <br /> SG1 was something special and time and time again it left me over the threshold of disbelief and amazement. The wonderful characters, stories, directors, writers. From episode 1 I was addicted. The combination of action, science, drama and especially the comedy worked so well that made me stay. <br /> <br /> There are no real words to fully express what this show meant to me. I can only thank those who have kept the show so fresh and entertaining for so many years. It inspired me to do many things I thought were impossible. <br /> <br /> I watch the movies next year and I really hope there will be a number of them. I never want to die. <br /> <br /> Stargate SG1 - 1997 - 2007?
