"Domino" is widely condemned on this site for its frenetic editing style and "ill" photography. It's opponents call its superficiality and criticize the implementation of style over substance. I couldn't disagree anymore. I believe that "Domino" represents the absolute highlight of Tony Scott's film career. <br /> <br /> After Tony Scott created the prevailing Hollywood action film style throughout the eighties and early nineties, Tony Scott moved progressively closer to a more subjective style of theater. As much as 'Crimson Tide', Scott used his stylistic talent to portray the inner worlds of his characters. The claustrophobia and drama aboard a ship on a nuclear submarine were embodied in the excellent use of long-lined, combined with Dutched-angle framing. It was then transferred to "Enemy Of The State" and "Spy Game" representing the world of surveillance and espionage respectively. <br /> <br /> "Man On Fire" was an extreme departure, a move to an expressionist more picturesque aesthetic. Here Scott used an outdated hand-curved camera and flash frames to express his character's explosive anger. Although not quite successful, it introduced the techniques that would find their full expression in "Domino". <br /> <br /> In the framework of an FBI interrogation, Domino put the life of the infamous bounty hunter through her story. deviating fragments of memory. She understands the memories we all do - in fragments, flashes and brief snaps. While Domino tells her story verbally, Scott interprets it visually and not only illustrates the events she describes, but also the point of view they lead. She does have "traces of mescaline" in her system, but her individual vision is in any case unusual. It's a woman who avoided the life of luxury for bounty hunting. <br /> <br /> This is when Domino begins to relate the events leading to her captivity that Scott really rips. Along with the cinematographer, Dan Mindel and composer Harry-Gregson Williams Scott orchestrates a postmodern canvas of contemporary Americana. Gradually we begin to realize that unusual, though she may be Domino, no longer coincides with the 90210 culture she rejected. As she ventures through this cultural blend, Scott makes his viewer more aware of the innocence it destroys by the underprivileged children who introduce the story. Eventually, Scott portrays their salvation as the only escape we have on this surreal journey. <br /> <br /> To criticize this movie for being stylized, is related to the criticism of a Picasso or a Pollock for the fact that it is not recognizable. Like any great painting, the meaning in "Domino" is in the surface and the surface is everything. <br /> <br /> I was by no means associated with Scott Free, but has always been a great fan of Tony Scott's work.
