It's amazing that the actress P.J. Soles did not become a big star after playing Riff Randall, # 1 fan of the punk rock group Ramones, in Rock 'n' Roll High School. Solde is so exuberant, you don't mind, it is of course too old to be in high school (the fact is outlined by seeing all the kids 24). The movie is a quick freak that doesn't kick out; everything is blown to the end at smithereens, and that is just as it should be. Mary Woronov, an intimate kinky and funny presence as the Nazi-like principal, initially gets a big, one-person piece where Frisbees flies dangerously close to her head (how much do they use or was it a fluke?) Dey Young is very attractive as soles' best, Kate Rambeau. The weakest link, ironically, in this "High School" chain is the Ramones. They can't act, they're not funny and their concert segment lasts too long. One Ramones song, "I Want You Around", is treated as a fantasy and is well captured; Other accidental songs are good, especially a rare Paul McCartney ballad heard near the beginning ("did we meet something before?"). Great fun! *** of ****
