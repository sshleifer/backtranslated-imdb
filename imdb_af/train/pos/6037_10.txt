What a BIG British movie, a screaming laugh and sexy Gary Stretch, and o, many bicycles and beautiful Welsh countryside. <br /> <br /> Members of our club appear in the ARROWHEAD Bike and Trike Social Club as extras! Hurray !! <br /> <br /> There are some really hilarious pieces, good acting, a good idea. <br /> <br /> With director Jon Ivay at a show in Wareham, Dorset. A great man, on earth and a good laugh. This movie has to be supported, as all great British movies should! <br /> <br /> So, look and see if you can, they have a website with theaters that show it, so find one near you! /> <br /> I can't wait to get the DVD. Some of our bike friends have seen the movie two or three times and can't get enough of it. <br /> <br /> Amanda
