I watched this movie on the cable, it was really funny, from the stereotype police chief to the stereotype big bad guys, jay leno and mr. mayate of karate star in this good comedy about a prototype car. I compare this movie to "RUSH HOUR" in which a local policeman has to work with an Asian police officer to settle a case. The hunting through the farming market in downtown Detroit brings back memories. Enjoyable soundtrack, good writing, I give it 10/10.
