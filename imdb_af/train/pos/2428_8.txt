As an old white housewife, I still appreciate that Laurence Fishburne is one of our best actors. Anyone who appreciates his work as in Deep Cover can enjoy watching the amazing play of this actor. Since I think it's his legal message, it can be even more interesting. All the plays are pretty good. If you can't take lower Manhattan junky worlds or the reality of crime life (not glorified action-shooting-em-ups), then it's not a movie you'll enjoy. This is Mr. Fishburne's usual contribution to incredibly subtle relationships. I would love to see Larry and Anthony Hopkins one day in a movie.
