As for many here, I can't praise the Cast and Crew who developed Talespin and others who made them through My Childhood. Like everyone commenting on this, the quality of the quality not only enjoys the animation, but also the quality of the story. lines and the characters. <br /> <br /> To classify this artwork as a "Cartoon" can never speak speech. This is actually an insult to the class as a "Cartoon", Talespin is an animation and nothing less, it is clearly the greatest work of genius to be produced on Disney to date. If Disney pulled it out of the air, they realized what they were doing and I'm sure their souls have been tortured with regret ever since. <br /> <br /> I'll take a moment to explain. Of the first to be one-sided to the last I think is Darkwing Duck, Disney has been plagued with failures due to political correctness and has taken back a Quantum Leap since, They prefer the quantity over Quality not to mention the room full of Monkey's stories, I can't see my kids watching the sensible "Cartoons", they are throwing out in fear that they will all be homer Simpson, some time in the future and 50% of the debt will be on me to go to Let it look, I can't let it happen. That's why I did all the shows from the late 80's to the mid 90's on a hard drive one day. My kids couldn't get through the "Cartoon Crap" of today and to enjoy the last childhood I have and stick to and I owe it all to Talespin. <br /> <br /> Speech spins for me are without a doubt the best Animation ever produced in the world for the sake of it's depth, Charm, White, Compassion, Emotion and Lack of really bad quality and story lines many of which today has. Do you see any of the content in the words "Ed, Edd and Eddie or anything else you can think of? The rubbish produced today can be compared to a 3-year-old's inexhaustible Hyroglyph depicting a Picasso. br /> <br /> The next time you watch an episode of Talespin, watch the wood grain on any wooden object or building like Higher for Hire and salivate about the quality of craftsmanship and effort put into this animation. the one shot backgrounds were done as if they were going to use them again and again, The Buildings Look at the Art Deco movement that was popular in the period depicted, even the vehicles are real life, OK, not all episodes were fantastic in animation but the lower grade scenes were covered by the superior scenes, which all looked at the end of the episode and you will probably never even notice unless you have focused and attention to detail. <br /> <br /> The one thing I like about this is what I saw s to mention the "deliberate mistakes" or "intended mistakes" in each episode and some have two, for example in sheepskins where Rebecca says, "You're on something Baloo" and Baloo's answers. "Who, I! I'm as innocent as a schoolboy" look at Rebecca's eyes, I have spoiled the rest of the Baloopers but just keep an eye on them next time. <br /> <br /> Everyone's comments are scared and 100% correct. I have nothing else to add that others have not already said here. , Disney, WAKE UP and smell the coffee, You've been sleeping for over a decade. Stop producing waste and bring quality back to Animations and stop producing "Cartoons". We have the proof of what you can do and we want to get it back. as soon as possible.
