An absolutely brilliant show. The second season started where the first ended, with a lot of mystery. Suspension in most, if not all, episodes and mystery anywhere. One that makes me think and think. It's really amazing how the author can get out of all the connections and bring all the characters together and combine all of these elements to make the characters' lives in the show so meaningful. Never get excited and I'm looking forward to the new season. Hopefully more secrets will be revealed and at the same time more puzzles are solved. Good choice of roll casting for this show, fits the characters perfectly. Can't really wait to finally discover the secret. Hopefully all the hype will not spoil the end.
