The most versatile fat man in martial arts does this again. An early Sammo movie mimicking his character's hero, Bruce Lee, Sammo is incredibly Lee as in his actions and fight. The way he slips into Bruce's style and then back to his own, more famous kung fu, is a joy to watch and shows how perfect and adaptable he is in his art. Throw a little slapstick of humor so loved by this kind of movie and it's a movie that's all comedy (some unintentional, like the fake black man), action and some incredible combat tones. <br /> <br /> A great beer and friends movie worth an hour and a half from someone's time.
