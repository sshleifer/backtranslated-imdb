This movie takes you to another time when there was a different pace in everyday life. We get an idea how families had to deal with the war and how quickly our young men sent to fight. A very pleasant look at the past and a reminder that war accidents are not just happening in the front. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, many of us have never had to go through what our grandparents, grandparents or parents did during a war. This movie, I think, is a small thank you. Peter Outerbridge looks incredible like a young Peter O'Toole and Russell Crowe is absolutely charming and as Australian as he can be. It's definitely worth listening to, "High Flight" and let me wonder what he can do with Shakespeare.
