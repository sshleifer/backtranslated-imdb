Oliver! the musical is a favorite of mine. The music, the characters, the story. It all looks perfect. In this version of the timeless classic novel, theater music turns, director Carol Reed brings the Broadway hit to life on the screen. <br /> <br /> The transition from musical to movie music is not an easy one. You need to have the right voices, the right set, the right font and the right game. All signs show yes to this play. It almost looks like it was written for the screen! <br /> <br /> Our story takes place throughout old England, where a boy named Oliver manages to work out of the orphanage. He winds his way through the country to London where he meets a group of juvenile criminals, led by Dodger, the clever talk, quick handbag. The leader of this gang is called Fagin, an older man who sells all the stolen goods. <br /> <br /> But everything isn't good in London, when Bill Sykes played by Oliver Reed and his loving girl, Nancy, entwined with Oliver, Fagin and his young troops, and the law. The result is a wonderful story of love, love and good music numbers. <br /> <br /> Whether you want music or not, you're listening to these songs and you'll be humming all day long. Oliver! is a triumph on and off the stage and is a timeless work of art.
