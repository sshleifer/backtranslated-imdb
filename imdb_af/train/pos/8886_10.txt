I wasn't alive in the 60's, so I can't guarantee this movie was a completely accurate presentation of the era, but it is definitely a moving and fulfilling experience. There are some excellent performances, especially by Josh Hamilton (from With Honors), Jerry O'Connell (Sliders), who plays brothers shared by the war. Bill Smitrovich, a character actor who has been ignored for many years, gives a sad performance as his strict father, who is forced to question his own beliefs and values, as one of his sons prides himself on getting to Vietnam. go, but return empty, while the other is exactly the opposite. All in all, it's a powerful and heartwarming movie I hope everyone gets a chance to experience.
