Not for people without quick sense or without a drop of Balkan blood in their veins. If you don't have one of these, you can't understand it. And if you don't understand it, you can't enjoy it. :) For example, if you think Picasso is a name of a car manufactured by Citroen, probably if you see a Picasso painting, you just walk over and decide that it is a trash of a street maker. :) So don't judge before you try to understand it :) In the end I think it's a MUST for everyone with open minds. Still, my N1 remains The Shawshank Redemption! And remember that not all things can be placed in frames. Because there are things in this world, any framework will not fit.
