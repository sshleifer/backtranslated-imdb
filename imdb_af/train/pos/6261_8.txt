Fantastic documentary of 1924. This early 20th century geography of today's Iraq was powerful. Look at it and tell me if Cecil B. DeMille didn't take notes before making his Ten Commandments. Photographer Merian C. Cooper later created Cinerama, an idea that was likely to have climbed while the remarkable landscapes in this film were filmed. Fans of Werner Herzog will find this movie to be a treasure, with sad stories of battle, complemented by the country around them. The human ability has never become so clear. The fact that it was made when it was, shows not only the will of the subjects, but also the filmmakers themselves.
