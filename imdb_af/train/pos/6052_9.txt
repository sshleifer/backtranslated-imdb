Highly recommended !! <br /> <br /> A well-written, funny movie that will appeal to everyone with a sense of humor !!!. Give it a go, it's good to see an Independent British Film than to own it against the big established studios !! Definitely worth adding to any movie collection. There are scenes in this movie that I'm sure many people will be able to relate to. You will laugh aloud at the antics and enjoy the good soundtrack. I especially enjoyed the Orb's version of Jimmy Cliff's Vietnam and The Tower of London's recording on Freebird. <br /> <br /> Go give it a little ............ you won't be disappointed.
