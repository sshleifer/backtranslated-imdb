I am often asked what makes Love Trap different. This is how I respond to the question: 1) It introduces characters - one in particular - that has never before been seen in the movie. <br /> <br /> 2) It reveals more truth about love and delves deeper into the concept of love than any other American film ever made in my humble opinion. <br /> <br /> 3) Structurally, as in the road The story is told, it's different from any love story you've ever seen. <br /> <br /> 4) It provides extremely timely insights on various cultural issues, within and outside the Black community. <br /> Over time, people will see Love Trap as being completely original work in this era, refreshing, authentic and honest. It is a rare morality team full of food for thought. <br /> <br /> Visit www.lovetrapmovie.com for complete and accurate information on this movie.
