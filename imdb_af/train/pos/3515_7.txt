Pretty good picture or a man was in the wrong place at the wrong time. If the murderer wants to hit the woman, why not just drop her off and let the police try to find out? Involving all these characters in the plot is dangerous not to mention all the bugs you need to worry about. Why did the depressed woman go out to the bar when she could barely sit in a chair or say a word? Is there really police out there, what are clever cracks, bangs, grinning monkeys that approach a suspect in such a slick way? It probably played well before the wheel was invented, but today it's so thin and incredible. Capture the manic thrush by Elisa Cook; his frenetic hammer never fitted the recording once. His crazy facial expressions existed for off-kilter stick synchronization.
