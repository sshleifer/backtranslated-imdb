... that the Bette Davis version of this movie was better than the Kim Novak version. <br /> <br /> Despite all the other comments written here, I prefer the Bette Davis version, though the Novak version has a more coherent story line. <br /> <br /> But: Davis' Mildred's raw emotions seem to me more suited to a messy girl who looks easy to become a prostitute. <br /> <br /> And these are the raw emotions that are part of what the poor doctor falls in love with. He has emotions of despair, of failure, of "differentness" - strong emotions that he suppresses. Davis' Mildred, on the other hand, shows her emotions immediately and without disapproval. She has no feelings of despair, or of failure, or of "differentness"; On the contrary, she has only survived as a poor Cockney woman in the Victorian era. <br /> <br /> Novak's portrayal was a more vulnerable Mildred than Davis, almost throughout the movie. Davis' Mildred was never ** vulnerable until she actually had to go to the doctor and ask for help. And when he leaves her - for her method of keeping body and soul together and constantly taking advantage of his love for her - she probably unleashes the most passionate rejection of snobbery, holier than you've ever seen on the screen: " I wiped out my mouth I've done away with my mouth! "Novak's vulnerability was excellent. Davis's realism was monumental. <br /> <br /> IMDb votes agree!
