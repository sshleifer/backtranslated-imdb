I think this movie will only work on people who are all turned off by the huge hype of Lord of the Rings. Well, so I was. And so, I really love this movie. I especially like all the flawless superheroes of LotR who have been so perfect and carelessly parodied. Most brilliant is the counterpart of Gandalf (the brave and wise and completely humorous know-it-all wizard): Almghandi, the cowardice and brain-dead transvestite. Sauron's peer ("Sauraus" from East Germany, of course) wears a simple bucket with eyelids as a helmet. Aragorn's alter ego is another accident that caused an accident trying to test his broken sword ("Ulrike" the legend) with placard tape. And "Strunzdumm" (Wormtong's counterpart) indeed has a strong resemblance to Brad Dourif! And don't forget Grmpfli and Heidi ... huh-huh
