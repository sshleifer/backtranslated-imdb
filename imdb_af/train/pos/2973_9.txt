Here's a movie that's really funny at any moment it covers. How can it not be said that these movie stars are the creators of South Park and directed by David Zucker? When I first saw this movie, I didn't immediately realize that Coop and Doug were really Matt and Trey, but their talent in acting and writing became just as impressive. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that they were really Matt and Trey. The humor is sometimes rough, sometimes dirty, sometimes brilliant, sometimes subtle, sometimes hard and sometimes silly, but overall, it's a hell of a movie that is undoubtedly under appreciated. Well, actually, it's crazy. Totally insane.
