I was never a big fan of television until I first watched 24. I came in late in the series. Season 5 ended before I even saw my first episode. It was a series 3 episode that was on my older DVR (digital video tape recorder) box while I was home for the weekend. It made that one episode for me and sink into the world of Jack Bauer. And boy was I trapped !! I watched the following six episodes without looking. The next day I went to Blockbuster and signed up for an unlimited passport for twenty dollars, and it is unnecessary to say it's the biggest, stronger money I've ever spent. I watched the first three seasons in three weeks. This is 72 40 minute episodes !!! I will say that to find out what happens next is easier on DVD than waiting a whole week. I can only imagine the prospect of watching Season 6 Week to Week! I find it a little abuse and cruel, but I'm going to try it and look just like the rest of America! The DVR is set up and you can bet I will be at the bit!
