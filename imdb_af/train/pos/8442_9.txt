The movie was excellent, except for some of the Esposito screens. I enjoyed how it brought every detective on the series and wrapped some plotlines that were not resolved in the series (thanks to NBC ...). It was wonderful to see Pembleton and Bayliss together at their most human and basic people. Braugher and Secor did a good job, but as usual it will be overlooked. It was hurt to see that it was the end of the murder. Reminders, ties and reviews on CourtTV are just not the same as seeing them, come every Friday. But the film did its job and did it well and presented a good portrayal of life after Al's retirement and the family relationship that existed between the unity. I enjoyed it a lot.
