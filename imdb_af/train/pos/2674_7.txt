If the dismissal of the boat, on the boat, on the bus, on the bus, it is a way to waste time. Then you have to go back to the Hollywood movies that wrap this section in one montage to reach. the money shots. And so you leave loose and in the biographical limbo that results in you not really seeing the realities of life. The long stretched travel series actually gives the viewer the same frustration and 'wait-in-line' feel the characters have to endure. Frustrating? Yes. Necessary? Indeed. The limbo of that journey is the key to the "carelessness" of this Turkish family. Beautiful movie with great acting. Sad but worth it.
