I watched this movie a few times and found it to be very good. This movie is also known as "Castle of Terror", "Kis of Terror", and "Dance Macabre". Barbara Steele is her usual beautiful / creepy self. George Riviere, the male chief, does a good job with his role. The whole movie drips with atmosphere, and there is a lot of tension. The camera angles are good and the acting, for the most part, is not bad. This film is quite suitable for a rainy day or evening. I have the DVD uncut version, which is much better than the modified TV version. Grab popcorn, turn off the lights, sit back and enjoy. John R. Tracy
