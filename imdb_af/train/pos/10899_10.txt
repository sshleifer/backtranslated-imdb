I laughed so hard during this movie that hurt my face. Ben Affleck was hilarious and reminded me of a nice boy Jack Black in this role. Gandolfini gives his typical A show. The whole movie is funny, the story is pretty good and the comic moments are fantastic. I didn't expect in this movie, so maybe. That is why I am so surprised to get out of the movie that is good and healthy. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys comedy, loneliness during the holidays and / or with the family. The best part of this movie (for me anyway) was the subtle bits of humor that caught me completely off guard and laughed for a long time after the rest of the audience stopped. On behalf of the scene involving the Christmas tree lighting. Go see it and enjoy a good laugh!
