I saw that this movie is a Jane Austen addicted and always feels dubious about the cinematographic representation of the complexity of her novels. Well, this transposition is simple, accurate, intelligent, delicate, careful, tactful, respectful, intense, in a word, perfect! br /> <br /> "Emma" is one of Austen's most beautiful and funniest novels, thanks to overall irony-penetrating situations and characters. The film respected this subtle irony, not ignoring the comic element (Miss Bates above all). What brought me in the novel and the film makes it clear is the deep knowledge of the human life shown by the English novelist and the modern look that women, men and their relationship deal with, and it's amazing when we think how an 18th-century female writer, who lived almost a secluded life, could grasp such depth and truth of life as she did: what fascinates me most and still. We can feel this modernity through the film: replace costumes and use a more current language, but the situations, the feelings, the ideas will be extremely modern. I think of the morbid interest in other people's lives, or the enlightening envy that is now ruling women's relationships, and still having trouble revealing, and expressing their feelings, especially love: every situation gets universal and out-of-time value. <br /> <br /> The film is very talented and offers very good and extremely brilliant performances: a young Gwyneth Paltrow is particularly suited to this role (today it is probably too mature), Toni Colette is simply big. And how did I envy them for the wonderful dresses they could wear! And then, the breathtaking English countryside, where every situation gets such a magical and dreamy dimension ... a very enjoyable and deserving movie.
