It could have been better if it was directed by someone with more experience. Shumlin did not do a bad job, but it is not a wonderful work of filmmaking. <br /> <br /> However, this is a beautiful movie. I loved it as local channels used it. Graham Greene is one of my favorite writers of the last century. Some pretty bad movies are made from his novels and stories. (Many love "The Fallen Idol", but I'm not among them. I think I saw and liked "Brighton Rock" a few years ago, but maybe I just think of the novel.) This is wonderful cast. Charles Boyer does not come as Spanish. But it seems he has the perfect temperament for this character - tired, careful, caring. Lauren Bacall is appealing as the British girl falls to him. But the supporting players are the best: Katina Paxinou is excellent. Her performance is a small Grand Guignol, but I am writing to the director. Peter Lorre, who meets us first when he teaches Boyer in an Esperanto-language universal language, is excellent - as always. <br /> <br /> And Wanda Hendrix can break the hardest heart. She comes across as an early early teenager. The character wants to be useful. She does her best. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie. Not without reservations. The discussion is mainly that it is a little coyote. But the story and acting can hardly be improved.
