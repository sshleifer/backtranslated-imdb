I watched FIDO on a movie channel and I have to say that I became an instant fan. The movie feels like a comic strip that manages the look and feel of the surreal 1950s. You know the healthy decade when they danced at Elvis while dropping nuclear bombs in the desert just to do so. People were so naive back, then it was scary and the idea that people with a clean cut would find it normal to have zombies as pets, actually works here. <br /> <br /> Kudos for this Canadian production, the colorful crisp cinematography and the excellent cast, including Carrie Anne Moss, Billy Connolly, Henry Czerny and the child. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that this movie was not a bigger hit. It deserves more recognition. It is much better than the things of Tim Burton or the SHAUN OF THE DEAD team. Oh good. However, this is an immediate classic.
