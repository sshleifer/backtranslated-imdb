I need to mention two failures for you to understand that this movie has passed brilliantly where they failed: "A Scanner Dark" and "Immortel Ad Vitam". If you were excited about the concepts of these two movies and feel extremely disappointed (like me), you'll probably enjoy the Renaissance. It plunges you into the world of a future Paris. It's not quite dystopies. They did the animation so well that I thought it was rotoscope, but from what I can say, it wasn't, it was just moving. The facial expressions are wonderful! Not since TRON have I seen a fantasy world so well displayed in an animation / live hybrid. The Black and White medium is used to focus your attention slowly on the subject of the scene; My favorite effect was what they did with headlights, look for it. The director plays with your attention and confusion, but you are finally satisfied by finding the thread he wants you to find. The overall effect is a hard and eager urban world, filled with little surprises. <br /> <br /> The plot is secondary, but it's not terrible. This is noir-ish. There is a background for most of the main characters who give them depth. There is again. There are "sets" so you can feel that you are in different places in Paris. There is some action, and even a car hunt. I have to see this one again to get everything. I also recommend a very large screen to see this as the "sets" are detailed and the credits are small.
