Footlight Parade is one of the best of the 1930's musical extravaganzas comedy. A funny screenplay and an all-star cast including Jimmy Cagney, beautiful Joan Blondell, Dick Powell, and Ruby Keeler make this movie a cut above the rest. Targeted and choreographed by the creative genius Busby Berkeley, this movie will grab you from earmuff to end. <br /> <br /> Of course, Busby is the undisputed master of the Hollywood musical with "Gold Diggers from 1933" and "42nd Street" to his credit (as dance director). Footlight Parade is characterized by hundreds of rare-dressed choir girls, a Berkeley brand. The extended dance numbers were shot with just one camera and Busby was the first director to film nearest dancers. His obsession with beautiful legs and "rear view" shots is clearly shown here. The general effect is highly erotic and enchanting. <br /> <br /> Our son, Jimmy Cagney, plays Chester Kent, a producer of "prologues" or short musical stage productions performed in movie theaters to entertain the audience before the talks. showed. He is surrounded by crooked partners, a corporate spy and a gold digger. Although Cagney had a solid background in vaudeville, it was the first film in which he showed his dancing talents. Joan Blondell is unforgettable as Cagney's wise-cracking, love-secretary. And Ruby Keeler is as rich as ever. <br /> <br /> The movie climbs with three outstanding production numbers, "Honeymoon Hotel", "The Waterfall" and "Shanghai Lil", each a masterpiece and probably not duplicated in today's Hollywood where so-called "special effects" are creative cinematography replaced. <br /> <br /> Claudia's Bottom Line: Slim and erotic, with some of the best musical production numbers ever placed on celluloid. An enjoyable depression era skirt.
