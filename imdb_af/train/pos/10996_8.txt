Who can watch a movie, look at Lucy Liu and not be cute. The woman is incredibly beautiful and a talented actress. It's a tough combination to find a few days. And Jeremy Northam. I heard many times, but I never really noticed him. My advice to Hollywood is: "Use it more." <br /> <br /> Now about the movie: I watched it in one of my cemetery shift. I do not recommend it to anyone. It's a bit too complicated and mysterious for that. I still can't believe I didn't see the end. I'm not going to say why it will spoil the evil movie. Although it is said, it is enough. <br /> <br /> Now I have to cast my vote on this movie. I love the dark mystical story, the actors did a good job and I love the directors (natali) work in the past. There isn't a big audience for this kind of thing, it's also pretty risky. You know what, I'm just going to give this work, because everyone should see it. Then again, 1 point deduction causes there is always room for improvement.
