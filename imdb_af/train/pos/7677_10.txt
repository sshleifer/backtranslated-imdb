Wow, this movie had a huge impact on me, it moved me. It's a great story about a girl in Cambodia who is being sold in the sex trade. I can't stop thinking about the fate of the girl named Holly. The movie is realistic. The film was an eye-opener, I can't imagine anyone moving away without helping to make a change to this terrible problem that exists. <br /> <br /> The content of the movie was very moving. It was one of the best movies I've seen this year. The <br /> <br /> girl playing Holly does a fantastic job with her character. Ron Livinston gives a fantastic show. The movie moved me to tears. It tells an important message to be heard worldwide. Everyone should see this movie. I think this movie will make a difference, I loved it!
