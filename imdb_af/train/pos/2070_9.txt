Martin Sheen, Michelle Phillips, Stuart Margolin and the late Vic Morrow are the human stars of this movie about a young man looking for answers about his brother's death. Mr. Sheen, Mr. Margolin and Mr. Morrow, everyone has their first performances in their respective roles. Mrs. Phillips has the slightly less enviable task of finding a television movie (twenty-five years ago) by providing the "sex interest" in another sexless movie. The real star, however, is the "California Kid"; A 1934 Ford coupe, borrowed from Jake Jacobs, was sitting in front of a camera and given a workout that would lure the viewer, blow and hold the front of the seat with spectacular anticipation. <br /> <br /> The Action Screens are spectacular (though some of the dialogue is a bit lame) making it a fine evening's distraction. That's how all "motorcycle movies" should be made. <br /> <br /> Try to catch this one on the late movie channel; it is worth the sleep.
