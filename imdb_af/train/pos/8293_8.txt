As a 90 minute experience, this is not the standard of 'Drive', as the actors clearly show their trade at the `Who am I? ' Learned? academy, while the action series are generally not better than those in the excellent Mark Dacascos beat em-up. But those who enjoyed 'Drive' (and I thought it was wonderful!) Will undoubtedly enjoy it as well. You will definitely not rewind back to the start and look at everything again, but you will definitely look back on some action scenes for a long time. <br /> <br /> It is refreshing to see that the art of quality combat choreography is still practiced, though not in Hong Kong, and I would like to see what these guys could do with the budgets, time and respect given to people like Yuen Woo-ping and Corey Yuen Kuei. If you sit through the first half hour and are not crazy about the horrible dialogue, then you are in a surprise. Bosch is great, and can really make a move with beautiful acrobatics, kicks and simple acts of bravery. <br /> <br /> If you're lucky enough to be within 500 miles of a copy, track it down and watch It. It's not Shakespeare. In fact, it's less articulated than Coolio in China Strike Force, but you'll be impressed with both the performances and the pain felt by the stunt team. (I'm pretty sure there's no safe way to land directly on your land, or be forced to shake a wooden roof by a speed vehicle!?). <br /> <br />
