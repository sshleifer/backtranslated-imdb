The actors play great, especially Kenneth Branagh himself. It's good that Robin Williams plays Osiric's comedy role, otherwise it might be a bit strange to see him in such a production. It is really great that Kenneth decided to use the full version of the text. This certainly does not happen too often. The viewers can see the whole, not the chosen ones, by the directors. Also - thank God that the film is in a classic form; NO for surreal fanfaberies! Although "Tytus Andronicus" was impressive, but Hamlet is another story, this is my point of view.
