So it made only 7.6 on this site for TV movies? Bah! Humbug! Without a doubt, this 1984 version of Dickens's classic story is the best ever made. And yes, the Hound saw the 1951 version which was also good, but not good enough. The lack of color may be the biggest flaw in the version, although the play was wonderful. <br /> <br /> George C. Scott is simply incredible like Ebenezer Scrooge. We all know the story of this solid businessman haunted by the ghost of his dead partner, then by three other spirits later that night. Scott is pretty horrible like Scrooge. Too horrible in fact for some critics who claim he cannot find the new glory he wakes up on Christmas morning after the spirits get to know him a valuable lesson. But hey, it's George C. Scott. He will never dance in the street in the joy. He has too much dignity, and his Scrooge projects his emotion in a realistic way. <br /> <br /> The supporting performances are uniformly excellent, such as the costumes, music and scenery. 19th century London comes to life in Clive Donner's visionary style. The film even frightens into various scenes that include the spirits. However, the important story of morality shines in every frame. <br /> <br /> You won't see this version on television anymore, and this is a disappointment. The 1984 version of A Christmas Carol should be a required part of every household celebration of the holiday. When the decorations come out of the basement, this movie must be found in the DVD player at least once during the season. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> The Hound.
