It's really a good movie. Some of the songs have become immortal and the dance of Fred and Ginger is their best ever. But basically, all of Fred's and Ginger's movies are the same. After the song and dance are over, it's the other characters in the movie that makes the movie work. What really bother me is why all the negative comments about Randolph Scott? His romance with Harriet Hilliard and the subplot of the movie is why I watch it over and over. He adds to this movie, it doesn't. He has a winning personality and a big smile. Randy is in my top ten all time favorite list. It's great to see him as something other than a cowboy. OK, so he's not really a good actor, but like many other stars: Errol Flynn, Alan Ladd, Victor Mature, etc. He was very nice and could sometimes get up at the top. Al Fred and Ginger's movies had subplots that were dependent on other actors to fill in the space between the musical numbers, otherwise the movie would have to be shortened by about half an hour. I just wish more people would appreciate Randy and I had a need to stand up.
