Oh noir. My favorite genre. Otto Preminger's succession to Laura is a film noir envisaged in a post-war New York, where corruption and violence run. Dana Andrews dies as Sergeant Mark Dixon, a detective whose brutal tactics landed him in hot water with his superiors. <br /> <br /> When he accidentally kills a murder suspect, Dixon tries to blame crime boss Tommy Scalese. Dixon is close to achieving his goal when he becomes involved with the dead man's beautiful Morgan Taylor. Of course, in typical noir fashion, things are going down the hill quickly. <br /> <br /> While the movie does not show an interesting camera or narrative, it has a constant tone of fear and gloom. Like most big noirs, it's also great, the viewer is sucking from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Yet, like most of Preminger's work films, it's not something I will see again. It lacks the verbal wit of Wilder, the visual flamboyance of Hitchcock or the spatial experimentation of Welles. As Lang's later work, "Sidewalk" feels very much a "clone" of what a noir should be, instead of something really artistic really. <br /> <br /> Themed the movie is nothing special. It's about a policeman who is slowly becoming a criminal. In one scene, Dixon explains that his father himself was a little crook, the movie with the idea of ​​predestination, but this one scene is as far as Otto goes, or dares to take his ideas. <br /> <br /> The camera work is also disappointing. There is no intelligence in Otto's camera. No attempt is made to assign the camera to anything. It doesn't play with space or architecture or interfere with the step-by-step police procedure. These are just fifty-three options. Undeniably, though most people do not care about these things. <br /> <br /> There is, however, one good shot where our hero is trapped in a noir cage that enters a vehicle driver (another cage) and is taken up in the main gangster's backyard. As with Lynch's "Blue Velvet", Otto is reconsidering the film, constantly voting "over" to hell. It works well, but the set design fails to strengthen it. <br /> <br /> 7/10 - Otto seems content to follow the Hawksian form of what a noir is, rather than playing with the possibilities of where noir can go. Like "Detour", "Night in the City", "Scarlet Street", "In a Lone Place", "Law of Violence", "Bomberang" and "Johnny Eager", "Where the pavement ends" is one of those things made second layer film noirs. It is competent and engaging, but lacks the extra special magic.
