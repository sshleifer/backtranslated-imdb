I was totally in this movie from the first to the last minute. It is brilliantly shot, with very interesting and original camera angles and techniques used. The plot surrounds a deaf woman picked up by friends and colleagues. She hires an assistant at work, with her true intention to find love. He is an ex-con and she takes advantage of him to take revenge on those who hurt her. In return, she has to help him with an elevator that requires her lip reading skills to pull it off. The film passes in a dark film noir, with some really excellent scenes, and an even better final. The right beauty in this film comes from the way the director benefits from the front character's disability. Using sound keeps the tension consistent and the dramatic shifts of silence to noise keep the blood in the pump, that's for sure. Throw in a little black comedy and undertones of erotic sexual oppression. You have the work of a wonderful movie. It's the kind of movie Hollywood really wants to make, but can't.
