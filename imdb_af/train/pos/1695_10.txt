Normally, the best way to annoy me in a movie is to refer to Orson Welles. But here's a sci-fi comedy that broadcast the World War .... and it's gold! The concept of a tiny bunch of small, aggressive and dumb strangers confused as kids in Halloween dress is wonderful. Don't be fooled by the idea that because it looks like a children's movie, it is unsophisticated - it's not, there's a very hidden treasure ... a gem!
