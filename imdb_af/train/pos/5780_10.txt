The Maxx is a deeply psychological introspective that is gently camouflaged as a strange superhero story. Julie Winters is a "freelance social worker" in an unnamed city, driven by crime, and she and everyone she knows have many problems working through. The Maxx is her friend and client, a street maker who thinks he's a dressed superhero - or is it the other way around? <br /> <br /> The Maxx may not be missed for the artwork, the story itself or The Excellent Voice - especially the late Barry Stigler's delightfully arid, dull-like evil voice of the great villain, Mr. Gone. <br /> <br /> If you get the chance to see it, don't miss it.
