This is one of my favorite family movies. I loved it when I was little and it still holds with me because I'm older. I still laugh at the same old jokes and can even throw away a tear. I have never taken much care of animals that speak or at least UN animated, but this one I will stand for. It's a nice old movie, but it will always be a place in my heart. <br /> <br /> There is no other living animal movie that I can think of, at the moment I could even compare to that, as much as this one. I may give too much praise to this movie, but I don't think show. I really like that big message that "Home is where the heart is." Or this is at least the message I got from it. Definitely recommended for a good old family movie night.
