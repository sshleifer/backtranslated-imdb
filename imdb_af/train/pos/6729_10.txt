If you've seen Dogtown and Z-Boys or are interested in seeing the real, non-caricature, Real-American "side of America, Riding Giants will be deeper than you've seen before. <br /> <br / > This film is "unreal", a firm term if ever there was one, but extremely appropriate if you can derive any kind of literal meaning from it - this is a 100% factual documentary, but with all the drama of an opera And the totally apparent sense of love, expertise and knowledge installed by Stacy Peralta's direction and narration, obviously leads this movie from swelling to great wave, while totally surprised at everything you enjoy enjoying. <br /> <br /> This movie is a symphony, as well as Beethoven's 9, and starts beautifully with its prediction in Hawaii, which begins deeply in human emotion in Santa Cruz and with riot, triumph and crescendo in Laird Hamilton's feats, again in Hawaii br /> <br /> Like classical music, like Beethoven's 9th, Ride of the Val Chills or Barbers Adagio for Strings, this may be the only piece you want, but it's worth it. Trust me.
