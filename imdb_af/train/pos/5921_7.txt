I was the production accountant on this movie, and I also had to do a voice overwork about it, so I'm not completely biased, but if it was terrible, I'd say it. I thought it was a fun movie, not a critically acclaimed masterpiece, but there was a lot of laughter along the way. The Bible states that the laugh looks good like a medicine, so watching this movie may be good for your health. <br /> <br /> So many of the actors in this photo have not yet reached their peak when we made it. this movie. Susan Sarandon, of course, is one who has since gained much greater fame. Melanie Mayron is considered a television on a weekly basis as a photographer in the "Thirty-something" TV drama series. Robert Englund later became known as Freddie Krueger, who is still pursuing people's dreams. One of my personal favorite actors on this show was Dub Taylor, who played the sheriff. He was an excellent comic actor, and a truly beautiful, sincere person. We all had fun working on this show, and I think it's fun.
