In Cinema Retro magazine # 2, it is announced that Mark Lester's voice was actually baptized by a 20-year-old woman, Kathe Green. Although Leste was considered perfect for the title role, director Carol Reed was not satisfied with his singing ability. The secret is revealed by a 2004 British documentary titled "Oliver! After They Were Famous". Greene was paying Â£ 400 for her job and she had to agree to keep her participation secret, just like Mark Lester. They kept their word and reveal only this fact as part of the TV program decades after the release of the film. For the record, Mark Lester retired from acting and is a practicing osteopath in England.
