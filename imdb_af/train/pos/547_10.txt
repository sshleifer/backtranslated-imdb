I don't know if I'm just strange, but I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. <br /> <br /> Back to Cabin at the Lake, of course, is the successor to another of my favorite movies. Cabin by the Lake. In fact, I think I enjoy this movie even more than the first one. I also thought the movie in this movie was great, Judd Nelson is always the best! I also enjoyed the plot as a whole. I liked the fact that this second movie focused on filming Stanley's screen game Cabin by the Lake - it was not an excess movie of Stanley who grabbed and drowned other girls. - If you are looking for some deep meaning, then this movie is probably not the one for you. However, if you are looking for a fun way to spend two hours, go ahead and watch it. I've probably killed at least ten hours to watch this movie. :)
