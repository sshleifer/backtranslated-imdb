How can anyone not love this movie? I think it's a hilarious spoof of all the old gangster movies; if you have never seen it before, look at it. Michael Keaton has a ball in this role than anything. One man misses the English language every time he speaks and Griffin Dunn plays a clueless D.A., but my favorite role should be Joe Piscopo. He has all the best lines. Danny DeVito, Alan Hale, Ray Walston is in this star-studded movie that has lampoon gangsters much harder than "Mafia" for the criminal underground.
