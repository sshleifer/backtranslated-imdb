A sweet little movie that will not even offend your grandmother, the "Saving Grace" of the same canvas as half a dozen other British comedies has been cut over the past two years ... undercover is confronted, finds the power to challenge and learn something about him / herself in the process. <br /> <br /> Wife and therefore broken, Grace is a master gardener and is appointed to help her friend / employee. Matthew grows his pot plant. He does it all wrong, so Grace helps him out. They realize she is the perfect person to harvest pot, to which they can both benefit. He enjoys smoking, she has to raise money to pay her mortgage. <br /> <br /> Highlight is Grace who travels to London to handle some of her goods, dressed in what looks like the white suit, John Travolta, in "Saturday Night Fever" and thus like a sore thumb out. <br /> <br /> Blethyn is always visible, and you can't tell it about many people. Well, I can't, anyway. Ferguson is very good, and Tcheky Karyo, whom I liked in "La Femme Nikita", is unforgettable. <br /> <br /> Not deeply moving or informative, but incredibly entertaining, and at a lively 90 minutes, feels like a walk with friends. 8/10.
