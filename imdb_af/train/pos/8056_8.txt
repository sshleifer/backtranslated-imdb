This photo, with all sorts of ocars for best director, John Ford, actor Victor McLaglen and music by Max Seiner in 1935. Victor McLaglen (Gypo Nolan), "Call Out the Marines", '42, gave an excellent performance as an Irish rebel who belonged to a rough and difficult crowd, all fighting for a cause and at the same time poorer and getting poorer. with plenty of drink. Gypo Nolan made a bad mistake when he decided to become an informant for his best friend to make a trip with America and a new way of life. Preston Foster, (Don Gallagher), "Guadalcanal Diary," 43, gave a great support role as the leader of the Irish uprising and was anxious to catch the informant of his group. Gypo Nolan is haunted by his betrayal of his friend and begins to feel like a Judas. Great movie for 1935 and great acting by McLaglen, but rather in every aspect of the film.
