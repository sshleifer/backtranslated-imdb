Simple yet good-natured entry film about a simple but good-natured high school graduate who has dreams of using the coolest fit in the world to use as his "ballroom". <br /> <br /> Our hero, Bobby, spends all his savings on getting the vehicle of his dreams. Joint sharing and love quickly start with girls. Bobby picked up at the local pizzeria, but he found a lot of responsibility, danger and sadness with the owner of such a mechanical wonder. <br /> <br /> The Van is a guilty pleasure from me. It catches the light back in the mid 70's and has enough unintentional humor to put it in the "so bad" category.
