Paul was completely ripped off by someone who set up, Dave made. It's the same story, not so funny. <br /> <br /> Paul heard me this morning, and Sammy Davis sings the new Parador anthem. He arrived in Brazil after a long flight of vegas, three aircraft, a car ride to the set, and so on. He could barely stand, had to use a sugar cane. He stayed in a trailer about the size of my bathroom. <br /> <br /> He didn't know he could do it. then he sees the crowd of 6,000 extras, paying 7 dollars. He came to life and they shot the scene for two hours. He was wonderful, then almost collapsed. <br /> <br /> Paul is a good guy, though very liberal. a real talent.
