Captured and graphic Japanese film graphically about small creatures that take over people and turn them into nekborg zombie like machines - defeating and hooking each other so the winner can eat the loser. In the middle of this, a few lovers are infected. <br /> <br /> Technically great horror comedy (?) is just for those with strong stomachs like blood and body parts are going to fly. Good taste prevents me from describing what is happening here, but we can only say it is quite horrible. If you like this kind of thing, there are a few steps above slim content anyway. See this movie. Personally, I am normally not one to enjoy such movies, but how sick and distorted they are. Here I was shocked enough that I could imagine it to people I know who really like gory movies. It's also a movie with enough going on, in the details I want to see again, because I know what's going on. In the end revealed. I want to go back and see what I'm not catching. In these films there is an internal logic. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 for those who love blood and cut limbs, it's zero or more precisely a run and hides warning for everyone.
