One of the most underrated movies I've seen long ago, Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey is the second hilarious adventure of Bill S. Preston Esq. and Ted Theodore Logan, also Wyld Stallyns. There are two ways to watch this movie: First, you see stupid dialogue, far-fetched plot, youthful idea. OR. You see brilliant muted idiots who find themselves in a situation too big for their brains. Throw a Bruce Willis or Arnold Schwarzeneggar into this plot and it will be a big block film. Bill and Ted go with the same level of sincerity in the story, just Bill and Ted. It's a tough fence to balance, but if you don't see the movie as a thrown-away screw comedy, but as an adventure with two guys having no business in adventure, it gets so much more.
