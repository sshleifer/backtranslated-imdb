If you haven't seen this dark little charmer, look it up. This is the story of a clumsy war time, Sad Sack (Fred MacMurray), who is named 4-F every time he tries to join any branch of the army. He finds a magical lamp that, of course, contains a genius (Gene Sheldon), but the genius is even more bumbling than MacMurray, and sends it over time to serve in all the wrong times and places as it wants. It's cute, cheerful and fluffy, and you can't help it, but love it. The sites are much like a Disney movie, especially since the two stars (MacMurray and Sheldon) both made Disney movies in the 50's and 60's, though not together. Needless to say, it ends well for everyone, and the viewer goes away, feels pretty good.
