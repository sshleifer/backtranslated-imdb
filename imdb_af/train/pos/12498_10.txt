This movie is the best movie ever, it has lots of live action. It's just wonderful everyone should see it and the actor is wonderful. The place is Rome. Italy is the best place ever. The actors are wonderful. Mary-Kate Olsen is such a great actress she plays Charlie and it's a great character and Ashley Olsen plays Leila and it's a wonderful character to love when he loves Rome.
