Of all the breakdancing / hip-hop movies released between 1983 and 1986, the 1984 movie Beat Street is undoubtedly the best. The story follows a DJ, his younger break dance brother, a graffiti artist and a showbiz promoter through one winter trying to break out of the ghetto using their "street" talent. The acting is not always at stake and the characters are not completely taken out, but they are more than compensated for a dialogue, a probable story, fantastic dance series and a timeless hip hop soundtrack. It should be noted that this film was shot in the birthplace of breakdancing ("It's not New York, it's the Bronx!") And features performances by breakdancing fathers, dance group Rock Steady Crew and rapper Africa Bambaata. Rock Steady Crew offers the best scene in the movie as they dominate the dance battle in the premier breakdancing club of the early 80s, the Roxy. A must see for hip-hop lovers.
