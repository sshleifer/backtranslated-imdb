'De Grot' is a great Dutch thriller, based on the book written by Tim Krabbe. Another of his books, 'Het Gouden Ei', was made in 1988 in the large Dutch riddle, called Spoorloos. This one is not as good as that thriller (although much better than the American memory also called 'The Vanishing'), but there are times when it comes close. <br /> <br /> Especially the opening hours are great. We see a man, later we learn his name is Egon Wagter (Fedja van HuÃªt), who comes from a plane in Thailand. When he picks up his pockets, it's pretty clear he is smuggling something over the border. These scenes are perfectly targeted, photographed and performed. A kind of tension is created that you would not normally have in an opening tone like this. Later we see Egon making a woman in Thailand with a woman. Both said they had never done such a thing. <br /> <br /> From this point on, the movie is still flashing back and forth. We see Egon, still as a child (here played by Erik van der Horst), a man named Axel (as a child played by Benja Bruijning). We learn how they grew up as friends, and how Axel (as an adult played by Marcel Hensema) became a criminal. Meanwhile, Egon goes to college and settles with a woman. Around this time he sometimes meets Axel, but he doesn't want to do anything to him. <br /> <br /> The movie is chronological in a way. It shows Egon and Axel as children, as students, young adults, and in the mid-thirties. But from time to time, as I said, the movie goes back to when they were kids and jumped forward. Every time we see it as children, it explains something that happens when they are adults. <br /> <br /> Minor spoilers in this. <br /> <br /> The title means 'The Cave', and it's the cave. It gives the movie its happy ending, though it's not so happy. As the beginning, the end is great. The middle part of the movie is entertaining and, in a way, distracts the attention of the first scenes, but eventually returns. This is the editing that gives the movie its happy ending, although we can say the dramatic end is also happy.
