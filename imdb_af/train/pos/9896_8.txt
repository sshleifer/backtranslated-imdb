For the past few months I've meant to see this movie. I was actually surprised at how good it was. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around a group of high school teenagers who are a boy named Marty Bully. They constantly huddle him until one of them makes a terrible mistake that Marty burns terribly. <br /> <br /> A few years later, the group is being reckoned with reckless teens to their own high school that is now leaving for a party. Although none of the reckless teens organized this party. <br /> <br /> Later, through the film, teens begin to die in the most horrific ways. I can surely tell you that they are so good. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie you find it was all a dream and nothing happened. But Marty is in hospital with severe burns. Although the murders did not occur, the burns and pranks apparently happened. <br /> <br /> The play is terrible, but it's good. <br /> <br /> I love the story. I'm really sympathetic to Marty. It's like Tamara (2005). The bulls eventually get what they eventually reach, and you finally feel satisfied that the victim is getting their sweet revenge. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend someone pick it up if you're looking for 80's. /> <br /> I give this movie 8 stars out of 10. Good cheese maker!
