I watch a romantic comedy with some hesitation, because romantic comedies contain age groups that make a movie uninteresting. Typically in a Romantic Comedy, there is a girl and there is a man, both in love, have problems and then win over the problems of getting married or whatever. But this movie is a different story, it's very different from the Romantic Comedies I've seen recently. <br /> <br /> There is a widowed man (Dan), there is a girl (Marie). Then Marie meets in a bookshop and speaks for somewhere, after Marie has to leave. Then develop something for her, and when it becomes meaningful, we get a twist. Marie is the friend of his brother. Indifferent to the circumstances, Dan thrives with Marie and realizes he loves her, and even Marie loves him, but their love will not only be possible. How this is made possible is the rest of the story. <br /> <br /> Steve Carell performs well, Juliette Binoche is good as Marie. And every other thing is well done. It's a good movie, watch it.
