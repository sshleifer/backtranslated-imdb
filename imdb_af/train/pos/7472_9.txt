I really like this movie. I read some of the other comments, and although I'm sorry for those who didn't understand it, I agree with the criticism. What in a strange way makes me more like this movie. I assume they played a good role in reviving an intelligent movie for the general public, but it has so many levels and is quite nice to watch. I also love the movies, like this one that causes so many debates, theories, possible ends and hidden sub-texts. Congratulations Mr. Cross, definitely in my top ten. <br /> <br /> P.S. Having seen it when it first came out while in Mexico, it was late at night and I had to come back to my hotel and I had a great paranoia trip! Where does the dream come true and the real start?
