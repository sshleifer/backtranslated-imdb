After high school graduation, best friends decide on Alice and Darlene to travel to Thailand. While there, they met a beautiful Australian man named Nick. After driving Nick, he asked them if they would like to take a weekend trip with him to Hong Kong. They agree. At the airport, however, they are being expelled for drug trafficking and are found guilty for 33 years in a Thai prison for something they say they have not done. Not really knowing what to do they end up contacting Yankee Hank, an American lawyer who lives in Thailand with his wife. Word has it if you have the money, he can help you. Things are starting well, but they still can't get out. <br /> <br /> The movie is really good because it doesn't matter what is going to happen and it's always interesting. However, I couldn't believe the end. It was one of those ends where you didn't know the truth of 100%, but you still know what happened to Nick and the drug smuggling because of the 'possession' etc. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale are both performing well here. However, Beckinsales's performance was a bit poor. Both Danes and Beckinsales characters friendship are good, but could look better. Paul Walker has a small, unreasonable role here. ;) <br /> Anyway, I thought Brokedown Palace was a good movie and I give it a 7/10.
