Somehow, this movie can be refreshing, bitter-sweating and heart-warming at the same time. Stars like Tony Shalhoub (of Providence) bring the story to life. The story itself is inspiring. We see a desperate, on-and-off life imagined by the most innocent eyes: a birdie. <br /> <br /> Paulie started his life as a baby parrot given to a little girl (played by Hallie Eisenberg, also known as the Pepsi girl) with a speech restriction. While learning to speak right, Paulie does. But unlike most birds, he can say everything that is being said. The military dad does not like the bird, so he is sent to a pawnshop and bought by an aging artist, Ivy. She teaches him ways, etc. While traveling across the country to find Paulie's owner. The film continues on several occasions, until Paulie finally arrives at a lab where he is eventually hidden in a cellar and found by a Russian custodian, who is affected by the bird's story. the plot is consistent with the simple, metaphorical theme that language is a gift and a curse. I'd like to say that the soundtrack is amazing. A beautiful blend of flute, digital base and horn enhances the film to the point of pure ecstasy. The demanding camera angles and breathtaking scenery enhance the story even more. And last but not least, the puppet show is completely credible. (Unlike in star wars, where Yoda looks like a Muppet). This film is one of my favorite movies, with the remark that my wonderful parakeet of four years has recently died. Overall, I give this movie **** four stars, two thumbs and a big hug.
