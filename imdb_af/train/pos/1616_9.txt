Deliriously romantic comedy with intertwining subplots that gorgeous belly and actors reflecting on each other with precise comic timing, a great performance to watch. When Cher's muscular fiance asks her to help him make peace with his estranged, moody, younger brother, no one can dream the consequences that follow. Operational Symbolism, Catholic Confession, Love Bites and Snowfall ... "Moonstruck" is timeless and smooth. It takes about 15 minutes to kick in the rhythm of the picture (there is an early sequence with the grandfather and his dogs at the slightly rough cemetery, and another scene with Cosmo and the older man at the gate stomping looks), but the patchwork of the plot is intertwined with an easy skill, and the movie's wobble toes and kooky spirit are both contagious. *** 1/2 from ****
