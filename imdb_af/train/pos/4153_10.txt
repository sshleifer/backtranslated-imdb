It was a fantastic episode. I saw a clip of it on YouTube, and I promised that if it ever appeared on TV, I would stick to the set to watch. I followed it with a friend of mine who was gay and the two of us cried at the end. It was a really well written, hearty episode of the forbidden love between two policemen who, as I felt, were really (in Coop's words) the "Lucky ones". These are episodes like this that Cold Case really makes one of the most fascinating and beloved works of television magic on CBS. I wait anxiously for more episodes, and a repeat of "Forever Blue" because I will always watch it again.
