Although I really enjoy Jim Carrey's latest "serious" performances ("The Truman Show", "Man on the Moon"), I have always thought of his real genius lies in physical comedy. This is not to say he is a fantastic, talented actor: the aunt of the Academy Awards seems so much to him, he has never received a (really earning) nomination or award. Well, any "institution" nominating for 11 Oscars, such as "Titanic," should not be taken seriously. <br /> <br /> With the review. "The Grinch" is the most beloved, best, most active, enjoyable season movie since "The Nightmare before Christmas". Both movies look very similar too, with their highly styled sets and the intention of someone stealing Christmas. Both let their lead actors look like the villains (one in a higher grade than the other), both packing a strong moral lesson and both are really nice. <br /> <br /> It's until you realize that Jack Skellington is a doll, and The Grinch is a human. But one that is so highly expressive, so fluent in its movements, so cartoonish, so unreal, that never stands in the way. He can be hilarious, he can be a sad soul, he can be angry. He lives in a 3-dimensional world where 3-dimensional people live. He jokes, he laughs, he cries, and eventually he saves the Christmas. I loved this movie and can't wait for it to come to DVD. It's one of those movies you'll really enjoy from 10 to 20 years. As timeless as they come.
