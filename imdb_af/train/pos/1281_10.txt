This movie is as good as it is hard to find. The film's hero (and author and director) is Simon Geist - a man with an agenda. "He creates a fake magazine just to have the authority to maintain the pigs of Los Angeles - the actors, the models, the musicians - who believe their own feces don't smell. With smart dialogue, Zucovic manages to do this. Certainly, the budget for this movie was probably what he paid for a used car, but this film is so solid and so well written that it works very well. Anyone who can reflect Edward Munk's "The Scream" in The reflection of a silver trash at a local coffee food must be nominated for a kind of award, give this movie a chance and listen to what it says ... because they have made the same car since 1986. known as 'the car' Bravo, Zucovic, bravo!
