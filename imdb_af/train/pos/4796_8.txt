A really nice story with a moral about brotherly love describes this strange David Lynch movie. It was especially "strange" because it wasn't the kind of movie Lynch had in the last 15-20 years. These were dark and shocking films (Blue Velvet, Wild At Heart, Mulholland Drive) and this is the opposite. I know it has disappointed many of its fans. Others were delighted. Count me as one of the latter, and I own all three "dark" movies. <br /> <br /> It was another supposed true life story, describing an elderly man's journey in a sewn mower from western Iowa all the way to Wisconsin to see his sick brother over whom he didn't speak in years not, but wants to see before the latter dies. Well, I think that point of departure - an old man who drives 400 miles to a lawnmower makes it another "strange" movie of its kind, so stay on Lynch! <br /> <br /> Richard Farnsworth plays the title role. He is the kind of old, facial, voiceless, low key personality mindset, who likes almost everyone. The wrinkles on his face tell a story a lot. It was so sad to hear what happened to him in real life, a year after this film was released. <br /> <br /> The first 25 minutes of this movie is not much, and not always enjoyable, as it highlights the character's mature and spiritually-challenged child (Sissy Spacek) and her tragic past, but soon Alvin Straight (Farnsworth) begins his journey, the story is picked up. I played it for several friends and they thought the movie never uploaded, but I'm more generous with it. I think it's a hidden gem. For them it was a sleeping pill. <br /> <br /> I found his journey very fascinating, but you need to realize beforehand that it will NOT be an exciting Lynch crime story. It's slow and if it's good with you, you might like it. The charm enters the picture of some people who meet Alvin along the way, such as an exuberant young girl running away and some pretty village goers who help the old man in trouble. (Henry Cada as "Daniel Riordan is a standpoint in this regard.) Harry Dean Stanton gets the third bill, but it's a joke: he's just in the last few minutes of the movie! <br /> <br /> The Iowa scenery is nice, I lived there for a few years and can witness the rolling hills and the rich soil, which is a beautiful condition with nice people .... like this movie.
