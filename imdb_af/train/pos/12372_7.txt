The Sentinel is a movie recommended to me by my dad years ago, and I've seen it many times. It always keeps me entertained while I am a little creepy. The flashback screens are what it really made for me. Cristina Raines' father is running around completely, with the two flu-like women, he always drives cold fever to send off my spine. this is your typical good vs evil thing, but at least manage it to be entertaining. The end I see as one of the best in Horror history. It has a lot of shocks and tensions, as Burgess Meredith does his thing as Chazen, puts me on the edge of my seat. The Sentinel has the perfect buildup of tension. We are never fully comfortable when Allison is on the screen. We know something terrible is always waiting for her, and that makes things more stressful. This movie is often neglected among horror fans, but personally I think it's one of the better ones out there, and it's certainly enough for all Horror fans to be happy. <br /> <br /> Performances. Cristina Raines has her timber moments, but mostly came in a big way. She is beautiful to look at, and her chemistry with Saranadon felt natural. Chris Sarandon is wonderful like the boyfriend, Michael. He had an immediate screen presence, and I couldn't help but love him. Martin Balsam, Jos√© Ferrer, John Carradine, Ava Gardner, Arthur Kennedy, Sylvia Miles, Deborah Raffin, Jerry Orbach, Richard Dreyfuss, Jeff Goldblum and Tom Berenger all have memorable roles, or small cameos. Burgess Meredith is great as Chazen. He looks like an ordinary old man, but what we find out is absolutely scary. Eli Wallach and Christopher Wlaken do well, like the rogue detectives. Beverly D'Angelo has a cold scene, which I won't spoil. <br /> <br /> Bottom line. The Sentinel is an effective Horror movie that is Horror fans, tends to be neglected. It will give you the excitement and fear you need to be content. The look is worth it. <br /> <br /> 7/10
