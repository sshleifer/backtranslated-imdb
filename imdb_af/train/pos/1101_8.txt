While prices have risen a lot and some of the details have dated, any homeowner who has struggled with homeownership problems should get a lot from this movie. I know I have. <br /> <br /> Mr. New York's Deputy CEO Blandings decides to move his family to the Connecticut suburbs and build himself a beautiful home there. He comes in after a hilarious jam, from bonds to lawsuits to construction problems, as the cost and schedule of the construction remains out of control. I thought it was the funniest scenes where Blandings hire a contractor to dig a pit for water. They dig hundreds of feet, but never get water. Another few days later, the basement of his home-to-floods! <br /> <br /> Cary Grant and Myrna Loy give credible performances as the Harry Mix pair, overwhelmed by problems they never thought. , and Melvyn Douglas is even better than Blanding's lawyer and family friend. <br /> <br /> The only warning is that social attitudes have changed a lot since 1948. Mrs. Mixtures are portrayed as a bit of a naive dimbulb that has no idea how much extra trouble she is causing, and there is a black girl (horror!). So this movie doesn't look through the social lens of 2003, and you'll enjoy it even more. <br /> <br />
