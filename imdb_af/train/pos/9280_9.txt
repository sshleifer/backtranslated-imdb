In Iran, women are officially banned from men's sporting events. In June 2005, the Iranian national soccer team played an important match against Bahrain in the Azadi Stadium for World Cup qualifiers. A group of Iranian girls and lovers of soccer dresses such as boys and unsuccessful attempts to enter the stadium are being arrested. <br /> <br /> Football (and Flamengo's team), beach and movies are my greatest passions; That's why I loved this little gem about a group of girls and their passion for football. Director Jafar Panahi, of "The White Balloon", "The Mirror" and "The Circle" shot this movie on the day that Iran defeated Bahrain and qualified for the World Cup in Germany. The dramatic and funny adventure of these Iranian girls is one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Not available
