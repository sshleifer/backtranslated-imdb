It's a great movie for all ages. This is the story of three animals how to get their way home. There is a bit of a turn at the end and mostly through the whole movie. You never know what will happen next. This movie makes you cry and makes you laugh. You just don't know what will happen next. The draw house is beautiful with all the wonderful wildlife. Their producers also spent a lot of money on this movie and it also shows. The animals in this movie were well trained and are great actors / actress themselves. Everything about this movie is great! 10 out of 10 all the way! Rent or buy it today I can guarantee that you will love it, the whole family will!
