I saw this Australian movie about 10 years ago and never forgot it. The movie shows the horror of the war in a way that Hollywood usually left. The relationship between the soldiers of the two warring countries is highlighted by the differences in culture and the ultimate knowledge that we are actually not completely different. If you can find any type of copy - buy or rent it. You won't be disappointed, just rude.
