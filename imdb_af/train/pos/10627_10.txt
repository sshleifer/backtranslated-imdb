So what is a real independent movie? In a day and age where the latest riddle of mainstream Hollywood is hard and cardinal, I'm sorry to say that what the general public tends to regard as an independent film is usually nothing more than a clever marketing package. <Br /> <br /> Therefore, we should be pleased that movies such as "Hatred of a Minute" exist. On the whole, this film makes a point of contradicting its own template (in horror movie). Love it or hate it, "Hatred" is not afraid to be what it is, and if you watch this movie, you get the real sense that Kallio (the director) not only made this movie to spray fake blood all over the place, he's here to tell stories. Goedes. You may find this movie in the horror movie section of your video store, but don't be fooled. This story is also about love, about good people being pushed over the edge, and that cute light at the end of the tunnel. <br /> <br /> If you expect a smut or an Evil Dead ripoff, stay away from this movie. But if you dig the finer points of horror / suspense genres, watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Yes. Bruce Campbell made this movie, and I'm sure he's proud to tell anyone it's not 'Evil Dead'. Bruce has never tried to bank on his "ash" image, and it is clear that he did not get involved with "Hatred", so neither can it happen. <br /> <br /> My advice, however, is to kill everyone, anything issued by Mr. Campbell, is to watch this movie anyway and see what more Mr. Kallio and Mr. Campbell is trying to show you. <br /> <br /> The acting is well done, though nothing about this movie is oscar caliber (perhaps deliberate), it's good to see compassionate performances in a horror movie. So often it seems that role-players in movies like this did not even try with "Hatred", it seems as if all the actors take their action very seriously and never resort to typical horror movie campaigning. <br /> <br /> Technically, "Hatred" is about as capable as getting a movie. The editing is fast, the cinematography is well given the budget, and "Hatred" keeps a quick fit, without any downsizing or bad anti-climax. <br /> <br /> All in all, Hatred doesn't have the brilliance of all the multi-million dollar fake Indians, but personally I don't see a problem with it. It's a movie of people who really care about the medium. People who got into their pockets pulled out bags, pulled out your nails and drops, carefully threw the wind and made a damn good movie. <br /> <br /> Exit this one.
