"Our Song" gives us the lives of the three teenagers Lanisha, Maria and Joycelyn - best friends hanging out at the end of summer. Adolescent summer - even if we don't know the signals and landmarks of this particular site, Crown Heights, Brooklyn - is the same for all of us. A low price from the pressure and riot of the school. Welcome heat and idleness. <br /> <br /> But if this experience of adolescence is universal, the city center of the 90s is a different place to most of us - perhaps as strange as any country. Young bodies excavating new silhouettes ... new territory ... the maze after maturity. The young thought comes in itself, speaks for itself and says it is who I am, that is who I want to be. It's / was always so. But that's how it plays in Brooklyn in the late 90's. <br /> <br /> Jim McKay is the author / director of this film project, but he acknowledges everyone who has shouted to him. The opening title slide a movie by 'everyone seems to be in the universe. It's a gesture, but by the end of the movie, we know it's a real one. [Closing items also have some of the most valid and valuable credits I've read.] Jan McLaughlin's vibrant audio recording deserves special attention. McKay is a modest leader who knows who tells this story - it is his three grace Lanisha, Maria and Joycelyn. They are the right thing, their interactions have the fire of true friendship and the focus of reality. It's not a music video that briefly tells the teenager's life. It has the severity of the long, unblinding stare. <br /> <br /> Hanging out with them, we don't feel completely included, but we feel privileged to listen. These are real voices that talk to plains about crises. and sowing of daily life. We are witness to the modern math of teen life - how to interpret, calculate and summarize and solve their problems. Small scenes illustrate great thoughts throughout. Lanisha hangs with her dad at his security work - that's the only way she can spend time with him. We see the love that exists between them, but also the failures of family and fatherhood. In a connected scene, Lanisha defends her father to her mother, and we see how desperate she must both love them and that they must love her again. Later, the three friends lay in the dark faces and dreams, and we remember how crazy / funny children are and more tragic how realism hammered itself into idealism. And in the end, Maria just walking down the street is a short story in itself. We see her gathering the courage to keep all her fears and doubts in the bay. She shows us the power we need to embrace the fragility of life. <br /> <br /> `Our song's greatest gift is that we feel the terrible ephemeral nature of friendship - how, one day, alive and alive, the intimacy in the next can only turn and drift. It's terrible, but that's just what it is, isn't it?
