A Christmas Together I actually came, but I was educated on John Denver and the songs of this special were always my family's Christmas music. For years, we made a cracked cassette from a record that meant it was Christmas. A few years ago I could finally find a video of it on Ebay, and when I had been listening to all the music for 21 years, I looked at John and the Muppets for myself. If you ever get the chance, it's great fun - good music, heart warming and cheese. It is also interesting to see the 70's versions of the Muppets and compare them to their newer versions today. I believe Denver has actually taken heat to do such a show. Normally, artists do not compromise their images, because they do sing-a-longs with the Muppets, but I'm glad he did. Even if you can't find the video, the soundtrack is also worth it. It has some Muppified traditional favorites, but also some original Denver songs.
