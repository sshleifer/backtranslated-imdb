As documented by previous posters, Rockstar's real stars are: INXS - and indeed the sequel, Rockstar: Supernova - Paul Mirkovich, Rafael Moreira, Jim McGorman, Nate Morton and Sasha Krivtsov. Don't know who they are? They are the incredible, tight rockin House Band whose music and talent make this performance look more like a sad American Idol clone. <br /> <br /> Remember the "strings" night? It was musical precision and perfection if I ever saw it. Suzie McNeil's epic version of Queen's' Bohemian Rhapsody ', Ty Taylor's memorable cover of the Stones'' You Can Not Always Get ... ', JD Fortune sings' Suspicious Minds'. The common denominator here is the wonderful House Band. <br /> <br /> As good as INXS was in their first, they are unfortunately a shadow of their former cells, although JD's lively performance made a little new life in their music, this show is about HB . <br /> <br /> Memo to producers: Season Three (if we are blessed to make it happen) Rockstar: House Band should be. Get those boys a good lead singer and they go places.
