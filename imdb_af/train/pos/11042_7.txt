In a fine, four prisoners occupied a cell: Carrère (Gerard Laroche), who used his company to commit fraud and betrayed his wife; the suit Lassalle (Philippe Laudenbach) and his protégé, the delayed Pâquerette (Dimitri Rataud), who ate her six months sister; and the intellectual Marcus (Clovis Cornillac), who killed his wife. One night, Carrère finds an ancient magazine hidden in a hole in the cell wall. They realize that the book was written by Danvers (Geoffrey Carey) in the beginning of the last century and deals with black magic. They decide to read and use the content to escape prison when they get the truth about Danvers' fate. "Maléfique" is an original, intriguing and claustrophobic French low-budget horror movie. The story is almost in the same place, has no clichés and does not observe the viewer until the last scene. I am a big fan of the French cinema, usually romance, drama and police stories, but I noticed recently that I saw some good French horror movies, such as "Un Jeu d 'Enfants," Belphegor "and" Dead End " has. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Sinais do Mal" ("Signs of the Evil")
