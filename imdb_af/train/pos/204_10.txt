First of all, I don't like almost all Neil Simon movies. But there is something unique about this, which involves me, and I would say this is one of the most entertaining comedies I have ever seen. The second time I looked at it, the connection was clear. When did Neil Simon meet my grandmothers? <br /> <br /> Alas, afraid they might sue, so he changed them in men. And how boring it would be if they were just housewives, Biz stars are better off. Well, it's a personal review, and my still living grandmother at the age of 97 (she even survived Walter Matthau's beautiful personalization of her!) Would it deny - but some of you should find resonance in these characters. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I have little tolerance for George Burns, but somehow he has one of the best supporting shows I can remember (and my grandmother even enjoyed it but didn't recognize the remarkable similarities she shared with the movie character). <br /> <br /> A lot of ethnic, and on top, you'll laugh and laugh or turn it off. For me, the pleasure is nice.
