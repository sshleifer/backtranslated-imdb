I hired it for my son who recently found interest in 9/11. He was a Kindergartener then and had no idea what had unfolded. I like the way it is told as a "documentary". If there was one movie I would recommend to see about 9/11, it would be one! Usually you see a movie that is actress that is known. This movie didn't know anyone. You also see a 9/11 movie, you hear of a firefighter or two who lose their lives and save people. I didn't feel it had any of it! I just rented this movie and will definitely consider adding it to my collection! Very well done indeed! My heart goes out to the survivors and families of the 9/11 victims!
