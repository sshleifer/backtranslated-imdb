This story based on two Edgar Allen Poe pieces ("The Fall of the House of Usher", "Dance of Death") is actually completely flu from beginning to end. It is similar to some of the old black-and-white movies about people meeting in an old, remote home (for example, "The Cat and the Canary", "The Old Dark House", "Night of Terror"). Boris Karloff plays a demented inventor of the life-size dolls that make the guests terror. He dies early in the film (or is he?) And the residents of the house are subjected to a number of frightening experiences. I'm not going into too much detail here, but it's definitely a must-see for fans of old dark house monks. <br /> <br /> Look at many popcorn and soft drinks in a darkened room. <Br /> <br /> Dan Basinger 8/10
