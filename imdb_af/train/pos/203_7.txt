The Neil Simon's Sunshine Boys with Walter Matthau and George Burns are a funny comedy about the strange bond with life and its shortness, but laughter is always bitter. With Willy Clark (Matthau) and Al Lewis (Burns), two major theater comedy actors are now diminishing on the unreliability of the harsh and ceaseless age. You can only feel anger and blue. Willy never gives up work and work, while Al is tired of players and he is home to his daughter at home. The couple in their old age were really funny and harmonious, but from the scene was a constant struggle and strife and eleven years after they broke, they didn't speak. Now, if they were to work, they had to come together again to make one of his best old sketches for a comedy story TV show. The meetings are explosive and liberating the old questions. The Neil Simon's script gives a certain rust spirit to the story and the melancholy and blue overwhelmingly. The many gags and laughter also managed to generate a good mix thanks to a large pair of Walter Matthu (Best Academy Actor Award) and George Burns (Won the Oscar as Best Supporting Actor). The two actors are very credible and actually and the harmony looks almost like they really work together for that time and that the realty doesn't carry them between them. The film is also touching on its overall ingenuity, as the story is told and how the report by Love-Heat, which binds the two actors, is truly part of the strange but at the same time usually understandable things for life. My rate is 7.
