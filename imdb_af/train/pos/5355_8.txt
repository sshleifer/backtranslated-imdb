The running man hit the modern American media complex and the dead dead center. This can be an easy target, but they do pull it off. RM effortlessly takes pro-wrestling (with some pro wrestlers like the Hunters), network television, the Nielsen ratings, the US government (it is anyway entertainment oriented), crime and punishment, and half a dozen other things on the go. It's far from the original Stephen King novella, and Arnold is not the novella's Ben Richards either. But who cares? It's basically an Arnie movie, with all the well-edited action ranges and one-liners that such a business requires.
