I saw this movie on TNT 12 years ago. It was Susanah York's birthday and they showed this movie as a dual feature with Tom Jones (1963). I haven't seen this movie on TV ever since. I was interested in seeing this movie because one of the stars is the very funny and talented Jim Dale, as Lusty the sailor. I believe Dale is now doing the story of the Harry Potter books about Casette, but anyway, he's pretty funny. It's a quick comedy. It's not on VHS or DVD. Columbia Pictures has to go through their movie collection, and consider restoring and releasing this movie on DVD. Christopher Plummer is hilarious as Lord Fopington, Ian Bannen is also quite humorous as Ramble the sailor. It's a bawdy comedy, the kind of movie one no longer sees, with great production values. *** 1/2 stars from ****
