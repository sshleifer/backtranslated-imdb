This brilliant series, brilliantly told by Laurence Olivier, should be the beginning of the end of World War II. The origin is not fully investigated from Germany's fall under the hands of the Versailles Treaty, which helped bring Hitler's demonic rise. But, as one reviewer says, it should be difficult to do so in a 26-part series. <br /> <br /> Apart from the expected battle photography / action, there are many personal, emotional and human tragedies advised to give the viewer a wonderful insight, especially if you are not necessarily a buffalo / fan of the World War II is not. Episodes showing testimonials and living on the home front of the main allies / rival, Britain, Germany, Japan, Russia and the United States, were quite eye-opening. The extreme cruelty of the war in front shows and of course the suffering of civilians, the death camps, etc. Very well handled and exposed. I would fully recommend it in any history class for the younger generation (which can be said to be one at 47!). Certain things have been eliminated quite strangely, as the advent of the new Jet era begins, with Frank Whittle's experimental Gloster beam and the Gloster Meteor's debut debut, as well as the German Messerschmitt Me 262 - especially as the V-1 seen what made his debut and there was surprisingly smaller mention of the V2. It is probably a small review, not the more sensational secrets and fantastic weapons that WW2 produced from a more vague old science. But a wonderful series that created its point and has done so since, has gratefully repeated. <br /> <br /> A series to hold as a box in historical terms, on DVD for anyone, especially a military fan. Jeremy Isaacs and Thames TV should be very proud.
