This is my favorite Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers movie. The dialogue between the two is so cute and funny and very clever. Not to mention this movie contains some of the best songs recorded by the two; as I put all my eggs in one basket and let's see the music and dance. If I remember correctly, it was the movie that introduced me to Fred Astaire, so I think it will always be a special place in my heart (sorry for the sentimental cr * p, but I'm woman like that about it). Everything In This Movie I Get 8/10 Of Me. The choreography was excellent and also the fact that Lucille Ball is in it makes it even more awesome.
