This movie has everything you want from an action movie. Blasts, shootings, bad guys and worse guys. It's nice to see James Belushi use his humor to get out of his trouble, stealing $ 12m from the ultimate big boss "The Skipper". Of course it sounds, but of course. But boy, I enjoyed watching this movie. It's much better than all the DVD garbage made today. If you can come across the stupid plan you will find out that this movie has some surprises in the store. You can argue about the twists that are predictable. But the quick pace of this movie doesn't give you time to think too much about them, it's a blessing, as this movie doesn't turn over. But more about traveling after that moment. Only the title is a bit misleading and that could be the reason why so many people hated this movie. They probably expected a movie about gang members, instead of a couple of crooks who switch each other.
