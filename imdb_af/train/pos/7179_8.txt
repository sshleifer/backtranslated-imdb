This brings Stephen King's writings and the remembered childhood full of terror to stories such as IT - as the opposite. There is no horror in this childhood that any of the friends - who are still 20 years of friends - remember or seem to suffer. On the line everything is described as a friendly jostling, perhaps it is often described as one or more of them, but everything is forgiven. There is no * anxiety * embedded as the film and the participants in later life describe the relationships - all we see are young people who grew up to be basically the same people. More mature, but basically the same people, and the same power structures. <br /> <br /> Absolutely amazing! Not only for people to be really unaffected by social conventions, but also for friendships to be virtually expensive. In this regard, this movie is a little pearl. As it accepts, it's the intent of the movie: A portrait of unattached emotions that bind people together. Contrary to later years' films depicting the dark sides of childhood, these are the violent inhibitions in Bowling for Combine. It's easy to think, but since the mid-80s along with the growing worship of children and children (accompanied by 1000's of ads, animations and series directed to children), several movies and documentary documents have been successful with the portraying the dark sides of the growth - the abuse, the loneliness, the pressure to excel - resulting in adults with dark and twisted thoughts. /> <br /> And here comes a movie that says: It's possible to have a happy childhood, look there! <br /> <br /> Thanks for that. OR the counterweight illusion ... <br /> <br /> 8/10
