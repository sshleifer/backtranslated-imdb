It is one of the best Hong Kong (action) movies around and it has a tense and exciting storyline as well as great battle scenes. This Sammo movie has it all, novels, drama, excitement and also a great hero. It's the only martial arts movie that interests me in the plot rather than just waiting for the battles. Sammo Fans-This is a must see (See also Eastern Condors, Shanghai Express (Yuen Biao is Ace!), Dragons Forever and Perform the Fat Dragon.
