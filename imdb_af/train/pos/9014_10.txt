Shameful, before I saw this movie, I was unfamiliar with Helena Bonham Carter. <br /> <br /> I had to investigate, to make sure she wasn't actually harassed, as her character was with (well?) she harassed. I was in absolute awe of this beautiful lady. She pulled it flawlessly. <br /> <br /> Who would have thought that sexually explicit circumstances involving the final needs and needs of a unique young lady can be interpreted and romantic? Well, they can be when the right artists present them in the right way, as they did in this wonderful movie. I forgot to mention the dynamically beautiful girl. Carter watched this movie. I often said she was the most beautiful animal ever to win the face of our earth, but she did herself in this particular movie. <br /> <br /> I hope any of you watching this movie enjoy it as much as I did. Thank you for expressing my opinion.
