Jean-Jacques's career started with his essay answering a quiz: civilization is making us angry. This intelligent and exciting movie supports the argument. In that sense, it repeats a theme common to French films: society is real, identity is a construction, freedom is criminal. Here the idea is treated literally. Both main characters find themselves, and each other, only when they break rules. This discovery can indeed be true in France. Anyway, it's quite romantic.
