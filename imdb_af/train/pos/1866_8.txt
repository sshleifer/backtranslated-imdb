A great story based on a true story about a young black man and all the troubles along the way. Since it is Denzel Washington's first movie he will direct himself, I have to admit I was a touch of skeptic, but who wouldn't be? But then he is a good actor with many years of experience, and the end result has grown. The story is told in a good way, which made you difficult during your childhood, and young adulthood, see yourself in those situations. So, it hardens you, let you know you're not the only one going through hell. In total, a touch of a young man trying to make it into this world. (The story is based on the life of Antwone Fisher, born August 3, 1959, Cleveland, Ohio, USA, who was also the author of this movie.) Highly recommended. 8/10
