I selected this movie from my local library. After meeting the director at a film festival last year, I was curious to "check out" his work. I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> The film takes a fresh look at familiar subjects, love, infidelity, friendships, jealousy. It can sometimes be talky, but never as much as sinking the movie. I enjoyed watching a love story with characters that belong together and see how they make conscious decisions rather than randomly falling into something so important as love. <br /> <br /> The contrast between this movie and the average low budget shoot-em up black film is very clear. Look at that. If you're happy, your copy will be done with a copy of the soundtrack like mine. Good stuff!
