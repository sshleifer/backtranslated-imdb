A patchwork over 911. The 11 stories from 11 directors from 11 countries are sometimes humorous, sometimes boring (the first one for example), sometimes told Americans: "We had more death than you had, and you supported the killers" , sometimes very weird (but highly symbolic and interesting). I really loved the Claude Lelouch (personal life of a couple in New York, showing that our daily "problems" are unimportant), Shoei Imamura (bizarre, strong anti-war in general) and Idrissa Ouedraogo (funny, typical African optimism despite terrible daily misery), and Youssef Chahine (an Egyptian intellectual, pro-peace, with moral problems accepting US policy towards Arab countries). I'm very happy to see many Americans keep this movie. It shows that we (or they? I'm still Belgian, but living in Texas for 12 years) are still interested in other cultures and are able to question past and present actions of our government, as we should in a democracy do.
