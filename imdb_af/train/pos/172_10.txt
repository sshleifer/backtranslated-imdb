I saw this movie a few times on Comedy Central. This movie was pretty good. It's an interesting adventure with the life of Sunny Davis, which is arranged to marry the King of Ohtar, so the US can get an army base there to balance power in the Middle East. Some good jokes, including "Sunnygate." I also just loved the final theme. It gave me a great political spirit. Ten out of ten was my rating for this movie.
