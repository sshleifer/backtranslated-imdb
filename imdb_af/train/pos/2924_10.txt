Valued NR (to be rated R for Pervasive Strong Language and Cru Sexual Humor). Quebec Rating: 16+ (Must 13+) Canadian Home Video Rating: 18A <br /> <br /> Eddie Murphy Delirious is Eddie's first stand-up comedy routine. It came back in 1983. Then he played in the movie 48 hours and Trading Places and he was on Saturday Night Live. Eddie made two rise comedy films. Dirigious and Raw. I prefer Rou because I just found the subject to be more humorous. However, Dirigious is also very funny with Eddie about his childhood and makes fun of celebrities like Mr.T and singers like Michael Jackson. A fan of uprising comedy movies should see Eddie Murphy's Delirious.
