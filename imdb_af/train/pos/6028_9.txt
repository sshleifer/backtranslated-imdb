This is the film in Antonioni's mid-term that most critics dismissed quickly, as a "flawed" look at the 60-year-old American youth culture / politics. For what it is worth, I touch it more and unforgettable than its more famous films like L'AVVENTURA, perhaps because it shows more emotion and empathy than any other place. The story is simple, but it is used as a framework for Antonioni's brilliant observations of and criticism of American consumer culture, student life, counter-culture and the whole anti-settling, anti-war backlash that was so prominent. <br /> <br /> Even from a purely technical point of view, it is a remarkably manufactured film; from the opening credit line to the bizarre desert 'love-in', to the use of billboards, and to the jaw-winged cathartic final that used 17 camera layouts (in its own way, as powerful as the wild forest climax). Antonioni also chose a hell of a front lady with Daria Halperin, one of the most beautiful ones ever said. There is not much 'acting' involved, as it feels more like a doctrine, and therefore the use of non-professionals as the main pair works fairly effectively within that context. And the soundtrack is not only filled with great music, but its use is also impressive. I can't forget the beginning of the movie, especially because of the choice of music, from Pink Floyd. br /> <br /> Contrary to popular opinion, it is quite a performance in the theater, and one that I enthusiastically recommend to anyone with a taste or tolerance for the discount. Worth to find out, and one of the key roles of the 60s that requires a DVD Recovery / Transmission.
