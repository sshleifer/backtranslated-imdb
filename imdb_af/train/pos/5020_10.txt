This is what a movie should be if we try to capture the essence of what is very surrealistic. It rarely captures this dull feature of film, it feels like a dream sequence and really moves you into a dark ghostly memory. The children were extremely credible and I expect them to come from them in the future. Of course, for such little ones, I don't know if Bill made them as good or not, but no less excellent. Bill went as far as I was concerned and for KevNJeff's comments on Mr. Paxton's bad play, which one can do in that role. Rather, he played the part well in my opinion. It comes from someone who said Hamlet was good (The Ethan Hawke Version?) Wow ......... Don't listen to his comment. Great movie to make you really feel uncomfortable, if that's what you want? Cinematography also gets above the average rating.
