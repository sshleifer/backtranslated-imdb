It was originally intended to be a movie that Gene Kelly would die, but when the makers couldn't find him, they became "the greatest actor in the world", and the result is pretty good. Nathan Detroit (Frank Sinatra) actually has a hard time doing what he does best, and he sets up a high-game gambling game because he needs $ 1000 to get the place. To get the money he needs, he has a $ 1000 bet with old friend Sky Masterson (Marlon Brando) that he can't be sergeant Sarah Brown (Great Expectations' Golden Globe winner, and BAFTA nominated Jean Simmons) get to go with him. Havana. Meanwhile, Nathan has trouble getting rid of the woman who wants him to marry her, Miss. Adelaide (Vivian Blaine). Also starring Robert Keith as Lieutenant Brannigan, Stubby Kaye as beautifully beautiful Johnson and B.S. Pulley as Big Christmas. An interesting romantic comedy musical, with Brando singing all his own songs, and Sinatra is smooth and cool. The Oscars have been awarded for the best art direction decoration, best cinematography, best costume design and best music for Jay Blackton and Cyril J. Mockridge. This is the BAFTA for Best Film of any Source, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Music / Comedy. Frank Sinatra was number 43 on the 100 largest Pop culture icons. Marlon Brando was number 30 at The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. He was number 11 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols. He was number 4 at 100 years, 100 stars.
