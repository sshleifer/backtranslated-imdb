A simple comment ... <br /> <br /> What can I say ... it's a wonderful movie I can watch over and over. It is definitely one of the top ten comedies. Featuring a major actor, Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau, Neil Simon portrays a perfect script based on his play. <br /> <br /> It's perfect to make life situations perfect. If you have a digital cable, you get the menu at the bottom of the screen to give what is going on. It usually gives this movie ***% stars, but actually earns **** stars. If you really watch this movie, you can say it will be so funny and fresh this year.
