When I chaired our college's coffee house, one of our work was to review student activity groups and films. One of the best things to do in 1972 was Groove Tube. The original premise was that it was shown outside Broadway in theaters where television monitors were placed by the audience so everyone had a good place. The premise was that the sketch would change on a regular basis - all Saturday Night Live, to keep the thing fresh. They decided to make it into a film for general distribution. <br /> <br /> I believe the developers said it was the first time Chevy Chase was on film. See how he walks naked, though the bush was crying. Like many reviews before me, it was Saturday Night Live before such a thing happened. I recommend this vid. I told my 13-year-old son of Koko the clown. He can't wait to get a copy!
