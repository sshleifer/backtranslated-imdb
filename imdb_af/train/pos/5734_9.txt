I consider myself a great fan of David Lynch's works because he offers viewers absolutely unique motion pictures with typical Lynch elements. After seeing most of his works, I thought I could predict Lynch's next step. I was dead wrong. Dumbland is something I could never think of under the name of David Lynch. Yet, after my recovery from the first shock, I started thinking about this extremely primitive main character and I concluded that all the absurdities, cruelty, cruelty, and disgust presented here mirror the reality, emphasized by distort it. There are things in our lives that we hardly emphasize, because they are either disgusting or awful, but they are around us, so I take the courage to say, Dumbland focuses on these bits. It is not a movie to enjoy, although you will sometimes laugh at a strange, twisted sense of humor, it is an animated reflection of all things we rather reject to observe, with its simplicity, morbidity and absurdity . Take it as it is, you don't have to keep it. It doesn't exist. And finally, if you're attentive enough, you'll also find elements typical of Lynch. I recommend it for tolerant people !!!
