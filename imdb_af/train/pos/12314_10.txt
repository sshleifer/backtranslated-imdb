Once a movie comes together that raises the bar for every other movie in its genre. A movie of this caliber will affect many movies after the release for the coming year. "A Chinese Spirit Story" falls into this category. This is probably one of the best horror movies made during the 1980s; possibly one of the best ever made. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers have made a movie adhering to every horror fan. The story is impressive and original. The villains are appropriately threatening and frightening. The sets are creepy and atmospheric. There is even a little blood and gore to satisfy the plunder of the house. But don't let the horror label deter you if you're not a fan of the genre. This movie easily fits in many different categories. <br /> <br /> The scriptwriter thoroughly blended the drama, comedy, horror, kung fu and romance genres into a delicious, luxury movie pizza. "A Chinese Spirit Story" is a beautiful epic love story that is happily spoken without the generous nudity and / or explicit sex scenes that devastated many Hollywood love stories. Those who are deposited by the romantic elements of the story can sit back in the fast-paced sword and 'wire-fu'. If that's not enough, actress Leslie Cheung and Wu Ma offer enough humorous situations to satisfy your comedy appetite. This movie offers something for every movie story. <br /> <br /> Director Siu-Tung Ching and producer Tsui Hark compiled a wonderful movie for this movie. Leslie Cheung proves that he is not only a talented actor, but also a talented singer and a beautiful physical comedian. I can't possibly think of another artist like Cheung who could portray Ling Choi Sin better (except maybe Chow Yun Fat). Joey Wang is mesmerizing like Lit Su Seen, the addict who steals the heart of Cheung's character. Her portrayal of the title character is truly haunting and memorable. Wu Ma is hilarious as the cantanker Taoist who helps young lovers. <br /> <br /> At the technical level, this movie is very impressive, even according to today's standards. The direction is wonderful. I wish today's Hollywood executives would look for talented artists such as Siu-Tung Ching, who would rather fall back on regular MTV video or Pepsi commercial `directors'. The cinematography is beautiful. You have to praise a cinematographer who can make a movie look like most of his screenplays take place at night. The special effects make-up is top-notch. In fact, most of the creature effects in this movie blow off the weird CGI ghouls and goblins that have become common in modern horror movies. <br /> <br /> Since its release, a Chinese Ghost Story has two worthy sequels, a full length animation movie, and numerous imitations. However, none of the films that followed or copied were able to capture the magic of these classics. This movie is needed to look for any horror fan or just someone looking for a great way to spend 95 minutes of your time. 10 out of 10. <br /> <br />
