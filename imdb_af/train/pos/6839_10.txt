In what one of the most blood-free movies ever should be, a transvestite is murdered in New York, and the answer to everything may not be what people suspect. One can see how Brian DePalma has an influence from Hitchcock with camera angles and things. Michael Caine plays a most formidable character, while Angie Dickinson is basically a boring rich woman with a bad hairstyle. Keith Gordon (who later played in "Christine") is probably the most interesting character in the movie. But you can't really understand this movie without seeing it. And once you've seen it, you should never know who you can trust. Also with Nancy Allen and Dennis Franz.
