If the movies are believed, Chinese spirits are much nicer and more naughty than their Western counterparts. The storylines of the three Chinese Ghost movies are largely identical, but the direction is excellent and the detail and color are such that it is not a big problem. As always, humor is an integral part of the film, accompanied, of course, with a great deal of concern. For those who have not yet encountered the "Chinese GhostStory" trilogy, this film offers an interesting departure from the Western horror / ghost genre; For those who still have a pleasant skirt in the Chinese ghost world.
