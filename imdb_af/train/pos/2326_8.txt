Dani (Reese Witherspoon) has always been very close to her older sister Maureen (Emily Warfield) until they both fall in love with their neighbor (Jason London). But it is not after a terrible tragedy that the two sisters realize that nothing can keep them apart and that their love for each other will never disappear. <br /> <br /> It was really a heartbreaking story about the first love. Probably the most painful story about young love I've ever seen. All the plays are wonderful and Reese Witherspoon gives an excellent performance in her first movie. I'll give the man in the moon 8.5 / 10
