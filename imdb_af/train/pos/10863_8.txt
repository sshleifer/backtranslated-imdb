First, I must say I made the mistake of keeping track of the electoral films. I'm sorry, because after election 2 was first seen, election seems a bit of a disappointment. Both films are gangster epics that are similar in shape. And while election is a nice piece of cinema, it's just not as good as it is. <br /> <br /> In the first election installment, the two competitors are shown to chair; Big D and Lok. After a few scenes of discussion among the "Uncle's" about the chairperson's title, they (almost unanimously) decide that Lok (Simon Yam) will stir the Triads. To say that, don't go well with rival Big D (Tony Leung Ka Fai), and in an attempt to influence the takeover, Big D kidnapped two of the uncles to turn the electoral council to his side. It has disastrous results and heads the triads in a whole war. Lok is determined to become chairman, but will not be official until he can repair the "Dragon Head Baton", a substantial representation of the chairman's power. The current chairman, Whistle (Chung Wang) has hidden somewhere in mainland China and the race is on to see who can recover it first. <br /> <br /> Much of the movie is dedicated to the recovery of the Baton. As both aspiring leaders are looking for it, they have to evade police and opposite sides, leading to one of the outstanding elections in Election, which includes an underground Jet (Nick Cheung), a machete and many bad guys. Nick Cheung's presence is stepping down to say the least ... I wonder if it affected director Johhnie To in any way while making the second election, as he is delivering more Jet's character in the successor. <br /> <br /> While Nick Cheung gives a theater performance, I don't have to give it to the rest of the movie's actors. Election has a good ensemble broadcast with well thought out performances that are both subtle and impact. Simon Yam is usually his glorious self and the film also benefits from heavyweight actors such as Louis Koo, Tony Leung Ka Fai and the undervalued Suet Lam. There are really no bad links in the act and one can easily believe they are real gangsters. <br /> <br /> Although the performances are great, one of the impressive things about Johnnie To's Eye is the camera. There are some notable shots in the movie and it goes without saying that you definitely know how to shoot his shots, as the viewer is treated to a range of innovative and very brilliant camera locations and angles. All that makes elections, especially, a nice movie. <br /> <br /> My problems with the movie mostly come from the number of characters involved in the election. It gets a little difficult to follow, because the movie is so full of characters that is not an integral part of the plot. While the successor wants to focus more on the two candidates, the first election offers the electoral process as a whole with tons of uncles, males and police officers who saturate the storyline. Perhaps the movie would have worked better if it had been a little longer with more time devoted to the inner workings of the Triad, or if director Johnnie To would interpret and set out the necessary elements. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line - All in all, it's a wonderful brutal movie with a great role, excellent direction and quiet pacing that packs a punch. It's just a little more complicated than it was needed.
