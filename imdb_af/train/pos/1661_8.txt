(spoilers?) <br /> <br /> While historical accuracy may be questionable ... (and with the mass appeal of the inaccurate LOTR, such things are now more easily excused) I liked the art of it. Although it's not really an art house movie. It offers some emotionally charged scenes from time to time. <br /> <br /> I have two complaints. 1. This is too short. and 2. The voice you hear whispering from time to time is not explained. <br /> <br /> 8/10 <br /> Quality: 10/10 Entertainment: 7/10 Repeatable: 5/10
