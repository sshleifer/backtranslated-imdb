This film is not morbine, nor is it depressed. Dis-sad, because AIDS was sad in the early 90's. But his true message is one of love and perseverance. <br /> <br /> Mark and Tom were in a long-term, loving relationship. Their dedication to each other is immediately evident, and as the destruction of AIDS escalates and becomes the focal point of their lives, you see strength and dedication that are truly heartwarming. <br /> <br /> When "Silverlake Life" was originally released, I was very much involved in HIV / AIDS education and healthcare, volunteer work as a counselor at an HIV / AIDS clinic. The movie talked to me like no other Aids movie of his day, because Mark and Tom were real people and live the many experiences I have seen in real life daily. I knew from first-hand experience how it was to see AIDS eating at formerly vibrant, young, healthy people; As Mark and Tom happened in the movie, it was very much like seeing my real friends weaken. It touched me so much that it even touched me all these years.
