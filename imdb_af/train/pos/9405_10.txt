While Hollywood became silent during the few years after World War II, England developed a very productive film industry. In "The Man in the White Suit", inventor Sidney Stratton (Alec Guinness) creates a suit that never gets dirty. Unfortunately, some other businesses are probably out of business now! How can Sidney deal with this and maintain his dignity? This is an example of one of the great movies in which Alec Guinness dies before becoming Obi Wan Kenobi. This is a good look at the overall absurdity of business. If you are planning to start any business, you may want to consider watching this movie.
