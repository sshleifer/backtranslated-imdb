I'm not a fan of new movies, but this one was a great pleasure to watch. Adults and children can see it together - how unusual! My aunt also liked it. It has laughter, tears, love, adventure, special effects, good actors - and a parrot. It reminded me of a favorite, The Wizard of Oz. The hero, Paulie, an intelligent parrot, is separated from his home and family and goes through many adventures, temptations and disappointments, and always remembers his decision to find his friend Marie. Highly recommended.
