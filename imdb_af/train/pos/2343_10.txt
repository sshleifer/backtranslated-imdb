Thanks, ABC picked it up instead of Fox. The best description (for those who know) is really miracles that meet Death as Me as best possible. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if an experience of death and fate early in life doesn't make me a fan of Brian Fuller, but I definitely enjoy his productions. I also enjoy checkered floors, pies, toys, engravings and other ominous items :) While a little Burtonesque, I definitely think it enjoys its own niche that doesn't need J Depp or HB Carter to be a wonderfully imaginative playground . Here we can find the joys and sorrows of childhood and adulthood that fall apart and really make sense and let life live to the limit!
