Ultra-grim crime drama by Pou-Soi Cheang, the director of "Home Sweet Home". Tonally reminded me of Billy Tang's "Run and Kill", although it wasn't so polished. Nonetheless, it's a fascinating, flawed piece of chaos about a Cambodian one-person, Pang (Edison Chen), who arrives in Hong Kong to kill a lawyer. As he flees the scene, he kills the partner of cop Sam Wai, who, in order to inflict injuries amid the handling of his dying father, begins Sam an insane, obsessive manhunt for Pang up to a dozen lead. dead bodies and ruthless violence. There must have been something in the air lately, because I have never seen so many people hitting the pulp as I did in recent times. These are grim, nasty things, and that's why I'm so partial to it, and I rejoice in its anticipated atmosphere. It is arrested visually and the sound design is very unique. Dramatically, everything spirals down until each character finds himself or herself in a world of screaming pain. A subplot involving Pang's attachment to a sexually abused girl adds depth to the story and boasts a surprising fourth act that boasts a fine act of grotesque operation.
