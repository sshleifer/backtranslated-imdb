The master of film show Cecil B. De Mille is going to West. Using three legends of the old west as lead actors (they probably never met), Gary Cooper launches Wild Bill Hickock, James Ellison as Buffalo Bill and Jean Arthur makes a good Calamity Jane. The story only serves De Mille to hang wonderful action sequences, such as the great Indian attack. Sometimes it's done very well. If you don't mind the little over-the-top performances of the role, it's a very entertaining western.Look out for a very young Anthony Quinn set up the role of an Indian brave who participated in the battle. from Little Big Horn. This part has at least noticed him in Hollywood.
