INSIDE SPOILERS! <br /> <br /> I've seen an ad on a video for this. Then my sister discovered that we had the book so I read it. I hired the video the same day I finished the book. I thought it was very memorable as the book was. The movie was brilliant. Tara Fitzgerald was excellent, as Helen and Rupert Graves were hateful as Arthur. The costumes, music and settings are surprisingly beautiful. <br /> <br /> WARNING! LOOK NOW MORE THAN YOU HAVE WEEDED HERE <br /> <br /> To the detriment, there are some sex scenes added and some violence. That's why the video is 15. There are a few other things thrown. At first I felt the accuracy was down. While the book is better than that, I'm glad I saw it and would recommend it to people who read the book, Bronte's fans or like drama drama (I'm all 3!) . The book is quite subject. The books of Anne Brontes do not seem to be commonly known as Jane Erye or Wuthering Heights which made it several times in television and film. Another thing. When I read the book, I was amazed at how much religion was in it, but here they figured it out! <br /> <br /> 7
