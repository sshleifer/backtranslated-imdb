As someone who has never been to sports, it seems to me hard to get into the football (or as we Americans call it unpredictable, soccer) -the theme "Bend It Like Beckham". But I have to say, it was a cool movie! Anglo-Indian Jesminder Bhamra (Parminder Nagra) and her WASP friend, Juliette Paxton (Keira Knightley), like to play soccer (yes, I'm going to say it in the UK and internationally) and just adore David Beckham. But Jesminder's traditional Sikh parents do not approve (her mother presents a very detailed description of football early in the movie). Okay, so maybe it was kind of a clich√© in that sense, but you must love this movie! And if I like me, you go to this movie without knowing the definition of "bending" in the football ... don't worry, the movie explains it (I've never heard of David Beckham before this movie ). And we all know that Keira Knightley grew up: A few months after "BILB" came out in the States, she was in the equally cool "Pirates of the Caribbean": The Curse of the Black Pearl.
