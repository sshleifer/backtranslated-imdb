This movie surprised me. I didn't have very high expectations for that, but I was wrong. Mary & Rhoda were very funny and well written. They did not spend too much time reclaiming the past, so they did not rely on the success of the old TV program to carry the movie. Overall it was very entertaining. <br /> <br /> My girlfriend said it could be a weekly sit-com and I think I agree with her.
