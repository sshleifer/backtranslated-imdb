"The Shooter" was another kind of movie for Michael Dudikoff. Although it is usually associated with action flashes that include martial arts, this film, as it was western, enabled him to show that he was a much more capable actor than allowed certain formula-like lines. <br /> <br /> The major issue, of course, is that the movie doesn't allow any solid character development. The meat is really left to the viewer. We can only guess at the sadness the shooter made, whose real name is Michael Atherton, the killer he is - a killer, do you think, that a small town affected by a local bully terror welcomes as a hero who can release it from his misery.
