For anyone who doesn't speak Swedish: The Swedish [original] title of this movie; "Rånarna" translated into something in the line of "The Robbers". This fact is the biggest problem I have with the movie because it's not really about the robbers. It's about a young woman working for Swedish police investigating robberies. A regular desk work that one would think, but this girl is soon on the field to take matters into her own hands, as the story goes, even one of the robbers shoots. Exactly: We've seen it before. The fact that there is a rather interesting twist on the plot does not really help, as the end is just like cliché as the first two thirds of the film. <br /> <br /> What saves just being another mainstream movie is the fact that it's done masterfully in every way, that the actors are as big as they are and don't overreact and that the director it really really keeps it as exciting as it is for most of the story. /> <br /> One thing I really loved about this movie is the fact that it is music that sets the right mood when needed, but is absent for the rest of the time, giving a good sense of reality for the shooting and Car-chases spread throughout the film. A fun touch! The fact that Michael Persbrandt is one of the few Swedish actors who are often inclined to type, unfortunately hurts the movie if you know that he will not only play the boyfriend's boyfriend and be a supportive character in the background, but This is something you should be neglected. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's an entertaining movie that steals more money in its plot than your time is. 10/07
