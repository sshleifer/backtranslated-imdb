When I rented this movie, I thought I was going to see a horror movie. However, there is little horror in this typical seventy mystery drama, directed by the funny James T. Flocker. Beautiful Matt Boston carries the picture with his good performance and the typical strange atmosphere of Flocker's movies is all present.
