It is truly the largest Swedish movie of all time. Not only is it revolutionary in its narrative, but it is also one of the first movies to feature the next generation of Swedish humor and Swedish comedians. Felix Herngren and Fredrik Lindstr√∂m are today two of the most intelligent and witty filmmakers in Sweden, and this film really represents it. <br /> <br /> "Adult" is a hot and hilarious story about adulthood, and whether we should be better.
