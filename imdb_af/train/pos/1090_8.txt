One of Cary Grant's most enduring comedies is Mr. Mixtures build his dream home. Although its size is determined, the home will be a dream home today. Still, Cary has made a good living in the advertising field, though he had a devil to make a slogan for ham with the brand Wham. <br /> <br /> What made this movie popular was the shortage of housing after World War II. The return of war veterans was to claim their rights under the GI Bill of Rights that included home loans. The problem was there were not enough houses to satisfy the demand. Around the time, the book was succeeded by Eric Hodgins and the film so popular Congress and President Truman signed the Taft-Ellender-Wagner Housing Act which signed the government for the first time in the home business. <br /> <br /> I had an uncle and aunt who built their own home at the same time they entered the early fifties. Like Cary Grant and Myrna Loy, they had two daughters and wanted to get out of downtown Rochester. Their place was not as big as a home in Connecticut with eighteen rooms, but they still lived the rest of their lives as Cary and Myrna probably did. <br /> <br /> Of course, it was expensive and the Costs continue to pick up and threaten to send Cary to the cleaners. Cary and Myrna also offer Melvyn Douglas advice, usually too late. The truth is that he is so nice on Myrna and Cary knows it. <br /> <br /> Myrna Loy's role is simply an extension of Nora Charles. If you can imagine that Charles is going to the country and William Powell has the headache Cary Grant, the movie will only work well. <br /> <br /> Mr. Mixtures build his dream home still works well as comedy because the situations are universal. And this review is dedicated to my uncle Walter and aunt Kate who have lived together in their dream home for over 40 years.
