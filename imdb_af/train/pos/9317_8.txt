I criticized this film with the statement, "If you can get the moralizing ..." It misses the point. Moralization is in the conscience of the observer, as it was. It's a decent movie with a standard murder mystery, but with a clear twist that is halfway through. The resolution makes the viewer wonder, "What would I have done in this position?" And I have to believe that's exactly what the filmmaker meant. To achieve this, and to entertain the audience, the film passes. I also like the way violence is never on stage, but just outside the camera. We know what has just happened; it just served us before, then smeared in our faces, as would be the case with contemporary blood and dressing. Moreover, violence is not the point. The point is the protagonist's moral dilemma, which is clever, though troubled, resolved.
