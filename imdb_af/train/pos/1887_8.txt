Arthur is a middle-aged rich 'child' who drinks like a fish. Arthur does what he feels and says everything that comes into his mind. He likes to boast about his wealth and knows he's a spoil. He spends money on people he doesn't know and finds everything funny. Arthur must marry a high-class girl to inherit a great fortune, but he falls in love with a poor waitress Liza Minnelli (she looks really weird). <br /> <br /> It's a damn funny movie. I watched this movie because a very famous Indian movie 'Sharabee' is based on Arthur's character. Although 'Sharabee' is definitely inspired by 'Arthur', I think they are two different movies. "Arthur" is not nice. She is sometimes very thin. There are so many fantastic liners in the movie. It's not a laughing noise, but it has some fantastic moments. My favorite scene is when Arthur meets his fiance's dad and he talks about the 'moose'. Duddley Moore probably has some comic timings. He is very good at words and body language. I loved the scene where he was talking about a "small" country to a specified couple in the hotel and he spoke in two different directions with husband and wife. John Gielgud has an Oscar for this film. I don't know the actor. I don't think he did a good job but could be if I looked at his work more. Movie has some flat spots, but not very long. looking forward to watching the successor.
