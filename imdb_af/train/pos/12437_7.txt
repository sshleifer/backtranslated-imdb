As a long fan of Peter O'Donnell's greatest creation, I watched this movie on DVD, without much hope of enjoyment; Indeed, I expected in 15 minutes to be horrified by the remote. Instead, I thoroughly enjoyed this production, and I especially enjoyed and appreciated how the producers and director managed to tell the background story of the Modesty Blaise. They managed to avoid the fall of making a (bad) movie version of the books we are all so familiar with. Instead of focusing on a period of modesty, only novels are mentioned. <br /> <br /> As for the production values ​​(and I'm not a filmography student!): Yes, the movie is filmed on a tight financial and time budget and might show it ... but wasting it viewer's enjoyment? In this case I don't think so. Instead, we are introduced to one of the world's greatest literary heroines and a taste of its abilities. <br /> <br /> Regarding the casting: because in unknown areas we are the only people who really matter, modesty and (perhaps) Professor Lob. For me, they were completely credible. Alexandra Staden, described by some as wood, and too thin to be an action heroine, brought to the screen Humility's pussy and coolness; her technique (when martial arts was needed), but most importantly, was the personal integrity at the heart of the Modesty Blaise cannon. <br /> <br /> OK, so we all know that this movie was made to make Miramax's claim to the Modesty Blaise character, it's made fast and cheap, BUT ... I can't wait to get the next production in this series by these producers, as long as they abide by the core values ​​and characterizations of the original stories!
