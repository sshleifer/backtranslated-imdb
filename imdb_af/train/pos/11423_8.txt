This movie shows life in Northern Cameroon from the point of view of a young French girl, France Dalens, whose father is an official for the government of the colonial government and whose family is one of the few white families. It gives a sense of how life was for both the colonists and the natives with whom they were associated. This is in keeping with another movie I've seen in Africa over a similar period (Nirgendwo in Africa (2001)), but I have no way of knowing how realistic or typical it is. It's not just an impression - things happen in the movie - but the plot is underestimated. The viewer is left to draw his own conclusions rather than pushing the filmmakers on him, although the appearance of the story as a springboard of the woman's visit to Southwest Cameroon offers as an adult perspective.
