Playing: Jim Carrey, Morgan Freeman, Jennifer Anniston I was really skeptical the first time I watched this movie. I mean, what a conceptual nightmare. Jim Carrey plays God? Nothing is sacred. <br /> <br /> Well, this movie is almost sacred, but it's not sacred either, at least not to a great extent. Yes, Jim Carrey has the powers of God for a while, but he is not God. Confused? I give you the layers. <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey plays Bruce Nolan, a reporter who falls on his luck and feels very unsuccessful in his life. He lives with his beautiful girl, Grace (Anniston), and you can tell straight from the bat they love each other, but the relationship is pretty shaky. <br /> <br /> Then Bruce gets a shot at anchorman, just to get it stolen by Evan Baxter. Obviously not, Bruce shares his thoughts with the world through television in a way that is comical and definitely worth getting fired. <br /> <br /> Many complain and grab over God later, Bruce gets a page. After a while he gets tired of calling, and he responds and goes to the Omni Presents building (heh). There he meets God (Freeman), who is the boss, electrician and writer of the building. I found it very amusing. God is the master, the Holy Spirit is the Electrician, and Jesus Christ is the Janitor. Think about it. Boss, obvious. Electrician, the man who keeps everything going. Janitor, the man cleaning the mess that left the world. BRILLIANT. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Bruce is a bit skeptical about the fact that he actually met God, but if God gives Bruce his powers and gives him a chance to play God, he begins believe a little. Wonder why. Involve the blatant abuse of powers for personal gain and abuse of enemies. <br /> <br /> Since it's Hollywood, Bruce is finally breaking up, learning his lesson and starting to use his strength for the good of the world. In the end, he calls out for God to take it away and pray that his will be done, not Bruce's. <br /> <br /> Since it is Jim Carrey, the movie is very amusing and there are definitely a few entertainers. moments in it. The movie is not perfect theology, but Hollywood is definitely a good attempt. Many statements in the movie can be very challenging and even challenging, and I complain to Tom Shadyac for his effort in this movie. <br /> <br /> So, far from perfect, definitely an amusing popcorn movie with a bit of thought behind it. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: 3.5 out of 4 (worth having a view or two)
