The Caprica episode (S01E01) is well done as a pilot. Really, this episode is exactly the same content as the DVD lead release. It is said that episode 01 gives a very substantive background to the very popular "Battlestar Galactica" series (both the original and the 2007 remake). This is significant for the 2007 series. As the latest graphic sci-fi is late, explore this series of "Virtual" life or environment. In addition, we are given much background on the Adama family line as well as their relationship with the uncontrolled (in the Battlestar Galactica series) creator of the Cylons. For the most part, this first episode revolves around the popular subject of "Virtual" life and (as expected) the early life of the colonies and the birth of the Cylons. <br /> <br /> Everything, I enjoy this episode. Although, it was not new material for myself or anyone who had already seen the DVD release of the Caprica pilot, the series looks very promising. As with many pilots, episode 01 leaves us with a rock hanger, so an audience is assured by an audience (science community). I will definitely continue to look for both configuration and development. <br /> <br /> I give this series 8 stars.
