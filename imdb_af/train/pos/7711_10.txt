Oh, so Robbie is a little hokey looking at today's standards, and some of the plays are pretty quiet and most special effects can now be duplicated by a bright 12-year-old child with a decent computer editor. And don't let me start over the poster. <br /> <br /> It's another great movie, 40 years after it's released. I grew up on Sunday afternoons watching a "science fiction" at the local TV station's "Science Fiction / Adventure Theater", so I saw quite a few SF movies from the 50's. At a time when most movies were happy to hit a rubber suit on someone and demolish him a miniature model of a city, Forbidden Planet has always raised the bar and shown that it was possible for a science fiction -make a movie that actually had a plot. <br /> <br /> I doubt many SF movies made in the 90s will still be worth watching in 2030.
