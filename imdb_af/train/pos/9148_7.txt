A very undervalued film telling the story of a young musician caught in an ever-declining spiral of domestic violence. <br /> <br /> At times difficult to watch, while Morris Day is portrayed as the misogynist, Prince as the knight On (motorcycle) steed, he is still advised to give a woman twice as part of the script. knock. The fact that he can do this and still emerge as a defective but fair hero is credit for writing. Prince is so free of ego in this film, that he not only portrays himself as a narcissistic megalomania, hitting women, but his most famous song is fictionalized as written by his father and Wendy & Lisa. Another two of his compositions - Computer Blue (although the album's worst album) and Darling Nikki - are considered songs that kill an audience. Perhaps the only concession to the Princely ego is a map calling the (slightly shorter than Prince) Apollonia 5'6. <br /> <br /> The almost complete amateur cast is mainly band members who play themselves (and judges who lead the actors on the terms they've never seen in other movies are completely missing the point) and do it well under the direction. Morris Day gets most of the plaudits for his lovely ham, although Jerome Benton also needs credit to reflect him well, especially his play, which is hilarious. Day and Benton go even as far as making an Abbott and Costello routine funny, doing something. <br /> <br /> Finally there is Prince. While I admit that I am biased, I actually think he is a pretty good actor in terms of the fact that he can portray a low key version of himself. Acting is NOT his profession, it was a movie made for entertainment, so someone pointed out that the starring man is not Robert DeNiro and thinks they are making a point is unfortunately misled. I don't want this review to be a false attack on other people's remarks, but I even dated this movie as a low budget and dark one. How will a film about domestic violence be shot, then? With full overhead lights and a CGI dinosaur running in frame? <br /> <br /> The movie is almost like a perfect snapshot of the neon lights and skinny tie era ?? until you remember it's actually made in a world of curly perms and tinny synths, and it's not some retro recreation. Prince's best film with Oscar-winning music, it sees him at its peak, and it is sad to realize that although he would make some fine albums, he would never catch up.
