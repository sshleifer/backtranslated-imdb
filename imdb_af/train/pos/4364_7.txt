I've never heard of Robert Roy MacGregor before "Rob Roy" came out, but the movie is definitely worth seeing. Liam Neeson plays the title for the role he has brought to Oskar Schindler, and Jessica Lange also does a very good job as his wife, Mary. Archibald Cunningham (Tim Roth) is one person who can crawl your skin. <br /> <br /> All in all, it comes out as well as Braveheart (maybe even better). I laugh as I think how Hollywood released two movies, which played almost back and forth. Very good. Also mainly John Hurt, Eric Stoltz, Brian Cox and Jason Flemyng.
