More directors like Nacho Vigalondo need a bigger output for their talents. 7:35 The la ma√±ana is absolute genius. What Nacho can deliver in 8 minutes takes a few Hollywood director hours to reach the movie. I watched it smile but feel a little dirty and not in the sexual way. You sit and wonder how you should feel after watching these 8 minutes. clot. I was entertained, but I was disturbed at the same time. Not many people can do it in just 8 minutes. It starts off simple enough. A young woman comes to her breakfast at her usual place. She sat down and started singing. From there, the film takes you so many different emotions at once, it's hard to describe. It's in black and white, but it helps with the feeling the movie gives. This film lets you know more about the characters, how they used to interact and how the end influenced their lives. I think it's like the old saying, "Let them want more", Nacho Vigalondo can do it. See it when you can. Show it to your friends and wonder how 8 minutes can be so much fun without wearing your clothes.
