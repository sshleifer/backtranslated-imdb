I have read several mixed reviews and several of them have scraped the movie thoroughly. I was originally interested in this project because it was appointed by Tony Scott and I became very interested in his work after Man On Fire had so much influence on me. Before I start my review, let me first say it ... it's great to see this movie be bored in a boring and ordinary way, but the authors and Scott have chosen a different approach. <br /> <br /> Plot: <br /> <br /> Simply put, it's not boring. Most Hollywood movies provide 'tried and tested' plots that they know to people, often ensuring audience acceptance of the movie and creating a greater likelihood of profit. This plot was one of the more interesting things I've seen for a while. Just for reference, I recently watched 'The Weather Man' and 'Lord of War' and while I would say that these movies are excellent and I both enjoyed them immensely, both of them are boring in these movies and become exactly tell you how you would expect them to be told. They do not take chances whatsoever, and they are extremely predictable after watching a number of American films. Domino's plot is both interesting and tells in a way that makes you think, "oh man, they're screwed now". And I feel it's missing in many recent movies. It is very deep in my mind and gives you many things to question while you see it. Overall, that's what interests me so much in the movie. <br /> <br /> Characters: <br /> <br /> I felt the characters were accurate. Knightley did a beautiful job of portraying a beautiful woman, who was everything but on the inside and wanted to be seen as she was. It was obvious that she wanted to prove herself and she did everything that meant she had to reach it. <br /> <br /> Choco was also very credible, his use of Spanish in inappropriate situations, his responses to Domino's lack of love, as well as his jealousy problems within the team ... they all became true to me, what made me feel that his character was so much more realistic. <br /> <br /> Rourke's character was the least interesting to me, but I still really liked it. He looked like an ordinary man trying to meet ends. I hope this is what the filmmakers are trying to achieve with him, because that's what I got from it. He had a very good job of showing Ed in an average Joe kind who made his mistakes, but still trying to live. <br /> <br /> Claremont / Ladies: I believe they need bread 'for the story. They were not just people who got money to buy a Bentley, they were real people who had a real problem and they were looking for others to reach the goal. You can empathize with them, because for them this child's disease was a problem without any other solution. These characters were supposed to show real people who were less fortunate in this mess because they needed help. <br /> <br /> The gangsters: They've seen the story sinister in a way that only the crowd can. And I really liked it. They also packed the story with small intricacies that made the plot so much more interesting. <br /> <br /> Christopher Walken / 90210 guys: <br /> <br /> They provided the comic relief in an otherwise very serious movie. . Van Walken's uncomfortable statements to the incessant references to the 90210 guys who have bones. Their involvement in the film just made it more enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Cinematography .... yes .... that cinematography. This is where this movie has lost many potential fans. But in my opinion I thought it was genius. The use of the camera to translate the mood of the current situation was, in my opinion, extremely effective. I see it as a method that is properly realized, but can always improve, just like anything else. I congratulate both the author, the editor, the film and the director of photography and congratulations on this film. Not only did they progress with their performance, they went so much further. The use of colors, both extremely light and extremely dark, has the 'look' of the film with a sinister and grungy appearance depicting the lives of the crowds, bounty hunters and the less fortunate people in a way that shows them do not live as perky or "clean" like everyone else. If you notice, in times of less stress or conflict, there were very few camera tricks if at all. It shows that Scott and his crew have tried to achieve this appearance and not just did it. I realize that most people who watched this movie did not expect it and that caused many of them to turn off for this movie, but I think it was wonderful that Scott took this approach. Hollywood movies have become predictable and soft. Most of them are shot in the same way with the same twists and turns. And I'm glad Scott was trying to make something else. <br /> <br /> Allowed, this movie is not for everyone, but to say it's trash and nothing to offer, the point is completely missing. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and I'm glad I spent the money for it. I would recommend it to everyone, but I'm sure it will only hit a chord with little. I have to agree with a previous poster when he said that many of those who refuse to see outside the 'MTV sphere' will not appreciate this movie, but I think many people will. We should all try to enjoy it for the fact that Scott and co. took a few chances and tried to deliver something unique. And with that in mind, I think he did tremendously.
