I honestly think this was the best version of the war of the world I saw every time. It was funny, but it was also educational, I learned the movie a lot and if I could, I'd have that movie. My favorite part was when the soldiers killed on the robot and another came behind. In the last film war of the world I think it should have been more like the first one and it would have been better. but in any way I give this movie 2 inches. <br /> <br /> And if they where to make another movie like this, I'll definitely see it. <br /> <br /> Thank you
