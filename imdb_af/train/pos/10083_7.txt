The fact that this movie has been poured on DVD still formatted on TV and with a fuzzy picture, has greatly annoyed many filmmakers ...... and rightly so. It deserves a much better treatment. <br /> <br /> The story is about a street performer who needs a boy to pass his craft (the rules of the day) and instead of a little girl (not the conventional way ) ... and the problems that occur afterwards. The old man bought the child from a slave auction and soon discovered the child was not a boy, which he obviously thought. <br /> <br /> The old man "Bianlian Wang (Xu Zhu) is kind of funny with a missing front tooth and a contagious grin. The girl" Doggie "(Hangzhou Renying) is a tuck shop. The story is how the two control it, I usually like a nice sentimental ending, but it gets a bit turned away in the last 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a drama, thrill story Filled with humor and sadness, don't just forget about a good quality picture for the money you spend on the DVD, until it goes widescreen, rent it.
