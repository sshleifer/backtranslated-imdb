I lost my dad at a very young age. So precisely, I have no memory of him. Over the years I learned a lot about him. One of those things was that he loved Western, and every Sunday, Bonanza was an absolute ritual to him. I remember myself at the end of the series, 8 years old, when the show stopped in 1973. To watch this show over the years makes me somehow closer to my lost father. It has all the right elements to make a show successful: laugh, tears, edge of your seat tension, and it even made you angry. My most lively memory of the show's original run came shortly after the death of our beloved Hoss Cartwright, Dan Blocker. One particular episode, and the end of closing credits, stained a photo of Blocker and faded to black, and I can also remember my eldest sister with a tear in her eye when I see it. I can remember it as if it were yesterday. On behalf of my old father, who is not here to say so, we love Bonanza. Life is the Cartwrights.
