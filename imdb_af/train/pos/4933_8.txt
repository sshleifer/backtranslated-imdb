Refreshing "lost" jewel! With effective dialogue combined with excellent acting to establish the characters, you are enough to take care of what happens to them. The Douglas and Widmark characters are realistic heroes. Palance is his usual evil presence. Widmark wins the fistical battle scene, a car hunt of less than 60 seconds with a "logical" end, and a long pursuit that blames the exaggerated pursuits of contemporary Hollywood. You know how it will probably end, but the tension and interest is sustained throughout. The end of the chase is one of the most realistic things you'll ever see. The film seems to slow a little beyond the waist but stays with it for the rewarding conclusion.
