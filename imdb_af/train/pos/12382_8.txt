Here's a decent center of the 70-year-old horror over a gate of hell in NYC that is just an old brown stone. It looks like there are many gates of hell, but of course it happens unconscious model to decide she needs a little space from her boyfriend / fiance and therefore she only chooses one who is disguised as a beautiful and affordable apartment. She meets several strange neighbors, and even attends a birthday party for a cat. When met with the broker because she heard strange noises at night, she found that she and an old priest were being the only tenants. Whoa! Then who are all these strangers? Her boyfriend (a slimy lawyer, played by Chris Sarandon) started pushing over and found that things didn't look like they were, not a long shot. It has some decent creepy scenes and the idea of ​​the creaking old people who are "sometimes" neighbors different from what they look like is pretty intriguing. A little decent gore and even a parade of less than normal people to the end makes it a decent watch, and while I've seen it on TV many times, the uncut DVD version is of course much better. Not a bad little horror movie, maybe a good companion to "Burnt Offerings". 8 out of 10.
