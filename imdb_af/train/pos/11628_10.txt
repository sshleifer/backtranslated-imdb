"I didn't want it to be complicated, read. I have to accept she's going to read it." Fear takes flight at 30 000 feet in this tight, action thriller. An overnight flight to Miami quickly becomes a struggle for survival when Lisa (Rachel McAdams) realizes her seatmate (Cillian Murphy) is planning to use her as part of a different assassination. As the minutes are over, she is in a race against time to warn the potential victims before it's too late. <br /> <br /> One of the many reasons I love this movie is because of the chemistry between the two stars, McAdams and Murphy, who are also two of my top favorite actors. For example, the early scenes at the airport are more like a romantic comedy: two people hold each other. I must also hand it over to the two, to make such a movie. Especially Murphy's character. Jackson, who is really so intricate, is so attractive and innocent, but he tries to do his job and Lisa feels physically and mentally trapped. I mean, in some parts he really worries Lisa. <br /> <br /> A great excitement goes completely through. Many movies I would hate to see a prequel or sequel, but actually I will not have a foreplay for this one, which would happen to Jackson following Lisa. Favorite scene is probably the headline scene because it was so unexpected. There was also that beautiful build up to the well-known 'pen' scene. When will she move her? There was also that nice change in McAdam's Lisa, where she changed herself from a victim to fight back. I also loved the scene where she sat down in the koshof and pretended to ask some ladies for a custody record. How big was Murphy with all his labor ...
