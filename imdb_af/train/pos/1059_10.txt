I love this show, it's sure to be a winner. Jessica Alba does a good job, it's time we have a kick girl who is not the pruning type. The whole cast is great and all the episodes have good sites. Everything was well laid out and thought. To put it together, it must have taken a while because it wasn't someone who was in a hurry who just slept. This is a BIG display altogether.
