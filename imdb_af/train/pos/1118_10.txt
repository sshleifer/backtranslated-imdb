Well, maybe this is one of the funniest movies of all time, and Sandy gives a tournament! Unfortunately, her career has never really started, but eventually she will always be remembered for her three first-class photos: "The King of Comedy", "Dallas Doll" and "Without You I'm Nothing". She dons in different personas from New York Socialite to Diana Ross to create a bitter and hilarious criticism of popular culture in America. Sexy and fiery, gentle and sensual, philosophical and melancholy, she convinces the audience in every scene, and she is actually "really beautiful". Look at this one (if you're not from Iowa), you'll enjoy it!
