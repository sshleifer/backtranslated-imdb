I'm a big Woody Allen fan and when I saw it playing at the movie, I couldn't help. I wanted to see Allen follow his beautiful movie Match Point as it was shot one of his films in G.B. (unique to Allen's work) along with what his new cap Scarlett Johanson seems to be. Scoop is much lighter than MP and the humor is Scoop's most enjoyable aspect. The plot revolves around Johanson's character (a journalism student) who gets a point about a hot story from outside the grave. She falls in love with a suspected killer (Jackman) and she has to decide if the truth is worth finding. Oh, and all this is done with the help of a clumsy wizard played by Allen. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed Johanson's performance, but I am a bit biased, I can watch a three-hour movie with Johanson in eternal frame and stagger. She plays a dizzy, yappy, bumbling sweetheart that is kind of a variation in a sense of Allen's stereotypical neurosis-stricken character. She adds appropriate body language for comic effect. Needless to say almost everyone who sees it will find Johanson's character sickly cute and that is a plus. Allen is Allen ... He still plays the same character as Chaplin and his Little Tramp character. Something in this movie makes me wonder if I will see the neurotic hypochondria again. He's not in the game of his next photo and is spending more time behind the camera. <br /> <br /> Jackman is also pleasing to the struggling millionaire murder suspect. I can't say that Jackman does anything in particular to make his part, but he does adjust his character. <br /> <br /> In terms of the plot I can't help but feel it is fresh ... In fact, it stinks of the curse of the Jade scorpion. Johanson and Allen are more detective than anything. However, I have to address Allen at his end because it's a little smarter than your typical, unobtrusive Hollywood version of this movie. Instead of being black and white, it is painted in shades of gray. To be completely innocent has nothing to do with it, nor any unambiguous debt. Although the plot looked, Woody still has one sign for one liners. I found his speeches interesting on his last film. Come for the humor, laugh and be cheerful. <br /> <br /> Needless to say if you enjoy Allen's work, watch it. If you don't look at anything else ...
