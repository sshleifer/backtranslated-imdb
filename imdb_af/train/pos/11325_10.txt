When I first heard about this series on AnimeTV, I have to say that from all the shows I have seen, this one is the best. I had to see this show, and that's what I really did. When I got the first volume of this show, it was the best. I really liked the animation, and all the fighting scenes were fantastic. I must say that my favorite characters in the show were Saber, and Archer and of course, I also like Illya. And of course, all the episodes on the volumes were interesting and very cool. Another thing I have to say about the series is Michael McConnohie (known for Transformers, and others) who plays Berserker's voice. He has a cool character. And I even watched the whole series before watching the final volume. So if you see something good, see this show, it's the best.
