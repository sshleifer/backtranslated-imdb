MPAA: Valued R for violence, language, nudity and short drug use. Quebec Rating: 13+ Canadian Home Video Rating: 18A <br /> <br /> I saw Coonskin today. This movie is also known as Bustin Out and Street Fight. After watching Fritz The Cat, I wanted to see more of Bashki's movies. I saw Cool World and thought it was mediocre and I saw it. When it was first released, the film was very controversial. It was racist and Al Sharpton wanted to ban the film, even protesting outside the movie where the film was. The movie was released on VHS under the title Street Fight. It is now regarded as a cult classic film and African American celebrities such as comedian Richard Pryor, director Spike Lee and rap group The Wu-Tang Clan said he enjoyed this movie. I personally thought Fritz The Cat was a much better movie, but it is also very enjoyable. With a view to Bashki or Blaxploitation movie fans. The movie mixes live action and animation like the movie. Rabbit. I would have preferred it in full animation, but wh The movie starts with a pastor and another man rushes to rescue two of their friends from prison. While the prisoners are waiting, the parent tells a story of three men he is kneeling. The movie then changes in animation format. We see three black men selling their house to this man. They decide to sell themselves in Harlem. So the leader, a black rabbit, kills a big player in Harlem and he basically becomes a big shot. The movie moves as the Italian mafia wants it out. The mafia involves the godfather, his three sons who are gay and an Italian clown. Coonskin is an entertaining animated movie worth checking out if you can find it.
