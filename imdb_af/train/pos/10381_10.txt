The previous reviewer said it exactly. I saw it once, was enchanted, saw it a second time when it was aired within a week or two of the first time. I still remember some of the screens. The institution is opening the 20th century. The war is called the First World War. One of the scenes is in a women-only section of a public place, which was an interesting historical note. The moment one of the women touches the other for the first time, one of my all-time great movie moments. I don't think of it as a "gay movie", it's an interesting and gentle period love story, where the two principals are women. I'd love to see this movie again; I would buy this one if it ever came out on DVD.
