Terry Gilliam's incredible feature length adjustment of Chris Marker's short film LA JETEE is full of surprising surprises, but still gets your heart thanks to the excellent role. Gilliam's flair for fantasy magical work with David and Janet Peoples writing to play with your head as much as it does with poor James Cole (Willis on his most Steve McQueen-like - better than McQueen, even!), A time Travel sentence of the future that literally does not know whether he is coming or going as a team of scientists, sends him back to the wrong times while trying to prevent a 1995 plague that is deadly to man, but harmless to animals. Willis, the just Oscar nominee Brad Pitt, and Madeline Stowe as a well-meaning psychiatrist give the best performances of their careers. Even Paul Buckmaster's tango-style score is haunting. This one is not a miss!
