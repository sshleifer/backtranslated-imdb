I have no idea what the other reviewer is talking about - it was a wonderful movie, and created a sense of the era that feels like time travel. The characters are really young, Mary is a strong game for Byron, Claire is youthful and a little annoying, Polidori is a convincing sex-sycophant ... everyone is beautiful, curious and decadent ... not the scary wreck that they are not Gothic. <br /> <br /> Gothic works as an independent piece of shock movie, and I loved it for various reasons, but it works like a Merchant and Ivory movie and was the best catch of my readings for the Summer to feel . Romance, yes, but repeat my interest in the life of Shelley and Byron every time I think of the movie. One of my all-time favorites.
