A LAUREL & HARDY Comedy Short. The boys come to the chimneys at home by Professor Noodle, a mad scientist who has just perfected his rejuvenation serum. Stan & Ollie continue with their FIREWORKS, spreading home and roof destruction. Then the professor wants to try his new drink ... <br /> <br /> A very funny little movie. The end is a bit sudden, but much of the slapstick that follows is great. Especially good is Stan & Ollie's game of wills at the opposite ends of the chimney. This is Lucien Littlefield's professor.
