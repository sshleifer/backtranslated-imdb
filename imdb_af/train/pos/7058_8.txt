Just after I saw the movie, the real magical feeling of the Walt Disney movies came to me, and I realized that it was a long time since I saw the "real" magic in a movie. <br /> <br /> Combining the right music, speeches and magic effects brings the Disney feeling back into your body. Many special things I saw where the unknown effects in the movie started with the disney logo that changed and ended in the Cinderella Castle as an old story telling fairy tales to your grandparents. <br /> <br /> The magic returned within me. I rate this movie 8 out of 10.
