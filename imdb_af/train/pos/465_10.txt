Marlene Gorris established herself as one of the world's great directors. This sensitive, visually stunning film is based on a story by Vladimir Nabokov and firmly captures the author's dark irony. John Turturro gives what I see as his best performance (I'm usually not a fan of his); and Emily Watson is also brilliant. Well worth seeing.
