As others have mentioned, all the women who are naked in this movie are usually absolutely beautiful. The plot clearly shows the hypocrisy of the female libido. When men are around, they want to be pursued, but if there are no men, they become the descendants of a 14-year-old boy. And the boy really becomes a man quickly (we should all be so happy!). He then gets the courage to pursue his true love.
