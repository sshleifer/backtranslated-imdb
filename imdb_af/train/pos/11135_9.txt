What makes Midnight Cowboy into a successful movie is the way Joe Buck joins Ratso Rizzo through a series of hardships that both affect them. There are really not many glimpses of hope in this movie for any character, but the hard realities they possess give the film its own kind of optimism that these men can at least find humanity within each other. <br /> <br /> This movie features Jon Voight's best performance and probably Dustin Hoffman's. The rest of the film is unknown, although it is rounded off by a fine series of character characters, including the cowpoke on the bus at the start of the movie. Also for those interested, Andy Warhol's pupil, Paul Morrissey, briefly shows at the party scene. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen this movie, it's essential. Look at that.
