The DVD for "Danaza Macabra" (Castle of Blood) is very strange. This is because parts of the film are in French with subtitles and the rest are dubbed in English from French. Sometimes characters moved between the two in the middle of a scene! When I tried to be the movie, just subtitled or just baptized, it didn't matter! Strange but still viewable. <br /> <br /> The story seems to be based on a Poe story, though I can't remember which one. In fact, the character of Poe appears in the beginning and end of the film - although it does not look like he does. <br /> <br /> A rich man makes a bet with a man on his luck that he can't stay home all night. It looks like it's easy to win - even if the house is very creepy. However, it can't be that easy, as the rich man says everyone who has previously bet has died - but this fool still wants to make the bet! While in the house, he encounters beautiful Barbara Steele and falls mad at her. Later, however, he learns that she died more than a decade earlier! How can this be? I could tell you more about the plot, but don't regret it. See it for yourself to find out the rest of the story. <br /> <br /> This movie gets very high marks for creating a creepy atmosphere. The house, black and white film and music work together to make a terrifying movie. Regarding the plot, it is interesting - especially because there are many turns - so much you just wonder who is and who is not among the dead at the end of the film. <br /> <br /> The only negative is that I felt sorry for the poor snake who was unnecessarily murdered. Crazy as it may sound, I felt sorry for it and it was hardly needed. <br /> <br /> Also, parents may want to know that there is some nudity at the end. A strikingly beautiful woman looks topless, but it's hardly needed for the plot.
