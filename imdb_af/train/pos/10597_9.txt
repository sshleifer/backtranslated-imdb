I recommend pictures that try something different. Many movies just look like a repetition of old ideas. That's why I highly recommend the Pimlico Passport. <br /> <br /> The movie is just after World War II and the post-war shortages and rationing seem to manage Londoners "barmy". The film is on a small neighborhood in London called Pimlico. They are also sick that they cannot buy what they want, but they cannot see any outcome. This is until they accidentally stumble upon a hidden treasure and a charter that officially called this neighborhood as a sovereign nation, hundreds of years ago! With this document, they argue, they can bypass all the rationing and coupons and live the way they want, as it seems they are NOT British subjects! Where the movie goes from there and how the crisis is finally resolved is something you have to see for yourself. Leave it on the brilliant thoughts of Ealing Studios to find this gem!
