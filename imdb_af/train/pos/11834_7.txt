I like horses and keep hand-drawn animation so I didn't expect anything from Dreamworks. New animated picture Spirit: Stalling from the Cimarron. I think you can say I was a little disappointed. You have wonderful animation and at first it looks like a perfect story. A story about absolutely nothing but a horse in nature. The animals do not sing or speak cute songs - a big plus. Unfortunately, the film has an inexplicable tale by Matt Damon; a juicy soundtrack by Bryan Adams; and enough action scenes to compare it to a Jerry Bruckheimer production. If the filmmakers stayed with simplicity, we would have a masterpiece here. It's not a good movie, but it's great fun for little kids. I would recommend this movie to families because it has its heart in the right place and it is the only thing out there that is not offensive to small children. Not bad, but could have been much better. Very nice visual though.
