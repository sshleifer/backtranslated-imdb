This movie has been on my wish list for ten years and I just found it on DVD when my mother's grandson gave it. He watched it and was excited to learn that it was about my gender - born in 1930 and evacuated in 1939 and he wanted to know more about it - and me. Luckily I borrowed it from him and looked at it on my own and I cried all through it. Not only did it capture the emotions, the class examination, the hardship and the warmth of human relationships of those years (as well as the atrocities (spoken and unspoken), but it was accurate! I'm also a bit of an anorak when It comes to ARP uniforms, ambulances (LCC) in the right color (white) and all the impediment of bomb-site management and the work of the Heavy Rescue Brigade, I couldn't do anything about my memories and the sandbagged Anderson The difference between the relatively pristine life in the town and the war-torn London was also sharply offered, and again I lived in 1939/40 and my own evacuation from London with this production! is natural and you will not expect him any more than these meticulous details, but it went far beyond the accurate representation of the facts and touched deep chords on human answers and was the only half-controlled one. rde judgments of those years. was certa Inly one of the big high spots in John Thaw's acting career and of Gold's direction and deserves to be better known. It's a great movie and I've ordered some copies to send to friends.
