Teresa Pavlinek was a popular member of the Toronto Second City cast. She did several visitors and advertisements here in Canada. Eventually someone has the sense to make her a show. The support case also looks pretty good. I have watched the pilot several times and I still find it refreshing. Although, I'm not sure why the show is listed as The Jane Show 2004. (I may be wrong) But as far as I know, the performance was conceptualized in 2005 and appeared on Global TV in Canada early in 2006. This is a fresh idea and hopefully it does well. Too bad can not be paired with Corner Gas. Now I know Corner gas is on CTV, but the two shows will be good companions.
