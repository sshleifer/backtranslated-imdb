I thoroughly enjoyed the first part of these two parties, The Impossible Planet, and was a little worried that the second part was not as good as in the past of the two parties of the past 2 People series. But grateful, my fears were unfounded because I enjoyed myself as much as the previous episode. Anyway, we start with the surviving crew on the way of the Ood, who has become the devil's pawn. There is also a little philosophy about the doctor's part in the episode I really enjoyed. Needless to say it was a good solid Doctor Who story. Perhaps it's a little too intense for the younger viewers. <br /> <br /> My Grade: B +
