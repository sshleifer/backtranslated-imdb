I just watched the 139-minute (widescreen) version with some friends and we were blown away. I won't bother repeating what others have said. What the filmmakers do with the concept is unexpected and fun. The big battle is exhausting. Then we were amazed to find that there were almost 30 minutes left to go, but we didn't like getting involved and entertaining. <br /> <br /> There is one thing that has almost ruined it and it was the horrible music / songs. Blues, Country / Folk and Rock Ballads do not belong here and every time they are used we all broke out. It's scary. You've been warned, but the story and storytelling keeps you grounded. <br /> <br /> There are several excellent moments to appreciate the talent behind the camera. There are many uses of silence as well as slow motion photography that work beautifully. I really wish I could delete the music, but unfortunately. <br /> <br /> Find it out. It's fun, it's different and it takes you to places you wouldn't expect and it's very refreshing.
