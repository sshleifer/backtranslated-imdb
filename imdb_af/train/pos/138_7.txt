I do not understand why the other comments on McConaughey's focus. He has never been a very interesting film actor. <br /> <br /> The best part of this movie is the writing and the white. Alfred Molina and Patrick McGaw make an unusual comic duo, certainly not stocks. Although one cannot say that their characters are well developed, they do not make them less funny. <br /> <br /> The version I saw was on HDNET and had subtitles for the Spanish dialogue, so it was definitely not a problem. The use of Spanish gives it more authenticity. <br /> <br /> A very underrated movie, determined by the unusual low score IMDb members, gave it. I thought it was fun and interesting and worth at least a 7. Very faint movies with higher scores and big money at the box office are much less interesting.
