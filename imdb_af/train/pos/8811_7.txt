Eleven different filmmakers from different parts of the world are compiled in this film to present their views and ideas about the WTC attack. This is one of the best efforts you will see in any movie. Movies like these are rarely made and appreciated. This film tries to touch every possible core of WTC. Here are some of the most important stories from the movie that make this movie so unique. <br /> <br /> There is the story of Samira Makhmalbaf (Iran) where somewhere in Iran people are preparing for US attacks. There, a teacher tries to educate her students by informing them of innocent people being murdered in WTC massacre. Then comes a story of Youssef Chahine (Egypt) where a filmmaker talks face to face with a dead soldier in the WTC attack and a Dead Hard Core Terrorist involved in the WTC attack. Then we see a story of Idrissa Ouedraogo (Burkina Faso) where a group of five innocent children see and plan to kidnap Osama Bin Laden and win the money from America. Then we see the story of Alejandro Gozalez Inarritu (Mexico) where you see a black screen and slowly see the real footage of WTC buildings coming down. And the people stuck in the building jump out of there to save their lives. The other most important story is from Mira Nair (India) where a mother struggles to respect her Dead Boy whose name is falsely trapped in the WTC massacre! After September 11, our heartbeat starts to start pumping automatically if we hear two names all over the world. First is the World Trade Center and the second is Osama! This film completely changes our perception and makes a strong point by demanding something more about it. <br /> <br /> I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who would like such types of Home DVD Collection. Definitely worth every penny you spend. But please do not expect anything other than Movies in this DVD. Of course, there are movie cartoons of the filmmakers, but no extra features.
