Let's go straight to the point: this is the movie I would like to take with me on a desert island (with DVD player). It's just perfect. If a reason for you is to watch a movie, you love the actors, you want to see that they are free to engage in space and feelings, this movie is for you. See the scene when Myrtle (Rowlands) gets drunk on stage and Maurice (Cassavetes) has to improvise because she doesn't follow the script anymore. If you are sensitive to camera movements, you will be fascinated by the way the camera moves on stage, the particular flow that follows the camera, as the actors are guided by the theatrical principle of private space ". And the story is just a brilliant mix of story and realistic drama, Cassavetes again arguing with Hollywood and the majors' politics, but this time he does it through Broadway, making one of the most exciting movies about theater. , this movie is a lucky one.
