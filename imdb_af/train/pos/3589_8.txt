I enjoyed this movie, and after watching it, made me wonder how much Caitlin Rose's existed in the world. How many other girls are subjected to this type of sexual abuse and pain by classmates and were too scared to open their mouths to it? How threatening and cruel can teenagers be to each other, because as this film shows, whose right is not important, it is what is popular and fearful that manipulates the minds of the youth and influences them to make such disobedience happen. Tiffani Amber Thiessen gives a powerful performance as the rape victim and Brian Austin Green is convincing because the man between the girl he thought he loved and his best friend. This is the kind of film that does not affect the exposure. earned. Noticeably, and brilliantly, too good to be just a movie for TV.
