I am a member of a canoe club and I can tell you the truth that liberation is synonymous with the peace and tranquility of the experience. As we put our boats in the water, the banjo echoes in the back of consciousness. This movie is timeless because it becomes philosophical of man's place in nature and technology's effect on man's relationship with nature. We see it in the fishing. We see it in the homemade tent. There is also urban man's contempt and sense of superiority towards the rural woodman "cracker". The fact that Atlanta's banker (Ned Beatty) has "bad teeth" is meant to put him on the same level with the foresters who also have bad teeth. Eventually, the struggle of life and death replaces "civilized man's" substances over "The Law". This canoeing ends too soon for the viewer, but unfortunately not enough for the characters.
