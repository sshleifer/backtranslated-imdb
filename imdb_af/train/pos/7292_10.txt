I just saw it this past Friday at the Los Angeles movie festival at Laemlee's on Beverly. This movie had the most applause of all the movies that night. Since two music videos were first opened, I didn't know what to expect, as they were quick and alert, I wasn't sure I was ready right away. But to my surprise, I really enjoyed it. I thought the chief actor demon man was really good. I was so impressed with his performance that I checked his name. I was surprised to see that it was the Witchblade man. He has since got very good! Either one or he gave nice roles or printed by the director, very difficult for this brief. The girl did a good job. I think it's difficult because it was her first show and was so young. The father also did well. There was a lot of good work for a short one, both for this and the short following "Mexican Hat" which was also nice, but I enjoyed it the most because it had the most depth and emotion and I really did caring for the characters. The other was a very simple story. The story was very illustrative and dark! It covered real topics with a more imaginative approach to keeping ADD people like me interested. We won't even talk about the last movie in the block I left. My only complaint is that I just wish I saw more of the devil's character and started a little less, so I gave it 9 out of 10. I also thought the final credits went a bit slow. Otherwise, it is beautifully told, directed and edited. The timing was very enjoyable with a complete change of the instantaneous MTV editing currently being done. There will be more of this director in the future as well as the actor. I will now think of him as the Sorrows Lost actor, not the Witchblade man.
