I only saw this movie on TV once and it was not repeated. This is weird if you consider the over and over repetitive waste. Horror movies are usually a source of entertainment for me, but this one really scared me. <br /> <br /> DO NOT READ THE FOLLOWING BIT IF YOU DON'T SEE THE MOVIE <br /> <br /> The scariest bit is when the townspeople pursue the preacher where his wife is almost dead (they poisoned her ). He asks who the hell are you anyway. One by one they give their true identities. The girl who pretends to be deaf to seduce and deceive him says, "I'm Lilith, the witch Adam loved before Eve."
