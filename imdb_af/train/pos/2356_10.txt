Pushing Daisies was a wonderful show. Much like Dead Like Me and Wonderfalls, you can tell was created by Bryan Fuller. I can understand how people who do not have much love for theater, theater, music and the like are annoyed. It's not a typical television program and the fantastic is too much for some. These people seem to need a little more linear and muted tone to keep them happy. This program explodes with color, winks at old movie scenes, hums with incredible music and talented performances. There is nothing arbitrary about the choices made from costume to search motive. The story takes a lot of turns and turns, but everyone is very accessible because the conversations are about love, honesty, courage, loss and so many other things that we face every day. The only unfortunate aspect was the end of the show and it was rushed because Pushing Daisies was canceled. Don't approach it as a typical TV show. Think of it as an evening at the theater, then sit back and enjoy!
