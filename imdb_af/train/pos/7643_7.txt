Spoiler !!! This movie is based on the concept What if? Of course Mr. Destiny can answer this question. The main character goes through a bad day, like many of us, and asks this question. Chaos Theory says a butterfly in China can have an effect on someone here from a chain reaction. The focus of this movie is based on one event during a baseball game. This event sets your Destiny in motion; Just like Ashton in "The Butterfly Effect" except Mr. Destiny uses comedy about drama. The results make a fresh, somewhat original movie. As one's philosophical resemblance to "The Butterfly Effect," one would probably be Mr. Destiny enjoys. I give it a 7 out of 10. Wonderful because I saw the first half of this movie 3 times, and finally watched the end on TBS.
