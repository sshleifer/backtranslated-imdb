First, think this movie is almost fifty years old! Yet it still stands as one of the great films of all time. I wonder how many of today's discarded celluloid productions will still be spoken in 2050? <br /> <br /> The story is simple but solid enough and the effects are nothing short of phenomenal for the day. I can remember for the first time what I saw as a child when the monster penetrates the power field that protects the ship and you have seen the review for the first (and only) time. If I fear, I can tell you. It looks dated today, but still more than effective enough. <br /> <br /> The scenes with the tiger now show their age. You can see the perimeter where the tiger in the shots with Altaira is temperate, but it is only visible. <br /> <br /> The effect of the creatures melting through the Krell doors is wonderful. br /> <br /> It's also great to see Leslie Nielsen (better remember for the airplane and nude films) as a young but still mature man. He was 30 when this movie came out! Almost 80 now! <br /> <br /> All in all, a good movie that will surely be a favorite for the coming year. Timeless.
