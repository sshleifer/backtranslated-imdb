Good action show but nothing new. This one was high in the mountains, which showed some beautiful scenery and such. One man takes a group of mercenaries, the head flies and he kicks. It could be called "Rambo goes to the Rockies", it was that pat. It had a very effective scene, right on the first of the movie that curled me into horror. Not a bad picture, but the same ol ', the same ol'.
