After completing Cronicles of the Heroic Knight just a few minutes ago, I am very welcome, but questions are still about me. While it appears that the first 7 episodes are actually a repetition of the first record of Lodoss's war, the truth is that it really is not. The creator of CotHK seems to have had a different vision of how the original ended (and this may be the case for the first 7 episodes), but I don't think so. CotHK says it starts 5 years after the War of Heros, where Parn was part. I think the director has the first 5 episodes so like a repetition of the original just to give the viewer a small reminder and an introduction to characters and their deeds, because they look much less after the series in Spark's story kicked. Now, as soon as the series kicks into Spark's part, we find ourselves kicking up for 10 years (15 years since the War of Heros). Spark and his crew look, in some cases, like Parn and his crew, as soon as the journey kicks in the gear, especially the love story between Spark and Neese. I've also thought several times by CotHK that I had thrown the original series and if it wasn't for Spark's long blue hair, I knew I'd been pushing more than once to make sure the right disk was in. However, consider these great setbacks, the writers have done a good job in making credible characters and a remarkable story. The only thing that hurts me is that Ashram and Wagnard return. Ummmm ... how ??? Don't get me wrong, both are great villains, though Ashram's only shameful feature is that he supports the Marmo. Maybe I missed something during the rough series that explained that part. As for the successors, I recommend CotHK. I place both CotHK and, even more, the original Record of Lodoss War far above the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Both of these are more epic than I've ever seen or read. I highly recommend it.
