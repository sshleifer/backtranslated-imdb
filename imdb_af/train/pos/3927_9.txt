OK, first fix the tag placed on the main page of this movie. Abe Lincoln did not walk with his sister in the movie, nor did he stop at his sister's grave. The person in question is Ann Rutledge, who was a very good friend in his New Salem days. Some say Ann was actually Lincoln's girlfriend, but there is no evidence to support it. <br /> <br /> Now there are manufacturing and fictionalizations in this movie. Hollywood has always taken dramatic license with anything under the sun, and "Young Mr. Lincoln" is no exception. However, the film court case is based on a real event: the charge of murder of William Duff Armstrong, and although it is largely fictionalized with many name changes, it will still be viewers. the screen. This is Hollywood's Golden Age, with drama at its best, and Henry Fonda may be the best Lincoln played by anyone.
