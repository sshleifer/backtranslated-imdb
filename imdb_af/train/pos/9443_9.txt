It is a pity that liberation is mainly known as the red-headed election film and for Dueling Banjos. Even people who have seen the movie cannot get their minds off the rape scene. It's not as bad as the rape scene in Pulp Fiction. It's certainly not as bad as any female rape scene in just about any movie. People tend to miss the power of the movie containing the infamous buggery scene. <br /> <br /> The acting, plot, cinematography and soundtrack of Salvation all lend a hand to his breeding charisma. The background in which it was shot is beautiful and is totally in contrast to the dark subject. The actors, both great and underage, make you feel like you are rafting straight along the river. <br /> <br /> The thing that separates this movie from others is the tangible sense of fear that inspires it. Not many movies can make you feel creepy. Bottom Line: This movie is a classic. I can't say much more than that.
