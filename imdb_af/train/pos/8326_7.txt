While Fred Schepisi's "I.Q." doesn't have really important features, it's still worth seeing. Walter Matthau plays Albert Einstein, who is trying to help mechanic Ed Walters (Tim Robbins) fall in love with Princeton maths doctoral candidate Catherine Boyd (Meg Ryan). Probably the funniest scene is when dr. Frizzyhead and friends (Lou Jacobi, Gene Saks and Joseph Maher) try to make Ed look like a scientist: he ends up as a French impressionist. <br /> <br /> Of course, little of The movie is historically accurate, but that's not the point. It's not meant to be anything but a light comedy, quite the opposite of Robbins' best-known 1994 movie (The Shawshank Redemption). A movie about Einstein's entire life should not only focus on his scientific achievements, but also his political activism, namely how he wrote a letter on behalf of the Scottsboro Nine and came out against nuclear weapons (which came to the point where FBI kept a file on him). <br /> <br /> Anyway, this one is acceptable. Also with Stephen Fry, Tony Shalhoub, Frank Whaley, Charles Durning and Keene Curtis.
