Every time I watch this movie, I am more impressed with the whole production. I came to the conclusion that this is the best romantic comedy ever made. Everyone involved is perfect; writing, acting, direction, editing and editing. While James Stewart can always rely on a good performance, and the supporting film is great, Margaret Sullavan reveals what an underestimate actress she was. Her tragic personal life gives her qualities as an artist where comedy acting skills are not easy to reach. Lubitsch managed to get the best and of course he played his best. Look at the number of scenes taken at one time - breathtakingly done.
