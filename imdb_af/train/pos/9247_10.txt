I expected this movie to be the romance of 1930. Boy meets girl, they fall in love, boy loses girl, boy wins her back in the end. It wasn't like that. Clark Gable plays concert artist Eddie with all his usual charisma and awkward eyebrow enhancement. He stepped away from the police when he burst into Ruby's (Jean Harlow) apartment, to find her in bubbles in the bath, no less. Instant chemistry.She plays hard to get out for a while, but a girl can only resist that grin for so long. The heat between them is clear, and there are some scenes that are definitely pre-production code! When an extortionist case goes bad and Ruby ends up in a hostel for "upset girls", she is miserable and thanks to the filth that her roommate gives, she starts believing Eddie will never come to her. Harlow plays perfectly the stubborn, quick talk. She never lets Gable get all the good lines! There is a particularly moving scene with her playing "their song" on the perfect keyboard. The last fifteen minutes I cried every time. A true sweet romance.
