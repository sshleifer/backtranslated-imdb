When you come across a jewel of such a movie, you realize why the 80's was the biggest decade to live through. The rock music ruled, and so did movies ... especially horror movies. Filmmakers knew how to entertain us, and "Trick or Treat" is clear for that. When Sammer Curr, who most likely went to W.A.S.P. singer Blackie Lawless, dying in a hotel fire, his # 1 fan Eddie, is confused. He goes to friend and local DJ Nuke (Gene Simmons) for support. Nuke gives him a copy of the last recording Sammi made; This is the only copy available. It was given to the radio station to play live Halloween night. When Eddie plays it, it brings Sammi up. He helps Eddie with the bulls at school, but then goes out of control. This is definitely a fantastic movie. The bad thing is, this movie is out of print. I paid $ 25.00 to finally get it off eBay. You must also ... spend $$ well!
