For a first film in a proposed series, it achieves the right balance. This is done with style and class showing Modesty's early days as a refugee and the beginning of her rise to power in the criminal world. I think it is a very honest / true portrayal of her character exactly as the author, Peter O'Donnell, meant. Alexandra Staden as Modesty is beautifully beautiful and an excellent choice. She acts very convincingly as the difficult survivor with an outward cool / intelligent / innocent. And full points for Tarantino for choosing an unknown actress for the role - much more credible to create a new face that creates the part. I'm looking forward to the next movie.
