"Ah Ritchie made another gangster movie with Statham," the average fan thought, expecting another Snatch / Lock Stock; might expect some temporary shifts, but not too difficult for "me and the boys" to swallow some beer. <br /> <br /> Note, you should see this movie. No cups of tea, no extra diet coke from the counter, no "keep it going" scream as you sip to the fridge - watch the movie! No other laughs than those you can make of the considerable violence (and if it drives your boat, it is so), but sharp solid direction, excellent dialogue and good performances. <br /> <br /> My favorite - Big Pussy From the Sopranos, always a reliable hood.
