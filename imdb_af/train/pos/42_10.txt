Busy Phillips sits in one hell of a performance, both comic and dramatic. Erika Christensen was good, but Busy stole the show. It was a fun touch to The Smokers, a movie starring Busy, which wasn't so good. If Busy doesn't get a nomination of any kind for this movie, it will be a disaster. Forget Mona Lisa Smile, see Home Room.
