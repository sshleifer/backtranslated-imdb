I swear, the zombie was killed twice and came back. I gave this movie an 8. Let's look at people, that's exactly what the other reviewers say, that is, a handy camera, shooting movie. Hey, hey, hey, welcome to make the whole indie movie. The fact that Todd Sheets has more than 700 zombies to appear in this movie is a tribute to his talents. Yes, the story has gaps, yes, we see the same zombies over and over, but who really cares? Take it for what it is, a fun and horrible horror movie, one to share with your buds, or to eradicate the people you really care about LOL. Mellow-out people, I suppose you all chose the garbage like "Titanic" or "Twister". Peace, and support independent movies!
