An excellent movie. Wonderfully performed by Mary Alice, Phillip M. Thomas, and a young Irene Cara. Tony King was very realistic in his role of satin. This movie was one of the last predominantly "all black" movies of the 70's and unlike the "blaxploitation" movies of that era, this movie actually had a plot and it was done very well. The movie soundtrack, sung by Aretha Franklin, was popular on the R&B cards at the time.
