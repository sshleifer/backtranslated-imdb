I enjoyed this show for two reasons 1. Richard Dean Anderson 2. Amanda Tapping. These two artists performed the show with the necessary support from the regular and repetitive actors. The replacement of RDA in the 9-10 seasons was enough to take the heart out of the show. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between all the main characters is just amazing. You get the feeling that the actors like to move around after the camera stops rolling. This relationship contributes to the program we see. <br /> <br /> RDA gives its 'O'Neill' character credible personality. He never knows when to rest the wise in him. You see how others in some of his statements leave their eyes down. Yet they know he's the man to have around when the situation is dangerous. <br /> <br /> There is much between 'Carter' and 'O'Neill' below the surface. They can keep the lid, but often just scarce. The episode 'Solitudes' in season 1 has the best drama ever seen on television. The love between the two had the prospect of dying because they faced it. <br /> <br /> "Carter" and "Jackson" often have to be smoothed over by the turmoil created by O'Neill. Yet O'Neill's tactical instincts always look good. He understands what to do without thinking about the matter. The team has been put at risk several times by not listening to the others. <br /> <br /> The quality dropped considerably during seasons 9 and 10. The original story arch was mostly used up and the new villains were never really caught my interest. Ben Browder was far below the RDA in performing the show. He had his rare moments with Claudia Black, but it was all. Amanda Tapping called these two seasons into her performances. You can see her very changing appearance after having a baby. She probably thinks more about the child than the show. <br /> <br /> The spin-off "Stargate Atlantis" has a few moments, but is usually a weaker attempt. The main characters are missing the creation of the original. The villains (Wraiths) are so unlikely to be ridiculous. Perhaps Amanda Tapping could breathe a little into the program, or it won't last for the fourth season. <br /> <br /> There has always been a problem for me in the special effects for the show. Forming spacecrafts that are formed as pyramids is a design monstrosity that is rarely in Sci-Fi. The use of torches for lighting in these ships is just as bad. The campus use of antique Egyptian decor, which conceals ultra-modern technology, is just as difficult to accept. <br /> <br /> I also wondered about some of the show's continuity. In the season 2 opener, 'Daniel Jackson' shot up and his uniform had a gaping hole where he was wounded. He crawls into a sarcophagus and it heals his body and restores his uniform as it only cost the shelf in the cupboard. The episode "Hathor" has a sarcophagus in the hands of the SGC, but it is never mentioned again. This device could be used in several later episodes on 'Daniel', 'O'Neill' and 'Dr. Frasier.
