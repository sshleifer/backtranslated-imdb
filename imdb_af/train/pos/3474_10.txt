This movie is worth seeing alone for Jared Harris' outstanding John Lennon painting. It doesn't matter that Harris doesn't look exactly like Lennon; His ways, expressions, attitude, accent and attitude are pure Lennon. Best Scene: Lennon in a local cafe verbal sparring with a stuttering fan or Paul McCartney & Wings's "Silly Love Songs" is worth the # 1 status in America.
