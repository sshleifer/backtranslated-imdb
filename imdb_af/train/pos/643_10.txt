Since my third or fourth show some time ago, I remembered La Maman et la putain while waiting for the DVD. Meanwhile, I read the French script, as well as Alain Philippon's monograph on Jean Eustache. The latter ends with a frustrating filmography, eleven films, fiction, doc and between, impossible to see, or, in the case of Mes petites amoureuses and Le Père Noël ..., to see again. <br /> <br /> A few questions that struck me this moment: The Polish Véronika's French is very common (un maximum d '"un maximum d'"). But still she has an accent? I think I can say she does. What is the absence of color, especially on the single spot, is the edge of the city shone? How does this fringe of sleep and travel differ from parts of The Tempest and The Winter's Tales? Ditto Alphaville. We can think that the years have passed since it was done, but is Eustache deliberately defined in the film's environment? Is this an enchanting island? Is Alexandre a fairy tale? Alexandre is always choreographing himself, worried about how or where to stand or walk, what to say when, announcing these decisions to care less than he does what he does. Or is it his way of choreographing others by doing it for himself? How else is he from Vertigo's Scottie? (I think a lot.) What is the difference between Eustache's Leaud and Truffaut, and Godard? How else is the current Léaud? Is he still going to do that, in recent roles, Irma Vep, Le Pornographe, who has reached the age? As soon as I arrived in a series of mostly Antoine Doinel (Léaud's character) for Truffaut movies early on. For a long time, every three or five minutes, in the path comes a twenty-something shawl, two-coat, Léaud hair, with a direction-seeking nose. I have no idea if it was conscious or unconscious mime. I was that age, but I have no idea how I look like that myself. No scarf, at least. I did have a brother who learned his transport from Bresson.
