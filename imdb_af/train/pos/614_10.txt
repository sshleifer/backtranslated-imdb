What a wonderful, fanciful movie is Stardust. <br /> <br /> I could easily end it with one statement and enough to say, one can use it as a very strong recommendation to see it. <Br /> <br /> At a time when Hollywood seems to be forcing remakes and keeping our throat off, let's remember why we're going to the movies in the first place. To escape the reality for a few hours and explore other lives, other times, or other planets. Ironically, "Stardust" takes us effortlessly to all three places and with a childlike pleasure we all desire. <br /> <br /> "Stardust" is full of all the characters we remember as children: princess, witches, pirates, ghosts and crooks. It has the girl in distress, the hero, the villains, the obstacles, the game, the antioxidants, the charm, and even the light speed to make it quasi-modern. <br /> <br /> "Stardust" is about a man from the town of Wall, conveniently located next to a wall separating their town from a magical kingdom. The only road along the wall is through a breech that is kept vigorously by a naughty old codger (played wonderfully by David Kelly). One day, a young man from the wall called Ben Barnes waited for the guy and escaped through the broad. He happens at a magical kingdom called Stormhold where he meets a dressed (and very sexy) young woman named Una. She is imprisoned by a witch and handcuffed by an unbreakable chain. While the witch is gone, Una Ben seduces and sends him on his way. Ben returns to Wall without incident and continues his life. But nine months later, he was called to the wall porch where the guy was waiting to handle what you could expect - a baby boy. <br /> <br /> The boy, named Tristan, grows into a rather fearless young man (Charlie Cox) who is beaten by a girl from his league and also engaged to another. Nevertheless, the young woman (named Victoria and played Sienna Miller) once went out with Tristain and confessed his love for her. After seeing a staggering star, she told him he could get her when he took the star and brought it back to her. He agrees and sticks to his quest, which will take him to the other side of the wall. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, in the kingdom of Stormhold, the old king dies (played perfectly by Peter O'Toole). He calls his remaining living sons to tell them who will succeed him on the throne. His sons' names are Primus, Secondus, Sextmus and Septimus. The other boys where the other brothers murdered in a humorous competition to see who lives to get the throne. <br /> <br /> Anyway, he throws his ruby ​​charm to the air and Voila, bringing the star to earth. <br /> <br /> The star collapses in the shape of a beautiful woman named Yvaine (Clare Danes) and of course she wears charm. But few know she is now convinced by Tristain, the Princes, and also an aging witch, called Lamia (Michelle Pfeiffer), who wants to exterminate the star heart to regain her own youth. <br /> <br /> Complex? Yes. But all this comes together as the adventure unfolds. <br /> <br /> Tristain is the first to find Yvaine, but is so blinded by his commitment to Victoria, he doesn't recognize the growing bond between him and Yvaine. His initial interest lies only in the return of Yvaine to Victoria as proof of his love. But he must first pass the rulers and Lamia. The princess is not such a problem, because they are constantly trying to kill each other - and just as in "Pirates of the Caribbean" - death has never been so funny. <br /> <br /> But Tristain also meets the witch his mother has addicted (although he doesn't know it's his mother) and a group of flying pirates led by Robert DeNiro. <br /> <br /> She is The main character in the movie and DeNiro plays it for a tea. He steals the film with his toughness and soon we learn a secret secret that lets audiences leave laughter on the floor. Although his role is small, DeNiro is exceptional! <br /> <br /> Michelle Pfeiffer is great as Lamia - a sexy evil witch. Claire Danes is most suitable as the confused and sad Yvaine. She makes a perfect girl. Jason Flemyng, Adam Buston, Rupert Everett and Mark Strong add the perfect dose of life as the fighting princes who, as they die, come back as ghost, 'Blithe Spirit' and 'High Spirits'. <br /> <br /> Director Matthew Vaughn, whose only other direct experience was "Layer Cake," weaves an enchanting story that everyone will enjoy. <br /> <br /> "Stardust" can be too small for young children, but anyone over 13 will want to watch this movie several times. It's so good. "Stardust" is what movies are supposed to be. Perfectly written, perfectly thrown, perfectly targeted and perfectly handled. In other words ... perfect.
