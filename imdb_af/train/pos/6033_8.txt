I just want to say that it may be biased as I am a producer on the film. However, I will retain some dignity. <br /> <br /> The star of the film, Oscar Ovies, starred as Jeff Grinderlin, a nebbic hypochondriac who spends more time than living. He brings a certain touch to his character who indeed links the audience with him, often saying in his mind and with a sense of loud comedy. His mother, played by Christine Haber, is the constant support bundle, which without crumbling on itself. His friends also lend a hand to Jeff's life, often making choices for him, rather than using his free will ... which he often neglects, anyway. <br /> <br /> The writing is great, and the talks flow like scenes from a Kevin Smith movie, with half as many Ben Affleck boo-hoo festivals. <br /> <br /> The camera work is a bit scarce on some points, and the sound can also use a boost, but the performances give the little details. It is also backed by a beautiful soundtrack with local talents and an exceptional composer. <br /> <br /> All in all, it was a surprise. A rare ginger, among many gems.
