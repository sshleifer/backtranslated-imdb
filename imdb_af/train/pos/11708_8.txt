The reason people say this movie scares them is because they did! This means that the movie's purpose was felt by some who saw it. When I first saw this movie, it scared me and made me think about life and religion. It's not a blood-and-frightening type of movie, but the kind you think might be doing things like the movie was written. Of course, believers won't say it's just a scientific film. The truth is, this movie is a must for your thriller collection, even if it has a religious view. If you're a fan of classic thrillers (Omen .. etc), it's one of them and it's a must. I have never seen the successor (Distant Thunder), but I believe it counts where this movie ends.
