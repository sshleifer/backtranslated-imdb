Dick Tracy was not the best for many comic fans because they wanted something like blood like Batman. Dick Tracy plays the innocence of being just a cartoon with villains who have serious appearance disorder and fun. Warren Beatty directs and stars as the main character fighting crime without even using superpowers. I love Dick Tracy as I was a child because of the comic atmosphere of the main colors: red, blue, orange, yellow, green and black. It's the perfect movie for anyone to watch with their children. Al Pacino is like Jack Nicholson in Batman and plays Big Boy Caprice with six. Madonna as the babe who is the second villain in this movie doesn't play the same boy's toys she represents. As I said, no blood, obsessions, sexual insinuation, or anything to offend anyone.
