In rare cases, a film comes together that has the power to expand the mind, warm the heart and touch the soul. "LOU" is such a movie. I got "LOU" from my wife who got it from a neighbor who is in the movie business. She looked at me a second time. We were both enthralled. Her as if for the first time again. <br /> <br /> "LOU" is a magical piece designed to send you back to the moment all your plays begin to happen. It does so while it is relentlessly entertaining. Bret Carr's play and pacing as a director doesn't leave you looking away. He crafted a character that disarmed with a bugs bunny like, stuttering innocence, but behaved warmly with such an underplayed sincerity that you forget you were watching a movie. If the epiphany hit the brilliant climax, I saw my wife in tears for the second time. <br /> <br /> As a life coach, I facilitate individual growth and transformation, and this film is a "must see" for life coaches and anyone looking for their own personal growth and transformation. It's a brilliant, creative masterpiece with the power to change lives!
