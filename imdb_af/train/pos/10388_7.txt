I'm a big fan of the Dukes of Hazzard TV show. And I really enjoyed this movie. I enjoyed it much more than I did with other summer bikers. <br /> <br /> It's funny to hear people against this movie with excuses such as "lame plot" and "it's much sharper than the show." Does anyone remember the cruelty of humor in the pilot section? Daisy jokes and Bo says Luke probably took half the children in the orphanage. The only reason it was cleaned is because it changed to and earlier time slot. <br /> <br /> And as far as the plot goes. It was the perfect Dukes plot. In fact, as a remake, it probably remains the source material worthy of any TV program that migrated to the big screen. <br /> <br /> While Sean William Scott and Johnny Knoxville are not really their little screen versions, they do a good job and work very well together. However, I wasn't too keen on Burt's Boss Hogg. And I would like to have a little more disqualification from Sheriff Roscoe. In the movie Roscoe is a bit ... scary. <br /> <br /> And who didn't have a smile on their face, while General Lee ran through the streets of Atlanta and Hazzard's back roads? br /> People, allow yourself to enjoy a movie that is just an excuse for nostalgia, bikini and car hunt, you won't be sorry. It's just a big silly movie!
