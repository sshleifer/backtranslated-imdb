Seriously, can you imagine so much talent in one movie without a big budget: Daniel Day-Lewis, Ray McAnally, Brenda Fricker, Hugh O'Conor AND Fiona Shaw? There is no doubt that Fricker and Day-Lewis earned their awards, but it would have been quite justified to award O'Conor (such as Young Christie) and McAnally. The clich√© is true: they don't play the roles they occupy. Day-Lewis's performance is a tour of the power - such a transformation that it is awesome, but it was truly a sign of the Academy's intelligence that, along with this performance, Brenda Fricker's beautifully handicapped, quiet and honored heartbreaking work. like Christie's mother. By the way, if you didn't see this wonderful actress in "Swann", it's another movie worth watching for her contribution (and the sublime Miranda Richardson).
