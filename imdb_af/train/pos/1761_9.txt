Just once we get an R-rated comedy that gets everyone's time and attention. This is a rare case when critics will enjoy it. I just came back from The 40 Year Old Virgin and I can honestly say it was one of the biggest laughs of my life. I showed up at 10:35 and each row was full. Not only that, everyone laughed their ass all the time. It's two hours without laughing. I dare to see this movie and not laugh. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple. A man is forty years old and he is a virgin. Yet, behind this simple, five-second joke, we get a deep, complex story that is not just one of the funniest things you'll ever see, but includes real lessons. Steve Carell stars as Andy Stitzer, The 40-year-old Virgin. We knew Steve Carell, as I think is one of the best plays of all time. Steve Carell had a spectacular play by Bruce Almighty and especially Anchorman, and ultimately he is proud of his moment to shine as the star. No one will forget his name once they see this pervasively funny, gut-busting, in-the-hilarious comedy. <br /> <br /> The beauty of the movie is that it's not 100% stupid. The brilliant writing of Judd Apatow and Steve Carell has a real purpose and it is not just one hell of a story to tell. Behind the crudeness and vulgar non-stop ride of the film comes an important lesson to be learned. Although not presented in the best way, the film gives us more than just a pleasant time. The gut-busting attitude will keep you going all the time while we see the real life struggle of people like Andy and his co-workers. The end could not have been better. Not only does it deliver what we are promised, but it gives one of the most memorable rounds that a comedy has ever seen. It would have been perfect if Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson came there, but you can't win it. Now you can. <br /> <br /> Finally, I think like Roger Ebert put it, Catherine Keener gives an inexplicably perfect show like Trish, one woman Andy really has his heart. Not only does she not give us, but it is crazy to see how bright she is burning the story. She was in the role, and she and Carell had great, hilarious chemistry on the screen. <br /> <br /> Canadian ratings once again show off Ontario with a 14A, while British Columbia, Alberta and Manitoba all hit the 40-year-old Virgin with an 18A. The same goes for Four Brothers, in my opinion, the second best movie of the year, and I can honestly say I love more and more of Ontario. For all who are your co-teens out there in the United States: Congratulations! <br /> <br /> Overall, Steve Carell gives one of the funniest shows I've ever seen and just about everyone in the speaker speaks to the non-stop laugh. Everyone will love this 40-year-old stomach this summer and I encourage everyone to see it as quickly as humanly possible. This is the best comedy of the year, hands off. It's all over the longest yard, the wedding crashers, and of course Apatow and Carell's last memorable comedy, Anchorman. <br /> <br /> It's a comic masterpiece and deserves the remarkable amount of praise from critics who already love it. Every one of my favorite critics loved it and it immediately earned a place on the IMDb Top 250. Steve Carell is a great star. Now look one of the brightest of summer. <br /> <br /> My rating: 9/10 <br /> Objective ?? 9/10 <br /> Subjective ?? 10/10 <br /> <br /> Eliason A.
