Dick Tracy is one of my favorite movies. I must admit to those who have not seen it. You will really love it or hate it. It came out a year after Batman's success. So everyone's expectations were so high that much lower just because the plot is so simple. But it's based on a cartoon ... what did you expect? Creative, this movie is great! The sets, makeup, music, costumes and the impressive play make this movie wonderful. The film has bloodless violence and no bad language - it is rarely rare. Targeted, produced, and star Warren Beatty as the bait crime fighter goes against Al Pacino's evil Big Boy Caprice and his crowd of thugs. Madonna steals the show as the seductive Breathless Mahoney. This is one of the best characters Madonna ever played. She has the best one liners I've heard! Madonna fans will love it! One of the coolest things about the movie is that they only used seven colors to make it look like a comic book. This film is really a piece of artwork that is unfortunately overlooked by the public. To sum it up, this movie brings out the child in us all. It's a movie that will make you smile at the end.
