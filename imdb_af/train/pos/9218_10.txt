First, let me say I wanted to see this movie for about a year now because I knew Angelina Jolie was in it and I love her. But my love for her has nothing to do with my opinion of the movie. Anyway, no video stores carry it low and see the local library. I watched it and loved it absolutely. Yes, there were Italian stereotypes, but it was good and funny. It was in no way humiliating. <br /> <br /> Every actor and actress did an excellent job. I laughed very hard at the sexual humor. Overall, I think this movie is worth seeing if you can find it. It's beautiful and just fun to watch. I rarely give movies like a 10, but I give this one a 10 !!! <br /> <br /> Find it and watch it!
