This movie can be interpreted at many different levels. Don't listen to the other comment that beats the movie and says it's a new story or game and it's just about drugs. It has many open superficial metaphors on drugs; But the rest of the movie (and why I think it's made personal) is not about it at all. It is really mocking psychology and the conditioning of society. It shows for a second time that the main character's brother is watching those sick videos online. Why? My interpretation is that it is to demonstrate that all this gruesome phenomena we are exposed to makes it easier for us to be mechanical in our occupations rather than seeing people or people. Regarding the scene of logic, it also reaches the people who were in the federal mandate of 1% clever classes that are confused and frustrated because life is not as predictable and mathematical and logical as it seems at macroscopic level. You must apply Heisenberg's uncertainty principle (along with all the other laws and principles of uncertainty) not only to physics but also to life and allow space to change and adapt your plans. One of the best movies I've ever seen. It can only go above your head; It is not for you it is for the people who are having trouble dealing with life that does not work out like a math problem. When you critically analyze a movie or write your critical review, try reading the back cover first (written by marketers and parapsychologists)
