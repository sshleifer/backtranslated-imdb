It took me time to really appreciate John Carpenter's Halloween. As a child, I remember having enjoyed the successes, especially The Return or Michael Myers, which I still think is the best Halloween sequel. But I thought the first one was slow and took too much time to get started. I watched it several times recently and I now know that I was wrong. Today I really understand this movie, the meaning it has, the whole feeling of this horror masterpiece. It's not about blood and gore. It's not about naked chicks and lame jokes. It's about the worst night in Laurie Strode's short life. It's over the night, his demented brother coming back home to finish what he started 15 years ago. This movie is meant to be scary and I think it succeeds very well. It's also one of the first slasher movies, a horror sub-genre I always loved. Halloween has a very dark atmosphere, creepy music and talented young actors, like Jamie Lee Curtis in her first role. Should I say more? Anyone who has never seen it, or a horror fan or not, should do his cinematic homework now. Highly recommended!
