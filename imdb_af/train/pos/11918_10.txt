"Angels in the Outfield" was originally a 1951 movie from the Ted Turner library; Disney recovered it in 1994, this time, with the California Angels (now the Los Angeles Angels) as the team (Disney owned it himself and the Anaheim Mighty Ducks Hockey team; also good use of the words, huh ??? ??). <br /> <br /> This movie was about some orphans who wanted a family. A man promised the boys a family, just as the angels won the winners. That's why he called on God one night about this. The boy who prayed could see the help on the way (and ONLY that boy); For example, when the first angel came down, a player hit such a ball so hard, not only did the bat break, so did the ball !!!!! For many of the 1994 after-All Star season, the Angels were at the top of the AL West (of which my Rangers team is one and it is still). However, they lost a match because the boy was in court instead of the White Sox / Angels game (there was no Central Division in Baseball, hence Chicago in the West) and no angels were there to help. So a new rule has been created: no angels can help in championship games. But wait! In the final championship game the Angels won !!! It was indeed a miracle. <br /> <br /> What I liked about this movie: It's a good movie. I mean, I've been praying every night for help with school and good; look at me now! My work was good !!!!! So for one, it shows that if you believe, God can send his angels to help you with any problems you may have in life. And secondly, it's a family baseball movie, which is always exciting. It's also an old Disney movie; I recently saw it on the New Disney Channel (Blech !!!!!). <br /> <br /> "Angels abroad" will change your life forever if you have seen it !! ! <br /> <br /> 10/10
