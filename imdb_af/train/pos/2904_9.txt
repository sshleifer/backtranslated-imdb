This film is Damian Szifr√≥n's second immersion in movies after his excellent character study in El Fondo del Mar. With "Tiempo De Valientes" he creates extremely well done characters, far away from prototypes and with an unprecedented chemistry between them. I saw Szifron's talent to present each character in a light way, but just enough to engage with them emotionally. His control over them is wonderful, so he recovers a good direction on the movie and an overall brilliant polished writing. The characters laugh and cry with true sentiment and invite the viewer to join their emotions and their evolution on the screen. <Br /> <br /> The Spanish takes over the English, the Buenos Aires urban landscape replaces Hollywood sets at night and the point of departure is just as interesting as any other, so we have a movie to compete with about Hollywood machinery. . <br /> <br /> But I want you to see the movie mainly because I've never done such engaging characters, all of them. It seems as if the writing fits perfectly with the actors and vice versa. I really think with a movie maker like this Argentina is really competing.
