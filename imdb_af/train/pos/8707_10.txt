Mechenosets is one of the most beautiful romantic movies I have ever seen. The name of the movie can be translated into English as "the swordman". The main hero (Sasha) was born with an exceptional ability: he can protect himself with the extremely sharp sword that comes out of his hand in his hand. On the one hand, he may look a more foolish superhero from the senseless film about unreal events and feelings. But it's not about Mechenosets. He can hardly even be called the anti-hero. I think he is just a person who has lost the prospect of his life and believes in good, justice and love. In his life he never met anyone who could understand and love him (except his mother). Each step is stained with blood; He takes revenge on everyone for his gift that has become a damnation to him. And suddenly he meets her. She doesn't need the idle talks and explanations. She loves him for what he is. She didn't care what he did. The fact that he is next to her is more important than anything else. But soon she finds out his secret: he kills two people (her ex-boyfriend and his bodyguard) to protect her in front of her eyes. Even afterwards, she couldn't escape her feelings. They are trying to run, but it is heart to hide. Finally, they have a serious car accident. He was chopped; she is in a mental hospital. They know nothing about each other, but she believes he will save her. He convinced many obstacles, but eventually found her. They are running again, but they are not invulnerable. She was wounded, she needed a rest, but the police almost caught them. He does not know what to do, they ride in a corner and then begins his sword trees, helicopter to cut them down, but there is no need because she is already dead in his arms and he is the lonely person in the whole world again.
