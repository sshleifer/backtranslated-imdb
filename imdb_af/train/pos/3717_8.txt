It was only when I saw Napoleon Dynamite that I remember seeing Cracker Bag. Just beautiful sentiment and never bending to be sweet. There are some fantastic cinematography and the head girl is quite brilliant. It captures more than the nostalgia of time. It has a real heart on it. It is the Achilles wound of childhood that is beautiful and painful. A simple story is always effective when done well. This Glendyn Ivin has a great future and I for one, look out for his next project. The follow-up is always the most diffuse thing. It's like the second album blues for most people. <br /> <br /> I just hope his next movie isn't something like a shark movie. Shout for everyone. Enjoy your theater.
