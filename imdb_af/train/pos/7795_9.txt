That would be another kind of review. I watched this movie twice on TV and would like to have a copy, as it talks about Panama City and the beach in the winter time which is my favorite time to be there. It was the first movie I saw at Ashley Judd and she was good and I enjoyed every other thing I saw. Sundance's response also impressed me, as did director Victor Nunez, who directed and wrote several movies about Florida. This movie is talking to me and I have seen nothing to compare it to. The plot speaks less to me than the environment. Well, I told you it would be a different kind of review.
