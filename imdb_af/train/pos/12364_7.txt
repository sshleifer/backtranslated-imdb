In the "devil-meet-spiritual" tendency of the late 60's / early 70's, which are the main types of "Rosemary's Baby", "The Exorcist" and "The Omen", "The Sentinel" In addition, it is just as well (although most are overlooked). In a way, it combines the best elements of the movies and tassels in a line of Polanski's "The Tenant" (which came out the same year) for good measure. A New York model that is unable to commit her attorney's boyfriend, takes a dormitory in a mussel cover, which initially looks like the perfect place; She meets an old old neighbor (the brilliant Burgess Meredith), plus the other out-of-town tenants. She wakes up awake through loud noises above her apartment, and soon discovers that a dumb priest and herself are the only residents of the otherwise deserted building. From there, director Michael Winner ("Death Wish") leads this supernatural thriller in gear, and there is a devious surprise for the hallucinogenic torture he causes on his heroine. Supported by a brilliant ensemble cast, a subtle storyline, and an excellent FX makeup by Dick Smith ("The Exorcist"), "The Sentinel" is a truly creepy horror flick.
