A warm, sweet and remarkable charm film about two antagonistic workers in the same shop (James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan) carrying a romance through a post box without knowing it. The key to the success of this film is that Ernst Lubitsch is absent from any poignant sentimentality and calls to give his actors. As a result, you fall in love with almost everyone. <br /> <br /> There is a strong undercurrent of melancholy running through this movie, which I appreciated. Loneliness is an important theme, which is naturally represented in the character of the shop owner and manager, played by Frank Morgan wonderfully. He discovers that he is exhausted by his wife and realizes that the successful life he has created for himself is not enough to make him feel alone if he does not have a partner to share it. This makes the fierce romance between Stewart and Sullavan increasingly gripping, as they both reach out to these invisible others, who each think of them as a soul mate before even meeting. Of course, we know that in the end everything will end up in the end, but the film does not forget the dishonest feeling one of them would feel if they found the reality not to be fantasy. <br /> <br /> Lubitsch fills out his movie with a crackerjack cast that has bootloads of chemistry. The small group of shop staff refers to the entire movie as a small family, and that is exactly how it feels to us. <br /> <br /> It's a wonderful, unsung romance. <br /> <br /> Degree: A +
