A new side to the story of Victoria and Albert is brought to life by director Jean-Marc Valle. Most people's flowing thoughts of Queen Victoria are those of the woman who has ruled for a few decades and lived her life in mourning. Emily Blunt is more than capable in the title role as his audiences give a different perspective. She portrays Victoria in her youth, ascension and early years. Blunt's Victoria was fresh and hung in the film. Her strongest scenes are with Albert (Rupert Friend) and Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany). All the actors acquitted themselves, including Miranda Richardson, in what could be a roll away. <br /> <br /> Although not a story of dramatic arches and histrionic "acting" moments, the story is still interesting enough to make it worth watching. There are some historical freedoms that were taken by the time of writing. The film tries to stay true to the relationship between Victoria and Albert and the social and royal structure of the era. The set design and costumes are outstanding. <br /> <br /> This movie will be most appreciated by those drawn on history, period dramas, and Blunt and the other actors. Highly recommended. <br /> <br /> Degree: A
