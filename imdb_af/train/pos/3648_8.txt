"Pandora's Clock" is a gripping suspense / thriller that is a cross between a virus film and a disaster movie. This movie, broadcast in two on NBC in 1996, showed in its debut in 1996, about a plane flight that becomes infected with a virus when one of the passengers only carries this disease. The US government is debating whether the plane should be destroyed or not, while the pilot (Richard Dean Anderson) and a virus expert (Daphne Zuniga) are trying to figure out something to avoid disasters. I'm not really a big fan of TV movies and miniseries, but I like "Pandora's Clock". This is one of a thrill ride. Jane Leeves (TV's "Frasier"), Robert Loggia, and Edward Herrmann (as president) star as well. <br /> <br /> *** (out of four)
