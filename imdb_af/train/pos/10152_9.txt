I saw it since I first saw it in her work. Eventually, it found 2/13/02 on Lifetime Movie Channel. <br /> <br /> Jim Larson's comments on the fact that it is a "lovely funny story of two people crossroads" are dead. Authors probably shouldn't get a bonus, everyone else SRO to make the movie. <br /> <br /> Anyone who appreciates a romantic movie should see it. <br /> <br /> Natasha's screen presence is so hot and Her smile so electric, to say nothing of her beauty, that everything she's in is on my favorite list. Her television and print interviews I have seen are just as refreshing and worth looking for. <br /> <br /> God bless her, her family, and future efforts. <br /> <br /> This movie doesn't seem to be available in DVD or video, but I'll be the first to buy it and I think others too.
