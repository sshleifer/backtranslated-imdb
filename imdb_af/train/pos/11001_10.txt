Canadian director Vincenzo Natali took the art house circuit with the intriguing and amazingly intelligent Cube in the 90's. This is my personal favorite SF movie of the 90's. It captured the basic concepts of a group of aliens trapped in a maze trapped like a giant cube at one set. This idea took in fascinating directions. <br /> <br /> I was eagerly awaiting Natali's follow-up and although it took five years to save him another project, I'm happy to say it's worth the wait. Cypher is a fascinating exploration of one man's place in the world, and through a completely logical event, finds himself in a situation beyond his control. <br /> <br /> I don't want too much about the plot, because one of Cypher's joys is the different ways we take. It's so refreshing in this day and age to see an SF movie that has more than one idea in its head. Cypher is such a movie. <br /> <br /> Morgan Sullivan (Jeremy Northam), one of the most beautiful people ever walking the planet, is rented by the company DigiCorp. They send him to different parts of America to record different seminars. To their indignation they are incredibly boring. While Morgan waits for one seminar, he walks into Rita Foster (an impeccable throw Lucy Liu), the definition of an ice cream girl. She gives him the brush, but there is something for her that he finds irresistible. It's not too surprising, seeing the dry marriage he's in. <br /> <br /> When Rita appears on another of Morgan's seminars, she tells him his life is not what it looks like. And I say nothing more about the plot. To do this, the impact that the rest of the movie has on us, as well as the bad road that is so much fun to follow, will make it cheap. <br /> <br /> As with Cube, Natali shows quite a talent for seemingly ordinary people, taking them out of the familiar, and basically seeing what will happen when they push into the unknown. And Cypher follows similar patterns. But it's not a Cube carbon copy. It has its own inspiration. <br /> <br /> Cypher is a movie that has more in common with conspiracy and paranoia stories. One of the great things about Cypher is the way these themes crawl into the story without your knowledge. When Morgan realizes his false identity is a piece of a much bigger puzzle, it's so much of our shock as it is to him. <br /> <br /> One thing that distinguishes Cypher from Cube is how much it is polished. is. Where Cube is limited to a minimalist environment and a shocking budget with an unknown role, Cypher is also on a low budget, but Natali realizes as much as he can so he can broaden the horizon and Morgan at an incredible Travel can begin through the labyrinth of its own identity. <br /> <br /> Natali's direction is exceptional, with a handsome hand on the reins. There are some great camera angles from the top, like the huge DigiCorp building as a large, robust office block in conjunction with the insignificant speck of Morgan's outside. All the color appears to be blown out of the picture, which perfectly complements the scene of the film as a contemporary film noir. <br /> <br /> The play is uniformly excellent. Jeremy Northam is a sympathetic figure from his loveless marriage to question his own identity. His performance is excellent because it is so modulated. He literally looks right in front of our eyes. From a clinical, spineless lash to a confident man who will do anything to preserve his new identity. <br /> <br /> David Hewlett is in a welcome appearance that made such an impact in Cube. He lives in a secret silo that seems to have been borrowed from black men. His scene is one of the best, as it is an exercise in meticulously calculated tension and paranoia. He is an alleged expert in identifying dual agents, which is a fantastic piece of writing brilliantly performed by Hewlett. All he has to do is look at Morgan, and we are drawn to his complex mind-game. <br /> <br /> But that's Lucy Liu who is the playmaker here. Too often she is thrown into movies where her potential is not fully exploited. But in Cyprus she finally gets a character that suits her like a glove. Rita is a separate, protected femme fatale who knows Liu. I got up each time because she's always in control and can quiet a room by the power of her icy stare alone. <br /> <br /> Things come to a very satisfying end, meaning not distracting on an ambiguous note like Cube did. But Morgan deserves his happy ending. After being so placed by the rings, I cheered him in the final scene. It's a perfect final moment as it comes as a ray of sunshine to a gloomy 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Cypher succeeds at all points. Interesting, shocking, always entertaining, that's all that Total Recall wanted to be, but wasn't. And it comes as a refreshing antidote to the overwhelming and inexplicable Matrix. <br /> <br /> A good follow-up to Natali. And now I'm a devoted fan of the man. Wonderful things!
