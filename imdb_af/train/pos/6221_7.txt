If this movie is a little better composed, it would be the best of Astaire and Rogers. As it is, it's a fine movie, but too long with a boring subplot, that is, Randolph Scott who plays Rogers's sister, played by Harriet Hilliard (that's Ozzie Nelson's wife for your baby boomers). <br /> <br /> Astaire and Scott are two Navy men. Scott meets Hilliard the first time she looks like a stereotypical librarian, and later after Ginger Rogers asked her friend (a blonde but unmistakable Lucille Ball) to enchant her. Meanwhile, Astaire is trying to pick up where he and his old dance partner stopped. The result is some amazing dance numbers, with Astaire and Rogers as a team as well as separately: "I put all my eggs in one basket," "Let yourself go," and "I'll rather lead the band." Hilliard is sweet, but a little sleepy like a plain Jane has become a glamorous girl, although she sings her two songs well, "But where are you?" and "Get Tea Behind Me, Satan" - One poster doesn't care for that song, but I love the title. Rogers is alive, and a youthful Astaire is a dynamo. <br /> <br /> The highlight of the movie comes to an end with Let's Face the Music and Dance, one of the most painstakingly beautiful songs ever written and certainly one of the most brilliant performed by Rogers and Astaire . They depict their '30s glamor and fantasy'. It really is to be regular and watched again and again.
