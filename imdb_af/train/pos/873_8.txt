I saw how this movie didn't expect much and didn't know much about it. I loved it. A very good, sharp plot, an intriguing hook in the shape of the ugly, thick, deaf girl and the ex-con, and a pace that makes things flow without hurrying. <br /> <br /> A much, much better movie than the same director's De Battre mon coeur s'est arreté, which was boring and incredible. <br /> <br /> The only thing that didn't quite work was that the so-called ugly, fat girl wasn't ugly or fat: solid, confident and far from conventional beautiful but with so much character in her face that she took over screen when she was on it. Excellent. I wish she was in more movies, and better than she usually is. I saw a little of Gilles's wife and a bit of mustache, and they both looked like garbage, and I saw everything from De battre mon coeur s'est arrreté, and that's definitely garbage. She came up a few, so I'll cross my fingers.
