This game is so far above all. I had the honor of playing on PS2, so the graphics were really good. The tuner was above the standard. The difficulty is just right. In my opinion, Wesker should be the best characters in the RE series. The story surprised me and took many different turns I didn't expect. The only score this game deserves is great.
