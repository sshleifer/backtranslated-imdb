Sense of humor. funny. intelligent. awesome. Once a year ago, I was a twist. came about this and started a veld fire. I stayed late every night and tied it to everyone I know. a couple. Like 3 people from the nearly 100 people I made, it didn't think it was as wonderful as I did. The others laughed aloud and cried and thanked me at the same time. please do yourself a favor. don't run. watch it and enjoy. intelligence and humor. This is a win-win situation. I wish I could have lunch with him and met the really scarce comedian who, as a society, needed more of us.
