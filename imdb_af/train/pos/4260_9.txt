After Fatih Akins first work, "Im July", which was pretty good, he created a wonderful Italian family epic. It's a German movie, which is unfortunately a bad condition, because we produce rarely more than moderate movies;). But this movie makes some very good photos of the time then. "Solino" is about an Italian immigrant arriving in the Ruhr region of Germany during the 1960s. The immigrant and his family then start the first Pizza restaurant in the region. The characters are excellently drawn. Especially Gigi, the main actor. You live every second, every feeling he does. His brother, played by Moritz Bleibtreu, is not that good. Well, you don't just believe him. But the character is well balanced and fits perfectly in this writing. I feel an urgent need to compare the style of this movie with the style of "The Godfather". Many people will probably hate this movie, she says boring. Not much tension? Yes, but an outrageous movie. 9 out of 10.
