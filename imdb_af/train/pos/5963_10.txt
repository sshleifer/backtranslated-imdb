This movie is terrible, but you should see it as a result. I'm not here to discuss the whole movie, just the biggest chase scene ever. When Eddie dumps milk on Tim, he gets down the hall. Eddie puts up barriers with hilarious effects (like a symbol that nails a trumpet player, buy the DVD and watch it slowly). The best stumbling block is a whipped mop bucket that jumps one jock, but continues to slide on the ground from a door. But when he slips, he picks up the speed, which defects physics (mainly friction); but what lies behind the door is the highest. The steepest step in any school ever, going to this jock to CLEAR. In fact, he will probably die of a broken neck. He not only defends all the concepts of reality, but makes the funniest noise ever made. Go buy this one. Trust me this scene is worth your $ 6.
