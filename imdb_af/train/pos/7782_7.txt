photography was beautiful, but I had trouble understanding what was going on ... was there much symbolism? ... the 2 goldfish - does it mean anything in Thai culture? There is not much plot, not much happening and it just goes by. no right start, no right means and no real end. It's rather unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> It was hard to get into the characters because you never felt you got them. It was hard to know what scenes were imaginary and what was real. The move feels chaotic and incompatible. I don't know what the pang brothers were hoping for. Maybe if I were Thai, it would make more sense ...
