I've seen many PPVs in the past, but it's the most entertaining, intense PPV and the most complete DVD I've ever seen. The DVD extras are worth it because they give a different picture of how the wrestlers are performing after the show (such as the chris no-maintenance / edge interview), a look at the Monday night wars, the first game of the Hogan title gold and some promotional talks. In addition, there is a good music video. <br /> <br /> 1. Tag Team Table Match: Bubby Ray and Spike Dudley vs Eddie Guerro and Chris Benoit 7/10 It was a very good intense game to start the show. Not too much and just pure raw physical. Spike can hold his own in table games and Guerro and Benoit have given good purity of wrestling skills. <br /> <br /> 2. WWE Crusier Weight Championship: Jamie Noble w / Nidia v. Billy Kidman 3/10 The crowd didn't really care for or wrestle and didn't get interested until Kidman did a shooting squad. Usually people expect a very high fly in a cruiser weight championship, but it had very little. In fact, it was so bad that when Noble hit his coach, nobody even cared or knew (you can tell by the lack of cameras flashing). However, the end was fast. <br /> <br /> 3. WWE European Championship: Jeff Hardy v. William Regal 5/10 I never liked being a wrestler, he didn't have intensity and style. Hardy was impressive, but didn't really have a chance to show off his high-flying action, though he still did good scores and added that it needed a quick pace. It ended quickly, which was perfect for this game. <br /> <br /> 4. John Cena v. Chris Jericho 6/10 It's funny to look back at Cena's very first PPV, how he used to act, how he dressed, and how he used it (look at his interview, it's pretty funny). It was a good intense game with Cena showing a variety of blows, suplexes, counters and some aerial photographs. Jericho was sub-par, but definitely helped Cena start his career. Cena Wins. <br /> <br /> 5. WWE Intercontinental Championship: RVD v. Brock Lesnar 8/10 It was a very intense and good game. Both wrestling styles have really combined well on the screen, with Brocks pure power and raw energy at RVD's agility and speed skill. RVD looks good in this game (better than its later races and races) and the whole match was fast paced. The end worked perfectly, as it kept Brock's uncomfortable streak, while RVD gave his only dessert in his home state. <br /> <br /> 6. No Disqualification Match: Booker T v. Big Show 7/10 Another solid match that did not have a certain intensity than the RVD game, but still a good success. Although it started very slowly (which is always with a big show), Booker T was impressive and got sick on the announcement table. The finishing touch was great, the end was a big dismay and great move for Booker T. <br /> 7. WWE Tag Team Championship: Hogan and Edge v. Christian and Lance storm 5/10 It was a mediocre match. Hogan usually comes to a large doll, but his variety does not have the intensity and energy. Then again, Christians do not have exactly the greatest athletic abilities themselves. It was ultimately a mediocre match but was still good for PPV. <br /> <br /> 8. Triple Threat Contest for the Undisputed Championship: 10/10. Rock v. Undertaker v. Kurt Angle. <br /> <br /> Easy game of the year. This is by far the best triple threat I've ever seen. It had thin falls, many finishers, stolen finishers, raw energy, intensity and fast pace. No one can predict who would come from this one. If you buy this DVD, I buy it strictly for this game. (Finally, look!) <br /> <br /> Overall, it was a solid PPV with lots of extra stuff to watch you again and again. Although it's hard to find (I had to pay a bit more than usual for this DVD), it's definitely worth your money.
