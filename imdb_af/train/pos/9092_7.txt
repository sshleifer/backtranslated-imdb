I think this film adds diversity and is very accurate in terms of historical reconstruction. The way it shows that the different communities leaving in Thailand are very interesting. The Portuguese, Japanese and various communities are governed by the king. The plots around the court are, as usual, a battle for power with much betrayal. The wardrobe is good. The film is also produced locally in Thailand in a reasonable production. The scene with the eleven as executors is very interesting. It's nice and I think it's also useful in schools for its historical accuracy, as it appears that the European in Asia subjects were local kings very different from the traditional Hollywood perspective.
