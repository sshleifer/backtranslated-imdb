I only saw the movie when I was about 13. It then sounded me and in many ways it is still. But I'm less likely to see it now as an accurate historical piece. Very little effort was made to investigate and interact with racism. It does not mean, therefore, that the strongest anti-racist weapon understands it at the heart of those who commit it. What we get instead is a dichotomy - on the one hand, cuddly and wood in 3D panoramic rainbow vision - on the other, two-dimensional characters are portrayed as an unapologetic unthinking evil. <br /> <br /> All this makes for a great movie story, but it worries me that people see the image as "accurate".
