Time is the future and for many it is not aware. The day is now. In this latest movie for legendary actor Edward G. Robinson, "Solent Green" becomes a classic classic. Many of the film and environmentalists believe this is our ultimate history. The film was taken from the novel entitled 'Make room, make room', but whose work title has changed to 'Solent Green.' The story is about the Earth as it develops in the future, with the world's environmental problems becoming nothing less than catastrophic. The planet's natural resources are exhausted and basic food is reduced to simple staples. They come in a variety of colors, such as Solent Yellow, Solent Red, and now 'Solent Green.' However, there are those who know the "right" ingredient in Solent Green and fear their own convictions and fear divine retribution. The first is a food executive named William R. Simonson (Joseph Cotton). At his death, a dedicated police detective named Robert Thorn (Charleston Heston) is looking for the truth behind his apparent suicide. Although corruption goes all the way up, it starts with Simonsons bodyguard, Tad Fielding (Chuck Connors) and security chief Donnovan (Roy Jenson) targeting Thorn for a waste processing plant. Thorn's boss, Lt. Hatcher (Brock Peters) believes his suspicions but warns him of the "Higher and Lord" who wants the case closed, but Thorn will not threaten his "Job" for an easy way out. What Thorn discovers him for the death mark, but like the film, awaits a final warning. ****
