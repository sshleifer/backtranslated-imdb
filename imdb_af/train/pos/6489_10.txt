I watched this series when it only came out in the 70's. I was 14 years old and I looked at my best friend's house as my dad didn't want to see it. It has become a weekly ritual every Sunday, and as someone tells two fourteen year olds to watch a documentary in almost venerable silence, that means it is something special. <br /> <br /> The broad sweep of World War II events makes for a difficult subject for document.so the makers have broken it down into what they consider to be the key key events and dedicated one episode for each one. Some episodes covered long periods such as 'wolf pack' that covered nearly six years of the Atlantic Ocean battle. Stalingrad had one episode for himself. <br /> <br /> This documentary could not be made today, simply because most of the interrogators are dead. The list of key players appearing gives a wonderful insight into the thinking at the moment. Anthony attended the foreign secretary, Carl Donnitz, oath of the U-boats, Albert spear, pet architect confident and later Hitler's arms minister. In one of the later episodes we see Traudl Junge, Hitler's secretary, who was with him in the bunker and it was for her that he had his thickness last testament and will - she left the bunker after Hitler's suicide and the Russian lines escape. These and many others play an important role in the realism of the events depicted. <br /> <br /> If I criticize the series that the code breakers of bletchly park are not included, but the revelations of their part in the war only started after the series so I can't blame the programmers . <br /> <br /> The opening titles and music are great, and Lawrence Olivier's narrative gives a natural gravity to the screenplay. <br /> <br /> The best documentary series ever made? undoubtedly
