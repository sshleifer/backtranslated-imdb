For me, it is Ealing Studio's most perfect movie - so fresh and appropriate half a century later, as it was the day it was released. <br /> <br /> As a satire on economic concepts of 'growth' and the commercial need for built-in aging, it can hardly be more up-to-the-minute. And what other movie can be said to have the hero literally wearing the plot? <br /> <br /> Strangely, there are parallels with Jurassic Park, where the chest literally turns around and bites. But Spielberg chased away the brilliant central arrogance of the book to talk about a little nonsense about 'children'. Hmmm. <br /> <br /> In The Man In The White Suit, Alec Guiness plays an idealistic young scientist who comes up with a rag who never gets dirty and never wears it. Suddenly workers and capital are united at the North English mill where he works, as never before to protect their livelihoods. <br /> <br /> Of course, because it's Ealing, it's a comedy, but it doesn't have to be. The complex interaction of established (if appropriate?) Interests plays beautifully, as one by one the parties realize that 'progress' is a threat and that the disposable and the waste that makes the tissues turn. <br /> <br /> But, yes, it's a comedy - even if it's a pointed one - and amidst the political irony, good performances, and some good old-fashioned knock-around lag. <br /> <br /> Yet it is the biting satire enduring it - shiny and white.
