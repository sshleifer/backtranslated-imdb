My Super Ex Girlfriend was a pleasant surprise to me. I really expected a terrible movie that would probably be stupid and predictable, and you know what? It was! But this movie has so much wonderful laugh and a fun plot that anyone could get a kick. I know it was a very nice movie, but Uma and Anna were just as cool and Steve was such a great addition with a big role that seems to have had so much fun and it really made the movie. <Br /> <br /> Jenny Johnson (scary, this is my best friend's real name) is not your typical average librarian looking for a woman, if Matt, your average man, asks her, he's in for more than he expected. He was asked for G-Girl on a date, the superhero of the world! But when he finds out what a jealous and crazy girl she really is and decides that it might be a good idea to spend some time apart, but Jenny won't have it, as he's for another girl, Hannah , fell and she would make his life a living hell, I mean, let's look at it, he couldn't have picked a better girl to break up. <br /> <br /> The effect was wheat-like, but you move quickly past them, the story and throw really made the story work and I loved Uma in this movie. It was such a step from Prime. My Super Ex Girlfriend is a fun movie that you shouldn't really take seriously, it's just a cute romantic comedy that I think if I can laugh at it, anyone can. <br /> <br /> 7/10
