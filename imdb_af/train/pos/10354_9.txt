GET IN THE DARK <br /> <br /> GETTING IN THE DARK was a movie I expected, a phenomenal show of Meryl Streep and a solid, unbeatable movie. This assumption comes from the fact that, apart from Streep's Best Actress nomination, the film received little attention from major award groups. <br /> <br /> Little did I expect a CRY IN THE DARK to be such a sounding drama built on every level. If you ask me, it is an undervalued classic. <br /> <br /> The movie opens slowly so that the audience sits at a relaxed pace in the Chamberlain and really notices that in the core it is an incredibly loving, simple family. Fred Schepisi (director) picks random moments to catch a family on vacation that gives a threatening feeling of the upcoming tragedy, while also showing the keen happiness that Lindy (Streep) and Michael (Sam Neill) Chamberlain have for their children care. <br /> <br /> While the well-known line "A Dingo Took My Baby!" has become a bit of a punchline these days, the film never gets close to laughing. The real death of Azariah was horrified. It's subtle and realistic, so the audience is frightened and asked questions. <br /> <br /> The majority of the film takes place in courtrooms and focuses on the ongoing struggle of the Chamberlain to prove their innocence to the press and court. Lindy suspects of murder. <br /> <br /> The fact that it is clear from the start that they are innocent makes the tense tests more and more poignant. As a member of the audience, I was fully invested in the cameras' destiny ... and was really angry and hurt and sad when they were made to look so horribly through the media. But immediately the media / public opinion is understandable. I loved how the media was not sympathetic at all, but they always had valid reasons to keep their views. <br /> <br /> The final line of the movie is very deep and has the central element making this movie so much different from other courtroom dramas. <br /> <br /> In terms of performances, the only thing that really matters in this movie is that of Streep and Neill ... and they deliver in every way. For me it is one of (if not # 1) Meryl Streep's best achievements. For all her abilities of different accents (which, of course, are very impressive in their own right), Streep never loses the heart and soul of her characters. I find it one of Streep's more subtle performances, and she beats it out of the park. And Neill, an actor who has never impressed me as a charismatic and attractive in JURASSIC PARK, is a perfect counterpoint for Stripe's performance. From what I have seen, it is undoubtedly Neill's best work to date. It is a pity that he was not recognized by the Academy with a leading nomination to suit Streep's ... B / c the two play brilliantly. <br /> <br /> More emotionally gripping than most movies, and also incredibly exciting ... A CRY IN THE DARK far exceeded my expectations. I strongly recommend that people who just know the movie as the movie where Meryl screams: "The dingo took my baby!" watch the movie and just see how much more there is to a CRY IN THE DARK than that one line. <br /> <br /> ...
