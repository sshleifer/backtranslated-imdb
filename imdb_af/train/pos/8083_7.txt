If you've read the books, forget about the characters Tolkien built in your head. The representation of hobbits, dwarfs, etc., had the disney treatment. The dark riders are excellent, and as I have always thought of the books. <br /> <br /> It's an excellent movie, blending vibrant movement and animation to deliver incredible effects for the year. I wish he (Bakshi) got the money to finish his epic. <br /> <br /> It is worth having the video as it will be worth a while after the 2001 Lord of the Rings !!
