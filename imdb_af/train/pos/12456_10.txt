This movie is definitely one of my favorite movies of its kind. The interaction between respect and morals strong characters is an ode to knightly look and the first code among thieves and policemen. It treats themes such as duty, guilt, word, manipulation and trust as little films have done and unfortunately nothing I can remember since the death of the "official" in the late seventies. The order is nice to the essential, nothing to live and thus leads the spectator right and wrong in a masterful plot without additional eye-catching and spectacular scenes that are often needed in smaller copies of the genre to keep the audience awake. No such scenes are present or needed. The argument is true to the spectator; An important asset in a genre that too often gets stressed by the deception of the audience. No, it's not missing Marble ... A congratulations to the music is in order A movie to watch and enjoy every minute, not just to watch.
