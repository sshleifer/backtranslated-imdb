This movie ran completely round the original Dolemite. It has everything that makes a movie great, except for real actors. (Ernie Hudson couldn't do it alone and you know it! LOL) I admit I killed my first videotape of this movie and I'm planning to buy the DVD version again as soon as possible! This movie has so many catchy lines, it's a pity! I'm ashamed to say I know the theme song backwards and forwards! I love Jimmy Lynch's character, and he must have won the Best Supporting Prize in Blaxploitation, but the Oscars were never right for this! It is a random film made up of Crooked Cops, Breasts, Chases, Bad Editing, and of course martial arts. (Since it's the 70s and I can say everyone has known some kind of martial arts). I think this movie should be restored and displayed one night in the middle of a marathon in local theaters!
