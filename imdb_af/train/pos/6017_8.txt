There is no way to confront "Zabriskie Point" from a rational point of view or try to describe it using words and conventions that you will use for other movies. That's because it's not a movie. It's an idea and a feeling that the filmmakers have changed it in some way into an object that is as nice as a movie. What we see is not the deployment of a plot, but rather a series of events that we do not see in movies every day, but just imagine that this happens as the backdrop we will be able to do when we have a tragic event in the news or from friends. We see our imagination of people who are abstraction for us - no one knows us, but we undoubtedly heard of them in a book or on TV or somewhere. So what do we see? Happenings. We see people offending, driving and inevitably escaping. Only the escape comes from something intangible - it is the collective situation and cruelty that allowed the mass of a civilization to exist, though laziness, or ... human nature. In the late 1960s of Los Angeles, our players are playing against and in response to the self-inflicted miseries of modern existence. These creatures are effectively empty slides that can show any trait we can imagine if we want. Although the actions taken can be regarded as criminal or irresponsible, the characters themselves are not criminals. They are people who seek a return for a well-known, non-manufactured existence that is beyond the normality they experience every day. Not that they are ever happy or sad, but they reach a kind of self-actualization when they move away from the suicide of modern life. They only reach true life in the natural world, even if it is the next victim of modern existence. In the end, 'Zabriski Point' is a hymn of the humanities attachment to the natural world. Since even the most devastated pieces of the earth lead to our predictions of progress, we lose our souls on the path to the death of the human spirit.
