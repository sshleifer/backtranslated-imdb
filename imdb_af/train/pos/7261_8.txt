I totally disagree with "ctomvelu" about Jim Belushi's talent. I like to love Belushi a lot. Admittedly I was skeptical when he first appeared on the scene because I was such a big fan of his brother John. But Jim has a screen scarf that got him very far - and he has developed well in recent years. <br /> <br /> Curly Sue is one of his previous films - his weight is giving away (isn't it true for most of us?) - and I like the movie. Yes, it gets on and heartwarming, so if you are in motor yachts, explosions and free sex, you may be able to surrender one - it's a hot movie of three lost soles that find each other. Don't get me wrong, I've been to the three aforementioned keys for a successful movie, but I also like a nice, solid story like this. <br /> <br /> And while Belushi and Kelly Lynch are performing excellently, the real star of this movie is Alisan Porter - who's absolutely treasured. <br /> <br /> I don't know what happened to her career, but who is responsible for dropping the ball (agent? parents?) should be shot. You can't ask for a more perfect introduction than familiarity with this movie, and yet nothing has been heard from her. <br /> <br /> Another sad Hollywood story ...
