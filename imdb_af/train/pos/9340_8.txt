** Possible Spoiler *** Adam Sandler is usually typed in comedy, but in "Reign", gives a deep moving display. While there are people facing Courage after September 11, 2001, Sandler plays Fineman, a lonely widow. and "lost in his own world". Johnson (Cheadle), a practicing dentist, meets his old college committee (Sandler) and wants to catch up with 'Old Times'. We see, as in Rain Man (Dustin Hoffman), Fineman also becomes emotional and withdraws in stressful situations. Cute music, seems to be a comfort and a psychological stool for him. <br /> <br /> In Fineman, Johnson is looking for some fun and comfort in his family. He also feels unhappy and dissatisfied with his work. In the same case, he also wants to make sure that his friend does not fall through the social "cracks". I came from this movie, with another prospect and more sympathetic compassion for robbers.
