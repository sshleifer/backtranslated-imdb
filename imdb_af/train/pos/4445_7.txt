This early black and white, Sirk melodrama is a minor movie, but shows the German director's flair to improve tired story lines in something that looks like art. In the 1910s, Barbara Stanwyck was the woman who had sinned by leaving her little husband and family for the Chicago stage trap. She never fulfilled her ambitions, and was withdrawn to the village she had left through an eager letter from her daughter telling her she also had the theater (a high school production). Back in her old town, she once again comes back against humility and has to deal with her hostile eldest daughter, hidden man (Richard Carlson) and ex-lover. The plot is nothing new, but Sirk sets himself apart by creating meaningful compositions, with each frame carefully shot, and he is immeasurably helped by Stanwyck as his leading lady. It runs brilliantly 76 minutes, and it's just as good, because the fabric doesn't really have the legs to go any further.
