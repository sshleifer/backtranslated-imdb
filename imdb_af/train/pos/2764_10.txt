On the eighth day God created Georges. But the same as an eighth day does not fit in the week. Georges does not fit in the modern world: he has Down syndrome and is therefore marginalized by society, four years ago, after his mother's death. She was the only one who loved him. <br /> <br /> Harry is another man who no longer loves. His wife left him for reasons she couldn't explain. He also lost the love of his daughters when he arrived late at the station to collect the two children, who wanted to spend the weekend with their father. <br /> <br /> Harry is a highly-oriented businessman. He knows all the rules that enable us to succeed in our modern meritocracy. But he made a crisis situation, which reached a climax after the loss of the love of his daughters. He questions the meaning of his life, without getting definite results. <br /> <br /> Meet Harry and Georges. Initially, Harry tried to get rid of Georges, the same as any other. But Georges can't be shaken off. And it gradually begins Harry, how much he needs Georges when he comes to his identity crisis. It is Georges who opens him a new access to the world and shows him his various eyes. Friendship and human warmth take the place of calculating striving for success. It's no surprise that Harry can't avoid his work. <br /> <br /> Georges helps Harry regain the recognition of the girls. Even his wife must admit that the fireworks he organized were worth seeing. Nevertheless, reintegration into the old life is no longer possible. And the new one seems to be nothing more than a dream with a time limit, which will reach its end unstoppably. The camera looks Harry and Georges from above, for a long minute, as they both lie in the grass and just enjoy the moment. But the same as this minute will inevitably pass away, the friendship of the two men who came in such a wonderful way will not be long lasting. Georges is destroyed by the impossibility of love for the opposite sex and can see no other way out than to commit suicide. Harry turns into a city stream, asking the drivers waiting in front of the traffic lights for charity. <br /> <br /> The film describes modern meritocracy as a disastrous mechanism that has positive values ​​such as human warmth or friendship. This is Georges, the Mongol, who is able to show the way out of the dilemma, but unfortunately his plea comes badly. However, his failure does not necessarily mean that it is impossible or not desirable to reach the goal. The way he shows us is certainly acceptable, although it requires a great deal of willpower and, above all, the courage to apply a radical non-conformity.
