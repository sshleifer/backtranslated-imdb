It is one of those landmark films that must be in the context of time. Thickness in Tallinn was made in 1993. It was a period of chaos, confusion and gross disorder not only for ordinary residents of Estonia, but also for many citizens of other former nations who were part of powerful Soviet empire. It was in such a tense climate that a young country called Estonia was born. As newly established governments are known to experience dental problems, Estonia has also experienced numerous problems such as some corrupt officials manipulated state machinery for filling their dirty bags using their selfish means. This is one of these movie's core themes. The devil in Tallinn appears as an Estonian film, but it was made by a Finnish director Ilka JÃ¤rvilaturi. He tried his best to interfere with as many doses of Estonian humor as possible. That is why it can be called a comedy film of political undertones. If ordinary people are involved in this movie, we can say that this film is good against evil. is not a new concept, as it is readily available in most religious books of different faiths. In Talinn, thousands are shown. How can ordinary governments also be destroyed by corrupt people. A beautiful movie to watch on a sunny day.
