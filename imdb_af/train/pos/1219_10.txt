The second Care Bears movie is amazingly better than its predecessor. It has a deeper plot, better character development, and the songs (especially the closing rod) are striking and cordial. Certainly, the movie tends to care about stress, but come on, it's a Care Bears movie. This movie is a good picture to show to children because it emphasizes friendship, love and caring again. To call the Care Bears is just too adorable!
