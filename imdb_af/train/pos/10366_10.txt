An unqualified "10." The level of writing and acting in this Australian film is reminiscent of the very best of "old" Hollywood. Sam Neill and Meryl Streep are very good together. Neill matches Stripe line for line, and take for the take - this is one of the best shows of his wonderful acting talent and he is at his sexy and most beautiful, despite the intensity of his role. This surprising film is a surprise to any movie fan who loves a gripping courtroom, portrayed in the most human but unintentional terms. The movie - which has won several awards in Australia - does not only boast an excellent cast and director, but also wonderful and authentic Australian venues. It proves that people are the same worldwide. And after all these years, people still have the pleasure of repeating the famous Stripe line, accent and all. A dingo nice baby! " Including some imp "Elaine Benis" on "Signal."
