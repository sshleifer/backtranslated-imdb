Wow, it was years since I last saw this movie. To see it in 2008 is definitely different from seeing it in 1986. Initially I didn't think I'd make it through the movie. Hunting Stevenson (Michael Keaton) was so zealous, arrogant and disrespectful that I found it hard to see him. He embodies every negative stereotype of Americans. If it wasn't bad enough, the picture just got worse when the little American town's best workers showed up. On the opposite spectrum, the Japanese was presented as emotional, robotics. The movie wasn't even funny, I just hung there because of its nostalgic value. And I'm glad I continued the watch. <br /> <br /> Like boxing, judges are struggling with how to complete the round. This movie ended from about three to seven, I evaluated it because of the end. The end was excellent. You always want a harmonious end and it was just like that. It was wonderful that the town got there work and kept the factory, but what was special was the marriage between Japanese customs and values ​​and American customs and values. It was a mediocre movie that ended on a high note.
