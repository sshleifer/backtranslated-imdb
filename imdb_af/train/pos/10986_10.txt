We stumbled on the documentary, Gray Gardens last Sunday, and "inhaled" without warning. Everybody entering the room appeared on the television and the haunting images of Edith and Edie living in their living room in almost one room of a large dirty townhouse on the beach, put ice cream and corn on the head. cooked on the bedside table) - and the cat blows on Edith's bed and her incredible words, "I thrive on the scent." We did not see the beginning and wondered what we looked at and how these aristocratic women succeeded in the position they were in. Spellbinding! a must see !!!!
