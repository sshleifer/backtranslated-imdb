Wow! All I can say is that if Elizabeth Montgomery is the enemy (she speaks Russian) then I give up. In her short skirt, high boots, and pronounced bust line, she's a real baby, even though her zombie-like eyeshadow is kind of coming and going. These 30 minutes are undoubtedly the sexiest of the series. Watch the realistic and revealing wrestling match with Bronson until he pulls her out of the jaw and destroys all the fun. Well, probably I should take my hormonal response. <br /> <br /> It's a very well-projected half-hour by the underestimated power behind the series's success, Buck Houghton. Of course, the producers want to lead the third season with an above average entry. It is post-core holocaust America (we know because it is part of the invading force) and only the American Bronson and the Soviet Montgomery are left, along with about twenty tons of realistic wreck. They wander under the devastation in alternating moods, wondering how long it will take for biology to deceive politics, which of course it does (lucky Bronson). And it's about it. No real conversation, except for what Bronson has to say, which is pretty overflowing. Nonetheless, the script is still entertaining, and rather brave for his time, and even suggests that not all Russian women looked like truck drivers (a popular Cold War stereotype of the time). <br /> <br /> In passing, it is rather curious that the many Slavic-elected Bronson (Buchinsky) as the American and the glamorous Montgomery will be cast as the slave. Appearance, it must be the reverse. My guess is that the producers did not want to throw the American into the physically weaker role of the woman, regardless of actions. However, there may be little of the usual TZ fright or atmosphere, but the episode remains a lot, very watchable 30 minutes.
