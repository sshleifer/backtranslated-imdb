As part of the celebration of Casino Royale's release, this new Bond star feature film featured director Roger Michell (Notting Hill). I almost switched it off because it was a bit boring, but I'm glad I got stuck with it. Basic May (Anne Reid) is a single mother of Helen (Anna Wilson-Jones) who barely sees anyone and has not had a boyfriend in years. Her daughter says she might want to marry her new boyfriend, Darren (Daniel Craig, of course). Once we know each other for a few days, May and Darren have a secret relationship. And at her age, with a 30-something, and the new Bond ?! Anyway, they obviously want to keep it a secret, but May regrets and wonder if Helen will find out. When she does, Darren gets less trouble than May. In fact, Helen asks her permission to hit her. Also with Peter Vaughan as Toots, Danira Govich as Au Pair, Harry Michell as Harry, Rosie Michell and Rosie and Johnny Engels' Oliver Ford Davies as Bruce. Very good!
