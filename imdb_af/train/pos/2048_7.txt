A grossly depressing screenplay and a few low-key performances by Peter Strauss and Pamela Reed and a great place in Ohio, make this fine TV movie hard in the fray. As the mills are close and the union is disappearing, the blue-collar workers are threatened by everyone: management, owners, their wives and children. Strauss is completely credible in his role, and Pamela Reed is, as always, wonderful. See if you can recognize John Goodman before wearing weight. <br /> <br /> The heavy metal count - was someone who made a pun? - Sometimes, strikingly annoying, but Frank Stanley's cinematography is knocked out, especially the mill screens.
