A Chinese scholar who critically criticizes the arrogant, nationalist, warring policies of the ruling clerk around the emperor in pre-war Japan is being a "communist" and a prison for life. His loving wife, who fully supports her husband and his ideas, is left alone to save her family from famine. This movie is a great statue erected in praise of the role of the mother in the history of mankind. Sayuri Yoshinaga is no less than sublime in the title role and it was a monumental scandal that she did not get an Asian Oscar for the best female role in 2009. It went to a young girl with very limited acting potential. <br /> <br /> This deeply moving and most human feature is a must see for all 'real children' on earth.
