All I can say is the first movie of the season that gets my attention. I chose it because of the actors, Gere and Claire, and the story looks promising. I just watched it and I can say - I'm overwhelmed. There are shocking scenes true, but it makes it more realistic. We must not move away from our reality, these things happen right now. And there are experts who are trying to change things and make things better and laugh about their commitment to the cause. Actually, I can't feel the "Hollywood touch" in the movie ... and it makes it better. Both Claire and Richard played a big role, earning a 10 out of me.
