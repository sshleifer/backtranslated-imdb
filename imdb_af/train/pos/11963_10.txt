"Scoop" is easily Woody Allen's funniest movie of the 2000s so far. Allen, although eventually looking at his age, is at the top of his game as a low-blue wizard Sidney Waterman. Its one-liners and attitude are hilarious. Don't let the critics swing your mind. "Scoop" is a "Woody-Lite" picture. <br /> <br /> The classic music score is an excellent compliment to the on-screen action. Scarlett Johanson looks beautiful in that swimsuit. Jackman stamp. The cinematography glows. "Scoop" is a great escapist prize from start to finish. The last shot of the movie alone is the admission price.
