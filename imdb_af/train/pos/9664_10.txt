Bette Midler shows off her talents and beauty in "Diva Las Vegas". I'm excited to have signed it and I can see when I want to. She has what is needed to keep an audience in captivity. Her voice is as beautiful as ever and will really impress you. The highlight of the show was her song "Stay With Me" from her 1979 film "The Rose". You can feel the emotion in the song and will get goose bombs on the leg. The show will leave you to rent a Bette Midler movie or go to the nearest music store and buy one of Bette Midler's albums.
