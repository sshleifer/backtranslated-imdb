... as I was when I watched this movie, I will never see this movie again, because it is a bad movie, but because it scares me so much! As I said, I was 14 when my English teacher decided to show it to us; The reason is that we have read an extract from the book. <br /> <br /> All the girls in my class were TERRIFIED when the woman came in black through the window and floated over Kidd's bed, but just before there was something that also scared us, that was Kidd the toy soldier gets under his pillow and he hears a child's voice saying, "It's for you". That scene is haunting me until today, almost 7 years after I saw the movie. <br /> <br /> If you're scared easily, avoid this movie !!!!!!!!
