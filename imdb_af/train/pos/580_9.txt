After watching the movie, it immediately became one of my favorites. <br /> <br /> A river runs through It is about two brothers who each take a different path in life. Norman Maclean (Craig Sheffer) is the parent of the two brothers and is on his way to education. Paul Maclean (Brad Pitt) is the rebellious younger brother traveling on a road full of stumbling blocks. The movie follows these characters, as each one follows their own path. <br /> <br /> There is no disadvantage to this movie. You will be entertained all the way. The acting, directing and writing are all perfect. The two things that are exceptional are cinematography and the score.
