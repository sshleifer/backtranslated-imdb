I saw that movie a few days ago. This movie is so great that it makes me feel that if you really just want something you've always dreamed about, you can have it. It shows a great desire, truth, happiness and sadness, hopeless and failure. But if you are strong enough and your heart really belongs to something you love, things can be different and happy.
