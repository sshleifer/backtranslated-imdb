I saw it in the theater during the initial release and it was appalling because I am sure it will still be. It was the first part of '68 and it was still the rounds in towns across America and there was a mass murder recently in my hometown where I saw a man watching a tramp. The freshness of that near-home event, combined with this dramatic true story, made for a very disturbing stage experience. It really brought to life the excellent acting of Robert Blake and Scott Wilson. I was familiar with the novel based on the true event by Truman Capote and the script and the direction of Richard Brooks waved the event and Truman's interpretation into compelling, sharp, cinematic adaptation. Quincy Jones music effectively determines the story. I just saw it a few times. It was too real. Almost like being a witness of the crime itself and driving with the killers. I'll give it a 9.0 of a possible 10. Today, society is so unthinkable of violence and crime today that it seems to be slow and easy and can be seen with less effect, but for anyone over the age of 50 it is a feature of the investigation of the criminal psyche.
