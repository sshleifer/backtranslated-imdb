What would happen if a depressed policeman was shrinking on trial? May be lots of fun ... This movie sets a benchmark in the action / comedy genre of the Argentine theater. Dear characters, probable story and a laugh that is laughable, have a little excitement. I recommended it for a pleasant time of entertainment. Peretti and Luque are endeavoring to fight a cold and courageous enemy at a time when it is difficult to trust someone. This movie will surprise you, the other side of the coin of "Analyze me" but not equal, with nothing envy. And if you want to get to know Bs.AS, there are few scenes from the center and downtown.
