It's a rare opportunity when I want to see a movie again. The Amati Girls is such a movie. In the old days, cinemas I would have stayed for more shows. Was this story autobiographical for the author / director? It has the aura of reality. <br /> <br /> The all-star cast offers their characters credible and gentle. Who doesn't want Mercedes Ruehl as an older sister? I loved her work since "For Roseanna". <br /> <br /> With most movies one lacks faith because we know it is the work of actors, producers, directors, sound engineers, etc. It was difficult to suspend such a belief in "The Amati Girls". One feels such a part of this family! How would I reach Dolores's defense if her family choked her emotional life. And wanted to address Lee Grant for emphasizing Cloris Leachman's hair color. Humor throughout is not belly-humor, but rather has a sense-of-quality that satisfies much more than pratfalls and such things. <br /> <br /> The love depicted in this cinema family is illustrated and nurtured. <br /> <br /> It is no coincidence that the family name Amati, translated from Italian, means "the loved ones".
