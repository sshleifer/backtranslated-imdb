Sammo should have a 10 out of 10 for this movie because it has everything. great story, big battles, big characters and great comos. <br /> <br /> This movie sees Dick Wei, taking Billy Chow and Chong Fat. Sammo takes a nice car in a casino, Sammo loses the battle, but what a fight it is full of high-speed action and elements of comedy being thrown in. <br /> <br /> Some good and enjoyable moments in the movie, Lama Ching Ying appears in a cameo and are killed. <br /> <br /> The end series will reach you for the rewind button as it is one of the best end fights I have seen. Sammo takes on many guys and ends up at Billy Chow.
