I only saw the movie three years ago, and it was then introduced by Disney head Eisner and real Jim Morris. <br /> <br /> About a month ago it came back on TV, and this time I tackled it. Since then I have to have looked at it at least three times. <br /> <br /> It's a wonderful, inspirational, good movie that is intelligently written and credible by anyone involved. It resists going for every sentimental trick in the book, as well as all the other clich√©s. <br /> <br /> Watching a movie where kids aren't jerky and having a whole host of behavioral problems is refreshing, and the jocks are not portrayed as testosterone-driven muscle heads. <br /> <br /> These are just ordinary people who dream like you and I have. <br /> <br /> I think Hollywood is like the other extreme that they call "eager realism", making movies where everyone has curses and problems with aggression. <br /> <br /> This movie is about a man who has a dream and is encouraged by friends and family to pursue that dream. The people in Big Lake TX look so personal that I want to move there. <br /> <br /> As I said b4, the movie doesn't try to go overboard with sentimentality. Dennis Quaid, as usual, never tease. I watched him from the late 70's, and he was so underrated. <br /> <br /> But this movie has excellent performances from ALL involved and kudos to the authors. <br /> <br /> A jewel In the movie is near the end when Jim practice in the dugout before the big game, and his wife calls him out of the stands. He rushes over and reaches out to his family. The look at the faces of the three other jars that sit on the couch is priceless. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a change in fit, then choose this movie.
