Great movie when I saw it. Must say one of my favorite movies of all time. I saw it 8 times in the theater and got the DVD. When I got older and saw it again, I realized the movie was average. Compared to films that are known for good comedys, it's nothing. I mean Rock was hilarious in the movie and the whole conversion with the racial stuff breaks some barriers that are wonderful. Also the idea of ​​how the movie is going is a good way of thinking. It's like a movie's mind, but also a small twist that is a very good touch. I like the movie overall, so I give it a ... <br /> <br /> Another good 7/10 for me.
