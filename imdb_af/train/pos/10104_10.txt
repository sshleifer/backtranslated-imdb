The performance of Om Puri, Smita Patil and Sadashiv Amrapurkar and the whole chemistry comes along, along with the minimalist approach to storytelling and guidance by Govind Nihlani. The dialogue by Vijay Tendulkar is also good. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen another movie yet. It's one whole, each piece is so fine in the plot. You can't be impressed by this movie. <br /> <br /> Amrish Puri comes down as the boss man and 'boss' of Om Puri. About Puri is the young man caught between his duty and his inability to fight the system. Sadhashiv as Rama Shetty just gives the right contact with the movie with his smiling and soft talk villain. The first meeting of Anand Velankar with Rama Shetty's at Sadhashiv's place is particularly beautiful. Smita Patil does not play a main focus, but her part is also not derived from the main chart. <br /> <br /> To add to this, Kafi Inamdar plays the role of a policeman who agreed with the system and its operations. To say right things in the right places and to know how to keep him from the trouble. He is also the "guru" of Om Puri and helps him when he gets into trouble. <br /> <br /> The film not only brings with it the problems that a police officer is having, but also the other side of brutality in police custody. To Puri catches hopelessness and the burning desire to break free in this exceptional show in Ardh Satya. <br /> <br /> Treatment to all avid fans of Indian theater.
