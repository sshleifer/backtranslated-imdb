I really thought this movie was great. Not only is history correct, but style is wonderful and yet intimate. I was a fan of Emily Blunt's depiction of Victoria and how she kept her spirit, though forced into a virtual exile while in her youth. Blunt shows the charismatic and sometimes dogmatic way Vicotria became famous (perhaps notorious). The romantic elements of the movie are so nice and soft that you at the end of the film really understand why Vicotria chose to spend the rest of her days murdering Albert. <br /> <br /> The technical aspects of the film It is also important to note this. I appreciated the beautiful score, which moves pretty well along with the dramatic movement of the story. I also think the cinematography is excellent, some scenes leave me breathless because of the lushness and splendor they portray. <br /> <br /> There were so few movies this year so beautiful and softer than this movie, and it estimates as one of 2009's best!
