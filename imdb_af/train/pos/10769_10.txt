I love Monte Carlo and thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I thought everyone was very good. I wasn't familiar with Richard Lewis, I thought he made his character (Julian Peters) very personal, funny and attractive. Sean Young was very good as the frozen reject girl with a heart of gold. George Hamilton was charming and the perfect Italian gigolo. John Candy has a field day as the bon vivant. James Belushi is hysterical as a total jerk. Cybill Shepard gave a very good performance as a pretty vulnerable ignored housewife. Delightful ensemble cast. Great talent, smart writing, lots of going on and beautiful places. Just a nice pick me up for a day. Especially in winter when traveling to Europe is not everywhere on your horizon.
