Must be honest and say I didn't see many independent movies, but I thought this one was done very well. The direction and cinematography were alluring without getting distracted. Successfully used corners, settings and lighting have created the nightmare world in which the main character is trapped. Many ghostly and memorable images from the film last long after it is over (always a sign of a good director).
