As it is in heaven (SPOILER WARNING) <br /> <br /> It was a wonderful human drama that stimulated my emotions and my imagination. <br /> <br /> It is a parable that reflects Christ's life and death. Daniel is a superior talented musician, who is physically and mentally exhausted through his career and must deliver it. When he joins his church choir, he brings a transformation into the lives of the choristers, just as Jesus did to society in the first century of Palestine. They laugh, they openly speak and truth to each other, their mistakes are exposed, they accept each other, love each other, become an important community. They include the mentally handicapped young (? Tore), so are their inclusivity. <br /> <br /> The pastor, Stig, had authority to set up a suffocating morality in the congregation, and this is gradually being rejected by the choristers. When Stig dismisses Daniel, there is a rebellion, and Stig is crushed. Stig represents the Jewish authorities of Jesus' day, whose insistence on obedience to the Jewish law gave a sharp contrast to the new life by the "golden rule" brought by Jesus. <br /> <br /> In one dramatic scene, someone declares "the church invented sin". Through the film, there is this contrast between moral and living creatures. <br /> <br /> Together with the Christ story, Daniel is killed by Conny, when he strikes, he leaves to drown in the river. Next scene, we can hardly believe it when Daniel's (excited!) Body is dragged into his room (the grave) in a white linen spray (the robe!), By three women (three wives guarded at the foot of the cross) in the gospel). Daniel is approached to Lena, a warm, beautiful young woman betrayed by a man she loved, and who is now riotous. (Jesus has a close relationship with Mary Magdalene-Lena-who was probably a high class eunuch / prostitute). Daniel learns by Lena to love, something he longs for, and now finds fulfillment. <br /> <br /> The solo sung by Gabriella, composed by Daniel, is about the life of a full life, as opposed to moral correctness. This leads to concern about sin, and what is right and wrong. <br /> <br /> The final scene shows the choir in harmony, like a mantra, and draws in the big audience, representing the harmony and interdependence that our true human destiny is.
