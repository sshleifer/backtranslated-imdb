These things have been storming in my head for ten years now. Some pieces of this work were really memorable. - I love to see another more current example of cg showy offy stuff. Actually, I'd like to be part of it. <br /> <br /> If I had the chance to just say what I wanted and that's it, I wouldn't have to write all these extra to make "10 lines of text" like this one website requires. I really mean? It almost discourages me, I mean luckily for the guys who made the movie. I really had the Minds Eye - and it took me 3 times to have enough lines, I hope you don't get me the wrong spelling. - You did it.
