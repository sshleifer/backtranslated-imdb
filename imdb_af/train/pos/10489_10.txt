This light comedy should be enjoyed for entertainment value. It sometimes becomes hysterically funny, but if you haven't spent time on it, you will miss the comedy when it breaks out. <br /> <br /> The role-play of characters coincides well and is reasonably credible in their roles. How Grace meets handles that meet her daughter's friend is played well. She is a real woman. And my favorite is Grace's white pimp bag she wears. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to laugh out loud, who cheers for the underdog, or just wants to see something else.
