What an absolutely stunning movie, if you have 2.5 hours to kill, watch it, you won't regret it, it's too much fun! Rajnikanth wears the film on his shoulders and although there is nothing more than him, I have always liked it. The music by A.Rehman takes time to grow on you, but after hearing it a few times, you really enjoy it.
