Shannon Lee, Bruce Lee's daughter, is delivering a high kicking action in spades in this exciting Hong Kong movie and proving that as her brother Brandon leaves is a real splinter from the old block. There is a high-tech stunt job to die in this fast-paced movie and the makers of the Bond movies should watch it if they want to decorate the action quotient of the next 007 adventure, as there are many innovative things here with fresh and original second unit works to strengthen the already high content of "AND NOW, YOU ARE DEATH". When you watch a movie so quickly and entertaining, you begin to wonder how the cinema itself could survive before the martial arts genre was created. I really believe that movies in general and action movies in particular just time to the first time marking Kung Fu movies made their debut. Bruce Lee was the father of modern action theater, and his rightful surviving descendant Shannon did not allow the family name to come here. Although there are some nice performances in this movie (Michel Wong for one), it's Shannon Lee, who will remember you for a truly spectacular show like Mandy the hitgirl supreme. Hell, you can get away and whistle her battles!
