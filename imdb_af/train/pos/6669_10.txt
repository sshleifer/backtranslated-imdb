I saw this movie the day it came out last year. Hilarious, I thought. Well, now it's on video and I've seen it again. I love this movie! The stuff they do is sometimes silly, but it makes it my third favorite movie of all time. The special effects are good, but the fun dialogue will make you roll. I'm the kind of person who will say I'm inspired by this movie, so if you like drama and other things, avoid it. But for everyone else, enjoy! The acting is wonderful. Hank Azaria is the best hands (he's not a commander or fruit), followed by Ben Stiller (I'm not improving, it makes me sick) and then William H. Macy gives his best show (outshining fargo). Everyone has praised everyone from macy to garafalo, but I think Kel Mitchell was pretty good as Invisible Boy. Two Problems: The boring part of the film is part of the romance between Stiller and Claire Forlani and the Casanova parole trial. Some scenes have not completely overlooked the story, but they are an explosion. Kinka and especially the writers tend to drag on a scene to everything they are hurting, but Bam and they are ready for more. I swear after you have seen it, you will be tired of the explosive climax (which I think was pretty cool). The camera is also very cool and moving with a raging fit with the actors. Also, Tom Waits delivers an excellent performance (he has this kind of cool bad hero cool to him) and as someone else has said is the best parts when the characters show them a bit of humility. Captain Amazing is pretty funny (especially his speech to Casanova about his perfect plan-I was rolling) and hare is pretty cool like Casanova. One beef: the funniest comedian ever (eddie izzard) is almost wasted, but his heart is in the right place. All in all, a wonderful movie. I give it twenty stars and hope that one day everyone will see the brilliance in the movie's best parody, the Six Million Dollar Man one. Download now as I think about it. 20/10
