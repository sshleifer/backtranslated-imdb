I'm a fan of ART, I love anything about art, I like paintings, sculptures, etc. This movie shows it, so I like it a lot, it shows how a woman wants to paint something about art, especially naked bodies, but she can't do it because of her strict family (father) at the beginning of the she painted her naked film, but she wanted a man for her paintings, but her family did not allow her to paint naked men, because it is against the moral. Even Artemisia can paint her boyfriend and her art teacher completely naked. She falls in love with her art teacher, and it seems that the art teacher is also in love with her, so in the end he sacrifices his freedom for her door. He said he raped her, but it wasn't true. Artemisia fell in love with him, but if she said she would suffer a lot, because in the trial in which Artemisia, her father and the art teacher, was, someone actually hurt her artistic hands. I think it's a good movie about ART, and an artistic love. It's worth watching. Valentina Cervi is wonderful as Artemisia, she works very well, I also like her performance in "The Portrait of a Lady" as Pansy Osmond. 8.5 / 10
