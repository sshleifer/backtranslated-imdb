As another IMDB reviewer noted, this movie started a bit slow, but was getting much better than it did. Yes, it is released by Roger Corman, and yes, it's about some of the same thematic land so much higher budget predecessors like FATAL ATTRACTION and POISON IVY. The succession of the woman's career as a rising blues singer against the man's loneliness gathering and his almost Freudian need to fill the emotional and physical "void" or "hole" while she is away with the clever use of minimal effects and settings are done well. Using a very small number of places and characters, as well as the use of water in virtually every scene as a cleaning and drowning metaphorical symbol throughout, reminds me of this movie, although clearly in a tiny budget. many ways of the fuller sense and more recent scenario, namely the French movie "SWIMMING POOL", which at least lent me, borrowed some useful ideas from "UP AGAINST AMANDA". With a smaller tool set, UP AGAINST AMANDA keeps its tension with a rudimentary, fatalistic view of surrender to the occasional lustful temptations, but achieves it or better than other movies in this genre. Turning off the stepfather's abuse of Amanda in the past (again, many Freudies) is also very unique in this genre and interesting. I agree with other viewers about the unexpected and sympathetic response to Amanda's fate that evokes this aspect of the story. The cast is excellent, I think. <br /> <br />
