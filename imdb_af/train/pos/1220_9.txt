Origin of the Care Bears & their cousins. If you've seen the original movie, you'll see a difference. The cousins ​​are educated with the Care Bears, rather than meet them later. However, I have no problems with it, preferring to treat the films as separate interpretations. The babies are wealthy and it is fun to watch how they play and grow. My favorite is Swift Heart Rabbit. The villain is a beautiful threatening shapeshifter. I could empathize with the three kids because I was never good at sports either. Cree Summer is excellent like Christy. The songs are sweet and memorable. If you have an open heart, like the toys or enjoy the original, do not miss it. 9/10
