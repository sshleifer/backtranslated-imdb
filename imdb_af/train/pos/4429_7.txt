I personally thought the movie was pretty good, very good acting by Tadanobu Asano of Ichi the Killer celebrity. I really can't say much about the story, but there were parts that confused me too much, and overall I thought the movie was just too long. Other than that, the movie fought a wonderful play and many of the sites were beautifully shot, big effects and lots of sword games. Another firm attempt by Tadanobu Asano in my opinion. Well, I really can't say the movie anymore, but if you just have a prospect on the Asian theater, Crouching Tiger is Hidden Dragon or House of Flying Daggers, I suggest you try to rent it, but if you a tough Asian movie lover I will say it should be very good Japanese film in your collection.
