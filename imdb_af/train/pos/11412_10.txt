Beautiful and intelligent played by the two young girls, Mischa Barton as Frankie, and Ingrid Uribe as Hazel, although the plot is a piece of imagination. Young Hazel running for mayor seems innocent, to be honest. <br /> <br /> While the play is well done by all concerned, the movie tends to have a real atmosphere of drama. Perhaps we have grown into the sensible reality in movies, rather than comparing Pollyanna with How Green Was My Valley! Never mind, everyone is good in their own way. <br /> <br /> I admire Joan Plowright even though her role here is slightly muffled. The middle of the road is well suited for younger viewers, and how nice to be exposed to fine classical music that is almost a rarity. <br /> <br /> I find this movie a welcome change because it reflects more style, thoughtful values ​​for the grown-up years, and no violence. A warm family movie to enjoy.
