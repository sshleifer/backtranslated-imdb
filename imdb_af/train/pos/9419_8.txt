This Alec Guinness starrer is a very good fun political satire of corporate industry and also a light eccentric character study. <br /> <br /> The pacing is a bit slow for a comedy, and nothing of it is really rolling- On the floor is funny, except perhaps the sound effects for the experiments. But it does have its amusing moments, and it's very fine in its performance. The big explosion segment is probably the most dangerous element. <br /> <br /> The union procedures are rather dripy, very reminiscent of I AM ALL RIGHT JACKET; especially the female socialist with a light romantic lover on the character of Guinness. The political trials actually carry the story. Ernest Thesigner is very significant as a heavyweight. <br /> <br /> I don't think this one works as well as the LADYKILLERS, or KIND HARDS AND CORONETS; but even light Ealing comedy is better than nothing.
