This film has many strengths. It has one of the best watchdogs outside the Lugosi-Karloff-Chaney Circle: Lionel Atwill, Fay Wray and Dwight Frye, plus the leading man, Melvyn Douglas. It has all the right ingredients: bats, a castle with lots of stone steps, a crazy scientist, villagers waving torches and hunting muscles, a character of 'Igor', a beautiful girl, even a goofy-haired Burgoist. The soft-focus camera work is moody and imaginative. There is even some good comic relief that is well distributed throughout the writing. <br /> <br /> But it's not really a monster movie because there's nothing supernatural in Kleinschloss. The plot revolves around the generic mad scientist (well played by Atwill) who appreciates his work more than human lives. <br /> <br /> It's not top material, due to a high-hum plot of the plot and some embarrassing bad dialogue for Dwight Frye. But it's worth a look if you like early b / w horror photos.
