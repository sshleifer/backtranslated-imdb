Clint Eastwood replays his role as Dirty Harry, this time on the case of a Vigilante (Sondra Locke) who killed the people who raped her and her sister at a carnival many years ago. Eastwood plays his part and the movie is mostly more action than talking, not complaining. Sudden impact is indeed enjoyable entertainment.
