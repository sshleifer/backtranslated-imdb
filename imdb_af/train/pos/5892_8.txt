Thomas Ince always had an effort to bring simple home stories with fullness and flair. "The Italian" is such a movie. Solid acting, especially by George Beban, the father of silent child actor George Beban, Jr., and wonderful sets carry a realistic sense of early immigration homes in New York. This gives this 1915 movie a genuinity that is unusual in features of this vintage. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with the modern day and a man (George Beban in modern clothes) who reads a story about an Italian immigrant, and then we go over to the story when George plays the immigrant . He raises enough money to bring his fiance from Italy to America, marry her and have a son with her. But times are hard and the family struggles to survive. I wondered why the mother did not breastfeed her child, and avoided the complications of the dirty formula, but also the early Dream Factory pushed political correct behavior for women in 1915! <br /> <br /> The best scene in the picture is when Beban has a chance to take revenge on a crime boss who accidentally puts him in jail, and at the last moment he decides against his planned move business. Very neat. I loved the curtain effect, it was wonderful. Wonderful use of lighting in this movie. <br /> <br /> I give "The Italian" an 8 out of 10.
