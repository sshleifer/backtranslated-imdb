This documentary is what you expect from Richard Attenborough, the man we gave Gandhi: beautifully photographed, compulsory, well written in the measured, literate way that Hollywood threw away in the 30's and meticulously accurate. It comes out as a genre movie, which is outstanding in its depiction of native American (or more appropriate to the Canadian institution, the "First Nations") culture and stands with "Black Robe" as a wonderfully photographed piece Kanoland and its culture here, circa 1934). This idyllic portrait derives drama from his subject: Archie "Gray Owl" Belaney, a shot raised in Hastings (England) in Hastings, became former girls who were so obsessed with the red Indian stories of his childhood that he went to Canada gone. forest, and became a staircase and adopted son of an Ojibway band. He was a vain man with a habit of marrying and leaving. <br /> <br /> Indian brides, none of whom thought less of it, because he was also an extremely charming and spicy character. One of his wives (one smarter than he, according to most accounts), as a writer and early advocate, made him known for the protection of the wild land of the North, and this is the focus of Attenborough's story. The chemistry between Brosnan and Annie Galipeau (as Gray Owl's wife Pony) is tempting and, if not flammable, is very pleasant. A good movie if you need time from the mad crowd.
