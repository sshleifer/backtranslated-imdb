Ghost Story (the TV movie - 1972) was the pilot of the NBC series. The movie was well written and well done and I thought when the TV season started in 1972-73, if the TV series is as good as the movie, NBC has a winner. (I wish this movie was available on video !!) The series was a huge disappointment - even with William Castle as exec. producer. However, if you have the opportunity to watch the original TV movie, Ghost Story, watch it. You won't be disappointed.
