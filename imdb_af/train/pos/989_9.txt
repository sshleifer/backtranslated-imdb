Both my friend and I thought this movie was well done. We expected a light-hearted comedy, but had a full action comic strip. We both thought this movie might not have done so well at the box office, as the previews led us to believe it was a comedy. I was impressed with the supporting actors and of course Dave Morse always introduces a great play. Most of the supporting role players are veterans not the first time runners and they were solid. We both felt the writing and direction was the first time and commented on buying this movie. If you don't buy it for a good time, rent it.
