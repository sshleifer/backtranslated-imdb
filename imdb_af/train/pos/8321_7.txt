It's a nice movie, even if it's a stupid idea. It was kind of a guilty pleasure to watch. Meg Ryan seems to be able to pull out roles in this kind of movie (another example is Joe vs the Volcano). That's why it makes her a star. Of course, Walter Matthau also had that ability and he really puts him in the role and makes an amusing, kind-hearted Einstein. I suppose you can say they're both good at portraying lovely characters, though they love in different ways (lovely young women against loving curmudgeon).
