Tintin and I recently broadcast as an episode of PBS's P.O.V. series. It is based on a sound interview by Georges Remi, among others Herge, Tintin's creator, from 1971 in which he discussed his various experiences, publishing his popular character, first in a Catholic newspaper, in his own series of comics. Great views of various comics and surreal images of Herge's dreams. I first met Tintin in the pages of Children's Digest at my local basic school library that reads The Secrets of the Unicorn. My mom later got a CD entry and I read the entire Red Rackham's Treasure every month in 1978. Afterwards I remember seeing a few Tintin comics in a local bookstore, but for some reason I didn't get it because I was 12. and I thought I was outgrowing them. I wrote Breaking Free, a book and signed by J. Daniels, published in 1989, six years after Herge's death. Haven't read it yet. This film also covers the artist's personal life as if he left his first wife to his relationship with a colorist in his service (whom he later married). Her name is Fanny and she is questioned here. If you like Tintin and his creator, this movie is definitely worth a look. Update: 9/4/07 I am now reading Breaking Free. Tintin and the Captain are the only ordinary characters to appear here and they are adapted to the anti-capitalist views of Mr. Daniels with Tintin portrayed as a rubbish-smoker with a slider on his shoulder which still cares for the Captain he stays with. The Captain just tries to meet ends with a woman and daughter he loves very much. They and other construction workers promise to strike after an employee dies of a faulty equipment accident. The whole thing takes place in England with work-class cockney shots. Not the kind of thing that Herge would approve of, but an interesting piece. Oh yes, dog Snow just appears in the upper left corner of the cover (which Tintin runs over the police!) And the dedication sheet.
