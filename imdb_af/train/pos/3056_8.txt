Placed it on my TIVO for a rainy day due to the throw, some very hard-working people in the industry, and when I finally looked, I wasn't disappointed. <br /> <br /> This movie has some Altman-like flavors (it is called credits in the end as a "thank you" person) who uses seemingly independent unrelated plot lines that collapse when the movie leads to its climax . Macy is pure, clean and honest as a man who cannot escape his "destination", Sutherland plays and depicts as little as possible. Neve splashes into a deliberately wounded environment, adds Tracy Ullman, Barbara Bain at Impossible on TV?), Not to mention the steady John Ritter and you have all the ingredients for a good FILM. The script is unsatisfactory, the dialogue is free of clich√© and thoughtful (especially between Macy and David Dorfman). Braving faith and enjoying, it really spent time well.
