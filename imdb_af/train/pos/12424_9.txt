I always wanted David Duchovney to go into the movie business, and eventually he did, and he made me proud. This movie continued what I hoped for. Duchovney played his character very well and managed to stay consistent with something new, rather than playing the Agent Molder that we used to. That's why I give him extra credit for his role, also because I couldn't see anyone else playing that particular character. David was big, but nothing compared to the psychotic Timothy Hutton. A brilliant show that doesn't get tired of the whole movie, because it never surprises you. He has weaknesses and strengths, making the story all the more credible. I also really enjoyed the story, it made a big contribution to the story, and has some very memorable quotes I've always used. This movie also had a miracle. I recommend it to anyone who likes drama, and doesn't care about blood.
