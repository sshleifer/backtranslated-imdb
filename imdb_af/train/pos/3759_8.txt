Two years later ... Bill (Alex Winter) and Ted (Keanu Reeves) are getting close to rock stars in the future but still need more work in their instruments. In the future, Bill & Ted is in public popular history, but then an evil man (Joss Ackland) is planning to kill Bill & Ted by sending cyborg cans to destroy them. Cyborgs are sent to the past and they actually killed the real Bill & Ted. Now, both guys are spirits and they have to travel through Heaven and Hell to save themselves and their future. <br /> <br /> Directed by Peter Hewitt (Tom and Huck, The Borrowers) made a clever successor with tremendous visual effects. Much more funny and entertaining than the original. William Sadler steals the show as The Grim Reaper. <br /> <br /> DVD has a good anamorphic widescreen (1.85: 1) transfer and a fine Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has the theater trailer and an amusing behind the scenes featurette. This sequel was a Box Office like the original, but it is also (Believe it or not), one of the best successors ever made (depending on your position). George Carlin briefly repeats his role from the original. Pam Grier also appears in a role. This is a pleasant fantasy comedy. (**** / *****).
