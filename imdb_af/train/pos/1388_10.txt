"the day time ended" is an amazing picture. In some ways it is better than "close meetings of the third kind." (I prefer an independent big budget spectaculars movie.) The special effects are cheesy, but that's a big part of the fun. your davis gives an excellent performance in this movie. This is probably one of the best roles he has ever had in a function. the musical score is very good. the story doesn't make sense. BUT THIS MAKES THIS ALL MORE IMPROVEMENT. Like many of the finest works of art, "the daytime ending" is not afraid to be subtle and ambiguous. "The day ended" can be a low budget in the movie, but it's not too much of a strain to compare it with the "existential" European films of the fifties and sixties. (many of which were low budget independent productions themselves.)
