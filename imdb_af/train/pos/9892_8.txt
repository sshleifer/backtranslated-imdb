This movie is such a nice kindness. <br /> <br /> A lot of people trapped in a deserted school. They start killing, they know they're getting stalked, so, what are they doing? One girl decides to take a bath, another decides to cheat on her husband (whoever is there) with an old boyfriend, so they somehow have a bed (in an old abandoned school? ) Get there and go there. <br /> <br /> And it comes with the Gore and the T&A. <br /> <br /> And it's also interesting from a historical / sociological point of view. Where the ordinary 80's skater is a reflection of how we view ourselves, or how adults see young people, or as Hollywood sees the rest of the country, it has a unique perspective. This is a British movie made to be an American treasure trove. It is hilarious to see how often the British actors trying to speak "American" ceaselessly return to their British accent. <br /> <br /> If you like 80-year-old slashers (like Pieces), you'll love this one.
