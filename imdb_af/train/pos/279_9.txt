I like the way this game can make you literally jump out of your seat while you play it. The way the screen jumps and flickers when hit is very realistic while at the same time remembering it is just a game and not really there. The sound effects and sound are wonderful. There are many weapons and different spells to throw and you can even choose which game to make stronger or not. You get this stone that can beat enemies as you recover mana to blow your enemies with even more magic. The best part is that all the time you play it, you're really jumping and scared of what the next corner can lie around or jumping behind you. If you want to get the full experience, try playing it with headphones.
