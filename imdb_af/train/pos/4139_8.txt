I really wonder how this performance plays in the UK and the rest of Europe. It's such a loss of self over an American (especially white Americans). This can be a great reason for some of the poison and vitriol pronounced on this plate. I love the show but it is with a few discussions and I feel it has taken the easy way out of Spoiler Spoiler: <br /> <br /> To burn and burn everything at the end of the second season . July closed the door and had no hope of reviving the show unless her character landed on a haystack in the middle of a farm. Who knows? It was a funny, racial and occasional, somewhat frightening show.
