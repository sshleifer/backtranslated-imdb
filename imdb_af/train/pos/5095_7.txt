King's Solomon's Mines brings us Patrick Swayze (playing Allan Quatermain) who has spent a lot of time in Africa, but decides it's time to return to England and be a father to his son. He finds that his wife's parents kept his son's supervision and that he has very little chance of getting him with a lot of money for a legal suit. There comes Alison Deedy (plays Elizabeth) whose father is in Africa and is held by an African tribe for ransom of the card. Elizabeth's father sent her. Elizabeth is looking for Quatermain to take her back to Africa to find her father. <br /> <br /> There is a good role of supporting characters going with Quatermain and Elizabeth and of course there are some enemies (Russians) who want the map too. <br /> <br /> The movie keeps your attention to the end. Patrick is playing a rough, handsome, honorable man who is in need of the girl's rescue. Patrick is a great dramatic actor who can easily portray passion, loss and despair, the rugged quiet good man, anger and strength. In King Solomon's Minds, his character smiles a few times. I would like to see Patrick Swayze again in a relaxed lifestyle story, one in which he should not stick his jaws and be so reasonably strong. Maybe a little dance will help. But it's a good movie for the whole family and is worth seeing.
