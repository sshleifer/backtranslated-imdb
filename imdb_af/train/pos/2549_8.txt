The wonderful crossbar Ronald Coleman is here, as in some of his films, going on. He is literally in every scene and this comic film remains fresh because of him, not in spite of him. He is attractive, greasy and very clever here, as he stays ahead of his walking, lovely wife - played perfectly by Anna Lee. The movie is based on a French play and brings all the best features of that farce. Most of the supporting role players are well known, at least by face, if not the name ... and are absolutely perfect for this very funny movie. The fantastic Mr. Coleman is a combination of Sean Connery and Clark Gable, as he remains a step ahead of the other characters. His multi talents can be further appreciated in the classic "Lost Horizon" that every movie buff should see.
