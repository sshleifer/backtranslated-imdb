I saw it in a sturdy movie theater where the audience is usually white, educated and urban. The show I attended had a sprinkling of African Americans, and this made the difference in hearing reaction between the two groups a wonderful social commentary on the state of racial relations in this country. Actually, the white people were scared to laugh or laugh nervously at the funny bits - and there are many! - because they laughed "at the Blacks", while the Blacks also remained fairly quiet because many could not laugh at themselves before the whites. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, I am Asian (and therefore not part of any group), had a good time getting this satire of rap culture and its egos / stairs / values ​​/ pseudo- view philosophies. The film is talented and becomes the characters depicted with great work. The songs are too funny to be believed. <br /> <br /> This film is one of the best pseudo-documentaries that come together, including a Mighty Wind "
