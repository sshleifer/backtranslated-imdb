This is a very funny movie by director / animator Richard Williams. Everyone who knows about William's work knows it's a bit of stocking (if it's not ingenious), but one takes the cake. <br /> <br /> It features two frightening ragdolls that will save their owner's new French doll from a lustful pirate toy and find themselves merciful at various bizarre characters along the way. The strength in this film lies mainly in its aesthetic quality; its strange character designs, its powerful animation, and its sharp contrast of sweet and scary. Williams's brilliant animation portrayed Raggedy Ann and Andy as real rag dolls, floppy and darned, rather than simple cartoon performances of the dolls, which made it more credible (at least in a visual sense). The animation shines on us, bringing the Camel-Wrinkled Knees, whose body runs with two different personalities that control every end, the silent movie with Sir Leonard Looney and of course the Greedy. <br /> <br /> The greedy animation, on its own, is probably the most beautiful psychedelic animation I've ever seen. There's something about this animation that just drops your jaw - and every second it's something new. Living in what is considered "the Taffy Pit", the Greedy is a massive blobman who lives and eats sweets. He sings a song I can't help but feels like sexual undertones, and tries to kill Raggedy Ann for her candy. <br /> <br /> The only complaint I have about this movie is that there are too many songs. It constantly fuses the movie's pass because there are SEVEN of them. There are about six good songs (which had to be the only one), including "I watch and what do I see?", "No girl's toys", "Blue" (although they didn't need it twice). don't sing), "I never get enough", "Because I love you" and maybe "I'm Home." The others just seem unnecessary and frankly not too wonderful to listen to. <br /> <br /> It's a weird movie with strange undertones, but if that's what you're looking for, you won't find it better.
