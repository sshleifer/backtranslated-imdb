Seen it in the theater in '86 and laughed more than once from my chair. "Beirut" ... "What do you know about Beirut?" ... "Beirut ... he's the best damnbofball ever lived." <br /> <br /> You know how it will end, but it has a good time to get there. The exercise screens are very funny, but the best scene can be the one when Jack and Reno try the Falcons v. Vikings watch Monday-night soccer match while trying a make-up dinner with their wives. <br /> <br /> Williams and Russell look great with this one and it's too bad to be overlooked as a top notch comedy.
