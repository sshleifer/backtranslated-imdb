The Cure is an amazing movie ... So exciting and just REAL! I was fortunate enough to catch a performance of 'The Cure' at the NYC premiere and it has totally blown me off! I also heard it won an award from the festival, and it certainly deserved it. The first thing I found out was the cinematography. Eric Giovon did a wonderful job. The shooting style of the love scene halfway through the movie was wonderful. A love scene was needed in this movie, and Jafri crossed the point, but also kept the scene tasteful. Giovon and Jafri are an excellent creative team and they must work together on future projects. Judy Maier's narrative was so surreal, but at the same time heartbreaking, it made me feel the main character. I'm a very tough critic, but I have to say The Cure is one of my favorite movies. JUST LOVE IT! If you haven't seen it yet, check it out!
