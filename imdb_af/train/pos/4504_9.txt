Here I thought "North Nook" was the last word in the archaic semi-doc "eskimo" movies. How wrong! As a keen sea kayak I stayed up to 330am to see this hope of getting a look at some handmade 'boats'. The movie didn't let me down. Any student of kayak / umiak construction should have a look, look here. (Note to fellow shakers: they seem to be using Norton Sound single-game kayaks.) <br /> <br /> But the movie went beyond this very little interest. Although there have been some others noticed a few small back-shot fakey bits the movie has so much heart they are just a slight irritation. It was (from this amateur anthropologist's point of view) probably the perfect time to make this movie. Early thirties: the 'talkies' are so new that they (including Louie B. Mayer!) Actually make the Inuit speak in their own language. And there are so many that were still authentic, despite the infused melodrama. They are rocking the polar bear, whale and caribou. A fifty version of this movie would have been so cute with 'stars', Technicolor, etc. To glue it. The seventies version? Don't even. A very good companion for this excellent movie is "White Shadows in the South" (1928). Geographically, the mirror image of "Eskimo" is also the incessant and profound disruption of Western culture / technology to unsuspecting people.
