After looking at a distributor's screening at the AFM one night, I had to say I was thoroughly impressed. The audience laughed throughout. Unfortunately, the territory has already been sold, so I didn't get the opportunity to buy the movie, but I believe it will be a big hit, locally and overseas. I agree with the remark that "Whipped" should not be picked up as a male "Sex and the City", mainly because it is different from "Sex and the City", "Whipped" about dating never to be. take seriously. "Beaten" fun fun on relationships in a way that most sex comedies won't dare. Also the movie I selected at the AFM combined more of a plot and story than Swingers, Clerks and Sex of the City. "Beaten" never dropped for a beat and presented the audience with a non-stop comedy. The performances of Amanda Peet and the rest of the cast were all solid, which only made the film more impressive due to the budget.
