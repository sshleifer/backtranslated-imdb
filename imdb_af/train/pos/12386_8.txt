"The Sentinel" is one of the best horror movies already made in the movie industry! I think it's very scary as very few movies actually are. Alison Parker is a model with a little familiarity. She dates back to a lawyer named Michael Lerman, and has a best friend, another model called Jennifer. Everything was wonderful in her life, until she decided to spend some time alone and rent a beautiful and old apartment. <br /> <br /> The problem is her neighbors, who are very, very strange. Suddenly Alison starts health problems and falls with frequency; She also remembers some painful facts about her past that cause her late nightmares or illusions. But everything has a reason, and it has to do with the new home where she lives ... I personally find "The Sentinel" a very creepy movie, and with "The Exorcist" They are two of the most scary movies I've ever seen. When we discover that Alison's house is inhabited only by the priest and my blood has frozen! It's also terrible to see that she has to be blind in the end of the movie to be the new sentinel to keep the monsters away from our world.
