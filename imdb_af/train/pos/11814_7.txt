Usually, when we use the word "escapist" we mean it negatively; Warren Beatty's big screen version of "Dick Tracy" proves "escapist" might be good. It's really one entertaining movie. As the equal, yellow-eyed, fearless title character, Beatty creates a detective to whom we can all relate: ready for action, but not without his weaknesses. <br /> <br /> From there, the rest of the characters are almost a world for themselves. Tess Truehart (Glenne Headly) is as glamorous as the men of any crime plane would expect. Amazing Mahoney (Madonna) is possibly the most confusing person imaginable; Big Boy Caprice (Al Pacino) is the average villain: merciless but cool. Other characters include the speech-challenged Mumbles (Dustin Hoffman), the 88 Keys (Mandy Patinkin) and The Kid (Charlie Korsmo). Charles Durning, James Caan, Dick Van Dyke, Estelle Parsons, Catherine O'Hara, Seymour Cassel, Paul Sorvino and Kathy Bates also star. <br /> <br /> Wait a minute. I didn't even explain the plot! The plot involves Tracy to try - and so far failed - to find a bit of Big Boy. At the same time, there are some very bizarre events in town, the answers might be closer to what everyone thinks. <br /> <br /> Of course, the main thing about this movie is that it's fun to watch. If Warren Beatty struggled to practice his age, he used it well here. Dick Tracy is a cool movie.
