A Hilarious action comedy in which Damian Szifron goes to Diaz's life, a policeman whose wife has been deceiving him. He lives in a hotel that feels guilty about his wife's infidelity, falls into depression, keeps on caring, running red lights, just having fun, sorry for himself. And Silberman, a Jewish shrink on trial, a leftist liberal who doesn't trust cops at all. He is told to accompany DÃ­az in his daily duties, which do not refuse the conditions of his probationary period. Soon, the situation when Silberman finds out that his wife was cheating on him and eventually being comforted by the person he was supposed to help, was a person he didn't trust in the beginning. A nuclear conspiracy, car thieves, international spies, a hysterical woman. Weird characters in a wonderful comedy about friendship and heroism.
