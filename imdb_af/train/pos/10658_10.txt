The only time I saw this movie was when I was 10 years old. I've remembered it all these years because I couldn't sleep for a week or more after I saw it. It absolutely hurt me. I was on vacation with my aunts in Ft. Worth, Texas and I will never forget it. Now, 48 years later, my daughter is trying to get a copy of this for me to consider as an adult. It did a lot of research to find out what movie it was, but I always remembered Barbara Stanwyck in it and eventually got the name and reviews about it. I enjoyed it very much, but it gave me a fright! Jaqui
