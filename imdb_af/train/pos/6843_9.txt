Author-director Brian De Palma is best known for his series of films that are called a little unfair, "Hitchcock imitations." Contrary to popular belief, De Palma does not pull off Hitchcock; He borrows story or character elements that can be seen in a Hitchcock movie and then sticks out on them in a more violent, modern way. Like Hitchcock, De Palma is known to blend blood-slaughtered death with macabre humor. <br /> <br /> "Dressed to Kill," packed back in 1980, is perhaps De Palma's best-known Hitchcockian movie, and it's probably also its best. The story involves a cross-embellished serial killer who keeps both a burned housewife (played by Angie Dickinson) and a street fish hooker (played by Nancy Allen). <br /> <br /> Yes, it will remind you clearly. of "Psycho", but De Palma's movie is just as technically ingenious and dark creative. The museum series has been exceptionally well done and edited; The lift pitch scene is also one of the most unique shot murders ever on the film. "Dressed to Kill" should not be a complete original, but I want to say it's definitely worth it. Rated R. 105 minutes. 9 out of 10.
