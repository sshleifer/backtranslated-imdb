I saw tons of HK action, and this one is right at the top of the genre. The action scenes are as exciting and kinetic as you have ever seen in any action movie. The kung fu is spectacular, the fireworks glimpse, the stuntwork heartbeat. The editing is perfect pace, boosts the tension and complements the liquid camera work. This film is directed by old pro Corey Yuen, whose resume is full of the best work of the genre, including the Jet Li vehicle, The Legend of Fong Sai-Yuk. If one thing is missing from this movie, it is the presence of a three-dimensional character, although Martin, the male head, comes closest to it. This movie is full of archetypes, rather than characters - the sexy killer, the goofy thief and his bitchy girlfriend, the croaking villains. That said, Shannon Lee has a tremendous screen presence; She is wonderful with the battles, the stunts and the guns. When she is on the screen, it's hard to take her eyes off her. She's so good. Why is this woman not a big star?
