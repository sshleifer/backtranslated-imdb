We don't get movies about brothers' sister relationships in Indian theater, or any other language or medium. This relationship has several aspects not exploited in movies or novels. Typically, a sister is portrayed as a pole that can be used for ransom in the climax. This movie deals with the subject in a completely different light. <br /> <br /> It's inspired by George Eliot's novel The Mill on the Floss. The brother is very prosaic, all good, the blue-eyed boy who is a conventional good boy and a favorite with his mother. The sister is romantic, wild and challenging of the unwritten rules of society. In spite of this, the brother's love is the winner. <br /> <br /> This movie is about the love of the two brothers and sisters who were divorced in childhood and feeling the same when they met years later. . It is also the command of the muted brother to reunite with his sister who has chosen to be game to defend the world. <br /> <br /> Although the film and the novel were set in two distant lands for about three centuries, the sentiments are the same and remain true.
