When I saw the movie, I thought it was boring because nothing happened, but when all the terrible things started to happen, such as when the church died and brought back, and also Gage and his mother die and there must be idiot girl bringing them back to life, though he ignored the warnings new and Jude. This is not Steven's best work. I thought his best work was shining. I don't think people who see this movie and comment on how horrible it is are wrong, because all they think is what they think. as if that person could do a better job of making an abomination. I mean to hurt evil and how he kills Jud is genius. Making the most innocent most unsuspecting character in one of the killers is cool. People who don't like the movie are stupid, even though it's a scary movie and nothing. Don't expect something from a movie that isn't. It wasn't as good in a general area yet. I still recommend people to watch the movie
