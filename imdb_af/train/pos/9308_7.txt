If you get used to Gabriel Byrne in serious roles like Tom in Millers Crossing or Keaton in The Usual Suspects, I recommend you watch this movie. Even if you are not a fan of Gabriel Byrne, all the actors in this movie give very good performances. If you have about eleven dollars (it's close to nine quid), I say order it online, or rent it from your favorite movie rental site. Guaranteed to make you laugh, or you're normally like gangster-type movies. Mad Dog Time / Trigger Happy is one of those movies you never forget, and find yourself over and over again. You will talk about it so much will beg your friends to borrow it.
