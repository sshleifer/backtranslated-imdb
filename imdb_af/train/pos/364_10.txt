Steven Speilberg's adaptation of Alice Walkers' popular novel is not without his part of the controversy. During the first release of the black community, they criticized the treatment of black men while others questioned why a white man directed this black woman movie. <br /> <br /> This is the story of a young black woman named Celie, growing up in rural America after the turn of the century. She has two children through her abused father who is cut out of her arms at birth. Her only consolation in her miserable life comes from her sister. <br /> <br /> Celie (played in new years by newcomer Whoopie Goldberg) is married to an abusive man (Danny Glover). The man is humiliated by the sister and so she is quickly removed from Celie's life. <br /> <br /> The story is often heartbreaking, as Celie hopes to reunite with her sister and her children one day. Throughout her life she meets a variety of characters, including Sophia, a tough nail lady for her step-son, and Shug, a loud and fun saloon singer, who teaches her a thing or two about love. <br /> <br /> Speilberg's direction is across this photo, offering brilliant cinematography and a few star performances. I dare to see this movie and not move it! The film The Color Purple manages the essence of what a complicated story is. While it tends to diminish both lesbian and African stories, both of which are so good in the book, the movie remains true to its themes, so Alice Walker's voice is clear. <br /> <br /> I couldn't start responding to the controversy surrounding this movie. However, it is enough to say this is one of the few films I can see again and left an indelible mark on me. <br /> <br />
