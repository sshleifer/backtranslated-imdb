Tom had a desire to make film long and he did it. It's as if he has visualized a dirty and exhausted notebook, full of big, small ideas he has been filling for 10 years. no awards character transformations, no Hollywood ingredients just live and a little magic. The balance, in speed, in strangers in comedy against drama, is perfectly weighed. This movie takes you on a journey that is over before you realize how beautiful it was. the music is wonderful and your eyes will be equally satisfied. The fact that this film is about nothing, just a series of sketches of people connected primarily by a party of one of the characters, makes it very enjoyable and surprisingly entertaining. This is brilliant because it is empty. this happens between the lines. to see or not to see, that's the?
