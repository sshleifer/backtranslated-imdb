It was a good movie. I'm not sure if this is a spoiler comment, but I didn't want to take a chance. Anyway, near the end of the movie, the prosecutor reads a scripture and then puts another of the memory. I can't read the first part he reads, but the second one is Genesis 9: 6. He says this is Genesis 9:12, but he actually calls verse 6. This is a common passage that is very much used to the death penalty to defend. It's too bad prosecutors don't quote the Bible today. Has anyone ever heard of John Jay, the first High Court in this country's history? He said the Bible is the best of all books. It's a pity we lost the view in America.
