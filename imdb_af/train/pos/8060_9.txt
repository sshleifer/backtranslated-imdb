**** SPOILERS **** Powerhouse movie showing how men in desperate situations can go as far as sacrificing their best friends and relatives and not realizing what monsters they are doing by doing so. Until a bull like Gypo Noland, Victor Mclaglen, it's too late. <br /> <br /> It was 1922 and the highlight of the Black and Tan Irish uprising against the mighty British Empire with the currently, British occupying troops, seeking to want Irish Republican rebels Frankie McPhillip, Wallace Ford for the murder of a Briish soldier. Gypo a good, really the best, friend of refugee McPhillip, is lucky to not work with his friend Katie, Margot Grahame. She was forced to turn tricks in the Dublin red light district to pay her rent. /> <br /> After a furious Gypo has worked on a potential John who wants him to spend a few hours with Katie, for a shilling or two, an evil Katie tells the not so clear Gyro that he prevents her from supporting herself with the only bankable asset she has, her body. Katie also tells Gypo that he must awaken reality and realize what a desperate situation she is involved with. To say the Gypo thought that it only killed ten pounds for her to go to America and get out of the poverty of Ireland, Gypo suddenly remembers a poster of his good friend Frankie McPhillip that he is just a reward of 20 pounds die. That's enough money for him and Kaite to travel to America. <br /> <br /> Gypo goes to a local Dublin flop house and soup kitchen to get a free meal. It's scared to walk into Frankie McPhillip's friend. Frankie tells him he sank in Dublin for both his mother, Mrs. McPhillip and Sister Maria, Una O'Connor & Heather Angel, and if he can make sure everything is safe for him to go home and later leave for his Irish Republican unit outside the city. <br /> <br /> All Gypo can see in Frankie's face the 20 pound reward for him turned into police! Without much of a second thought, after assuring Frankie that all is well, Gypo goes to the police secretly and informs his friend who is later shot in a police and Tan shootings in his mother's house and shot dead. . <br /> <In the act, the police chief killed the 20 pounds, like thirty pieces of silver, for an almost emotional Gypo who takes it and goes out the back door of the police station so someone can see him. You can see in the police chief's face and acts that he has nothing but contempt for Gypo's betrayal of his friend Frankie McPhillip. Although he wanted murder and an enemy of the British Empire. That's how low traitors or informants are kept, even by those they work secretly. <br /> <br /> Gypo seems to be his worst enemy after Frankie's betrayal, as his conscience takes control of his thoughts. Gypo sees and hears everyone, including his unsuspecting friend Katie, pointing his finger at Frankie's betrayal and death in the hands of the British authorities. Gypo's guilty thoughts got him into the royal and glorious drunk, on the rewards money, that at the time he had to be forced to admit his crime to his Irish Republican Army colleagues, who had almost drunk and tried Gypo . The money was just about his festive drink and fornication. <br /> <br /> What good feelings, if possible, that you had for the feeble and strong shoulder Gypo was completely demolished when you were in a total despair, in order to prevent him shot, he catches an innocent man Mulligan, Donald Meek, in his crime to inform his friend Frankie McPhillip. It is quickly exposed as a total manufacturing by nothing but the guilty Gypo itself. The dye is then thrown as straws are drawn for which one would be to place a bullet in Gypo's head for the final leaking chapter of this heartbreaking and memorable Crime-and-Punish class.
