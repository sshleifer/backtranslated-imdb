FREDDY is from scary to funny, in this 6th installment in the Nightmare series. <br /> <br /> It has been 2 years, actually 11, as this movie takes place in 2001. And FREDDY killed every last child on Elm. street except one, John Doe (Jacobb of part 5, even the film indicates what he is) he used to bring more children to Elm street. Not only does FREDDY get his wishes, but he also gets his daughter back to Elm street. When she finds out what happens, she and other children decide to kill FREDDY once and for all. We also see FREDDY's ominous backgrounds. <br /> <br /> Rachel Talalay, who has long been confronted with the nightmare series. Many people hate this movie, but I like it. It tried to bring out what FREDDY did with its wisecracks ... COMDEY and make the series more funny than scary. So this movie is really a good thing to talk about. It's not the wrost in the series, part 2 still holds it. <br /> <br />
