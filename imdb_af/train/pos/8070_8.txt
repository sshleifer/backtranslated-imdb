I have no doubt that Victor McLaglen won his best actor Oscar for this movie by a three-way division among the Mutiny on the Bounty leaders of Clark Gable, Charles Laughton and Franchot Tone who were all in the same race. But The Informer is still a good movie because John Ford didn't get his first best director Oscar if it wasn't. No allocation involved in his award. <br /> <br /> The film and the story by Liam O'Flaherty on which it is based, entails a poor simplification of a man named Gypo Nolan who was once a member of the Irish Republican Defense Force. He was caged for a few times that he was pulling in the eastern stunt. He retired and wanted to return. He's on his last penny and if he can't come in again, he wants to be enough to go to America. There is a twenty pound reward for information that led to the arrest of a former comrade Frankie McPhillip played by Wallace Ford. In a moment of weakness he goes to the black and Tan constable and informs him about McPhillip. <br /> <br /> The IRA is quite anxious to find out who McPhillip has stepped out and they are pretty sure it was McLaglen. He didn't have the reason to really cover his own tracks. He made a poor effort to involve another man, Peter Mulligan, played by Donald Meek. He also picks up a pendant that is played by J.M. Kerrigan. <br /> <br /> The entire performance of The Informer took place in Dublin in 1922 from about six in the evening to early the next morning. Of necessity, it is shot in darkness and shade, possibly making the first noir thriller. If it happened after World War II, the informant would have classified as a great noir classic, such as Odd Man Out or the Third Man. It has a lot of similarity. <br /> <br /> John Ford knew this world very well. He took time during the Rebellion and was then in Ireland and had a brother who was in the IRA. His real name before he hurt it was Sean O'Fiernan. <br /> <br /> Preston Foster plays the IRA commandant Dan Gallagher. In the book Gallagher is a louder and mean man than Foster has him here. My guess is that John Ford wanted him to be a sympathetic character to give film makers some angry interest. He made it clear that Foster should eliminate the informant because the Black and currently will grab him and get a little more out of him and endanger the entire organization. <br /> <br /> The IRA trial scene is the highlight of the movie. When Foster Donald Meek asks if he recognizes the authority of their court, Meek is unable to say no. The King's justice and writing are not here. This illustrates graphically at the point despite occupation by army troops and constable, but the British are losing their grip on the population. <br /> <br /> Of course, the Informer is quite a story with his John Ford touch, but less than you'd expect. Even if McLaglen spends his money on a drunk spree, the IRA is constantly in the shade and watches every refugee. <br /> <br /> The Informer is a story that has been told well in Ireland in a horrific and gloomy time.
