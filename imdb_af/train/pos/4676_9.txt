I thought of this movie, and refreshing its ambiguity in a world of fast fix movies where we were manipulated to love the "good guy" and hate the bad guy. Scott Cohen, a very attractive television actor, does a wonderful job depicting the family's black sheep / lost child who strives to gain his father's love and respect, as well as his widowed sister-in-law with whom he believes a history. Judd Hirsch plays against his usual good old image as a father who triangles his sons and is now left with the one he has always rejected. <br /> <br /> When I saw it at the Tribeca Film Festival, I was captivated by the beautiful way the sawdust was used to portray a family tradition as explained by the director. <br /> <br /> This is an appropriate successor to the classic "Ordinary People." I just realized, Judd Hirsch was in it too!
