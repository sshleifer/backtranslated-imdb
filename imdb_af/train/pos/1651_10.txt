I watched its presentation on PBS in the US when it was originally broadcast in 1988 (?). Suppose the miniseries were available on DVD, I bought first editions of all three books last year. Since then I have been searching for the series on internet movie sites. Today I found this site. I'll give the search. <br /> <br /> I also want to buy these full - 26 episodes - miniseries. After I bought the DVDs, I would read each book and look at the episodes for that book. This is what I did with John LeCarre's Karla trilogy and Larry McMurty's Texas Ranger trilogy. <br /> <br /> Does anyone have any suggestions for good books or book series that have become very good TV miniseries - or movie series - now available on DVD?
