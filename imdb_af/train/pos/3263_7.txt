Usually I really enjoy movies like "Chances Are," but for this reason I wasn't quite happy with this one. The first half was done pretty well, with Alex Finch dead and reincarnation in a new body (played by Robert Downey Jr.). He meets his wife (Cybill Shepherd) and friend (Ryan O'Neal) and his daughter, who are now growing up. The scenes met them again and Downey rediscovered who he was once was well done, and there is a good amount of emotion and happiness as soon as Shepherd finally believes she is really reincarnating her husband, but from there the movie goes down. There are several sex-related scenes that turn me off completely, especially Downey and Shepherd who want to come back together, despite the difference in their age. After that, however, the film succeeds in the most satisfactory way, taking into account the circumstances of the plot. I was disappointed because I didn't expect the movie to be so immoral in the end. There was great potential with this story, and the scenes in heaven were well done. There is a good theme song sung by Peter Cetera and Cher, but eventually the movie is not good. For a better, similar movie, try "Heaven Can Wait." Certainly, however, I had a lot of desire I didn't see because of the screens in the second half. <br /> <br /> *** from ****
