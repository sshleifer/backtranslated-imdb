I don't know why people always want a deeper meaning in movies or otherwise look worthless. <br /> <br /> What about entertainment? Something that Morgan Freeman excels. He gets a chance to show a little. Paz Vega, his co-star, gets a career boost and Brad Silberling gets a name to draw people to watch his movie. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a good movie. Some humor, some pathos, bittersweetness, but nothing over. I have a special kick from Jim Parsons as the receptionist at a construction company. When he looks at Freeman adoringly and says, "You want to be my wife." He's just hilarious. The battle scene between me. Vega, her ex-husband and his girlfriend are also wonderful. <br /> <br /> In short, it's a cute, charming movie that will make you smile. You can do much, much worse.
