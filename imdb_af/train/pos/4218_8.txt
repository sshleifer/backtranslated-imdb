I didn't see too much of the Columbo movies. Actually, I think I just watched one or two, apart from this one. I always liked Columbo, though, somehow, without seeing so much of him. Peter Falk is and always was the perfect choice for the character, because of his appearance, his voice and his charm. The perfect proof of this is that although the series started in 1968, the latter (and probably not the last) of the films was made in 2003. This is 35 years. And Falk was back 40 when he made the first one. The series consists of 68 movies (unless my count is down), all made for TV. Everyone knows the character, though no one ever saw a movie with him in the theater. That's quite a thing, if you ask me. The plot is pretty good. The only problem I have with that is that the killer and murder are initially announced (although it may be the same for all Columbo movies), but leave no mystery, but how Columbo solves it, makes it slightly dull (as there is not much to look at at the end of the movie). The pacing is good, there is almost a scene where you are bored. The acting is very good, especially Falk and Ruth Gordon. They have some good exchanges of dialogue in the movie. The characters are well written and credible. The dialogue and script are extremely good for a TV movie. All in all, the film, yes, surprisingly good for a TV movie, and definitely worth watching for any fan of Columbo and / or crime / mystery. 8/10
