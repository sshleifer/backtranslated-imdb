I really like this movie ... it was cute. I enjoyed it, but if you didn't, it's your fault. Emma Roberts played a good Nancy Drew, even though she wasn't quite like the books. The old fashion outfits are strange when you see them in modern times, but she looks good on them. For me, the rich girls didn't have outfits that made them look rich. I mean, they seem to have all the clothes, blindly folded - at a garage sale and just decided to put it all together. All the outfits were tough, especially if they were wearing the penny trousers with their regular outfits. I don't want to make the movie bad, because it definitely wasn't! Just go to the theater and watch it !!! You will enjoy it!
