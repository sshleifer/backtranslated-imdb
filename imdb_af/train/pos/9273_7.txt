In Iran, the Islamic Revolution formed all parts of life, including everyday things. But people are still living their lives, usually just doing the things you would expect, such as going to soccer matches to cheer the national team as it is in the running to qualify for the World Cup. Except for women not going to the football stadium to watch the match. <br /> <br /> A very funny little movie follows the tiny group of women trapped in the football stadium and the small group of bored soldiers assigned to protect them in a container just outside the stadium. The absurdity of the situation, the simple wish of these women to cheer on the team (nothing subversive there) and little human touch on the lives of everyone, adds to a reasonable comment on humanity towards the ideology. <br /> Amateur activity, good writing and dialogue, a very pleasant movie. Bend it like Beckham, kind of - a warm heart and a joy in the daily interests and enjoyment of people.
