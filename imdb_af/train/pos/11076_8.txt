I will begin to say that it has been transferred unconditionally by almost everyone! The fact is, it wasn't what anyone expected, especially from Guy Ritchie. What everyone expected was cockney geezers and good one linen "do you like day?" etc., but it is much more mature than its previous works. I will agree that it is confusing, but all the facts are there for us, we just have to see and listen harder. This movie requires all your attention! Look beyond the cool and brilliant look of the movie, try listening to the dialogue rather than admiring the performances and I think we'll all get a better understanding of the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, it has its influences from modern classics (fighting club, pulp fiction, etc.), but it's in the original in both directions and fits with a music score for no one. I feel that if everyone watched this movie over and over again, they would understand it much more and might appreciate it for the fine piece of modern movies that it is and I also hope that Ritchie goes so vain as I prefer around his mockney "masterpieces".
