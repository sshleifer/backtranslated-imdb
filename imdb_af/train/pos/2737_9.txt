The film grabbed from start to finish and its black / white photography of the American heartland is amazing. We feel right there with them as they land over the big sky and then in Mexico and back to America. By the end of the movie, the reflection of the rain on Robert Blake looked like tiny rivers of sweat and tears that roll his face. Eventually we follow their stairs to their final moment. <br /> <br /> The two criminals, executed by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson, such as Perry Smith and Dick Hickock, can be seen on any street in any town. Hickock is a smiling boy next door and Smith, the man with stars in his eyes on the wrong side of town. This point is made in the movie and it is always surprising that criminals are no different from anyone else. Evil, even the most dirty, is part of the human condition. These two fraudsters kill a whole family and look for a safe that is not there. Once they are underway, they begin to write bad checks and work out a route for the authorities. <br /> <br /> There are many good supporting actors. I like John Forsyth as the detective on the case, Alvin Dewey. Will Geer also shines in a short but excellent scene as the prosecutor. <br /> <br /> I wanted to see this movie all the way, just after he got it briefly; I finally got it after I bought the DVD. The result is the best classic crime movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Don't miss this brilliant movie. For me, it's a great filmmaking.
