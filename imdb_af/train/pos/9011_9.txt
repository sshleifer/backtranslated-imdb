I found this movie by chance, but I'm glad I did. Kenneth Branagh's performance came close to this Helena Bonham Carter movie, but their strong chemistry made for a much nicer movie. This movie has the excellent movies Branagh made with Emma Thompson in mind. Carter's star turns here as a disabled young woman who wants to complete herself, as well as I've seen from a female head. To portray a disabled person is difficult to subtract, but with basically just her eyes to show her pain about her life situation, she made it so credible. If this movie came out after the current movie of movies with beautiful women left themselves for roles (Charlize Theron, Halle Berry), I was sure Carter would strongly consider for an Oscar. If you walk over this movie on the cable late at night, trust me, it is worth losing sleep.
