I was constantly searched by family and friends for my tears about movies, and they were not disappointed when I watched this one. I cried many times, but believe me it wasn't about sappiness. I had pain for the family and I suffered for this man if he tried to save himself the only way he knew. Denzel was fantastic as always, and so was Chris Walkin. Mickey Rourke, I didn't even admit; those years didn't look like him. My husband is not one to watch movies again unless they are historically accurate war movies (snoring !!!!) He watched this movie five times and I have to get the DVD to watch it again because he has worn out the band and it jumped all the time I watched.
