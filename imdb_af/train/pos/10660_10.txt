I found this movie almost out of the way. When Miss Stanwyck starts her story, it's only a few minutes until you realize there are problems. The deserted area, the lock on the door of the abandoned petrol station, is all set to wait for it ... here it comes. Initially, you think it's about the boy, but you are starting to breathe too quickly and see how the tide enters. I found this movie very stressful, even though I've been watching it before and preparing for the unbundling. Now a movie that can keep you in tension, even when you have seen it, deserves a special special rating, perhaps a white knuckle award?
