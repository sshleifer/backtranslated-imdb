I saw it on TV last night, and was very happy. <br /> <br /> It's kind of the movie that makes you feel fine and warm, and believes there is still some goodness in the world (all neighbors pretended not to see what mercy did has to help her and protect her - the old policeman is my favorite), although you know that this story is not really realistic. <br /> <br /> I loved doing (they all looked like ordinary, ordinary people, living in a small scenic English coastal town), but the biggest thing in the movie was the white and humor it has! Just remember the scene in the shop with two old ladies after they had their "tea"! <br /> <br /> Perhaps the end was a bit confusing, but it didn't really enjoy me. whole story!
