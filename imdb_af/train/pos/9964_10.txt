Just get it. The DVD is cheap and easy to get, the length is now standard and you have gone long enough. (When home video started, there were at least three versions with parts missing.) Everything you've read is true. There is no defense and no life without it. The color is sumptuous and wonderful to look at, and the production values ​​are pretty good for a Saturday afternoon kiddie epic. But no problem .. the whole of Santa Vs. Satan's corner is so shattered that STRONG it has made the movie a hit at the moment and a cult fave once home video really going on. How good / bad / odd / is it? I only saw the TRAILER as a child, and remember it for nearly 30 years. It closes Murray's over the top voice. I told my older sister and she called me a liar and couldn't believe it was possible for someone to make. A movie where Santa vs.Satan .. Add things like Santa to ask for the Virgin Mary's blessing before they lie on Christmas Eve, children who want to catch him and make him SLAVE. And an international kiddie sweat shop. And it probably comes close to a lot of nightmares the children had in the 60's. Like others here, I look now every holiday season. (My version of the selection is The Mystery Science Theater 3000 edition). But an old way of choosing it, the movie is a demented masterpiece and a total must (along with Brianiac, by the way ..). It never makes me down. Better, I think, then SANTA CLAUS elevates the MARTIANS. Parts of it can still make you shrink or leave you. (How many parents do you know, go out on Christmas at Christmas? "If you're bored, just go and play the piano." DANG.) Freaky, boring, disturbing, funny, childish, weird. he, what else can you have?
