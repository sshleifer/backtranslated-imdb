This film is described as a comedy, but it was not a comedy at all. Like any Panahi movie, it was a very realistic drama depicting the common thread of social inequality and hypocrisy. But it was very funny; much lighter than the director's dark and serious The Circle (my favorite Iranian movie). The ingenuity of the girls and the villain between them and the soldiers were both credible (as if it were a documentary) and totally hilarious. <br /> <br /> Filming the real match and aftermath was amazing. It added a realism like Australia's Kenny, of course a completely different movie. <br /> <br /> The performances of all non-professional actors ?? soldiers and girls ?? was very credible. It was very moving to see the passion, disappointment and excitement of these girls. Anyone in this country who thinks Muslim girls wearing a chador are different from their own daughters, should this movie go? It will be a real eye-opening. <br /> <br /> For me, the soldiers represented the present paradigm. They started with stock-standard official policy responses to all the girls' pleas. As the film progresses, they found it harder to maintain this attitude. When all Tehran seems to break out in a wild celebration, everyone gets caught up in it, and the ridiculousness of the current policy is clear to everyone. <br /> <br /> It was a very moving and unexpected end. , and gave the film a very good mix of emotions, frivolity, drama and social commentary. Although it is adult theater, I think adult children of seven and older will appreciate this movie (as long as they can read subtitles). It is remarkable that a repressive country such as Iran is able to produce such quality products by Panahi and Kiarostami. Perhaps the restrictions there are for directors to be extremely resourceful. Australian (and other) filmmakers can take a leaf out of their book.
