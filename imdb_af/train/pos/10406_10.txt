Abu, the Day of Baghdad, helps King Ahmed to regain his kingdom of a wicked wizard. <br /> <br /> If Europe is going to make war and flare up important parts of the world, Sir Alexander Korda's London films have unveiled this lavish escapade prize from the legends of Arabian nights. Replaced by swords and witchcraft, it gave audiences a brief break in 1940. It is also a good movie production, with good acting and an intelligent script. <br /> <br /> Conrad Veidt gets the best bill and earns it, and plays the evil wizard Jaffar. His saturnic face with his piercing eyes reminds one of the macabre roles he played with such delight in such days. Here is a villain worth watching. As the boy thief, Sabu is perfectly thrown into this, his third movie. While not a hero in the typical sense of the word, his character is heroic in action and action. <br /> <br /> The rest of the players work well. John Justin is both energetic and sensitive as the unexposed king must learn about the realities of the hard way; Sabu gets an important part of the action (when he's not turned into a dog), but Justin is appropriately athletic when needs are. Beautiful June Duprez plays the endangered Princess of Basra, coveted by two very different men. Rex Ingram appears in the filming of the massive Rex Ingram. It's a genius with an attitude. <br /> <br /> Allan Jeayes uses his good voice as a storyteller. Miles Malleson is given a different eccentric role than the childlike Sultan of Basra, who always deals with his mechanical toys. (Malleson was also responsible for the movie's screenplay and dialogue). Behind Morton Selten depicts the benevolent King of Legend. Mary Morris, later an exceptional stage actress, plays the dual role of Jaffar's accomplice and the six armed Silver Dancer. <br /> <br /> The film started in Britain, but wartime troubles have caused Korda to move it to Southern California, which probably explains the presence of American Ingram in the cast. The artistry, in vibrant Technicolor, is the most beautiful, especially the fairy tale architecture in blues, white and pink. <br /> <br /> ****************** ******* <br /> Born in Sabu Dastagir in 1924, Sabu was employed the Maharaja of Mysore's stables when he was discovered by Korda's company and was in front of the cameras. His first four films (OLPHANT BOY-1937, THE DRUM-1938, THE DAY OF BAGDAD-1940, JUNGLE BOOK-1942) was his best and he worked out of Hollywood when they finished. After his military service in World War II, he resumed his film career, but for many years he played unlimited roles in ethnic roles in incomprehensible minor films. Black NARCISSUS (1947) is the one big exception. His last movie, Walt Disney's A TIGER WALKS (1964) was an improvement, but it was too late. Sabu died of a heart attack in late 1963, just 39 years old.
