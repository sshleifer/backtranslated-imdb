This movie is one of those who have a sound familiarity with it. It's nice, well-grounded and a movie that makes you think ... and smiles. Paul Reiser and Peter Falk take you on a journey you won't forget. The soundtrack is beautifully varied and appropriate; and the film itself is like a fresh air. It surely deserves recognition for both the film and the actors! Finally, an art that deviates from the obvious love story and the regular special effects seen today. I never walked into my heart out of a movie with so much warmth and sense of thought; because it felt like someone just wrapped it in a soft fleece blanket. To watch this movie is to find a true treasure and delight in it.
