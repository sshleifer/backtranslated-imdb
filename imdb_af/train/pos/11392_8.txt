Paris is the place to enjoy beautiful art and music, and to fall in love with love - as in this movie. Boy meets girl, they fall in love, but something stands in their way of eternal happiness, the classic story. <br /> <br /> The wonderful music of George Gerschwin complements the great dance by Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron. An American in Paris' is a humorous, light, loving film worth watching. <br /> <br /> 8/10 <br /> <br />
