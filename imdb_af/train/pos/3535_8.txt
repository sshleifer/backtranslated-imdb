** WARNING - PROMOTE SPOILERS! ** <br /> <br /> First of all I would like to say that I really liked this game. I gave it to my parents for two months after Christmas. I'm glad I did. <br /> <br /> Firstly, I would like to say that the single player was very good. The first level is probably one of the best in the game when you are at a London festival, and some evil guys ruin it by kidnapping the prime minister's daughter. Of course, you have to save her, and it's quite a big level, but should take you at least five minutes. The best part, and I also think the funniest part is when you're in the jet-pack, and people are knocking off Big Ben. Just provide the jet-pack's most reliable rocket launcher and blow off the clock faces and enemies. Pure fun! <br /> <br /> The rest of the levels are very good but fairly short. There are four mini-levels that you can unlock, and this is one of the lodges, because only the first two of them are actually fun, and the last two to unlock are just "killing 25 enemies' goals, I mean, c 'Mon! We have many points to unlock these missions and the last two bonus missions are really bad! <br /> <br /> The multiplayer, me and some of my friends agree, is very good and challenging, even if there is no clash. Halo didn't have a clash, but it's still some fine multiplayer games! You can be a load of bad guys, and you go against each other, and you can fall, which is the best way to kill people without going to their character. <br /> <br /> Gameplay - 8.5 / 10 (levels can be quite repetitive and bonus commands can be improved). Graphics - 9/10 (there are the strange bad graphics, but it's not very often). Multiplayer - 10/10 (no comment needed, just fine, you can ride in jet packs and vehicles). Sound - 8/10 Repetition Value - 7/10 (the only levels I go to is the London Level and Istanbul Part 1). <br /> <br /> I give this game: 8.5 / 10 <br /> Can have some improvement, but it's still good.
