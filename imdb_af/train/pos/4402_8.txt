Since all Jesse James, Quantrill, jayhawkers, etc. movies were seen in the fifties, it is a thrill to see this film with a new perspective by director Ang Lee. The scene of the attack by Lawrence, Kansas is wonderful. The romantic relationship between Jewel and Toby Mcguire seems to be one of the best parts and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers is outstanding as the bad guy. All the time, this movie makes you feel the horror of war and the desperate situation of the main characters who don't know if they will survive the next few hours. Definitely worth seeing.
