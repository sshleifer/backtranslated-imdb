I saw this movie on the cable last night and it is extraordinary. What I like most is that it is understated and low key, but very sad. Henry Thomas' (he played the child in E.T.) The show is masterfully articulate (he is supposed to be a man with few words). David Straithern is a wonderful crazy villain. And miraculously (since we're talking about a Hollywood product here), a baby serves as a main character, but one that doesn't act or has lines, but rather IS (and is light on it). Interesting to note that Thomas's mysterious relationship w. E.T. was at the heart of that movie; while his band w. The baby serves as the core of a good baby. <br /> <br /> Then there's the music - ah, what music !! Gillian Welch's songs are wonderful and the whole score is beautiful mountain country music. <br /> <br /> This movie is amazingly atmospheric. I highly recommend it.
