It's a very funny (and sexy) movie - it's not just stupid but has a good play. It's the kind of movie where the characters are so entertaining that you feel connected to everyone in the theater. I saw it at the Boston Film Festival, and I often laughed myself out loud at everyone, and also moved through some of the movie's more serious parts. This is a unique movie about two doctors, and I don't want to give anything away, but there are also powerful scenes and fun, and the dialogue is wonderful. Wood Harris's character has a unique relationship with his girlfriend Zoe Saldana, and Brian White and Mya are also funny and sexy in their roles. If you get a chance to see it - go - you won't be disappointed. It's worth seeing again. Wood Harris deserves an award.
