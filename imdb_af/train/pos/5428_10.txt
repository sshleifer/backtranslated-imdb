My favorite "Imperialism" movie and one of the best action adventure flashes of all time. Grant, McLaglen and Fairbanks dominate the screen with daring and clever cracks to please everyone but most "PC" of filmmakers. Memorable scenes are abundant - the 3 sergeants and their 20 screenings are fighting hundreds of thugs; MacChesney & Cutter gives Bobby Coote the speckled punch ("save some for the elephant"); Cutter to MacChesney - "I'm an expedition"; Your sniper out of jail, with a fork ("what do you think I'm trying to break out? A blush pudding?!) And the incredible temple scene with Sutter singing and then annoucing, fat like buyer - Okay, you're all arrested taken! "<br /> <br /> I can go on, but that's enough to say I'm trying to catch this movie when it's going. For armchair adventurers and generals it is difficult to think of a better 2 hours.
