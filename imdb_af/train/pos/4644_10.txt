Right out of the funniest spoof of pretentious home cinema films ever made. <br /> <br /> This movie exposes all the cliches, and then some! Incredibly Bad (Downs Syndrome!) Actors. Terribly self-important dialogue. Scenes that are supposed to shock but fall flat. Jarring editing. Pointless plot points. Everyone wrapped up in a kind of fleshy miasma of lack of respect for the audience and vague soul awareness. <br /> <br /> It achieves exactly what it is designed for. A hilarious satire of the boring movies made by spoiled teen trust funders, to show their parents when they ask them what they've done over the past two years! To "What is it?" received his Cannes award. Aanman Werner Herzog was rumored to have said that the film was actually a spoof, in his own films! He supposedly blew the information. He refuses to discuss the incident today. <br /> <br /> Anyway, watch it and laugh, it will be a classic humor for many years.
