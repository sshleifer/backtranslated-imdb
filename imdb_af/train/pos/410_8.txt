I rented this movie in DVD form without knowing anything about it, part of a winter marathon to watch a movie every night. After several horrible American action adventure films (Ballistic, Daredevil, Cradle of Life), Zhu Warriors hit me as a brilliant original film film. The story is utterly nonsense, but I found the film's sincerity, kindness and complete lack of irony refreshing, and the film looks spectacular. Certainly, the special effects aren't technically as flawless as those manufactured by Hollywood, but the filmmakers are wisely interested in color, composition and movement as realism, and so many of the shots are breathtaking. In one shot, two of the super human characters stand on rock rock muscles, a large moon that emerges before them, the image perfectly balanced by the three elements. In another, a princess-fighter spreads through the sky behind her glowing sword like a heat-seeking missile. And the colors explode from shot to shot, use emotion rather than imagine reality. <br /> <br /> The characters have the same simplicity and directness of characters, and do not offer much depth in themselves, but refer to artifacts that resonate more deeply. Physically, several of the actors are surprisingly beautiful. They play their roles straight, without irony or fraud, and so are credible. <br /> <br /> Very strange to everyone, despite the obscurity of plot and thin characterization, I found myself very close to tears. by the beautiful simplicity of the actors and the wildly original, heartfelt vision of the director. <br /> <br />
