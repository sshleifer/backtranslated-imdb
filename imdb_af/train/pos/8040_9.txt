It will be somewhat short. First, do not listen to the critics because it is not as bad as most say it is! Sniper uses a classic movie formula, which quickly refuses to whistle the movie. While the sniper does not reflect the 100% truth about how our country's military snipers work, it gives those who know nothing of the Professional Sniper a glimpse of the Sniper world. And yes, the movie has many mistakes, but which movie doesn't it? There are many good scenes and good acting by Tom Berenger. I have to say the two worst scenes are at the start of the movie with Billy Zane in the helicopter, followed by Zane in the marine bar scene. The best scene in Sniper is with Berenger in the middle of a field with the opposing force it eats! There are also very good shots of the jungle and some classic shots that use the camera as if you were watching a gunshot. And yes, the Sniper Motto is "one shot, one kill". Judge Sniper for yourself !! <br /> <br />
