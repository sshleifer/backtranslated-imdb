I've seen it a dozen times over the years. I was about fifteen when I first saw it in B&W at the local PBS station. <br /> <br /> I bought a DVD series for the kids to watch and watch. They do not teach history in school, and this explains the most critical event of the 20th century. It expands their critical thinking. <br /> <br /> Accordingly, with all the participants in their own words explaining what they did and why, describing what led to the war and the real war. <br /> <br /> Buy it for your kids, along with Alistair Cooke's America. See it with them and make them understand. You'll be so glad you did it.
