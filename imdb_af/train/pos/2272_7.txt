Nick Nolte gives an excellent performance in Kurt Vonnegut's dark story. Notle plays Howard W. Campbell, who was a dual agent during World War II in propaganda. After the war he lived anonymously until competitive factions wanted to dig his past. As with many of Vonnegut's work, it is a meditation on the absurdity of the war and those who use propaganda for their own purposes. Nolte is fantastic - confident and confident than the younger Campbell, and then broken and pursued as the older man forced to reconcile the sins of his past. (7 out of 10)
