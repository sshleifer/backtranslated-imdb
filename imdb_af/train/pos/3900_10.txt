It is at the top of my list of the most hysterically funny shows I've ever seen. I laughed so hard, I'm sure I missed half of the jokes. It shows Izzard as the brilliant gifted comedian he is. What I really like is that he never "dumb down" the material for his audience. His timing is impeccable and the routine is tied together as a performance rather than just a series of gags. Thumb on the road.
