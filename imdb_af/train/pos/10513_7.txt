If you have any idea about Jane Austen's production, repeat the same in each of her novels: marriage, marriage and marriage! In my opinion, all the films made from her novels are a bit boring, but I like Austen's characters, because they all have a certain personality and typical words they would like to repeat, as in Emma. The thing that makes Emma good is Gwyneth Paltrow, she's very good at her lead. Also, the fact that each of the characters in the movie can't think, but how to become a good partner and get married soon, makes the movie hilarious.
