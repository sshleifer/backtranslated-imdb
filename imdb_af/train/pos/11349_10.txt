This movie may have a dubious pedigree because it's made for TV, but it's one of the best movies I've seen. The film and its actors won several awards. It is alluring, fascinating, and it will completely absorb you. The story that a killer in iron curtain Russia by people who are willing to dare to save their lives from trying to save lives of future victims would be a compelling story if it is fiction - but it seems to be a true story. I highly recommend it.
