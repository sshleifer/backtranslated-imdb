Sure, this movie is not historically accurate, but it is great fun. Most DeMille photos, especially the later epics, are slow and plodding, but the action here moves to a clip. The story is basically a series of peaks with very few quiet moments. The action takes us from an Indian attack on a cabin; one of the best parts of the movie with Jean Arthur excellent while trying to satisfy the war-painted natives. This is followed by her and Cooper is taken to the war camp and tortured. Later comes a protracted battle with the Cheyenne. The whole thing is ridiculous but fun and fun from start to finish. Jean Arthur is one of the best actresses of this era and she shines here.
