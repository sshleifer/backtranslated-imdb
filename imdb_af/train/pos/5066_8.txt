I know some people think the movie is boring, but I don't agree. It is a biography of a very complex and extraordinary person. I love the characters in the movie and think that leaving parts of Archie's life caught a mystery from his humanity. I don't think the purpose of a good biography should be the details of someone's life, but rather the complexities and relationships that make them interesting. And what's more fascinating than someone who has rediscovered themselves so successfully? "Men who dream they are - you dreamed well." Good work for Lord Attenborough. I also wanted to mention that Nathaniel Arcand really exhibited me as a charismatic actor and I hope to see him in more movies.
