Probably the first Portuguese movie I've seen in my life, and I enjoyed it. The plot is related to how the young army officers used the power in Portugal in 1974 to eventually defeat Caetano's fascist government and to finalize the wars in the colonies, Mozambique, Angola and Guinea (Bissau) - Cape Vert. Most of the events shown in the movie reflect the behavior of the army officers and soldiers to maintain the coup of the oppressed people. They were very happy with this new development and freedom, the resistance of Caetano's men and also in a subtle way of most conservative officials, including Spinola, who took over as the new president. The Portuguese revolution can be remembered because of the actions of several young officials, but to me the most interesting part of the film was when the young captain expressed that Portugal should develop itself democratically. And so the country achieved a few years after this coup. or revolution. The film also shows that the army officers and soldiers never wanted to kill anyone; even the most serious enemies were respected at the end.
