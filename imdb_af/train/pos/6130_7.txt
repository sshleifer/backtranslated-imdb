Surprisingly good. The play was fun, the script was fun, the music was cheesy fun, the plot was great fun. It was a fun movie to watch and give your brain some rest. Parts of the plot and quotes I found very creative. 7 out of 10. Actually, for what it was, it would earn a 10 out of 10. It's not supposed to compare it to an arthouse movie or a bloody slasher movie.
