Full Moon High (1981) 3 out of 5 Dir: Larry Cohen Stars: Adam Arkin, Ed McMahon, Roz Kelly <br /> <br /> Tony (Arkin) is your average high school person. Preparing for the big home game, girlfriend problem and hair growth in strange places? You know the usual. But the hair in strange places gets a bit out of control when a trip to Transylvania with his father (YES! McMahon) leaves him with a bad case from the fur balls. Now doomed to run the world forever as a werewolf, how will Adam get any girls? <br /> <br /> "Full Moon High" is not often spoken, but it is a stupid and entertaining horror poem. Larry Cohen (Q The Winged Snake, The Stuff) contains as many gags as he possibly can as a writer / director. Arkin (H20: Halloween, 20 years later) shows good timing in the lead. If you're a fan of spoofs like 'Airplane' and 'Student Bodies', I think you'll have fun with this chuckle festival.
