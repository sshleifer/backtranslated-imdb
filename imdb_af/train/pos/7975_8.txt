I just love Malle's documentary programs. They are so effortless and simple, but still so fascinating. I have no idea why this documentary works. It's about Glencoe, Minnesota. There live 5000 people and nothing happens. But Malle still manages this fascinating and interesting. His love for mankind, even racist or homophobic people, is so overwhelming that you can only help but also fall in love with them. <br /> <br /> Malle filmed most of it in 1979. He returned six years later to see what had changed. It would be a good movie without the material 6 years later, but this little addition makes it wonderful. It may seem that Malle just did what was done in the Up series, but it really isn't. The Up series is about people. Malle's emphasis is not so much on what happened to every person, but what happened to this community. And the change is wonderful. 1985 is the Reagan era and farmers suffer. Once a proud community, no one sees much future and parents hope their children will train themselves and do something other than farming. <br /> <br /> This documentary document is very relevant today. Our financial crises started today because of what happened. Just look at these last words in the film, spoken by an older town attorney (in 1985): <br /> <br /> "Well, I have high expectations for this country because the things that are right Now I can only be characterized in my mind as an obsession with greed, and a nation does not live long with that obsession, and especially a democracy that ... There is good - there is good - very good in this country and lots of good people and they are not going - they are not going to subscribe to this philosophy of greed that is now going on. It's terrible. "<br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it has over 20 years and a hell of a headache before it happened.
