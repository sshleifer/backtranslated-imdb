What a fun b-movie! Shepis is absolutely beautiful and the scarecrow is clear and original. He really brought me back to the 80's monsters. The budget is, of course, low and not everyone is Pacino behind the lens, but it doesn't matter because it never takes seriously. From the trailer discount redneck to the high flying martial arts moving from the scarecrow, this is truly a b-movie gem. Grab some refreshments, snacks and some friends and kick back and relax. I enjoyed this movie so much, but I bought 3 Scarecrow movies. Sure, they are not for everyone, but for everyone their own. Sometimes you just have to lie down and smile.
