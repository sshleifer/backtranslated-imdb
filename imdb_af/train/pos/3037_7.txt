The movie "MacArthur" starts and ends with genl. Douglas MacArthur, Gregory Peck, Alma Mata, US Military Academy of West Point on the Hudson. We see a weakened 82-year-old Gen.MacArthur gives the opening speech at the 1962 graduation class which is an honor to serve their country. The movie then goes back to Gen. in an almost two-hour flashback. MacArthur's brilliant as well as controversial career that began in the early spring of 1942 in the darkest hours of World War II on the beleaguered island of Corregidor in the Philippines. <br /> <Genl. MacArthur, for the first time in his military career, almost obeyed a direct command of his US President, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Dan O'Herlihy. Feeling that he would leave his men on his biggest hour of distress, MacArthur reluctantly did with his wife and young son, which he had just told him to haunt him for the memory of the war. This was the reason why his escape was under fire from death or imprisonment by the Japanese. General MacArthur has already used his influence to get FDR two years later to start a major invasion of the Philippians instead of the island of Formosa. supports his promise to both the Philippine people and the thousands of US POWs left behind. That he will return and return with the power of the American army and fleet to restore his promise! <br /> <br /> In the two years until the invasion of the Philippine Islands, General MacArther, Japanese forces have overthrown the southern Pafiphia in a number of brilliantly wrecked island battles, which have isolated and starved hundreds of thousands of Japanese troops in surrender. The general lost that suffering far less American military than any other allied commander in the Pacific War! <br /> <br /> It was in 1950/51 in the Korean War that Gen. MacArthur won his most brilliant victory as well as his worst military defeat. After the survival of the North Korean army was brilliantly and perfectly executed, with the invading US Marines carrying less than 100 victims, back door or left-hand invasion of Inchon Gen. MacArther felt invincible, leaving the US / UN forces under his command. border, along the Yalu River, of Communist Red China. Tell his subordinates that he is facing the threat of a massive land attack by communist Chinese troops. General. MacArthur did in any case push until the attack cut American and UN forces into ribbons. The unstoppable wave after the attack of Red Chinese troops forced the US / UN forces to leave their lives in the "Big Bug Out" of 1950 and leave all their equipment, across the North Korean border, even to leaving the South Korean capital. from Seoul! It appears to be one of the greatest military disasters in US history, while US forces lost a record in the Korean War, 1000 lives on the first day-Nov. 29/30 1950-Communist Chinese invasion! <br /> <br /> Shocking and humiliating in what he allowed, mainly due to his own arrogance, to happen MacArthur did not go on the offensive against the advancing Communist Chinese and Non-Korean forces but his own commander and head Pres. Harry S. Truman, Ed-Flanders, not in the mood to do what needs to be done: Start a full-scale invasion of Communist China with nuclear weapons if necessary to prevent its troops from overshooting the Korean Peninsula! For Pres. Truman, who has just enough pleasure from genl. MacArthur had in him, shaking his mouth in public, how he abused the war not to carry out everything MacArthur wanted him to do. Against the Red Chinese it was the last straw! On April 11, 1951 Pres. Truman has the Gen. MacArthur has been forced to serve as commander-in-chief of the US / UN forces in Korea! Pres. Truman's courageous, yet very unpopular, decision did not, with MacArthur's total war strategy, break a Third World War to break out with the ally of the Soviet Union Communist China, which at that time had the Atomic bomb like the USA! Pres. Truman's controversial decision to shower the popular MacArthur General, also re-elected him in 1952, with his polling numbers so low in the middle of the 20s - which he withdrew in March of that year - from the US presidential campaign! <br /> <br /> In Gen. MacArthur's accident was there when the political and military climate in the world changed in how to make future wars. With the horrors of a nuclear war in 1950/51, a reality would have been as a national suicide to go all out, like General. MacArthur wanted, against the Red Chinese with the possibility to run a nuclear holocaust Not only the American USSR & Red China but the whole world! This was the important reality of future war that gen. MacArthur has never been taught, as the A and H bombs have not yet been invented, in West Point. <br /> <br /> Back to 1962 we can now see that Gen. MacArthur, after concluding his opening speech at West Point, became both a parent and wiser soldier, and since his retirement from the US military, older statesman in his feelings about war and its total futility. One thing that genl. MacArthur was taught at an early age, is of his civil war, general father Douglas MacArthur Sr, who has kept him alive for him, that war was the last, not the first resort in establishing a soldier like not himself. issues between nations. By doing so, it is the soldiers who have to fight and die. It has a lifetime, with the arrival of the core age, for gen. MacArthur took to realize how right and sensible his father was a congressional medal of honor, as he himself was!
