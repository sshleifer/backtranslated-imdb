Theo Robertson commented that WAW did not properly cover the conditions after WWI, which led to Hitler's rise and World War II. <br /> <br /> Maybe he missed the first ONE and a quarter HOURS volume 8? Cover this period, and along with previous volumes in the series, clearly shows the existing conditions I feel. A friend of mine grew up in Germany during this time, even joined the Hitler Youth, and his experiences were very similar to those mentioned in WAW. <br /> <br /> This documentary is so far above the history channel's documentary programs. own, that there is no comparison. <br /> <br /> The only mistake, and it's a small one I have with WAW, is this: the numbers aren't included many times. For example, if you are talking about loan leases, how much war material has been borrowed / rented? How much to Russia, how much to Britain? How many merchant ships did the U-Boats sink, and when? How many ships did the German or Japanese fleet have in total in 1941? What type were they? How many troops? How many troops did the allies have in total and by country? Many numbers could make many viewers nod, but I would have preferred it more! And of course I always want to see more military analysis. Like Why did Patton & Clark not catch the German army that was in Cassini after they surrounded it, instead of driving Monty to Rome and escaping? I don't think you can begin to understand war until you have seen these video segments on "total war", such as the Dresden fire bomb. It's like Auschwitz, etc. To understand before you see the cuts of the death camps: you can't just turn your head around - it's too incredible. <br /> <br /> Unknown at that time, and of Course, onfilmed, were the most ominous atrocities and inhumanities of the Japanese, including cannibalism, (read "Flyboys"), and some live vivisection of medical "experimentation" "prisoners, without any anesthesia! <br /> <br /> Dave
