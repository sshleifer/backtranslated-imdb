Whether they are three guys in their whites that are bound to a man bound in a rope or a girl, who says, "What, dog?" to a piece of roadkill, there is something, please, everyone in Knuckleface Jones. It is strange and surreal and not quite a perfectly understandable yarn ... but it never loses you. The first time I saw it, I almost laughed at me. And every night after that I would come home and look again. Forget Coyote Ugly ... this is the movie that my beloved on Piper Perabo confirmed. See it ... before it's too late!
