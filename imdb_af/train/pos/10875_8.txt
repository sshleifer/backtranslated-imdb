Australia's first mainstream movie film hits the screen with a bang. And a sting. And a cut. And a shout or two. And lots of blood, fear, red herring and lots of laughs. <br /> <br /> In fact, there are many of the first surrounding Cut - this is Dave Warner's first script produced, though he has several other options. or in negotiation; it is the first major film by director and former Hoodoo Guru Kimble Rendall; And this is also the first film for producer Martin Fabinyi. And for a lot of guys who are baptizing their toes for the first time in this genre, they know their stuff. <br /> <br /> Cut tells the story of a bunch of Australian film students who have a treasure movie, Hot Blood, it's never finished, because his director, Hilary (Kylie Minogue), was murdered by the actor who soul killer playing in the movie. <br /> <br /> Despite their lecturer (who was assistant director at night, Hilary died), they warn that when someone tries to die again from Hot Blooded, director Raffy (Jessica Napier) and producer decide Hester (Sarah Kants) to continue and complete the film. They put a crew together and get the original star, Vanessa Turnbill (Molly Ringwald), to return to Australia - in fact, to the original place - to complete Hot Blooded? 14 years after shooting closed. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's a slasher movie, lots of blood loss, etc.? long with lots of laughs, some good scares and a rocking Aussie soundtrack. Cut shows that Australia can make a good, mass-market horror movie just as good as Hollywood. <br /> <br /> It's a finely crafted feature, with excellent special effects, a solid plot and a killer - Scarman - it's a welcome addition to the ranks of Michael, Jason and Freddy.
