Carter Wong plays a noble hero on a quest for a book of healing that leads him to ultimate revenge! The pacing is good in this movie and there are many battle scenes to keep the movie. The flying guillotines look bad and the main villain has no problems using them. Although the story is not strong, the action is fun and you pull to the end (which I feel could have continued). <br /> <br /> Nice and dark, it's great, oh school kung fu !!
