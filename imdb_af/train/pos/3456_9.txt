There is no such thing as perfect murder. Lieutenant Columbo knows this. Franklin, who is the other half of the detective storyline, doesn't know it. He killed his partner, Jim Ferris, who had plans to go solo. Now Columbo enters the picture and asks all sorts of questions from Mr. Franklin. And give back for another question. Columbo: Murder by the book (1971) is directed by young Steven Spielberg before his time of celebrity. Steven Bochco wrote it. Columbo is a fantastic character with his clumsy look. It is hard to believe that this man can solve any crime. But he can. Each and every one of them! Peter Falk is the only person in the world who can portray this character. So no remakes. Please. This part is a great example of how Columbo worked. Jack Cassidy plays the killer and Martin Milner plays the victim. Rosemary Forsyth plays the victim's wife, Joanna Ferris. There is something special in the scenes between Columbo and her. How to make the omelet and everything. Barbara Colby plays Lilly La Sanka. She actually met a tragic fate when she died after a murder she did. I was a fan of Columbo since childhood and I still enjoy watching. There was a break for many years that they didn't show Columbo stories at all, but now he's back. Bake for another question.
