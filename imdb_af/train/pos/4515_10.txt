That movie is absolutely fantastic !! Looking at your friends can be a great day. Obviously you need to know that the movie is foolish and very badly directed and acted (Tomba / Unziker a few), and it's probably the worst movie in the world, but you can really enjoy it. We watched it in 19 and it was a great evening. The best screens are the first, when the criminals kill Alex's friend and he tries to work like a despair and the result is a comic scene of the first category. And when he showed Leva (Antevleva, who's a name) the "Palassio di giusstissia", and then the accident of Leva, which once went off the road, and a second later the car was completely empty! What a magic!
