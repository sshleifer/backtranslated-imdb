A girl's folly is a kind of half-comedy, half-documented look at the mid-1910's movie business. We take a look at life in an early movie studio, where we experience the compilation of a set, run through a scene, deal with lovers of film fanatics, even lunch with the commissioner. We are also busy with little known films. For example, did you know that "Popular movie actors do not know the plot of the picture in which they work"? <br /> <br /> The plot of this film is essentially film star Kenneth Driscoll's discovery and romance of an emerging young starlet he discovers while being shot in the country. I believe the 30-minute version I watched was shortened, included on the same band with Cecil B. De Mille's "The Cheat." It's a very credible movie - an easy watch with a big rope of extras. As a bonus, it includes some of the best illustrated captions I've ever seen with a silent movie.
