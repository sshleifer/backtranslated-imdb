Remain the Limerick: <br /> <br /> If a man can come back from death <br /> <br /> And live in a little girl's head <br /> <br /> Vengeance he will Get <<br /> For the murder he met. <br /> <br /> By the man who is now in his wife's bed. <br /> <br /> For me, this is a highly subordinate, classic episode that is part of what the X-Files defined to me before I started watching it. I saw some segments before when the show was first started and I was too young to see it like parts of The Jersey Devil, but I remember especially that this episode is considered an 11 year old and completely astounded by the scene. where the guy is killed by the bus and then the hypnosis scene with the girl. I tell you I couldn't sleep for weeks! For this reason, the episode has a special aura about it now to enjoy the creepiness factor I've grown since. It's enough to let me pass some of the obvious flaws in the plot, such as why the girl had to wait until she was 9 before her previous life spirit really started to rectify his revenge. Or what she did just sat on a bus in the middle of the night. You'd think her parents would be concerned. And maybe they are, we just don't really see that part of the story. And was there with the telekinesis? Unlike adding the really cool Carrie factor to the already fiery story, there was really no good explanation for that. But even with its small flaws, it's in my mind a classic episode and has little or no reason for me not to like it. 10 out of 10.
