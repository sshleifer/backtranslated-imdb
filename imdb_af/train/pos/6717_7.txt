This documentary was very thorough and exposed, and at the same time entertaining, which I thought was quite impressive. I felt as though they had a good job about the sport from its origins to the present, but yet there is a reason why I do not give such a high score to this movie. <br /> <br /> I felt that the story at times focused too much on the "proper nouns" of the sport, so to speak: too much in individual places to navigate, and especially too much on individual surfers. I felt as if the documentary had more to do with the nature of the sport, the ideology of the sport, and so on. It would have been better (although of course it was covered, I don't think so much time needs it). <br /> <br /> And for many people who aren't completely upset about surfing, they can sometimes sow and hear about specific places and specific surfers. Although the video clips and the in-depth research are well respected, it could be presented in a way that would be better for those who are not avid surfers. <br /> <br /> Also, my biggest disappointment at times was talking about how totally wonderful and wonderful events in the navigation history were, but they didn't unfold the real footage of these events and all the while waiting for the silver screen this amazing, breathtaking event that these men talk about life-changing moments, and ultimately you only get many people talking about it, not the real footage. It was annoying for me to hear these stories and not see them. I understand the trouble of getting footage of everything, but please: don't boast an event, and then don't show it. <br /> <br /> Overall, a lot of fresh documentaries I enjoyed watching; Not the best documentary due to the above reasons, but very fresh and with a lot of exciting footage and a good soundtrack. This is a documentary that I recommend to everyone to check out.
