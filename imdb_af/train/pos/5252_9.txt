When I heard about this movie, it had to be the funniest thing I've ever seen. Yes, it was funny. I mean, I loved it all till the end where ........... Oh no I can't tell you, have it for yourself. It's funny except. The vulgar language. That's why I say if you like movies that are funny in a funny way, watch it, but if it's not your money to rent or buy it.
