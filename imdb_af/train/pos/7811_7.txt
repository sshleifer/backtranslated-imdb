Steve Biko was a black activist who tried to resist the white minority-regulated South Africa, in the same way that Gandhi tried to resist the British empire's colonialism in India. Richard Attenborough's film Cry Freedom is not about Biko or Apartheid as much as it is about Donald Woods, the white liberal newspaper editor who endured his life trying to tell Biko's story. The film has a critical point-of-view switch after Biko has jailed in prison for uncomfortable behavior in the hands of the South African "police". Woods, played by Kevin Kline, has to choose whether to do the right thing and flee the country to publish books on Biko or print his wife, played by Penelope Wilton, to acquaint him with the books. In that case, Biko died in vain. What begins as a life-changing friendship between Biko and Woods, degenerates into a standard by escaping the numbers across the border yarn after Biko's death. Oscar-nominated Denzel Washington is good at only his fourth film as Biko, but something is wrong in a film that is trying to portray the apartheid struggle by focusing more than half of the film on the trials of a white family. Attenborough would have served his topic better by focusing on Biko's rise to prominence instead of starting where Biko spoke to Woods. Maybe a black actor in a leading role in a 2 1/2 hour movie wasn't exactly conducive to a big box office, but the movie was a huge box office anyway. Aside from film politics, the film is still entertaining and sending a message or two, though, in PG-purified fashion. *** of 4 stars.
