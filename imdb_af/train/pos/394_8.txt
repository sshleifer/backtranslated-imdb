It's an incredible return from the film director mastermind, Tsui Hark. It's one of a few movies that deserve a face-to-face match for Steven Chow's Shaolin Soccer. From the moment the movie started, there was an astounding backdrop on every edge that was <br /> <br /> laid out with beautiful style. If you are a science fiction or Chinese martial arts geek, you will love the excessive amounts of many 3D effects and realistic computer-generated weapons. There is a good thing (as always) of Ekin Cheung playing "Sky King". He teamed up with Louis Koo (Red). I was very impressed with his flexible "wing" that turned off incoming attacks. The fighting movements of these actors were skillful in every way. Not only is the action fantastic, but it has a somewhat complex story. Many critics of this movie complain about the lack of story / theme or just "slashing" and even describing "The Legend of Poo". However, the viewer cannot rely on Dragon Ballz and other similar Manga Cartoons to understand this movie. Others who are fussy with "Wu Xia" movies will have a better choice. With respect. There can be a weakness that can be provided. The blow that was delivered to the enemy on the last battle theory could be made more material and devastating. Despite this, it must be a must see.
