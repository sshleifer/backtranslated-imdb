I just looked at Roll and what a pleasure it was. Toby Malone's performance really stood out. I found out about what's happening to Matt in the whole movie, which is a lot of fun, very much with a good mix of well-rounded characters. time. There are also very good twists throughout, which will make you guess until the end. Other characters to watch out for are the totally insane Tiny and the sneaky attractive Jesse. It may not have the big budget of a Hollywood group, but don't detach it, you can do much worse than checking it out, you won't regret it. Good fun. 10/07
