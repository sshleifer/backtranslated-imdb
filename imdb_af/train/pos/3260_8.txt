People call it a comedy, but when I just watched it, I only laughed once. <br /> <br />. I think the problem is that I only saw it when I was 14, <br /> <br /> and I wasn't old enough to understand that it wasn't meant to be taken seriously. There were quite a few scenes that were meant to be funny, but I looked too much at the characters to laugh at <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> I suggest watching this movie next time you fall in love <br /> <br /> and try to take it seriously. I think you will find that, despite some faint <br /> <br /> errors, this is one of the most moving love stories you've ever seen.
