This film looks in many ways 'Enemy of the State' with Will Smith and Gene Hackman, as we have run an innocent (black) man by government with all the modern technology known to man. Usually when the storyline is copied like this, the result is a disaster. This does not apply here. Of course, I love everything David Morse does, so maybe my comments are not fair, but there were more good things about this movie. The main bath, played by Doug Hutchison, was brilliant, and the story flowed with exquisite extras such as David Paymer and Robert Pastorelli. However, our hero, Alvin Sanders (played by Jamie Foxx), was the biggest part of the game. He is so out of place, cracks bad jokes, without sympathy from the audience. Or not to start with, the strange thing is that it grows similar to you (and also to its followers!). I didn't expect much when I rented it, but was surprised with a good solid action movie with comedy pieces. 10/07
