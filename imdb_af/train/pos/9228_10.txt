To see that another Nunsploitation movie with an average Mother Superior is being abused and tortured, Flavia is much more than I expected. <br /> <br /> It actually has a feminist story, though I don't think such a term exists in the era in which the movie was introduced. This was definitely not practiced. Women (and the Jews and the poor) are much nurtured and locked up in many places in society. Sister Flavia (Florinda Bolkan) experiences throughout her tyranny of her time until she can just sit there and do something about it, even if it is disastrous. <br /> <br /> The pre-credit sequence has Flavia as a young adolescent near a battlefield. She sees an injured "evil" Muslim soldier (one of the few still alive) and tries to help him. Before she could, her hate-filled father held the soldier and waved his head in her face (great family dynamics, huh?). Then her father forced her to join a monastery where she experienced even more injustice. Although scenes include violence, rape and nuns, I will consider it more of a historical drama than Nunsploitation. <br /> <br /> Indeed, many of the ingredients for a trashy exploit are there, but the acting, camera work, storyline and music are too good to keep it on the level. Most of the "non" movies I have seen usually have the basic premise of: A good girl somehow windy in a monastery, where Mother Superior is a supreme bitch who likes people and / or their life makes a living hell. br /> <br /> Flavia spends much of the first part of his film passively questioning all the atrocities happening around her. Much of her passivity is forgotten when she likes the strong (but slightly lukewarm-like-like-looking outside like me, but it's much easier for guys). Sister Agatha. When a group of Muslims attack their abbey, Flavia and Agatha do not reconcile in fear like the other nuns. Their attackers actually work as their liberators (from the cruelty and near slavery of the abbey). In fact, it's a Christian, not a Muslim invader, who is very dear to Sister Agatha. <br /> <br /> It's Agatha's death that sends Flavia on her violent crusade against those who have suppressed her. Her father treated her like dirt. Her Muslim lover ruined her at a very unrelenting time. I don't want to spend too much of the rest of the story, but be prepared to be shocked, devastated and sad. It's a good movie, so don't be fired as a trash on its (undeserved) reputation. Plus, how on earth can a movie with Florinda Bolkan and Claudio Cassinelli go wrong? I'm not familiar with Mar√≠a Casares' other works, but Sister Agatha is a character character. <br /> <br /> I've read very good reviews of the Synapse version, but I love my German X-rated Culinary DVD copy. It's not anamorphic / 16: 9, but actually has a bit more picture information on all sides than Synapse's release. <br /> <br /> And there are also very good, wise or funny dialogues (lots of Sister Agatha) <br /> <br /> "Why is God male? The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit? are all male! " -Flavia <br /> <br /> "These guys are scared-looking at them, Sister - afraid their power will be taken away from them!" SR. Agatha (regarding Christians fleeing after Muslims arrive) <br /> <br /> "Woman, where are you going? The Muslims can't do anything to you that the Christians haven't done! Ha Ha Ha!" SR. Agatha (to a group of fleeting Christian women) <br /> <br /> "Lord bless these Muslims - To make fear in these turbulent Christians." -Flavia <br /> <br /> "Is it just the naked eye of a Muslim to help you make your underwear?" SR. Agatha <br /> <br /> Closing message: "Flavia Gaetani, not yet a Muslim - no longer a Christian - was punished as a runaway nun. The idea for the film came from events during the Musalman incidents from Italy occurred In what is still remembered today as THE MARTYROM OF THE 800 AT OTRANTO "
