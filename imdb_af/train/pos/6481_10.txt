I saw this series when I was a kid and knew the details it went into and never forgot. I eventually bought the DVD collection and that's just how I remembered. It's just how a doco should be biased and factual. The movie material is incredible and the interviews are fantastic. The only other series I found to be equal is "The Deutschen Panzer". <br /> <br /> I just want Hollywood to sit down and watch this series, then they might make some big war movies. <Br /> <br /> Note. Band of Brothers, Saving Private Ryan, Letters from Iwo Jima, Flags of Our Fathers and When Trumpets Fade, Some That I Will Recommend
