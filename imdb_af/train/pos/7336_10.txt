This is another fantasy favorite of Ralph Bakshi; after I saw it on YouTube. In the distant past after the ice age, it is a prehistoric sword-and-magic quest between good and evil. Nekron, Lord of the Kingdom of Ice and his mother Queen Juliana, have set their desire to conquer the famous world. When their glaciers were destroyed, the village of a man named Larn, he (Larn) vows to avenge his people and kill the Ice Lord. Meanwhile, the underworld followers of Nekron and Juliana, Firekeep's King Jarol's sultry daughter, Princess Teegra; but she manages to escape and finally meets with Larn, who promises to return her to Firekeep; If the submensor doesn't even find them. <br /> <br /> This movie did very little box (like most of Ralph Bakshi's films) but became a cult classic, partly for the quality of art, a collaboration between Ralph Bakshi and the famous fantasy artist Frank Frazetta. I also heard that the script was written by Gerry Conway and Roy Thomas, the two men who did Conan's storybooks, and the background painters included James Gurney, the illustrator of the Dinotopia novels; although I never read Conan or Dinotopia. And also the painter Thomas Kinkade, who is for his artwork for figures, music boxes for The Bradford Exchange Company, in addition to paintings. And like Bakshi's films The Lord of the Rings and American Pop, this film is filmed, but the process works better in this movie than in the previous one. <br /> <br /> Overall, I think it's one of the best animated fantasy films ever made, and a great collaboration between two great thoughts - Ralph Bakshi and Frank Frazetta. With lots of fantasy, sexual innuendo and exciting adventure.
