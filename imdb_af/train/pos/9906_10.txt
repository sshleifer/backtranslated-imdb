Yeah, the plot is hardly credible and very thin. Yes, the acting varies from average to laugh. Yes, it has been done so many times before. But what we are dealing with is a film that does not keep away from these facts and pretends that it is nothing more than it is. There are indeed some original death scenes and the tension rises throughout the movie. In addition, you are never more than a few minutes away from a gory kill. I encourage everyone to see this movie with an uncontrolled eye and see it for what it seems to be; a scary, funny slasher flick with a theme song for no one.
