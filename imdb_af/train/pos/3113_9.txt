The Bourne Ultimatum - Jason Bourne (Matt Damon in his best role ever), the latest spy kid on the block, ends his quest for his identity as he also ends the CIA's latest "Blackbriar" program to make super-murders. like himself. <br /> <br /> I was so psyched for this one that I looked at his predecessors yesterday and today. Identity was as brilliant as I remember, and Supremacy remains the weak (but still enjoyable) link in the worst-plot chain and, apart from a car hunt that easily leaves the movie of the movie, little in action and excitement. <br /> <br /> High boy, has Ultimatum tension! Even if you know that Bourne will escape the authorities (and son makes these movies so inactive), it's still brilliant to let him do it. It is surprising to think that two men with handguns and mopeds can create 10x more tension than the $ 150m giant robots in Transformers did. <br /> <br /> Get it to Paul Greengrass, who shoots this idiosyncratic style of documentary, even though he is filming characters that are far from ordinary, in places like CIA headquarters where no one within 10 miles will be allowed a camcorder. He listened to my various complaints with Supremacy, as the performance in Ultimatum is nothing less than awesome, with various tools used as weapons to be a candlestick, a hardcover book (I'll never see it again not an electric fan (don't ask). The music also helped to generate a lot of tension, and there was hardly a moment to keep up with nail bites. <br /> <br /> The play is good, and the evolution of Julia Stiles' character "Nicky" has her situation in a new highly sympathetic light. Damon plays his signature role with reserve but skill (which looks smaller, but it really looks like Matt Damon can evade the CIA and Interpol), but noticeable moments of poignancy if he's still struggling to find his humanity. This longing for her real life can be boring, and almost done in the Supreme, but only works better in Ultimatum (better script). <br /> <br /> I am reminded of a scene in "Goldeneye" (the only good Pierce Brosnan Bond movie) in which Sean Bean's character James asks if the martini ever screams all the men he killed , keep quiet. Bourne deplores all the people he killed, and (or at least he has) the meaning of action without purpose, life without meaning and how government has transformed people into resources. However, resources that Krav Maga knows and can make weapons out of anything. <br /> <br /> Sidoteek: It's always bothered by me, despite being a superspy and hunting by the CIA, Interpol, and the police almost everywhere he goes, that Bourne never thought of even the Smallest efforts to disguise its features or create some new passports. Sunglasses maybe? <br /> <br /> If you have a pulse and love action movie, Bourne is Ultimatum for you. Hell, it's probably the best action movie to come out this year. Of course, you would be a fool to see it without first looking at the other. It's similar to a touch near the end, but I almost feel tempted to think about it. This is the first "3" movie this summer to at least agree, if not exceed the original, and say something. <br /> <br /> A-
