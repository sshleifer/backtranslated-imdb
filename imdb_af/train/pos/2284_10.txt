It's a lot of chilling, and for the most part, a thoughtful drama. I am very impressed with the movie, not just for the plot and wonderful acting, but that such a unique movie was made. Most movies that involve a spy or a war are filled with a spoken Briton or a mighty battle, but not that. It's not about this kind of war, it's about the war between a man and his position in life, an American spy in Germany, who will be a supporter of an evil that no one will ever forget. When the war is over, Campell thinks he will come home as a hero, but his true heroic attitude must remain a secret government. Back to America, Campell meets Nazi supporters as well as Nazi haters and offers interesting conflicts, both internally and externally. Nolte pulls more than the roll, and fits the plot very well for what it asks.
