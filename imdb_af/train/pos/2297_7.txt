There is something about every "Hammer" movie. I see it really takes me in a new fantasy world. In the world of "Hammer" movies anything can happen. "Guardian of the Abyss" is one of those types of movies. This adventure deep into the occult and hypnosis to bring another kind of horror fantasy. All in all, a memorable movie. 7.5 / 10.
