I saw this movie on Thursday night after a very boring day. I had no expectations, those I had were quite negative. Because the only movie I've ever watched for Jimmy is the American version of taxi with Queen Latifah (?) ... don't ask why! But seriously .. this movie is so cute! Drew Barrymore is always sweet, but I almost fell in love with Fallon's character. Why can't I meet such a cute nerd? :) Movies like this are excellent. Simple, sweet and necessary. Sunday on a Thursday. I'm not even a sports fan, but it's something about American movies with baseball that interests me. Probably the fact that we don't have the sport here in Norway. <br /> <br /> (My first comment ever.) Haha
