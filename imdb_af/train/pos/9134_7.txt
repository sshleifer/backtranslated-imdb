"Purple Rain" has never been a critic's darling, but it is a cult classic - and deserves it. If you're a Prince fan, it's for you. <br /> <br /> The main plot is Prince who sees his abusive parents in himself and falls in love with a girl. Believe it or not this movie is not just singing and dancing. There are many intense scenes and it is heart-warming. Sometimes it comes down, but if it works, it really works. Very hit and miss. <br /> <br /> No one can really play in the movie. Everyone is one of Prince's acts like "The Time" and "Vanity 6". Yet it adds charm to the movie. When Prince is ever on the screen, he lifts it up and it's fun to see him at his commercial peak. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, look and see it if you like Prince like me. If you are not a fan, it will make you one.
