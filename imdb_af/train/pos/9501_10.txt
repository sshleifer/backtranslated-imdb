I saw this movie when it was released and when I was 12 years old. And I still remember the wonderful scenes of how the hero / heroine escapes each time it's in danger. And the best feature of the movie was the portrayal of the villain! I think many so-called action movies have copied many "escape scenes" from this movie !! And it doesn't impress me just when I see such copying, it always increases my appreciation for this masterpiece! :) The lead actors performed great. The slow and realistic development of chemistry b / w the hero and heroine was portrayed in a very natural and wonderful way. As children, we felt that the love they developed was very natural. The way they face and overcome all their trials and tribulations is something that even children can realize what the value of true love, sacrifice and caring is. I recommend that each person see this movie when he has a chance !! --Vijay.
