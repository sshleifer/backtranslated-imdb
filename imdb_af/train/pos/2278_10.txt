Mother Night is one of my favorite novels and will see it. I was expecting a great disappointment. Instead, I have a film depicting the irony, humor, peer and especially the crushing sadness of Vonnegut's novel. <br /> <br /> It's definitely Nolte's best preformance to date. He captures Howard Cambell Jr.'s defeat and restraint. consistent from the subtle intonations of his speech to the retracted tears behind his eyes. <br /> <br /> Alan Arkin is absolutely hilarious like George Kraft. Sherryl Lee is haunting her debauchery from reality as Cambell's young lover. John Goodman is underestimated and more than effective as Cambell's "Blue Fairy Godmother". <br /> <br /> This Pinnocioesque story from Cambell tries to be his own ideal hero and unknowingly becomes his ideal tragic villian, a mature and lively look at what we as humans are. And it's also one of the most romantic movies I've ever experienced. Cambell is the incarnation of both foolish and wise love. And at the film sastifying painful conclusion, he finally learns what it means to be a real boy, as his Bloufees grandmother gives him his wish. And he realizes ... Well, look at the movie and you will see. <br /> <br /> In my mind, Mother Night is one of the best movies ever made in my mind. This is a beautiful poetic story that digs deep within our emotions and is completely true to its original author.
