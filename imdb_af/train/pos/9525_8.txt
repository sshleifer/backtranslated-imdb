ROAD TO PERDITIVE can be summarized by Thomas Newman's score. It is haunting and beautiful, but you are aware that this music is similar to Newman's other work and while listening to the soundtrack, you are reminded of SCENT OR A WOMAN, MEET JOE BLACK and THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, you are reminded of other movies than the story unfold on the screen. As the Sullivans ride through America, trying to escape a psychotic hit, you think of THE GETAWAY, Irish gangsters are MILLER'S CROSSING while the subtitle of guilt and redemption can be summed up by Coppola and Leone's gangster epics. In spite of all this, it should not be seen as a serious criticism of the Sam Mendes movie I repeat, it is haunting and beautiful. The only flaws in that work are a very slow opening of twenty minutes and I am slightly confused by the events that have caused Michael Sullivan to be betrayed. But if you stop thinking about how much of a sentimental mess Spielberg made possible with the story of a father and his twelve-year-old son who is running for their lives, you can't help thinking what an excellent director Mendes is. no. <br /> <br /> ROAD TO PERDITION is a movie where the entire cast acts flawlessly. I have never been so good at Tom Hanks, but he is both so good here, because he's in any lead, probably better. Paul Newman plays a character with an Irish accent, but at no time did I think I had an American screen legend that dropped a false accent. Newman's performance is due to the subtle body language, his character owed by guilt, but Newman never milkes it or goes over the top. Although Newman does not perform best in the film, the two Brit supporters Craig and Law are also very memorable as American gang members and while Law still has a long career as a leading actor, one wonders how Daniel Craig is a character actor if he did not decide to become James Bond, a role to repeat the end of an actor career
