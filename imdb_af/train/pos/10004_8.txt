It's not the comic Robin Williams, nor is it the curious / insane Robin Williams of the recent thriller celebrity. It's a hybrid of the classic drama without over-dramatization, mixed with Robin's new love for the thriller. But it's not a thrill. It is more of a mysterious vehicle with which Williams tries to locate a sick boy and his custodian. <br /> <br /> Also with Sandra Oh and Rory Culkin, this Suspense Drama pretty much plays like a news release until William's character gets close to reaching his goal. <br /> <br /> I have to say I was very entertained, though this movie does not teach, guide, inspect or entertain. It felt more like I was looking at an old man (Williams), since he was really acting from a third-person perspective. In other words, it really felt, and I could endorse the prospect of the story. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's worth a watch, although it's definitely not Friday / Saturday night pay. <Br /> <br /> It amounts to 7.7 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> the Enemy :.
