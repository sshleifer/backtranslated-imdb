"How to lose friends and alienate people" is an entertaining, if lost, adaptation of Toby Young's memoir of the same name. It's also a good title to help fill out the line requirement in IMDb reviews! The basic core is the same as the book with certain incidents dramatized, but a romantic plot is added and the end is definitely Hollywoodised. Simon Pegg, despite playing a substantially annoying person, is his usual sweet and funny self and carries the movie very well. Strange to think just a few years ago, he was just a TV sitcom man and now he rubs shoulders with Hollywood names. There is a good supporting role and it is an entertaining, easy look - kind of a male 'Ugly Betty', but funnier.
