Wow it was a movie was quite fascinating. I couldn't believe I woke up so late to see it, but it got late. I started looking, I couldn't stop. It had a whole host of very good members. Wow, even Eartha Kitt and Ruby Dee Forrest Whittaker and James Earl Jones and many more famous actors and actresses. It was more than a glimpse into history. It was eye-opening in another part of society that people don't know and can even be ashamed to talk about. I have never heard of a book or movie about this and this is something that black history never addresses, but just look down because they were private and mixed race, I recommend this movie.
