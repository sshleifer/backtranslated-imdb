Rock 'n' Roll High School was one of the best movies ever made! I think the only reason it was so wonderful was because of the Ramones! You couldn't have made the same movie and put something like the Sex Pistols, or The Clash in place of the Ramones, it just wouldn't have been the same. the young, clint howard, Vincent Van Patten, Mary Woronov, Paul Bartel, and the saddle fitters, just added to the movie. The whole movie is about the Ramones ... especially Joey! So everyone saw the Rock 'n' Roll High School if you were a big fan of real PUNK. Not the sissy new crap ... but the hard and fast kind. The kind just could do the Ramones. R.I.P (Rest in Peace) Joey Ramone 1951-2001. Dee Dee Ramone 1952-2002!
