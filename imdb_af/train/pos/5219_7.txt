Gere and Danes die as two workers for the Public Security Department who are keeping pace with liberated sex offenders. Gerds playing Babbage refer to them as his flock. Gere is an exaggerated venture on the way. He is training, new coming Allison, to take over his job. Gerds see his herd as very sick, hidden puppies. He asks them questions that are not on the list and tries to act like police and solve crimes. He is still being warned of this behavior, hence the reason why he is being replaced. During his last few days at work, a young girl goes away, and Babbage is sure it's one of his herds that got lost. He and Allison cut down a list and discovered that some of the offenders had gone AWOL. So, he decides to find the missing girl rather than help the police. That part is a bit far-fetched. <br /> <br /> There are some sick, distorted things shown in this movie. Like when Babbage and Allison go to this building where a lot of sick people disturb one another. There are also the people who kidnapped the girl. At the end of the film we see what sick freaks they are. However, I will not mention this movie excessively, because not much is shown on film. <br /> <br /> FINAL THROUGH: If you like thrillers and movies about serial killers and cops chasing killers, you'll love it.
