I remember walking to Spain after 25h00, getting a lift, which seems to be, two brief Italian little crooks. They did a lot out of the law, but on the other hand, a small portrait of Jesus in the bag for their protection ... just and unfairly, well and badly, criminally and correctly where in a new combination outside the categories that I knew. "Les Valseuses" gives me, although a movie and not real life, a picture close to my own experiences: the intensity of every moment as you leave behind and go for the most important thing, whatever your path, it is another state of mind and also "dangerous" form of life, because as we all know, there are people who are not ready for this and are willing to persecute you for "stealing" and so on. This film touches 'values' it's a story of 'what's right and wrong': morality. This is the resurrection of the individual who frees himself / herself from the "false morality" and conformity. There is danger all the way, because how far can you go with your own 'freedom' and cross your own moral boundaries and those of other people? What to do with people who are prepared to hurt you, put you in prison or even shoot for the things you do, such as stealing a petrol from a multinational oil company for your fifth car? Les Valseuses make these questions wake up in me again, because morality, unlike the usual 'media message', is very complex ...
