If you have lived through the years 60, this movie can sometimes be painful and other times a lot of joy. That's all there, but the small print in the counter-culture tabloid is common at the time. These are the roots of a social revolution that still spells out: "Don't talk too soon, because the wheel is still in spin, for the times they are changing." While the film focuses on the revolutionary nature of LSD and then distribution, it only played a tremendous hand in the evolution of the intelligentsia, which influenced engineers, scientists and aid in hyper-development of computer-related activities. A salute to the filmmakers of one there - you caught the era better than I saw before.
