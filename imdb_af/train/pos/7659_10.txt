I just watched this movie, which upset me a lot. There were also twice in South Africa, around the time this movie was set. <br /> <br /> It's certainly hard to beat, and the opening scenes tend to set the scene. The slow, but steady increase in pace does not make it easy, and there are certainly few light moments. <br /> <br /> Never again will Nigel Hawthorne see again. He came as a distorted individual, and I found myself no longer presenting him. <br /> <br /> Totally agree with Steve-thomp's articulate and thoughtful comment.
