Almost a masterpiece. Not so well written. Beautiful cinematography, I don't think. This movie wasn't too terrible, but it wasn't much better than average. The main story about highly immoral teenagers had to be more focused on the forbidden romance and why it was ... really got it instead of scratching the surface with basics "because mom says we can't." Some parts had to be completely dropped or processed to be more important to the fate of the two main characters. Several times I wondered if the author / director was a fan of George Lucas' classic American Graffiti. Not that it is wrong to be a fan of that movie, but sometimes to make your movie look like, I come up! The worst part was that Madchen Amick had such a small portion, I mean double coming on !! She was the only one, in one or two lines, who actually tried a southern accent. (Take a good listen, it was there even though her character was from California!). Perhaps if she was the star, others could have followed and we would have had a more authentic sounding movie. Oh yes, what can you do if you have a director who is just a director and not an artist. Sorry. Overall, I give it a B and it's a bit generous because I'm partial to me. Amick.
