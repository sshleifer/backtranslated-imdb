I was one of the many who expected to see a glorified, Yankee doodle dandy depiction of a day (quoted as known) in weakness rather than glory. How wrong I was. These guys were there, right in the middle of it, and the photos they returned were wonderful and heartbreaking. And yet it all took place on a retreat to the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. <br /> <br /> Two French filmmakers have a documentary about life as a NY firefighter, especially from the perspective of a young newcomer coming through the ranks. At first we see a lot of these footage, just to remind us that there was no thought to make a film about terrorism. It was meant to be a film about regular people who earn a living to help others, and the beauty of the movie is that it never loses this edge. <br /> <br /> While a suspicious gas line is being investigated, I think memory is a bit furious about it, we suddenly hear an airplane flying overhead. The camera pan to reveal a commercial jet that torpedoes in one of the towers. What should the cameraman think of at this time? The FDNY allows the camera to follow it in the building. The following is a true view from the front lines. We see the dedication of the FDNY, their reactions (the astonished silence after the first person heard after death, is cold) as well as the collapse of one of the buildings inside, while a second camera is the events of the outside. <br /> <br /> If it wasn't for the horrible event they were covering, the footage would only be a young doco maker's dream. Quite simply, the images deserve to be preserved forever. But what really sets this film apart is the real humanity that brings it to the viewer. We see firefighters unleashing, helping people of different races to escape each other to ruin and even the concerns of the filmmakers (they are brothers), as they cannot reach each other in confusion. There are wonderful attractions as well as wonderful human stories in this movie, something Hollywood can never duplicate (though it tries). <br /> <br /> 9/11 is not a movie about politics. It is also not a film about religion, nationality or even jihad. 9/11 is a film about people, and a true indication of the best and the worst we are capable of. 9/11 is just one of the most important movies I've ever seen, and would be the only movie to be born from this event if it was for me. You can't duplicate it.
