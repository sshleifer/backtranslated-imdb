Val Kilmer and Dylan McDermott are great. I saw Kilmer on The Doors, but his interpretation of John Holmes is wonderful. Nothing compared to Boogie nights that were so slow. Wonderland is a movie that allows you to show you a terrible crime story from the perspective of a guy who is only welcomed in his drug-custody and stands by what ever happens. At the same time, the John Holmes character shows a very clever hustler who is able to move through the most beautiful and ugliest situations almost unharmed. The movie has been watched more than once. The seventy ambience sensual and full of drugs is wonderful.
