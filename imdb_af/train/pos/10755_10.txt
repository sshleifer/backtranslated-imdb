Great documentary on the lives of the NY firefighters during the worst terrorist attack of all time. The reason is why it should see a collector item. What shocked me was not just the attacks, but the "High Fat Diet" and the physical appearance of some of these firefighters. I think many doctors will agree with me that, in the physical form in which they were, some of these firemen did NOT make the 79th floor that would carry more than 60kg of acceleration. To say this, I now have a greater respect for firefighters and I realize I'm becoming a firefighter, a life-changing work. The French have a history of making big documentaries and that's what it is, a great documentary .....
