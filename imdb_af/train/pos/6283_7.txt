As much as I like from great epic pictures - I will save you the namesake - it's great to kick back with a few beers and a simple action movie sometimes. Movies where the plot takes a back seat to the pieces. Movies where the dialogue is not so clever that it connects itself in endless buttons press. There are DOGS of movies that fit the account ... but in my opinion Gone In Sixty Seconds is one of the better ones. <br /> <br /> This is an update of the movie that shares its name. It also shares the ethos of the picture, but not quite. Whatever the original was, was streamlined. Whatever is streamlined, is also enhanced by a larger budget. Often these kinds of efforts are recipes for a complete disaster - see the nasty-ugly repetition of the Italian Job for one who has blown it - but here, thanks to a cast of mostly excellent actors, Sixty succeeds. <br /> <br /> The plot and much of the dialogue is not much to write IMDb. Often you have scenes where the same line of dialogue goes back and forth between the actors, each one having a different voice. Many people found it irritating; I find it raises a smile. Every actor gets a chance to show his or her definition of style here, with Cage, Jolie and Duvall leading the pack of course (and it should be noted that it is also amusing to not see Mrs Pitt first here ). The chemistry between the good o 'Saint Nick the stalwart (see date of review) and Angelina leads to some nice moments. <br /> <br /> The villain is not even a bit scary - I have seen Chris Eccleston roll hard before, so I know he can handle them, but I think he is deliberately aimed at making his role inconspicuous not to distract from the action. We know that the heroes will somehow succeed; We just sit with them in the car and enjoy the ride. I think many of these scenes have been played in the cheek so far that they have crossed the minds of many who give it a poor rating. In fact, I wouldn't want some four-walled beetles at the camera. It's just that kind of movie. <br /> <br /> All this style and not so much dust - something that often leaves my patience out, if not done * just * so - would be worthless if the action wasn't there. And for the most part it is. So wonderful. I noticed that it seems to be a common tendency to use quick cut extreme close-ups to do these days right. Personally, I find this kind of thing exhausting. I prefer movies like this where the stunts are impressive enough not to use artificial tension, by raping fast shots all the time. I said that Cage actually did so many car booths as he could get away without losing his assurance (in real life I mean - his character doesn't care) and showing it. The man can really move a vehicle and it is well used in the slow burning climate final where he manages a Mustang in the most unpleasant and fine way. <br /> <br /> So yes, this movie is not an "epic, life-affirming post-9/11 photo with compulsory social commenting" effort. The pacing was uneven, some of the screens cut and not all the actors dragged the line. But motorcycles rarely come better than that. So if you hate cars ... why do you read this comment? <br /> <br /> I will take over the many iterations of "The Flaccid And The Tedious" any day. 10/07
