This show started with great mystery episodes. I think everyone is in the first 15 or 16 episodes. Then the show started playing short episodes with Shaggy, Scooby Doo and Scrappy doo. <br /> <br /> I think Hanna Barbera Productions had to change 20 minute episodes into short episodes. Some of the voice actors have become unavailable. After 15 or 16 episodes, Frank Welker (who played Fred) did not become available. I think Velma's voice changed to the first 12 episodes, because the first voice actor Velma played was not available. <br /> <br /> And the network ordered the Hanna Barbera studio to make more shorts with Shaggy, Scooby Doo, and Scrappy doo, because the ratings were high. They had to make shorts. I wish they were riddles like 15 episodes. Yet it is a good performance.
