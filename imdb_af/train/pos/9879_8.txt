Lily Mars offers Judy Garland one of the easier roles she had at MGM, because Lily Mars is definitely a character she can identify with. A young girl with talent enough for ten, she knows she needs to make it into the theater, no matter how many producer Van Heflin discourages her home town. <br /> <br /> I really liked Judy here. one like the girl determined to make it into the theater. Because it is Judy Garland with the talent of Judy Garland, you know in the audience that she has the right things, even though Van Heflin almost convinces the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Both Judy and Heflin hail from the same small town, Heflin's father was the city doctor who delivered her and Heflin while moving away and becoming a big producer on Broadway. Their respective moms, Fay Bainter and Spring Byington, kept in touch. This is her predecessor, but Heflin has constantly been bursting with stagestruck kids, but never someone like Lily Mars. <br /> <br /> No real big song hits from Lily Mars presented to Garland, although she has all her songs. The best thing about the movie is a revival of that glow-era chestnut brown, every little movement has a meaning of its own. Judy sings it with Connie Gilchrist who plays the cleaner in a Broadway theater where Heflin's performance is produced. Gilchrist was a star in the days of the FloraDora Girls and she and Judy deliver the big-style song with Connie. It's the best scene in the movie, as Gilchrist encourages Judy to stick to it. Composer Karl Hoschna has been dead for a long time, but text player Otto Harbach was still alive and I was waiting for him to hear what he had heard. <br /> <br /> European musical star Marta Eggerth is in the presentation of Lily Mars as the show's star who is initially bemused, then angry and finally, understanding Garland and Heflin. She did some movies with MGM and then returned to Europe for more work on the continent. I'm betting. MGM didn't know what to do with her and her thick Hungarian accent, though Louis B. Mayer never met a soprano he didn't like. <br /> <br /> Van Heflin does well like the patient producer who draws a lot from Garland and Eggerth. Heflin came out of his Oscar last year for Johnny Eager and he and Garland will not be an ideal screensaver, but they are not bad together. <br /> <br /> The presentation of Lily Mars is a fine. showcase for the talents of Judy Garland. And she didn't have to share the screen in another back-up movie with Mickey Rooney.
