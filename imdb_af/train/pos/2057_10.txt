There wasn't a day in 2002 where I wasn't scared by a scarecrow. I felt this movie had a serious problem. <br /> <br /> It brought back many memories because it was so realistic. <Br /> <br /> Even today I have nightmares over maize on the bat, and can't even touch near the cans, in the fear of my life. <br /> <br /> I must admit that, at one point in the movie I had to turn it off because it was too close to the house <br /> <br /> For those of you who have never been through a scarecrow has been attacked, you can watch this movie about how it felt to us victims <br /> <br /> This film teaches us not to make life obviously or to waste with wheat, believe me I'm there and I have the scars. <br /> <br /> Watch the movie, its wonderful and educational
