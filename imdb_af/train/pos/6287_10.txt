gone in 60 seconds is a very good action comedy movie that has made over $ 100m, but has been blown by most critics. I personally thought it was a good movie. The story was credible and has probably played the biggest role ever for this kind of movie, including 3 academic award winners Nicolas Cage, Robert Duvall and the very hot Anjolina Jolie. Unlike the lame stunt at the end, it is a perfect combination of action comedy and drama. my count is **** (from ****)
