While I'm not a big fan of music, I loved the movies of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers because they're just as much fun. Sure, they can be a little formal, but even if you know what is going to happen, they are still very pleasant to watch. Nevertheless, I was a little disappointed in this trip. Part of it was because this movie didn't have the wonderful supporting role you saw in TOP HAT or we would dance. Without Edward Everett Horton or Eric Blore, the movie seems a bit lacking - especially in the "fun" section. The stupid antics of these supporting actors gave the other movies charm that you just can't get with FULLY THE BIRTH. In addition, unlike the usual character played by Astaire, this one is more of a while. Like his fat head, Rogers is still in trouble. And as a result, it's much harder to keep him or see them in the end of the movie. Plus, although the music is by Irving Berlin, the songs do not seem so memorable. In fact, none of the songs was so special and I can't recall either, even though I just saw the movie. While it's still a cute and valuable movie, it just has the sparkle and magic of some of their other movies. Good but far from big.
