Maybe "Presque Rien" wasn't the best movie ever made ... But it's better than many of you said. I still haven't seen a gay-themed movie better than this one. <br /> <br /> You Americans are used to watching many narrative movies, with a clear beginning, development and outcome. But European movies are less telling, but let you think and feel a lot. Many of you didn't understand the meaning of the movie. The purpose of this one does not show us a simple summer not loving movie ", with commercial characters" falling in love and staying forever. "Summer Holidays and Beach is just a backdrop, and this movie is aimed at every young boy which can be identified with those boys. <br /> <br /> Perhaps some of you didn't understand this movie well because of its 3 parts, shown as flashbacks, these 3 moments are: - Summer time in Pornichet , when they meet and love each other - After a year and a half week in Nantes, Mathieu does not attend a psychiatrist himself, trying to take suicide, and Cedric brings him to hospital, and later appears with a psychiatrist to Talk about why he did it - The last part is when Mathieu comes back to Pornichet in winter alone to think about how his life has changed, how his life has become and trying to find himself. <br /> <br /> It is possible that some people may not understand everything well not, because all the screens are mixed among them. But anyway, as I said earlier, it's not a funny movie. If what anyone wants to see is meat, for that we have Belami movies. <br /> <br /> Presque Rien, which we want to show, is how cruel life can be for a young boy who isn't sure. about his feelings and not sure about what to do in life. Mathieu just wants to leave home and try to live the kind of life he thought could bring him happiness. But what was perfect in the beginning is not as good as he thought, and he is upset and feels that he has lost his way of life. He is lost and does not know what he really wants to do, or what makes him happy. He eventually becomes depressed and tries to commit suicide. <br /> <br /> So, funny? Is not a funny movie. Many hot scenes? just a few .. but it's not a movie for entertainment. Everything is about feelings ... friendship, love, happiness, unhappiness, pain, depression, loneliness ... I, like many others, feel identified with Mathieu's life and problems, and that's what director wanted to do. movie that shows us the cruel reality of a boy's life. <br /> <br /> For me, the best gay-themed movie ever.
