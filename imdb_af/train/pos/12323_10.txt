This is the best Chinese movie I've ever seen, and in my opinion much better than Hero of Chrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. The movie is a unique combination of several genres: it's a beautiful love story, action movie, comedy and horror at the same time. And the most wonderful thing is that it really does succeed! <br /> <br /> This movie definitely makes me top 5, and should be enjoyable for every movie lover. The action sequences have the traditional unrealistic jump and even fly, but the way it is shot differs greatly from the Hero style and the flying always looks good and usually even makes sense (spokes can fly) <br /> <br /> See this movie, you won't regret it. 10/10
