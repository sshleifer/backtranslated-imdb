Ideal for families with small children who are looking for light-hearted, non-violent movies that are exciting for the child and amusing though, quite curly, for adults. Not a bad movie for a low budget work. Children will be amazed at the Santa's workshop and the "magic" that will allow them to get houses through chimneys that look too small or homes that have no chimneys at all! <br /> <br /> Children will be excited about Santa's success at The nasty devil called Pitch (addicted to classic red outfit with horns and tail!). They will be sympathetic to the poor little girl whose greatest desire is to have a little doll to love. And the poor, little rich boy who just wants to spend time with his eternally absent parents. And what kid does anyone know at school, which is just like the nasty boys used by Pitch to help catch Christmas and ruin Christmas? In the end, everyone, including the nasty boys, just gets what they deserve for Christmas! <br /> <br /> The movie will bring children to both Santa and the message of love he gives to people all over the world. /> <br />
