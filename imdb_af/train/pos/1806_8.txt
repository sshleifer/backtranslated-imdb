I wish children's movies were still made so; dark and deep. There was (get this) character development (and Charlie is the hallmark of the dynamic character), plot development, wonderful animation, emotional engagement and a rational, related and consistent theme. If it weren't for the handful of song and dance routines, you would never have thought it was a children's movie, so I'm giving it such a high rating. This movie is a great movie, let alone a children's movie. This brings me to my second point: it must be the darkest "kids" movie I've seen for some time, it comes from a 22-year-old. I would be shocked to not scare a child under the age of 8 for half of the last half, and from the first half of the movie, and it ends with one of the saddest endings you can ever overcome (ala "Jurassic Bark", for those of you who are Futurama fans), and it makes this movie so good. Just because the movie evokes universal emotions, we do not normally feel and accept that it is bad, the film does not hurt; In fact, this means it has succeeded. Good, funny movies are supposed to make us laugh; good horror movies are supposed to scare us; good sad movies are supposed to make us sad. My point is, good movies are supposed to move you, not just entertainment; This movie moved me. <br /> <br /> This film is also incredibly violent by today's standards for a children's film and contains subject matter that may not be suitable for some children today. Parents, I want to see it first. I am usually not one to say something about this kind of thing, but I saw it yesterday and it even came as a surprise to me.
