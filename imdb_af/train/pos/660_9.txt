9/10 to 30 minutes pure holiday terror. Okay, so it's not that scary. But it's certainly fun. <br /> <br /> The Crypt Keeper (John Kassir) tells a story of holiday FEAR, gives us all the Christmas Goose ... GosseBUMPS This is. Bwahahahahha. You really have to be careful about what you are Santa Santa. Have a terrible Christmas and a Happy New Fear. Okay, I'll stop. <br /> <br /> Good, so in the story, a greedy woman (best screamer in the world, Mary Ellen Trainor), killed her husband (Marshall Bell, the coach who gets a towel killed in ANOES 2) for the money. BUT, her plan is ruined when a crazy killer is dressed in a Santa suit (Larry "Dr. Giggles" Drake) comes her way. <br /> <br /> If you watch it on YouTube, you can watch it for free, but most of you have seen it (my third view). But if you haven't seen it, I suggest you do it.
