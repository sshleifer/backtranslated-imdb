<br /> <br /> I have to admit that I enjoy bad movies. I love them, I look at them all. Particularly scared. My friends and everyone gather after a hard week at school and work, rent some crazy tapas, order a pizza and explode. One of the ones we got from Hollywood Video was this one, Zombie Bloodbath. This one had a big box, so I expected less than usual. <br /> <br /> The story is about a housing project built over a nuclear facility that had the above ground low bulldozed, and the other underground layers are simply covered. The inhabitants of this area find the covered facility when some children fall into a hole in a cave. It wakes up a few zombies. <br /> <br /> From now on, it's a piece of city. The gore effects and action never stop until the final credits roll. <br /> <br /> OK, it's not a good art, but one with the ruthless dialogue and the top horrible stuff was our favorite of the evening. Actually, it was one of the best party tapes I ever had the pleasure of watching. And you can say it's done no money, with a lot of crazy people. There are hundreds of zombies, and the director looks like Brendan Frazer (he has a cameo) and it's just a wild journey.
