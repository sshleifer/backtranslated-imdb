The institution and actors make this television movie the best version of Dickens' classic story. George C. Scott is very credible as the rest of the cast. She screams the screams until the end of the movie. Then his character changes to one that is truly repentant. The 19th century English town chosen for the environment creates an atmosphere that suits Dickens and adds to the likelihood of this movie. It's a movie I see with the real Grinch every Christmas and it's a wonderful life.
