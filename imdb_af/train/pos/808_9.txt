I just wish the return of the Jedi, by someone else, I mean, there are far too many ewoks scenes, totally unnecessary. Besides this time our heroes look like different people: Princess Leia no longer fights with Solo, Luke looks boring, Darth Vader is not as angry as before, and Yoda just dies. <br /> <br /> But there are many extraordinary things. go to this episode I just can't hate. <br /> <br /> ANY SPOILERS 1- Jabba the hut 2- The Sail Barge attack order. 3-The emperor (now it's angry) 4- The Speeders are chasing the end forest. 5-The Last Battle. 6-The Dark Side Seduction Scene. 7-The return of Anakin to the good side of power. 8- And the last celebration. <br /> <br /> Some of them are so good that they can bring tears to your eyes. If some scenes were cut and another director hired, it would have been so perfect as episodes 4 and 5, but it is quite exceptional. 9 out of 10.
