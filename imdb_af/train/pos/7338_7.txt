Fire And Ice is an animated film found in a fantasy world. The film is about a town destroyed by a giant glacier. This is the home of evil lord Nekron. The only survivor of the town is a young man named Larn who avenges those killed by the glacier. The ice glacier moves through the land of fire and the princess of the country named Teegra is kidnapped by evil creatures. Larn proposes to find her and to find and kill Nekron. Fire and Ice is directed by Ralph Bakshi, who is one of my favorite adult animators. He brought us such animated masterpieces as the movie version of Fritz The Cat and some movies he wrote himself, like the big movie Heavy Traffic. I didn't like Fire and Ice as I had Ralph Bakshi's other work, but I still found the movie to be enjoyable. It had some nice animation in parts and the story was enough to entertain. The only basic complaint I have is that I wish there was more of a story on the film, because the story it uses is very thin and there isn't much. I also wish the movie was a little longer, as it was less than 80 minutes running. Yet it is an entertaining action adventure film that, unlike Fritz The Cat of Heavy Traffic, is suitable for children 8 and older. I just wish there was a more developed story and it went a little longer than it did.
