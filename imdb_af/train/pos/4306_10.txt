The mere fact that I think about the movie for another decade is what really talks about the film. For me, it supports Grand Canyon as a movie that somehow touches you. I really believe that before the movie Crash there was Grand Canyon. The big difference between the two films is, I think, the timing of their release. I'm not going to argue which one is better, but I think the idea is that they share the same message. I'd like to hear from those who have an opinion on this topic. I'll start a comment you can find at http://www.myspace.com/62229249. You can also find me there to share any other topics about movies we may share, because I have a real love for film.
