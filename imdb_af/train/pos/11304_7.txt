I'm not sure under what circumstances director Visconti decided to film James Cain's novel "The Postman Always Rings Twice" (I don't even know if Viscounti got the rights to the book), but the resulting movie is definitely interesting . This is not the best version of Cain's story (I love the 1981 version best), but thanks to Visconti's excellent direction and Clara Calamai's and Massimo Girotti's (a very sensual couple), it's a must be for noir fans. Visconti mixes neorealism with noir sensibilities to great effect. However, the movie is not perfect. My biggest complaint is that the movie is a bit too long for its own good; The story moves at a very slow pace (I don't think Visconti was very good at modifying his movies). I think movie noir works better with a short running time. Fortunately, Calamai and Girotti are magnetic actors who are interested in the viewer. Anyway, as much as I like about this movie and the remakes, I don't think anyone made the definitive version of Cain's much-priced book.
