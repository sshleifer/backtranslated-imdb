My dad grew up and watched George Reeves as Superman and when I was a little kid, he had episodes on VHS and let me see them, including this movie (past them in the family if you want) and I love it. <Br /> <br /> Clark Kent and Lois Lane are sent to a small town with and the oil mine and the mining radioactive, and targeted by the town is deadly and this is to Superman for this chaos to stop. <br /> <br /> It's just as wonderful and fun to watch. The old style special effects and sound - the crew pulled off such beauty with so little technology. George Reeves was my hero when I was a small child, and I am now 16, it just goes to show how timeless and classic these adventures are.
