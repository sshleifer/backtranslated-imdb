It's not an easy movie to watch - it's over three and a half hours long and consists of conversations. Yet it is so incredibly compelling and mercilessly observations of the human character, that it is one of the best films of all time in my humble opinion. <br /> <br /> The movie is depressed, cynical and cruel. (If you want something encouraging, see Jacques Rivette's fantastic Céline and Julie Go Boating, made about the same time). It shows the idealism of the late 1960s to be nothing but society trying to change it. <br /> <br /> It includes a so-called liberated ménage-à-trois between Alexandre (played by Jean-Pierre Leaud), Marie (Bernadette Lafont) and Veronika (Francoise Lebrun). Yet Alexandre is shown to be as chauvinistic and jealous as any other man. The women are exposed as willingly subordinate and define their femininity by the male look. <br /> <br /> The movie is a very icy end to the highly revolutionary French New Wave. This movement was one of the most important movements in film history and had a profound effect on the film as we know it. Jean-Pierre Leaud was one of the key actors of the New Wave, who, among others, in the influential Les Quatres Cent Coups (1959) by Francois Truffaut as rebellious teenager. Director Jean Eustache is not as well known as other New Wave directors, but he should be. <br /> <br /> There is no improvisation (unlike John Cassavetes' similar films made in the US) and the dialogue comes from real-life conversations. The film is resonant with Eustache's personal experiences. For example, Francoise Lebrun was a former Eustache lover. Eustache himself committed suicide in 1981 and also the actual person on whom the character Marie was founded. The anger and bitterness all culminate in a disturbing monologue by Veronika, delivered directly to the audience, breaking down the cold objective nature of the rest of the movie. This fascinating, personal and honest cinematic statement remains one of the most revealing films of human nature.
