It is a strange, cerebral, surreal, esoteric film. If there is something like an "intellectual horror" festival, this movie is it. I started to get scared and wanted someone else to look at it, and it hardly got a plot! I have to see this movie several times before I feel I really understand it. If you are the kind of person who likes "My Dinner With Andre" and movies of Godard, or if you do a lot of thought-changing drugs, you will probably enjoy this movie. Wow.
