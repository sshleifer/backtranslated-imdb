Esther Williams gets her first post-MGM lead and starts off with a good start <br /> <br />. This movie is a well-activated entertainment choice <br /> <br /> with a mature theme repeating a million times <br /> <br />. Esther <br /> looks good and if she wants to, would probably have gone <br /> <br /> more and better movies, but according to her autobiography, <br /> <br /> has pretty much stopped working for marriage. Anyway, she is so <br /> <br /> enjoyable and enjoyable to see her in a totally different role outside the "swimming music". Universal was fantastic for <br /> <br /> making movies with former MGM stars after the studio began <br /> <br /> dropping its biggest names when it started turning down. Stars <br /> <br /> such as Lana Turner, June Allyson and others have made the quality of the first <br /> <br /> quality films at Universal, as they obviously still had power at <br /> < br /> the box office. I wish Esther made more, but since she didn't, <br /> <br /> makes this one even more special.
