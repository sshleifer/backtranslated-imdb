I really like the first 2 seasons. because many good characters later disappeared. As most shows are, it's pretty slow, then it gets better in later seasons, but it's the absolute reverse. Jenny of the 1st season and Valarie of the 2nd season were Sabrina's friends, I really didn't care about the others, Jenny and Valarie were her coolest friends. For some reason, I think the producers wanted us not to have some reason for her colleagues. They were so cruel for Sabrina. but my favorite season 1 episode is a cartoon and my favorite season 2 episode is witch waste, this is the funniest episode. I also thought it was funny how Libby was popular, but she was always jealous of Sabrina, and never had a real boyfriend, but always wanted to be with Harvey. I just wished they could have made it better. I also liked how the first two seasons, during the opening credits, would say Sabrina a few words while wearing a costume, as in the pilot's section where she was in the witch costume, I liked how she said "It's not me" and later on she tried to change herself to something else, which I think, but it's a very cool show. It's a bit like the andy griffith show in a way, because it was good first, but once it got color and barney fife left, it was longer good. but I still like to see it, but the only reason I look at seasons later is because of sabrina. What I meant about the opening sequence is: The opening titles of the seasons 1-3 show Sabrina in front of a mirror that positions with different costumes and outfits, as the names of the cast members flash quickly at the bottom of the screen. In the end, Sabrina would say a kind of pun associated with the outfit she wears, then disappear. the season four opening series calls the characters. The opening credits of the 5-7 seasons include Sabrina in different locations in Boston
