Initially I thought the Ring would be a more than normal movie with its usual plot. How surprised I was! Of course the plot is simple: one girl is in love with two men - but Hitchcock brings it to us on a silver dish, with laughter and fear, with compassion and anxiety. The way he shows the popular crowds of the fair, the strength of the girl's appeal to both men, the tragic elements that come together with techniques that make up most of his biggest films (North-Northwest, Ropes, etc.) . The master made it big before his thirties!
