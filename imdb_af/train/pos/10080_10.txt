In the rapid economic development of the 1990s in China, there is a revival of traditional Chinese culture, partly due to the rise of nationalism, accompanied by the increase in wealth, and more importantly due to the sense of spiritual fittings following the collapse of the old socialist ideology in the post-cultural revolutionary era. <br /> <br /> However, the revival of Chinese traditional culture, Confucianism, was not without disaster, as Chinese adopted the whole tradition without eliminating the bad part, and the discrimination against girls in this film is an excellent example. <br /> <br /> Not only should the discarded part be inherited, the good part that is supposed to be inherited, such as the traditional opera, and its technique, such as changing face, is in the revival ignored and confronted extinction. <br /> <br /> The director used this film to solve the problem of re-embracing tradition by contemporary China, which is the deeper meaning behind the movie.
