This low budget erotic thriller has some good points but much worse. The plot revolves around a female lawyer who tries to clean her lover who is accused of killing his wife. Being a soft core film means she is interrupted at a strip club and has sex with possible suspects. Like plots go for this kind of genre, not too bad. The writing is okay, and the story makes sense for someone at 2:00 to see it not to see too many plot holes. But everything else in the movie looks cheap. The main players are not that bad, but pretty much all the fans are incredibly bad (one girl looks as if she is drunk and / or tall). The cinematography is badly lit, with everything that looks grumpy and ugly. The sound is so terrible that you can hardly hear what people are saying. The worst thing about this movie is why you watch it - the sex. The reason why people see these things is for hot sex scenes with very hot girls in Red Shoe Diary situations. The sex scenes are not hot, they are messy, shot in that porn style where everything is just a two-man masterpiece. The woman also looks as if they are going to a porn shooting house. I don't try rude or mean here, but they all have breast implants and a burnt / weathered appearance. Even the title, "Deviant Obsession", sounds like a Hardcore flick. Not that I have nothing against porn - in fact I love it. But I want to separate my soft core and my hard core. What ever happened to actresses like Shannon Tweed, Jacqueline Lovell, Shannon Whirry and Kim Dawson? Women who can act and who would raise you altogether? And what happened to B erotic thrillers like Body Chemistry, Nighteyes and even Stripped to Kill. Sure, not one of these true masterpieces, but at least they felt like movies. Plus, they pushed the envelope, past Hollywood's relative prank posture on sex, sexual obsessions, and perversions. Now they just make hard-core movies without the hard core sex.
