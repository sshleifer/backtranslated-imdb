Cosimo (Luis Guzm√°n) is told about a perfect hoist in prison. Since being behind bars and not doing it himself, he must leave it to his girlfriend, Rosalind (Patricia Clarkson). Sun there are five guys who organize the crime - five guys with very little brain capacity. Brothers Anthony and Joe Russo are the directors of Welkom at Collinwood (2002). This is a crime comedy that is often very funny. You can't help but laugh when everything goes wrong with these guys. There are some good actors playing these characters. William H.Macy plays Riley.Isaiah Washington is Leon.Sam Rockwell is Pero.Michael Jeter is Toto.Andy Davoli is Basil.Gabrielle Union plays his love interest. Michelle.Jennifer Esposito plays Pero's love affair Carmela.George Clooney (also producer) plays Jerzy, the tattooed guy in a wheelchair. It's a highly entertaining movie. I definitely recommend it.
