It's a slow moving story. No action. No crazy tension. No sudden surprises. If you can't stand to watch a movie about two people who just talk and walk, about a story slowly evolving and about love-dovey novels, don't waste your time and money. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, if you are in a dialogue, masterful storytelling, ideas that are thought and true love in the dust of life, this is your movie. I recommend watching this movie when you are most alert, because the pace, the music and the overall tone of the movie can put you in a woolly mood. It's really fantastic. I really mean it. <br /> <br /> Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are sometimes irritating in their ways, but thankfully, the chemistry between the two makes the play very natural, warm and gentle. They work and feel from the beginning so you feel like an intruder. <br /> <br /> In their conversations, there are excellent comments on many subjects that will spark thoughts and conversations between you and your partner. I thought it was too deep and too diverse for such young characters, but I can underestimate their intelligence. Yet it didn't ruin the movie. <br /> <br /> The overall story is very simple that I think the movie gives, it's charming and ultimately it's power. BOTTOM LINE: The movie's flow is slow. That dialogue is fascinating. The story builds lightly, systematically and in substance. Building up to the final is satisfactory and ultimately rewarding.
