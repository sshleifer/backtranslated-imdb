"If Ned Kelly was born later, he would probably have won a Victoria cross at Gallipolli." This was Ned's Bravery. <br /> <br /> In Australia and especially Victoria, the name Ned Kelly can be said and immediately recognized. In Greta he is still a hero, the lifeblood of the village of Jerilderie depends on the tourism he created, but in Mansfield they still didn't forget that the three policeman he killed came from there. <br /> Many of the buildings he visited in his life are still standing. From the Old Melbourne Gaol where he was hanged, to the post office, he detained in Jerilderie. A cell in which he was once held in Greta is displayed in Benella and the website of Ann Jones' Hotel, the station and even the logs where he is trapped in Glenrowan can be visited. <br /> <br /> Evidence of everyone The events in the movie (apart from his love interest) are available everywhere in Victoria, in police records and even in the Sash awarded to Ned, to save Dick Shelton from drowning. None of these are wrong, and what remains is justified by Neds actions. The horse stolen by Ned was actually stolen by Wild Wright (the man holding Ned with boxes out of jail). Ned was already in prison when the horse was reported, so he did not steal it. <br /> <br /> The jury letter is more than previously said. This is not self-justification. This is Ned's biography, an outline of what he stands for and who he protects. So go ahead and read it, look at the movie and then make your thoughts on what Ned was.
