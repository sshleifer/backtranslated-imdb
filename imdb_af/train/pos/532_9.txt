Enchanting, romantic, innovative and funny. The vision of this extraordinary film is almost unmatched, better known as "dead romance" like Ghost. While we know intuitively that Peter and June are finally finding happiness at the end of those long stairs, the joy is in the journey. The moral of the story is of course timeless: love conquers everyone. But the battle to achieve that victory is played in a heavenly arena of fleeting vision and gripping greatness. With over 500 well-dressed extras depicting different ages and cultures, the directors' vision of heaven remains six decades later, well into the CGI era. <br /> <br /> But for all the cosmic scale, Powell and Pressburger knew an essential truth: the best story is told at the smallest level. The wonderful, definitely romantic aspect of "Trap" is captured with the ultimate simplicity: June's tear, preserved on a rose petal. <br /> <br /> This movie, like the story and the set itself, is one for centuries.
