Star Pickford and director Tourneur - along with his two favorite cameras and assistant Clarence Brown - do the editing - bring great beauty and intelligence to this story of poor, isolated Scottish Isles - the same area Michael Powell would be interested in his first major twenty years later success. Visions of wind and waves, sunbathing silhouettes of lovers not only complement the story, they are the story of hardship. <br /> <br /> The actors bring the dignity of proud people to their roles and Pickford is brilliant if her character struggles with her duties as head of the clan, staggering between comedy and thoughtfulness, here with her father's dimple that the eternal islanders in the church are roaring, sitting with her cane in her hand like a scepter, speaking her lover, played by Matt Moore. <br /> <br /> See if you can choose future star Leatrice Joy in the ensemble. I tried, but failed.
