Before I watched this movie, I thought this movie would be like Flashpoint, because before I watched this movie, Flashpoint was the last Jenna Jameson and Brad Armstrong movie I had ever watched. Regarding sexual scenes, I was disappointed. I thought Dreamquest's sexual scenes would be great as Flashpoint sexual scenes, but I was disappointed. Apart from the Asian scene of Asia Carrera, my sexual scene in this movie doesn't make me good (you know what I mean). The great Jenna Jameson does not do that kind of sexual scene of what she is capable of. Felecia and Stephanie Swift, both lovely girls, both disappointed me and sexual scenes. <br /> <br /> Although it's an adult movie, but if you leave the sexual scene factor, this movie is great. As for the typical adult movie standards, this movie has definitely raised adult movie standards. Story, acting, direction, sets, makeups and other technical things of this movie are really great. The actors of this movie performed really well, they all did a good job. Dream Quest is definitely the bar of quality adult movies.
