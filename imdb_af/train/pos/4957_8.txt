10 ITEMS OF LESS was made on a scant budget in two weeks by author / director Brad Silberling, just a small movie shot in Carson, CA who feels that the whole story has been improvised ... in the best of words. Silberling had the good fortune to link veteran actor Morgan Freeman, among his big projects, to Spanish actress Paz Vega. The result is a dialogue between two people of different value who improve the lives of others. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman plays himself - yet he is part of the comedy that he is portrayed as an actor who has been out of work for four years and has chosen a place for a little "filler film" to return to the flow of things. His 'role' is that of a market manager and he is observed at Carson, where he meets a Scarlet, the girlfriend at the argumentative 10 Items or Less Checkout line. Not only is she tired of Scarlet's static work, she is generally angry with her husband, Bobby Cannavale, who is currently sleeping with Scarlet's luxury colleague (Anne Dudek) and her lack of ability to work properly elsewhere to get. The two pairs after a few shared problems and off are going on a "road trip" which results in each of the characters growing out of the presence and life story of the other. <br /> <br /> It's a simple story, simply said, but because of the tender band between Freeman and Paz, it works very well. It's one of those little films about human relationships where it's vulnerable to change and exchange, is the message. It is worth watching, and it is a DVD with touching, informative and comical features - a pleasure to watch. Grady Harp
