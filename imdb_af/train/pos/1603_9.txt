I'm really surprised this movie didn't get a higher rating on IMDB. It's one of those movies that can easily be made by anyone, but for romantic comedy "Moonstruck" it's really in a class by itself. The institution and ethnic charm are things that people take for granted. The decisive piece makes it an almost perfect movie. Few movies in the 1980s were as good as "Moonstruck" and it's also funny. **** from *****
