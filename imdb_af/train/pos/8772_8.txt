Director Raoul Walsh was like the Michael Bay of the '40s and years before. And I mean it positively, since I'm definitely not a Bay Hater. His movies are just plain high quality entertainment, just as the Raoul Walsh movies were in his days. <br /> <br /> "Lord Jim" is good quality entertainment. Besides a first class director, it's also a first class, with Raoul Walsh's regular chief Errol Flynn starring. <br /> <br /> What surprised me was how well the boxing matches were brought to the screen. They used a very dynamic camera work, which also made the boxing matches exciting and exciting, with the final championship battle against John L. Sullivan as the ultimate highlight. <br /> <br /> Biopics of the 40's and earlier were of course still very different from biographies made this day. Modern biographies often glorify his major subject and show his / her life from basic birth to death and everything, mostly emotional aspects, in between. "Old biopics" were just the same as films that were not real-life people, which also meant that filmmakers often used creative freedom with the main character's personality and events in his / her life. This movie is also not just a boxing legend, but also a beautiful portrayal of the era in which illegal bare knuckle fights entered the modern era of boxing. <br /> <br /> Errol Flynn does a great job portraying the real image. Living famous boxer James J. Corbett aka Gentleman Jim. Not too many people knew it, but Flynn had really good work in the 40's, of which the movie is one. Physicaly also looks like top shape. He also looks completely different, without his trademark, a little mustache in this movie. The movie also has some fine supporting actors and some fine plays throughout. <br /> <br /> A great and entertaining movie that is really well kept today. <br /> <br /> 8/10
