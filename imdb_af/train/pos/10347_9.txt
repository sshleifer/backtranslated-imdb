Lovely little movie, juggling comedy and detective, romance and drama genres, like Lt Kenny Williams (Melvyn Douglas), balance his dedication to his girlfriend Maxine Carroll (Joan Blondell) and his duty to power as a ace detective. <br /> <br /> Today, this hodge podge can't appeal to all viewers, but in his day something has been given to every member of the film, and the resolution for the rather tired feel-opposite plot is original. and refreshing, and worth it. <br /> <br /> "The Amazing Mr. Williams" has to be among the most outrageous blind dates in film history, and its shiny comic repartee sparkle. Tucked away, Melvyn Douglas delivers some of the best lines: "I want to run into a Turkish towel in Main Street before I control any woman over my life!" And the bustling Joan Blondell let her fairies fly with a typical aplomb: "Good sadness! You look like my aunt Nellie!" <br /> <br /> The crime solution here is standard money, although a fine cast or character actor helps to bring the material to life. <br /> <br /> From today's vantage point, "The Amazing Mr. Williams" may be interesting for his insightful generation of gender as a socially-defined construction, the more edgy for his seemingly rigid borders. While much of the gender report takes place in a superficial battle of the sexes, it is sometimes subtle and penetrating, not only playing in some of the finer details of the movie, but in the battle of genres reaching its peak in the final scene. .
