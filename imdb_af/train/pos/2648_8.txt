Actually the story of two brother brothers and their respective fall of grace (via drug addiction) and later redemption. One brother, a self-proclaimed genius played by James Franco, is your typical sensitive but intelligent man-child. The other brother is a hard-working future doctor who becomes less discretionary as he tackles addiction himself while dealing with the stress of his family's expectations for both children. Not too heavy handed like drug fables, and all in all a pretty realistic sketch of the family dynamics that cause drug problems. I would recommend it to anyone interested in such character studies and recommend James Franco for his efforts in what was, of course, a love work.
