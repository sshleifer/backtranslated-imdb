Verhoeven's film was mature and full of garbage. He is a disgusting hack of a director and must be ashamed. Through his own admission, he read 2 chapters of the book, got bored and decided to make up the whole thing from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Heinlein would never have supported that trash if he was alive to see It. It basically steals the name, mocks the politics of the book (which is a good part of it) and throws a few T&A so that the average idiot American movie maker doesn't get bored. <br /> <br /> This anime isn't perfect, but at least it's mostly accurate, as I can say best.
