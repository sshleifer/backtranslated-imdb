Story of four teenage girls growing up in California. Jeanie (Jodie Foster) is the most level of the bunch - but wants to move out of her home where she lives with her divorced mother (Sally Kellerman). Annie (Cherie Currie) is addicted to drugs, alcohol and bad boys and is defeated by her father. Madge (Marilyn Kagan) has overprotective parents. Deirde (Kandice Stroh) thinks she is more mature than the rest of them. <br /> <br /> It's nothing new to what we've seen many times before - but this one has one big difference - it's accurate. . I graduated from high school in 1980 (when I first saw the movie) and I was amazed at how realistic it was. They are quite right about the dialogue, clothing and attitudes. Even the main song of the movie ("On the Radio" at Donna Summer) was a big hit before it came out. This movie hit me harder than any other teenage movie of the time, because I could understand and relate to the characters. I knew high school girls who were just like that! The film is (of course) dated, but it captures a time we will never see again. <br /> <br /> The play is good at all levels with Foster delivering the best performance. The relationship between her and Kellerman (which was excellent) was realistic and well done. Even Scott Baio (who plays a little as a girlfriend of the girls) played more or less realistically a teenage boy. <br /> <br /> A very good movie - essential performance when you came in 1980. film has an earnings R score (lots of drug use and curse), but must be seen by all teenagers. I give it a 8.
