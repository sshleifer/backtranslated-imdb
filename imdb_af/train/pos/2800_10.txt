David Beckham is a British soccer player and the man of Victoria Beckham ("Posh Spice" of the Spice Girls). His trademark is a goalie that bends over pitch and net. The soccer equivalent of an incessant curved ball in baseball. "Bend it like Beckham" means that kind of spectacular shot is made. In addition, and a small shrine to him in the main character's bedroom and a faux-cameo in the end, the movie has nothing to do with him. <br /> <br /> The movie is full of little football in jokes, like the present that one of the characters' parents gives her a jersey with the number 9 on it (property of the big Mia Hamm, on the well-known), references to Posh a 'Becks,' the video tribute to the WUSA plays one of the characters for an unbelieving friend ("They have it?"), lesbian gags, sports-bra gags, and so on. <br /> <br /> The story is about a teenage girl in England who abuses Beckham and wants to be a soccer star. She has a real gift, but the two seemingly insurmountable obstacles she has to overcome are the absence of a professional women's league in the UK (hence their fascination with our WUSA) and her parents, who are Indian immigrants on very old-fashioned ways. which does not allow girls to do contact sports. The girl's family is portrayed as figures of ironic fun, but with great love - think My Big Fat Greek Wedding. The girl loves and respects them enough to go through the helmet, hiding her growing soccer field from them.
