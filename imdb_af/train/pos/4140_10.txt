What an incredibly funny and original show. The cast that starts with the hysterical Julie Brown (Homecoming Queen's Got A Gun) is just perfect. Add Amy Hill (All American Girl-Grandma Kim) who plays a lesbian who always fights with her partner and business partner (Asian restaurant-WOK-DON "T RUN). I laughed louder at this show than any other I still have ever seen. (including Newhart one of my favorites for all time) If you like movies like Naked Gun and Airplane, you'll love this series! One of the best moments of the show is Cindy Williams who plays herself. Tammy finds a picture of Cindy Williams in her dress, the picture is that Cindy Williams is doing an unresolved action with a ball game upside down - it's great to see an actress like Cindy Williams herself so can play opera, like with many surprises during his short term, I can only hope it will be released on DVD one day with special special bonus features - the finest series I've ever seen !!
