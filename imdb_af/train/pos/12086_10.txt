Wonderful family drama / comedy with MacClaine and Garr who, every time I see it, entertaines and warms the heart. Highly recommended for all ages from 9-year-olds to grannies. Beautiful period that occupies 1962. The story includes the struggling Garr, her two children and aunt Zena (MacClaine) trying to meet ends without a man as head of the household. The "family" heads left the legacy of a long forgotten family member who had left Garr for a while. The stubborn Garr, as the sweet but determined mother, gets the whole family in the restoration and opening of the cafe. But wait ...... Tannie Zena is an old circus artist with card prints, magical powders and a jesters sense of humor ...... she loves to get the kids and her into stupid and sometimes dangerous games. .. What happens next is a beautiful combination of Miracle at Lords that coincided with Cuban missile crises (with real-time real-time TV news) and a "ghost" prick that gets out of hand. Entertaining, philosophizing, asking for religion, and giving a glorious look at the frightening terror of the Cuban missile crises of October 1962, this film finally reminds of faith, family, and rediscovered love. Oh, and the music from the early 60's era is just great! <br /> <br /> Highly recommend as a FEEL GOOD MOVIE 10 out of 10
