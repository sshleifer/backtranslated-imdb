Another example of Cary Grant's unique talents. A show worthy of Oscar consideration, but once again avoided by the Academy. Mr Grant ran the spectacle from foolish to gentle in this wonderful comedy about a man who decided to move out of the big city. The pitfalls of building a home are well-wound and have the base (loosely) for the more modern Tom Hanks vehicle, "The Money Pit". <br /> <br /> If you want a good old-fashioned comedy without the curse and the Gratuitous sex, this movie is a must see.
