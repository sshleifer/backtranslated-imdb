All in all, a good movie and better for the film not being made, the story can be hidden from the masses. Brosnan does a good job as a native American with a hidden past and photography is amazing. For some, it may be too whimsical, boring to others - for me it is a soft, well-crafted story and ideal for family viewing. Now it's not something you recently got much of.
