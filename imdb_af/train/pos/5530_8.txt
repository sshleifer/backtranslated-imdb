A must see for anyone who likes photography. Beautiful and breathtaking, leaving you in ore. I saw it twice in a theater and now on DVD. It does well on DVD, but on the big screen it's something else. <br /> <br /> Have my two daughters see it and they loved it, my eldest cried at the end. But she was the one who wanted to see it tonight when she saw it at the video store. his simple telling of a child's love for nature and especially a fox is well told. In some ways it reminded me of the bear in telling a story, not documentary formats. which works very well for children. Not preached is very important, you raise your own thoughts. <br /> <br /> But the star of this movie is the movies, how did they do what they did. amazing just amazing.
