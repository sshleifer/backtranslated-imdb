My mom took me to see this movie as a kid and I want to see it every year if I do all my other Christmas favorites. What I remember most was the stupid devil and santa who watched his telescope. I waited and watch the T.V. guide every year to see when it will be shown. I will usually play it on a Saturday afternoon. I just found the movie in English that took something special from the movie and wanted to find a copy of it in Spanish. I'd rather keep this movie in my heart and never suffered from nightmares than others might imagine. Yes, it's another movie about Santa Claus and it makes it special and unique. I can't wait to get a copy of this movie and watch it with my kids as I explain my favorite parts and memories to them!
