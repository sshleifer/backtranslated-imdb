This particularly enjoyable and sad sequel to the highly successful "The Legend of Boggy Creek" is a follow-up in just the name. Stories abound in a dormant, self-contained fishing community of a so-called evil Bigfoot creature, called "Big Bay Ty", who lives deep in the unyielding wetlands of Boggy Creek. Two bratty brothers and their older, more sensible tomboy sister (a lovely festive show by a cute, colored future "Different Strokes" sitcom star Dana Plato) go into the treacherous swamp to see if the creature of local legend may be actually a true living being. The trio are hopelessly lost in a fierce storm and the furry, bearded, humongous, but very soft and benevolent Sasquatch comes to the children's rescue. <br /> <br /> Tom Moore's informal, no-frills direction is linked to this simple story in a tranquil pace, which captures the rural village workday minutiae in urgent exact detail and the assorted warmth assorted characters and show love and happily develop the sentiment in an organic, incessant way that never falls into stickiness. -sappy mush. Worshiping Dawn Wells (Mary Ann on "Gilligan's Island") gives an impressive representation of the children's loving working class single mom, while Jim Wilson and John Hofeus provide enjoyable, impeccable support as well as a few whipped oil shaved curmudgeonly coots. Robert Bethard's skilful, sunny cinematography shows the bushy environment in all its beautiful tranquil, painful, pure and fragile, untouched by civilization. Darrell Deck's score combines industrious flesh-crawling synthesizer shakers and cheering banjo-pluckin 'country bluegrass into a tuneful sonic brew. In addition, this photo has special praise for the way it unpredictably predicts the 90's kiddie feature Bigfoot vogue with a good 15 year old.
