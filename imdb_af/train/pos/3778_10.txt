The first film had little ambition so nothing was stuck on the screen. It was a bad version of 'Back to the Future' with zero charm. Once Bill & Ted is assumed to be nitwits, the joke can be hammered out before it breaks. <br /> <br /> It's a surprise. It's your only heater warning ... <br /> <br /> Today's standards are better. It was rid of the release, sad because more talent was involved than the first time. We get the "Face / Off" photographer, "Fugitive" editor, a Burton's early work production designer, and "Matrix" audio designer. <br /> <br /> The authors made them level. first outing with something deep. As it was avoided by the fan base and the public, the director probably decided that the style was too bad. This is not, it fits the material. Like 'Death Becomes Her' and 'Catch-22', dare to be smart, but we like our movies "simply" so we don't buy it. Probably as it dared differently is why it took 12 producers to deduct it. What's so good? <br /> <br /> - New self-reference to Keanu; from the plane to the Messiah. See also Arnold Schwarzenegger. <br /> <br /> - Joss hates his creations as much as he hates his peers, he makes his own hatred. The Bose B & T and the "good robot usses" have the same vocabulary as their original: fewer copies and depreciation of language. <br /> <br /> - The "duality" motif. Nowhere else is it clear than in photography styles, very high and low angles. They even use Roy Brocksmith from 'Total Recall' to highlight the point. <br /> <br /> - The "choices" motive. I don't know where it started in the genre (maybe 'Ghostbusters'), but it's used very well here. It even comes down to the 7 games against death - Battleship and Club. <br /> <br /> - Movie self-reference, even present in the game against death (Clue). It is smarter than Tarantino or Brooks. Note the Premier magazine cover at the end: "Bill and Ted: The Movie." Ecronically also how Death and Nomolos were villains in the 'Die Hard' and 'Lethal Weapon' prosecutions. <br /> <br /> I still have a few small nits, but nothing compared to the original one. Music and film are different mediums, so it doesn't make sense why many scripts revolve around the former - especially in the teenage market. Carlin is a great comedian, but in this movie he is messed up. Also, for all the bravest, this attempt, even funny gay jokes, cannot kill a cat. <br /> <br /> So, despite a Nickelodeon production, it's incredibly interesting. From this movie we have Beavis and Butt-Head. "We are in Heaven and we only hurt three people." <br /> <br /> Final Analysis = = Midrange Material
