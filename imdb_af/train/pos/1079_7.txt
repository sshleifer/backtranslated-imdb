Although not seen in too many movies, you've probably seen the basic themes in too many movies. <br /> <br /> None of Grant's or Loy's best movies, they make a great effort together. After all, with so much talent and very good supporting role, you know the laugh will be there. <br /> <br /> The movie is light, has some dramatic spotting, but keeps the plot moving and lets you smile all over. <br /> <br /> A good example of classic American filmmaker who stood the test of time. <br /> <br /> Final Saturday afternoon fare, heavy on popcorn.
