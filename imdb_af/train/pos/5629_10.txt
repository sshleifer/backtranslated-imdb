I loved this excellent movie. Farrah Fawcett played the part phenomenally and with good heart. She plays a woman who is being driven to the extreme to protect her and her friends after being attacked by a stranger. After being rejected by the police, she realized she was alone. <br /> <br /> One day, when she broke into the house alone in the house and attacked her in the house alone. I'm not going to call the police or get him out. She must spray him in the eye and invade him in her fireplace. <br /> <br /> I think there's a need for a wake up call to the laws of the country. They're too easy on these criminals. It's time for more harsh punishment.
