This is a FUNNY movie. It has all the usual Disney components (music, great variety of characters, story, appeal), entwined with wonderful animation and the excellent voice talents of lesser-known actors such as those in Antz and Egypt's prize. /> <br /> The characters work really well, and have a strong career, and the humor is at a wide level aimed at exceeding generation barriers. The film is also featured in an excellent cinemascope format, resulting in the cinema experience. <br /> <br /> Call me crazy, but I've seen the movie three times and I'm planning to take more friends to see this weekend. . Many skeptics have seen this movie on my recommendation and not disappointed. I work in a plywood, and I can honestly say that nobody ever walked out of this movie without a sense of satisfaction. <br /> <br /> See it and don't break it down because it's animated. . You're sure to enjoy this movie and make sure you stay for the end credits! The bloopers and out-tasks at the end are the funniest part of the movie, which is loaded through the whole laugh.
