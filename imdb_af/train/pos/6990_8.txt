Bela Lugosi appears in several of these low budget chillers for Monogram Studios in the 1940s and The Corpse Vanishes is one of the better ones. Bela plays a crazy scientist who kidnaps young brides and kills them and then extracts fluid from their bodies so that he can make his aging wife look. After a reporter and a doctor stayed at his home the night and discovered that he was responsible for the death of the brides, the next morning, they reported these murders to the police and the mad scientist was shot dead shortly thereafter. <br /> <br /> You almost have everything in this movie: scientists' assistants consist of an old hag, a hunchback and dwarf (her sons), a thunderstorm and haunting parts in Bela's house. Bela and his wife find them better in coffins, rather than beds in the movie. <br /> <br /> The Corpse Vanishes is worth a look, especially for Bela Lugosi fans. Great fun. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 stars out of 5.
