Although a teardrop is, it is definitely a "feel good" movie. All the actors were excellent and Will Smith as always, does the job and does it well. I can go on, but choose ten of the "10" ratings and they said so well and probably better than I could. <br /> <br /> BUT, since I have to include at least 10 lines to comment, I would say that Rosario Dawson was largely unknown to me as a viewer. Her performance was enjoyable and I look forward to seeing her playing in many movies. <br /> <br /> And, this movie shows that Will Smith can't prove anything further in terms of his ability as an actor.
