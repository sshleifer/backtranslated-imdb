WAQT is a perfect example of a chicken soup, not exactly for your soul. Unfortunately, the sauce has lost its true taste, thanks to all the excess dilution and decorations that have come into play. <br /> <br /> What is surprising and disappointing about WAQT is that it comes from a director who stayed away from the usual clich√©s of the Hindi theater in his first venture, but who in his second outing for all the stereotype enter film formulas. While Vipul Shah had the conviction to declare something unpredictable as blind men who robbed a bank in AWARE, he failed to analyze life throughout the WAQT packaging based on something imaginable as a father boy relationship. Taken from a Gujarati play Aavjo Vhala Fari Malishu, WAQT has a sensible story with a social message to back up. An adult look at the father-son relationship, a father's unconditional love for his son and a son's responsibility to his family. Ishwar Chand Sharawat (Amitabh Bachchan), who put his entire kingdom out of the ground, leads a prosperous life with his wife Sumitra (Shefali Shah). Their only son, Aditya (Akshay Kumar), never needed to strive for anything, as he made everything tailor-made and spoonful. Ishwar's indulgence just spoiled him. <br /> <br /> Aditya dreams of becoming a superstar, but does nothing to make his dreams come true. Meanwhile, he is married to his wife's Mitali (Priyanka Chopra). Ishwar hopes Aditya's marriage will make a more responsible man, but he is disappointed. Aditya is still his best way to lead a carefree life. <br /> <br /> The endurance limit eventually falls when Ishwar Aditya emits from his home. The sudden change in the attitude of his loving father towards him and his wife, now expecting, is Aditya. He has no option, but strives for the livelihood of his wife and his unborn child. He begins to become an independent man, but the gap in his relationship with his father grows. <br /> <br /> The story is simplistic, while the uncomplicated script has a very elementary approach. One can easily identify and relate to the credible characters of both the father and the boy. If you're not one of the two, you've got individuals like them somewhere in real life anyway. <br /> <br /> Add it to director Vipul Shah's easy handling of the script. With a family relationship like this, any other director in his place would have added in tons of melodrama in the proceedings according to the Bollywood family drama film legislation, which makes the film into a compulsive tear-dancer. However, Shah exhorts the effortless handling of emotions for most of the film. <br /> <br /> Clear example of its unpretentious direction is tangible in the pre-scene scene where the father pours the boy out of his home a fairly frivolous way. The goal of the scene is achieved without making a brown on the audience's brain. It was for the scene in the second half in which the now divorced father's son has a flickering conversation. It distinguishes WAQT from a KABHI KUSHI GHUM or an I RISHTAA and places it one level high in terms of treatment. <br /> <br /> But after all the distinctions have been made, can one wonder where WAQT still fails? The problem lies in the fact that WAQT distinguishes itself from the others in the league in terms of treatment, but it does give the glitches in the package. What with the director occasionally in the first half forces into song-n-dance. There is a Johar kinda shaadi song, a Chopra kinda Holi song, a father son disco dandia song, a dream song and a dream, true song that suffices in the viewer. Imagine ... the father just drove the boy out of his house and dreamed the boy of a song in Moroccan mountains with his wife. Out of place! Out of reason! and the audience from the seat. <br /> <br /> The movie only traces in the first half and the real story only begins in the second half. The director wasted too much WAQT on unnecessary elements. The much talked about dog hunting sequence is not bad, but not salvation either. However, Akshay Kumar's tandav dance is just ridiculous. Imagine that he qualifies for the star hunt in the movie with this (inadvertently) hilarious histrionic. Add the climax to the final of the star hunt where the boy bursts with emotions. It's so archetypes! The change pattern could also be reversed to hide the father's reason for the change of attitude towards his son. <br /> <br /> Anu Malik's music is good but unnecessary in the proceedings. Santosh Thundiiayil's camera work is capable enough, but not very demanding. Aatish Kapadia has had some good dialogues for dramatic moments. <br /> <br /> Boman Irani and Rajpal Yadav make the light moments in the movie very effective. While Rajpal Yadav has gone overboard with his comic histrionics lately, he has underlined his character this time and is completely limited. His deadpan expressions are perfectly complimented with Boman's over-the-top histrionics. <br /> <br /> Shefali Shah is convincing in the mother's role. Not taken as a disapproval, but she is playing flawlessly in both and "watching" her character. Priyanka is beautiful and performs well. <br /> <br /> Of course, the biggest applause is Akshay Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan. Akshay is especially expressive in the scene, where his doting father deliberately told him to make him aware of his responsibilities. Although Bachchan is a bit dramatic in some scenes, his brilliance is throughout the film. <br /> <br /> In short, WAQT is like a soup whose ingredients are tasty and nutritious, but the final recipe is somehow not so tasty.
