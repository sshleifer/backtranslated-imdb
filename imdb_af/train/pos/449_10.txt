For anyone who is rated at the first meeting, the perfect tutorial is on depth of character. The grumpy old lady has a soft, thoughtful heart - and needs new friends. The fleeting, insecure, 'ditsy' lady who makes inappropriate, uncomfortable comments - sees deep in your soul and has pure love for all. The cold, primitive, proper, neglected woman has thrilled passion that can cook at any moment - with the right attitude. The perfect beauty - rich, sweet, party, persecuted by trumpets - wants peace, quiet and love without possession. <br /> <br /> Taking the time to look outside the surface, you'll find treasures in everyday life, from the least anticipated sources. All it takes is patience and a touch of enchantment.
