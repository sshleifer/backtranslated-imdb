"Gandhi as a man and dad?" has always been discussed by people in India. "Gandhi ... my dad" is a story that would not know much about such details. Certainly an insight into Gandhi's personal life. <br /> <br /> Overall, I like the movie for story and filmmaking. Jariwala, Akshay Khanna and Shefali Shah have all done a good job. Most scenes of the movie will be nice desktop wallpapers ... commendable work. Traditional Indian folk music as background score in some parts of the movie gives a good feeling of the events. <br /> <br /> But what I didn't like was the narrative style. On several points I over-dramatized the tone. <br /> <br /> Overall good work by Anil Kapoor Productions. I would recommend it as "must-see-once". 8/10
