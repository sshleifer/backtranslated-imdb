With a fascinating show by Will Smith and a story that makes your heartbeat harder than a rock-guitar-mid-solo, seven pound races past the director's previous collaboration with the actor (The Pursuit of Happiness), a movie that i also loved. Remember Gabriele Muccino's name because some of his movies may be unnoticed if the actor associated with the project is not quite as high a profile. <br /> <br /> Too bad, I set up Will Smith's scheme early. I put two and two together when he calls in his own suicide in the first scene and the scene when Rosario Dawson's character is introduced as an incurable heart. -disease. <br /> <br /> However, I still think the author / director has made the right choice to make the books (books are the first and last scene) that way, this is the source of urgency and tension in the movie , gradually finding out how exactly a man can be driven after that ultimate sacrifice, and it was heartbreaking to see that the relationship between Smith and Dawson's character flourishes and develops, always knowing in the back of the mind that this unfortunate two were. . <br /> <br /> One of my friends with whom I saw the movie saw Smith's character, could have a divine gift, and I understand why: his performance is almost English when he is in the presence Of his seven elected members, but at other times he can be hard and scary, and when he is alone he has full weight of his situation too much for him and he completely broke down. It is quite a versatile display. <br /> <br /> Finally, I can't forget to mention the revival of the accident scene, which was really great done in terms of cinematography linked to music. Place it on your list.
