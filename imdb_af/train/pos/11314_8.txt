Wow! The kind of movie you can see ten times and still entertain in its nuances. Absolutely incredible! If it was Visconti's debut movie, I scream to think what would happen if he got better from film to movie. The only one I saw (at time of writing) is Death in Venice - it was absolutely incredible: more shiny visual than Ossession (Obsession). One of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen, but his story wasn't as relevant as Ossessione. If you click on "miscellaneous" on the links of this page, there are still photos of the movie on the websites. They will not really meet the experience of the movie: such graceful camera movements, such a beautiful composition, such wonderful faces, such great characters, such a wonderful story development, the first movie adapted from James M Cain's The Postman Always Rings Twice. "<br /> <br /> I can't believe it was in 43, eight years before Brando was supposed to act realistically with Streetcar Named Desire (1951). The actors in this may not use the method technique, that is, they have not felt everything themselves (I know nothing about it) - but to date they are the best, most real and realistic shows in cinema, and eight years before Streetcar Named Desire has a new sensuality on the screen, Ossessione was electricity sensual! The most sensual thing since the beginning of the theater! Yes, I'm superlative, but Ossessione was just as fantastic. <br /> <br /> The reason why Ossessione doesn't was made in fascist Italy and banned by Mussolini, cut in America, American audiences did not see its full glory to 59, eight years after Straatkar. <br /> <br /> say no more about it - just write to say one of the best, most beautiful and exciting. what I've ever seen and tell you to go out and see it! Like another reviewer, I'll buy it as soon as I can find it!
