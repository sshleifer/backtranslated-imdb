I'll be honest with you. I like this movie. It's a big zombie movie full of action, original ideas, good acting, but also full of bad zombie effects. Part IV, entitled "After Death" is also good. I would recommend this movie to horror fans. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 <br /> <br /> Fans of Horror Movies like this should check out Puppet Master, Skinned Alive, Slumber Party Massacre, Sleep Away Camp, and other Full Moon Pictures flicks.
