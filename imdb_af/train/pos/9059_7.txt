It's a good movie, a good family movie to see if you have nothing else to do. If you expect this movie to be out of the book, you'll be very disappointed. I was somewhat disappointed because I read the book a few times when I was in primary school. <br /> <br /> It's about a new kid in the village called Billy. He makes a bet with the school pool and the bet is not like most bets. Billy must one day eat 10 worms or win the bully. <br /> <br /> The acting is OK, probably the worst part of the movie. The child actors over exaggerate many things. They think it's apocalypse if Billy doesn't eat the worms. Hallie Eisenberg, however, did a wonderful job. <br /> <br /> The plot line is good as a movie, but it struggles as a book adaptation. I was able to watch this movie without looking at the time. Sometimes. <br /> Overall, this was a good family movie with some weaknesses. I rate this movie 7/10.
