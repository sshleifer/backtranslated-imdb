It watched last night and broadcast through the sad storyline, the excellent character development and the good karmic vibe emanating from the play and the movie as a whole. <br /> <br /> Without giving away too much of the plot, it starts with a regular boy commuting every day to his office work, inspired to take dance lessons. Along the way, the protagonist and the assorted characters in his quest meet on the dance floor, learn lessons about others and about themselves. <br /> <br /> The story has a prologue about what soccer dance in Japan symbolizes, so learning to dance in Japan is not exactly as easy as it is here in the US. <br /> <br /> The movie is light; You will laugh aloud at some of the eyelids. Yet, it is also worthy of some difficulty to describe. All the movie characters are taken seriously, as they are, and no one is diminished because of their "imperfections." <br /> <br /> I was thinking of taking social dance classes with friends. It just so happened that a friend lent me the video to learn dance. Is it synchronous or what? I think so, because now I'm really geeked to try it. <br /> <br /> Watch this wonderful family movie (small kids can't get it, but teenagers will definitely) and smile at the right caring you see every time. <br /> <br /> Why they'll make a remake of Sal Our Dance is a mystery because it's perfect as it is.
