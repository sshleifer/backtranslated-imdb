I only saw this show a few times, but will stay in my memory. <br /> <br /> It is very frustrating that it's so hard to find it anywhere to buy and yet it seems like there is endless repetition of things like friends! Especially even harder to be in England, I think. <br /> <br /> They say it was low ratings or was it a complaint from the Bakersfield PD itself? Maybe it was just too clever for some people? <br /> <br /> Anyway, just about one comedy, I'd love to see again, but it's almost impossible to find. I hear it being or is repeating on another network? But unfortunately not here! <br /> <br /> Summary: Genius.
