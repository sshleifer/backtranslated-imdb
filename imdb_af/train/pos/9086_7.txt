If you are under 13 or more than 13 and are very drunk, you will enjoy the D War. If you are a seriously devoted fan of all kinds of brainless action movies, you will enjoy the D War. Otherwise, don't bother! I saw the movie today with my nephews and 3 of their friends. They really loved it and it made me feel good. After the movie was over, all the kids (my cousins ​​and their friends) couldn't stop thanking me for taking them to the theater. <br /> <br /> The CG is good. Acting and ruling is terrible. Storyline is extremely simple. But since half of the audience were children, they shouted, shouted and shouted every time the dragons appeared on the screen. This made the show experience much more exciting than it should have been. <br /> <br /> It's a good movie to take your kids, but besides the final battle order, D-war is disappointing. I give this movie 7 out of 10 mainly because the kids loved it so much.
