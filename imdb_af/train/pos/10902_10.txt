I was terrified when I watched the movie. How jonny could keep so much hope and faith was wonderful. so many people just care what they want, and care about all the things they don't have. and they are so small things like chothes, a new car applies. I saw people in tears because of a void. This movie brings everything back to the basics. love, hope the beauty of simple but so important things in life. This shows our daily problems for what they are small and really unimportant. You look at this boy and you realize as long as you are blessed with food, a roof over your head and your loved ones around you. You are truly blessed. And the words stop and smell the roses really have a new meaning. And I know jonny will see it and I want to thank him for sharing such faith, strength and humor with me. Thank you, young, I know you are heaving the heavens and bringing much love and laughter to heaven above.
