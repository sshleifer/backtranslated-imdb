In the early 1930s, this film was one of the more giant black and white films of this time before the Hoyts Code was enforced. This is the story of a young beautiful woman moving to New York and making her way to the top of the business using her body as a tool to get there. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwyck plays the young and beautiful Lily Powers who do a pretty good job with her performance. Lily moves to New York and places her on the business by sleeping with all the men. Stanwyck does an excellent performance as a strong woman who uses men as a one-off deal, almost any emotion towards them playing as if they were pawns. Lily Powers is a woman who has not only love and power. <br /> <br /> I thought this movie is a bit different from other movies I've seen, because there's almost any background music heard. I believe this is just because it is when people are first introduced to live sound and dialogue between the people of the movie. The few times the music is heard, is shown in the beginning as we make her way to the chain. The filming and different scenes were something fantastic! The director of this film has made all the right angles and the right tricks that make this movie full of realism. <br /> <br /> This movie was all together a good movie. The end of this movie was not so good. as it should have been, but it did not completely destroy it. Baby Face had his slow moving scenes throughout the movie, and might have some predictable parts to sleep with. But it's a lovely movie that can be watched more than once and introduced to some people and friends.
