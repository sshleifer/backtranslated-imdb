In "Die Nibelungen: Siegfried" Siegfried was betrayed. Now Kriemhild is looking for revenge. She marries Hagen, and through a series of events, a very drastic (but appropriate) action is finally taken. <br /> <br /> One of the things to watch this movie is that we can look at certain portraits. Attila the Hun (called Etzel in the movie) is shown as the foreign person from the east, possibly an ally to the Soviet Union. It was clear that it was not Fritz Lang's fault that Hitler used "The Nibelungenlied" for German national pride in the Third Reich, but one can see what the Fuehrer likes of the story. Nonetheless, this is an absolutely formidable movie.
