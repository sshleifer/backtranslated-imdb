I know many people do not like this movie, but I just think it is rich. There isn't much I can say, but the movie is a good movie I think. The songs are beautiful, the costumes are beautiful, the voices are beautiful, and there are many funny lines in the movie, especially as Briggitta learns about the do's and not the society. If you like musical, I want to say you want this one!
