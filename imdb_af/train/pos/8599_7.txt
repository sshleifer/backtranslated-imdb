It's been 19 years since Gordon Gekko used "Wall Street" to let us know that greed is good. Now, Michael Douglas takes the GG persona and morphs it into a secret service agent, Pete Garrison. Guess what? It works! This is a solid political excitement that makes me guess. The detail work to show the security measures taken by the SS on behalf of the President and First Lady was also intriguing. All the clues were pretty good, but, as I wish, I couldn't accept Eva Longoria as a secret service agent. While Jodie Foster just lets you stop believing and really thinks she is FBI agent Starling in "Silence of the Lambs", you won't get the same feeling with Longoria. Yet it is a fun movie, recreational entertainment with the Beltway as a backdrop.
