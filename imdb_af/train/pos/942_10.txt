This is the best movie version of Dicken's classic story. I've seen it over and over on VHS, and recently got the DVD version, which was formatted for TV (not wide screen). What I find interesting about this teleplay is the role-players of English actors who are now recognizable, as many have appeared in other films / performances in North America since 1984. My biggest surprise is Edward Woodward, the Equalizer, as the Christmas Ghost. .
