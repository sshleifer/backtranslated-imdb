This is a running natural movie clip. By porn, I don't mean sex. I mean gratuitous images of (for example) thousands of birds together, or hundreds of walrus, or a giant waterfall or iceberg. Several of the shots in the movie just seem to exist to make their way into the trailer, to get people into theaters to see it for all ten seconds before it disappears, never to again for the rest of the movie. don't see. <Br /> <br /> There is hardly any plot in this movie. Understanding to expect a story of three animal families, "better than March of Penguins", the movie simply doesn't deliver. The blame is based on three key areas: (1) the writers who gave James Earl Jones some of the worst lines to tell in film history, (2) the music team who threatened to tell you what to feel, even when the movie does not motivate, and last but most importantly (3) the editors who jumped the story from place to place with no rhythm or reason, no continuity, no flow and life from the whole movie does not suck film about the life. When we came halfway through the film to the whales, I sank back in my seat with fear, hoping that the film was more than halfway and that I could survive the long endurance test with the animals. screen. <br /> <br /> There was almost no science in the movie either. They were warm and cold (everything, not just the seasons) just on the side of the Earth, ignoring the fact that we would have even greater extremes from place to place if there was no tilt because the poles would never warm do not become. And that would be the worst if we had no rotation (relative to revolution) like Mercury, because half of the planet would bake and the other half would freeze. Then they used the term "humans and animals", as if humans were not animals, somehow released from the laws of nature. So much for science. <br /> <br /> However, I have to pay the camera work, so I call this nature porn again. Everything that is from a slow motion to a fine-tuned mechanical-controlled time-lapse photography is used to give some (and I caution, only a few) beautiful moments that increase the beam as compared to other natural films. That said, I'm not convinced it was all on the screen. Some of the shots that show off the huge waterhole in Africa, as it changed from season to season, look like CGI. A director expected such suspicions and built in other shots to show that it was natural, but they didn't. <br /> <br /> For a film about Earth I expected a lot of Earth to be shown. What we saw was pristine. We had to use the narrator's word that some species are at stake due to climate change. They didn't prove it to us. They didn't show us Alberta's toxic tail dams visible from space. They didn't show us the big Pacific rubbish. They did not show us a night photo of human light pollution around the planet. It is so much earth than anything else. Why cover it for a nice white whit? <br /> <br /> My last criticism of the content is predation. Any time a predator was shown on the screen actually attacked a prey. The music almost turned into the Mt Doom scene of Lord of the Rings, depicted with the predator as a kind of bad character by Sauron. But predators aren't angry. They provide a necessary service to ensure that the best members of the prey species survive. We are predators themselves. Any time the predator caught the prey, we immediately cut down on something else, pretending that death and eating didn't really happen. The final insult was that the "father polar bear" was left to die after he ventured to eat. "Bad bear! Bad!", You can almost hear them say. <br /> <br /> Presenting itself. My theater can be part of this, but maybe not. I expected to see something clearer than I could see on my own HDTV LCD at home. But the picture was vague, and was presented in the same 16: 9 relationship I could get at home, instead of the broader relationship, many movies come these days. And during an action-packed scene near the end, the movie (I can't think it happens digitally, what it looks like) has been damaged, and we've lost several of the colors and eventually become completely black. It repeats about three times. <br /> <br /> If they actually plant a tree on my behalf, it'll be worth it. But how will I know?
