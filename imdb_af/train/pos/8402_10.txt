THE VAN is a simple teenage operating image made especially for the ride, making it comfortable, and offering many opportunities to laugh and cry with your friends. Danny Devito has a small but big role as driver of a car wash and stole the show almost! All the clues are well behaved, the characters complex and the direction relatively competent for this type of picture. A Crown International Release.
