Shower holds in so many ways. Almost all the movies take place in an old-time bathhouse, with the residents providing humor, pathos and emotional touch. The love and friendship between the owner and his delayed son is deep and moving. The way in which the older brother is drawn into this small world seems unbiased and convincing. The plot is winding, full of surprises and ironic, and touched entirely by a sense of what I should call the neighborhood in the relationships and conflicts of the artists. It's a movie I pull out of if I want to believe in the world again.
