I had the opportunity to see this film debut at the Appalachian Film Festival, which won a Best Picture Award. This film is brilliantly done, with an excellent role that works well as an ensemble. My favorite performances were from Youssef Kerkour, Justin Lane, and Adam Jones. There are also some big effects with dragons and cockroaches, and I was surprised to find that this movie was done on a small budget. Author-director Adam Jones, who I believe also, won an award for his writing, doing an excellent job with guidance. The audience loved this movie. Cross Eyed will make you laugh through the movie. Definitely a must see.
