This series is a year after the mission to Abydos in the movie Stargate. This explains many of the things the movie has neglected to mention. Like how was the Stargate activated without a human computer? Where does the Goa'uld (race's race) come from? How much is there? <br /> <br /> The first episode has a retired Jack O'Neill (spelled with 2 L), reminiscent of active duty by General George Hammond for an attack by the closed Stargate of Apophis, a powerful Goa. Wool killing four men and kidnapping a woman. We meet Samantha Carter, a brilliant scientist who claims to have been through the Stargate for the first time, and is determined to go through now. We find out that Daniel is married to Abydos, and that there are hundreds of Gate addresses they can call. Then Daniel's wife is captured by Apophis and becomes his new queen. <br /> <br /> It continues in the second episode where General Hammond announces the formation of the SGC. This includes nine teams, in which Jack's team will be SG-1 consisting of Jack, Samantha and Daniel. They go to Chulak, a Goa'uld homeland to save Daniel's wife and another caught at Abydos called Ska'ra. They are captured, and just as Apophis orders to kill them and many other prisoners, rescue a Jaffa named Teal'c, First Prime or Apophis, and go to Earth, where he is part of SG 1. <br /> <br /> It was just the beginning of the adventure. In the course of the show they went to the past and the future, transferred to alternative realities, swollen bodies, old, met with alien races who called a rebel alliance of Goa'uld, called the Tok'ra, in which Samantha's Pa. a member, the Asgard, a cute little race in which we see Thor most times (he is Jack's buddy) and avoids worldwide disasters through teeth's countless times. <br /> <br /> The show was recently canceled but lasted for ten seasons. In the season nine revealed a new enemy called the Ori burning brand new powers, new dangers and new mysteries around the Stargate and its creators, the parents. Season nine and ten also launched two new characters, Ben Browder, as Cameron Mitchell, the new leader of SG-1 and Claudia Black as Vala MalDoran, a female from another world who has a new sense of fun bring for the team. <br /> <br /> Very well-produced, interesting characters, fantastic special effects and a subtle love affair between Samantha and Jack, this one has it all. Another way to travel the galaxy, and different kinds of adventures, is one show you don't want to miss. Unlock the gate and step through. You won't regret it!
