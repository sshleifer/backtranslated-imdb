I admit I didn't have an idea of ​​what to expect before viewing this highly stylized piece. It could have been the cure for a zombie virus or the cold for everything I knew. It started with great footage, small pieces to grab your attention and run your imagination. As it continued, I quickly learned through voices that took place. A nice little neo noir story I felt was not just a few minutes from my time. The small clues given to the audience at the beginning give them a sense of fulfillment as they work the plot together. Along with a nice twist to the end, it's a cool package in general. The score, though not bad, almost gave the movie a music video feel. It just felt a bit dated, and nothing added to the storyline. Some of the performances felt too dramatic, but perfectly matched the feel of the overall piece. I walk away from this very satisfied. I got a lot of information in a short time, but it didn't rush or push through big editing and voice work. Good work!
