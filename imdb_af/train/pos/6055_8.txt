I didn't expect much from this movie, but was very pleasantly surprised because it was light and funny and very well observed. The central trio of clashes with dead enders was surprisingly nice as they disturbed their way through their drug-centered journey to Wales. The humor was soft and subtle, just like the three characters (testifying to their sympathetic treatment of the old old lady shopkeeper). The atmosphere of rural Wales is perfectly captured, and the soundtrack is very well chosen. Sharp and carefully written, with great attention to detail. I have never seen such a realistic depiction of alternative culture - I felt I was there with them. Lots of contact and fun - not what you can expect from a movie about bikers and drugs. A delight on all fronts, and hard to criticize, although I thought the last two scenes were a bit crippled - the film had to end when they left Wales. But overall, an unexpected treasure of a movie.
