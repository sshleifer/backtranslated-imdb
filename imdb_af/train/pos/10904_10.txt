The most moving and truly eye-opening documentary ever created. I helped the whole road, from start to finish. To see the show, you are immediately caught by a man's struggle to live without pain, to live a life that we will take for granted. The first time I heard the title, I was almost scared to see the program. It was hard for me to understand every day of my life every day. I really felt for him. The saddest part of the documentary is when Jonny chooses his coffin. Can you imagine doing this? Yet, even though he was in indifferent and unbearable pain, he still opened his own love. (DEBRA) Jonny is one of the only people who deserve true respect and admiration, he is the definition of a role model, who was a true and unmistakable hero to him!
