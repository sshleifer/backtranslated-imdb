I find it so incredible that we have been talking about this movie for many years! Obviously this movie wasn't that bad, otherwise people wouldn't even talk about it. I personally enjoy this movie immensely, and still! I think this movie is not for everyone, but it certainly touched the hearts of many. <br /> <br /> As for those who think this movie is "overestimated" or "overheated" ... well, we just have the movie audience to thank for it! lol * You see, it's not CRITICAL / article writers that make a movie "BIG" or "HIT" with the general movie audience. People make the movie a great success. With Titanic everyone was in awe. Let's see it, a movie like this has never been made before. At least not with the special effects needed to really capture the essence of the ship. This movie is so accurate that even James Cameron ended the actual sinking of the ship in the movie with the REAL sinking that fateful day in April 1912. Even the silverware for kindness matched! <br /> <br /> Give this movie a break for you! The critics thought this movie would sink BIG time! When this movie actually came out and people with Word of MOND (being the best form of advertising) heard that it was a good / decent / movie worth seeing, everyone started to movie to the theaters in herds to see this movie. ... not once, not twice, but maybe 3 times and more! So, I really wouldn't say this movie is "overhyped" ... at least not as the rebuild for the MATRIX recharges or the HULK is overhyped. ha! Critics did not even think that Titanic would make enough money to cover Cameron's huge movie budget that it took to make this mammoth a movie. However, the film money has made the 200m budget and much more! <br /> <br /> Personally, I love this movie. However, this movie cannot be for everyone. Don't say this movie sucks just because of romance! That's the most sexual thing I've ever heard! Don't like a movie just because it has romance in it! The story was sweet. The dialogue could have been better, but let's see it ... the OWN star of the movie wasn't Leo or Kate ... it was the GIGANTIC ship! I think all the actors like DiCaprio and Winslet did a good job. It's not their best job (I've both seen BETTER work from both), but it wasn't the WORST I saw on the screen before. Give them a break! <br /> <br />
