I was just a little young for this one, but I had to see it. There are some excellent music, which many people have mentioned, but no one seems a very rare appearance by "Angel", a now mostly ignored but once quite popular musical outfit. Wearing their distinctive white outfits, they cut through the "20th Century Foxes", and apparently everyone is trying to penetrate the camera's vision field. Keyboardist Gregg Giuffria remains the tire highlight, and apparently never got much of a haircut! Cherie Currie (ex-Runaways singer) is starting a short but noteworthy acting career here, and is quite memorable with Jodie Foster and the rest. (Her topless 3-D scenes in "Parasite", and her UFO observation, in "Wavelength" we all looked at her for a while). <br /> <br /> It's not a masterpiece, but it keeps a bit of its time so everyone can watch and wonder.
