With the badly injured Tony in an induced coma, two things happen: Tony thinks he is leading the life of a salesman attending a business convention, while his family and friends are going through hell to try the possible loss of the big man handle. The dream sequence is straight from an old TWILIGHT ZONE episode, as Tony tries to turn him into an average Joe to handle a missing wallet and mixed identities while on a long-term business trip. His intonation as a blazer and khaki bear sknook is more mediocre and less that of an Italian thief by Noo Joisey. A fun touch. The shockingly long-haired, hippie-dippy AJ (who calls Paulie at one point "Van Helsing") has a nice scene with his old comatose. The best moment has the big boys trying to talk without Tony about life, which immediately breaks into a territorial dispute. Vito gets a line about the newly found gene, probably a cascade, which is interesting in light of what we are going to learn on Vito.
