Of all the versions of the Odyssey (or of any Greek mythological story) it is in my opinion the best of them all. Almost true to the original storyline - with some minor deviations and omissions, eg. the absence of Scylla & Charybdis and the fact that Eumaeus recognizes the shepherd dog Odysseus in disguise in his hut - realistic plays and old-fashioned scenery and costumes, all contribute to this a memorable masterpiece, not a Hollywood sword-and-sandals B movie. Despite the fact that the dialogue and subtitles are entirely in Italian, he can still make the head and tail of what is going on and what the actors say (provided you have a good handy text from the Odyssey). At least I did, and so much so that it inspired me to study the Italian language to appreciate the movie even more.
