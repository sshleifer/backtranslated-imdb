I really enjoyed this debut by Ring Director, Hideo Nakata. If you've seen Ring in advance, you'll be familiar with the style and idea of ​​this movie. It has a subtle spookiness about what works better than the constant (and predictable) stingers that infect most mainstream movies of this genre. If you like movies that give you the chills, you'll probably like this one. A good, creepy debut by Hideo Nakata. 8/10
