I think it has the potential to be the best Star Trek series, but I say POTENTIAL. We all know there is a chance they will drop the ball and run out of ideas. BUT I DO NOT HOPE! For those who didn't see it. SEE IT! Without that annoying "PRIME DIRECTIVE", every time they float over their heads, it can be cool. And Scott Bakula was undoubtedly a BIG CHOICE for Captain, and the Vulcan Babe is also hot (Look at the disinfectant scene) I gave it a VOL 10 ... it blows away all the other series of openers. I hope it's been over 7 years ...
