When I got the movie in the schedule for Christmas, the title didn't make me known since I didn't read the novel and didn't hear anything about the movie. Yet, after reading the content, I decided to spend my Christmas night watching the movie. The effect completely surprised me: I do not remember when I last saw a movie involving me every moment. A VOW TO CHERISH is undoubtedly one of the movies that is now a real surprise I received from the theater. Here are some of my arguments why I consider this film a highly understated movie. <br /> <br /> First, the entire content is particularly educational. It offers something to the modern audience - pure faith and some answers to universal questions. Is there a need for Christ in our time? Does love still matter? What is faith for? What is the logic of burden and suffering in life? Is there really someone next to me can I always trust? The movie presents the answers through the content, as anything that happens to the characters can work so well with any of us. <br /> <br /> Second, the movie is extremely human. The main characters experience inner struggle and handle extremely difficult decisions. Is it better for Kyle David Denman) and Teri (Megan Paul) to start their own lives and forget about the family or keep the values ​​taught at home? Is it better for John (Ken Howard) to leave Ellen (Barbara Babcock), his sick wife, and start a new happy life with Julia (Donna Bullock), a woman he falls in love with? In fact, Ellen doesn't admit him anymore ... Yet he decides to promise his WYS eternal faithfulness. Did John's rebellious brother Phil (D. David Morin) go better on his easy life, though it did not bring him satisfaction or once thought seriously about his life. Phil's prayer to God in the park is a psychological masterpiece of universal aspect of mankind. These words can also be said as well by everyone, no matter where, when or how they live. <br /> <br /> Third, the movie is a good portrayal of family, not very popular these days: there are problems, there is always something more powerful that these people gather. This "something" is love and trust. I know it may look a bit idealistic. Not all families can rely on fidelity and it shouldn't be that simple. Yet it is a very educational aspect and a realistic one. <br /> <br /> Fourth, the entire film focuses on people's mutual help. If we want happy lives in our society, we need to understand one thing: we need to help each other. Alexander (Ossie Davis) is an example of such an attitude. At the beginning of the movie we see him talking to John about praying. Later he helps his brother. Alexander is a kind of "angel" sent to John and his family. Isn't it possible that we become angels for one another? <br /> <br /> Fifth, the artistic features are also worthwhile. PERFORMANCE: Barbara Babcock gives a real show as Ellen and although she has a difficult role, she does a perfect job. For example, think of the moment she appears at school and wants to learn again. Ken Howard is also unforgettable as the faithful man. PICTURE: The most memorable for me was the scene of John and Ellen in the park falling on autumn leaves (autumn) while sunshine (love) spreads everywhere. I interpret as a kind of symbol: though sad, it can always be illuminated by light and joy. <br /> <br /> A FET TO CHERISH is a wonderful movie that has shown me realistically what it means To love, how reliable it is, proved me again how beautiful it is to live and to believe. In the end I would like to quote the in-depth words from the movie. I have become very touched and hope you will. <br /> <br /> Kyle to his uncle Phil: Yes, he (John Brighton) lives by the Bible. But no one forces you to do it. Yet, according to which rules do you live?
