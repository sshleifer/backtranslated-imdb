OLIVER TWIST had to have controversy as well as success after publishing it in 1837. Dickens published it in 1837. His picture of life in the urban ghettos was something shocking and new, and making the central figures of the novel include criminals. /> <br /> One day he went to London and passed a young woman with whom he was friendly. He said hello, but she was pretty stiff with him. He couldn't understand it. A few days later they met again, and he asked what he had done to upset her. "Well, if you need to know, I didn't know your last novel." "Really, everyone thinks a lot about it." He was surprised: "What's wrong with that?" "Oh, Charles," she said. "I'm Jewish. How can you make such a character like Fagin?" He didn't expect it: "Well, you know the trial last year of Ikey Solomon, the thief trainer. He's a model for Fagin and he was Jewish." <br /> <br /> Dickens found it not finished. "Yes," she replied, "He did what he deserved. But Charles, they do not call him" Solomon the Jew "as you call Fagin" the Jew. "Furthermore, Solomon did not plan a murder. admitted that he could be taken away. He kept thinking about what she said. <br /> <br /> Oliver Twist was published in various editions, and Dickens tried to improve on Fagin, and then he got an idea He reviewed the chapter called "Fagin's Last Night Alive", which showed the fears in the man, and added additional details. <br /> <br /> He let his female friend know about his decision to Fagin A day or so he met her at a friend's house, looking at him as if he were crazy. "Didn't you keep the changes?" he asked. "Charles, who's changing - he is still a bad villain named the Jew! "she replied." Yes, I kept them, but did not see how frightened he was in the death cells in prison. " It noticed, but felt that he was so dirty that he had to suffer such fears. "Oh ... then I was right about that ... and you saw the little details I added?" He asked. "What details?" She replied. "Once you see Fagin, he cooks himself meals ... you read it?", Dickens looks at her and expects a sign of recognition. Instead, the woman looks confused. "I read that he was at the fireplace, but I had to grind the hallway." Dickens smiled as if he were brilliant: "He makes a pig sausage for his dinner." "What!" She exclaimed. "He eats pork, my dear ... see - he's not a good Jew!" His friend looked at him, shook her head, and after his dismay, their friend's house ran away. She didn't talk to him for years. <br /> <br /> Dickens never shook his own bigotries completely, but the situation led to a partial attempt to change into his last completed novel. IN OUR MUTUAL FRIEND (1865) he has a minor character, Mr. Riah, used by an unscrupulous landlord to collect high rents from poor tenants. The landlord testifies that Riah will be blamed for being Jewish. <br /> <br /> But Mr. Riah is a good man. He is a very good man. He is a very, very, very, very good man - so good to be incredible. As Fagin mr. Seeing Riah in action, he would probably chase him away with a stick. <br /> <br /> The antisemitic image of Fagin lingers to this day. It is a bit of Dickens's genius as author that the novel overcomes it. If you present the story on film, however, it still causes trouble for writers and directors: how can you, after the Holocaust, do a filming of a worthy novel without disturbing cartoons? David Lean showed how Alec Guiness appeared in one or two scenes showing a human side and confronting a gang at the end with true dignity. Sir Carol Reed, in his musical version of the novel, did it even better because of a rewrite in the original musical. <br /> <br /> OLIVER was made in a West End musical hit in the mid-1960s, and then taken to Broadway where it was again a hit. With a wonderful score by Lionel Bart, including "Food Glorious Food", "I'm the Situation Review", "Consider Yourself", "Boy for Sale", "Who will buy", "As long as he needs me have "deserve this success. Reed performed well in his role play, including his cousin Oliver Reed and Sykes, Ron Moody as Fagin, Mark Lester such as Oliver, Jack Wild as the Dodger, Shani Wallis as Nancy and Harry Secombe as Mr. Bumble. There was no major musical success in Hollywood for a decade. The last musical to win the Best Picture Oscar was GIGI in 1958. OLIVER won it in 1968. <br /> <br /> And Fagin - how about the eternal problem of caricature? Well in the musical Fagin is not caught, tried and executed for the murder that was committed. After all, even Lean tried Fagin to control his ally in his actions. But here Fagin realizes that he is getting too old to be dependent on this kind of chancy life. Although he lost his treasures (those stolen items he kept on knowing their value and admiring their beauty), he decided he could reform. He was allowed to do so, accompanied by his faithful acolytes, the Artful Dodger. I don't think Dickens would have appreciated the change (his female friend might have), but a modern audience certainly accepts it as appropriate.
