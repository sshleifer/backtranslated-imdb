Casting Jack Cassidy as Ken Frankin was pure shine. Cassidy embodies arrogance, trust, charm and white - all with a condescending, evil little smile on his face. According to me, Jack Cassidy is by far the best killer (who appeared three times) in the Columbo series. This particular (and first) show is my favorite Columbo episode ever - hands off. An excuse Steven Spielberg had amazing camera work (yes, there were some camera shadows on the actors), capturing the nuances and crooks at different and intriguing corners between Columbo and Franklin. Also the panoramic and sharp shots at Big Bear Lake, CA (Franklin's cabin house) were very impressive. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen this episode yet, then you're guilty of doing it - it's a real masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Jack Cassidy was a very talented actor and singer. His charismatic personality was highly contagious. His death in 1976, at the age of 49, was very sad and indeed very tragic - he certainly had his best years in front of him. Rest in peace Jack, you will live forever through your great work.
