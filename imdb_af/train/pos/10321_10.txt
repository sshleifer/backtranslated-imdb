Most people miss Hollywood's concept point. If a hero can stimulate heroic deeds to the mind of a child, I accept the lessons taught by Doc Savage. <br /> <br /> At all times of conflict or war, the Public and Government are looking for heroes to decorate. The film industry brings heroes on the screen that people can identify - such as Doc Savage, James Bond, Superman, Batman, Spiderman and others. Doc Savage is remembered by more than one generation as the 'best of the best' for James Bond, Superman or any of the others. All others who follow Sav Savage are only part of the character, not the 'Bronze Man'.
