For anyone who may not know what a one-actor movie was, this is the best example. This plot is ridiculous and really makes no sense. It's full of cleaved situations, chopped lines, melodrama, comedy ... you call it! <br /> <br /> But Amitabh Bachchan can make anything convincing, and this movie is by no means an exception. Everybody turns in a decent performance - Shashi Kapoor, Waheeda Rehman, Ranjit, Om Prakash, Smita Patil ... But this is the Megastar that overshadows everyone with its teasing presence. Without him, this movie would have been a non-starter ... The story is about separation / wrong identities / misunderstandings / love / hate / loyalty / good vs evil - everything, really! Amitabh's is a brilliant show on all counts, in an otherwise silly movie! And did I mention it's ridiculously funny?
