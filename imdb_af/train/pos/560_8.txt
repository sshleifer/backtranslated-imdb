Another very good Mann movie thanks to the father / son combination of Walter Brennan and Jimmy Stewart. Brennan (Ben Tatum) is often the comic conscience of Stewart or Wayne (Red River / Rio Bravo). He is there to see that the younger man forks or bends the ride. "You're wrong Mr. Dunston". Jeff Webster (Stewart) gives the impression that he cares only for himself, but it is clear that he cannot leave Brennan. John McIntire is excellent as the law of Skagway, taking into account the case law on its reality. Another important theme is helping people and helping people in turn. The loner cannot do it and suffer for it. <br /> <br /> The caption above plays on Tatum's claim that he cannot live without his coffee. This nicotine addiction proves deadly. Probably the first and last time on the screen. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie and now own the DVD.
