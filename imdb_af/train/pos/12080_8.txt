Julia Ross (Nina Foch) agrees as a secretary with the rich Hughes family to come over her boyfriend who leaves her. Almost immediately she is swollen and sent to the family's estate in Cornwall. When she wakes up, she tells her she is Marion Hughes, is mentally ill and keeps her locked up ... but why?

(B pictures were low budget photos made quickly with low budgets and no big stars). It's just as long as it needs to be (just 65 minutes), is well-targeted, fast and exciting. Fuck (a good actress) is just OK, but Dame May Witty is great and George Macready is excellent (and frightening). ) than the villains. Well got to catch. A perfect example of how to make a good movie on a small budget.
