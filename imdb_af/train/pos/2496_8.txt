No refuse - no where even near garbage. Not an original one? That's the last thing that could be said of 2.4 children. Predictable? definitely not! Although it was a little unusual for the BBC, it was hilarious, funny and witty. I especially liked Belinda Lang and John Pickard - who I believe was wonderful. Gary Olsen was also very good and so were all the other members. I was quite new why it was yesterday to read about Gary Olsen's death at a relatively young age. I wish they would make more comedy of this kind, much more of them (and show them here in Israel) .Dumbs up!
