The final installment in the action-thriller franchise is just the most likely of the three films. It's going to play the anti-Bond theme. Bourne doesn't like what he does and wants to know about his vague passing. Everything about this film hits it on the nail of cinematography to choreography / stuntwork on stage to stage. <br /> <br /> The movie starts to run like a Moscow police force. The story looks straight where the first movie has left. Or do this? The time is a bit confused here, but we get the fact that Bourne remembers things. A sudden jump-up while trying to clear him, almost gets him fixed, but he makes it and doesn't kill anyone. They are not his target. From there we get more of the plot of his past with a new player, Noah Vosen, who wants to know everything about Bourne and will protect it at all costs. Pamela Landy is also back, as well as Nicky Parsons, who also has a past with Bourne. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is in your face and follows virtually everything. The car hunt is even more intense as it may seem like the first two. And the veteran throw Bourne is wonderful with a nice part by Albert Finney. It also has some political overtones in relation to the transition and other government policies, but it is small and integrates well within the plot. All in all, this is the best of the trilogical conclusions this year, if not the best action trilogy ever.
