I find Alan Jacobs's review very accurate with regard to the movie, but I had the opportunity to rent the DVD from the blocker with a comment from BYU's Curator, Motion Picture Archives James D'Arc. The then LDS prophet Heber J. Grant approved the film of the deviations of historical content for dramatic expression and telescope events. For example, the movie tried Joseph Smith. in spite of Brigham Young's great conviction in defense of Joseph Smith, he was found guilty anyway. Then Joseph was killed. Historically, Joseph Smith was never found guilty of anything. Brigham Young was in Boston when Joseph Smith was arrested for this particular trial. Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum, both of whom died before the trial.
