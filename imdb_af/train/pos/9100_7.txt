Spanish films are in a, if not Golden, definitely a Silver Age. Pi√©dras is another example of a movie that takes people and their conflict seriously. Although the feelings are strong or almost at the level of life or death, they are still not really melodramatic. This can happen. <br /> <br /> There are different stories here that are connected. The one is about the delayed girl, who does not force the street to go to the next block. The one is about the middle-aged woman who finds the lover of her life in a foot fetishist. Another is about the girl with drug problems whose lover leaves her. Another is about the treacherous of a brothel who (almost) finds true love. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing. It is in Spain, the filmmakers take women seriously.
