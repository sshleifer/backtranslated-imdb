Walking between the comedy and drama is one of the most difficult actions in the theater. How do you laugh at other people's misery and don't feel bad if it goes too long? <br /> <br /> Well, this surprising jewel of a movie will be big, big laugh, beautiful scenery and pretty big. a good buzz as well. I especially like the notion that a trick of history made alcohol legal because white Europeans loved it, and marijuana illegally, since 'those other races' used it ... undoubtedly true and uncovered a racial side to the marijuana laws that are so openly whispered by populations around the world. <br /> <br /> An extraordinary "DVD Extra" comment ... two of them in fact ... run through the whole movie with both the actors, and then again with the authors. I saw how things I was sure were not in the first movie, but then realized how easy it was to miss the subtle comedy at first. What a hoot! Don't miss it! 9/10 stars
