An old man living in the mountains wakes up one morning and loses his cat. He wandered the forest to testify to a murder, but did he see the murder or lose it? Does he get old? The movie is so good because the viewer has to make up their own minds about what is going on. There is very little dialogue in this movie, but it does not need words, the whole movie speaks for itself. You knew what was going on and I liked it. <br /> <br /> The other part I liked was the shots of the forest in late autumn and winter. It was beautiful, but the only thing I didn't like was the view of the old man in his underwear. He could have tied the mantle a little tighter, but unlike that, it was a pretty deep film.
