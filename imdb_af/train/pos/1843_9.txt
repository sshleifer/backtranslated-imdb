This drama is different from Sex and the City, where women have a few drinks and share their sexual encounters. It's much more personal and people can relate to it. It is much more enticing and emotionally new than other women's and their lives, such as "Sex and the City, Lipstick Jungle ...." <br /> <br /> Dr. Katie Roden, a psychologist with a dark secret, looks much more depressed and guilty than the rest of her 3 friends. She's about the death of her former lover who was patient while his son's progress was being tackled on her. Her gloomy clothes and empty and cold house convey her very well in emotions. <br /> <br /> A widow, Trudi Malloy, is having trouble releasing her dead husband from 9/11. And as an attractive stranger, Richard shows an interest in her, she is suddenly forced to do a reality test by her friends indicating that she is returning to dating affairs. The ridiculous and embarrassing court performance between Richard and Trudi is quite funny! It is interesting to note that Richard asks her to get millions of 9/11 advice for her husband's death. See how she's intentions. <br /> <br /> Siobhan Dillon, a lawyer, is full of her husband's love-making tactics that just "baby make" (as they struggle to conceive) and she quickly falls to her colleague who services offers a little too willing and doesn't hesitate long! Interesting to see if she will continue her relationship with her husband (played by Raza Jeffrey). Jessica, a real estate businesswoman is single and straightforward until she arranges a lesbian wedding and has a relationship with one of them. Her character is shown as a brave and challenging woman who, before her lesbian encounter, has sex with a "married man", her colleague. Let's see where her character dares. It's also a good thing that the drama reveals that sometimes friends lie to each other to be safe!
