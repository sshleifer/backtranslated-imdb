It's a good movie, although people who are unfamiliar with the Modesty Blaise comics and books may find it a bit slow and won't be in action. For the Modesty fan, the movie will be very enjoyable, especially as it is very faithful in the presentation of the Modesty Blaise "History". Peter O'Donnell is listed in the credits as "Creative Consultant" and the filmmakers actually have to pay attention as the plot thoroughly recreates the details presented in the comic books over the years. The only thing the true fan might find disappointing is that there is no Willie Garvin in the story. This lack of Willie is only true to the Modesty Blaise chronology since the movie took place in the early days of Modesty's career. Alexandra Staden makes a very credible young modesty that looks very much like it. Modesty is supposed to look. A welcome change from the travesty of the Monica Vitti depiction of Modesty.
