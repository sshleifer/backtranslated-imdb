Dumbland is not for everyone. In fact, Dumbland may be for no one but Lynch and it makes it funny and a collective cartoon. Violent? Yes. Swear? Yes. Absurd? Yes. A piece of garbage? Never. Dumbland is a wonderful picture of some Americans who have no brain and touch women and children for fun. From Mexico I can say I love it! My favorite episodes are: 1- My teeth bleed, all the sound around and violence let me scream and sit behind my bed. 2- Get the stick! Yes, baby gets it and teaches a lesson: some people are never thankful for your actions. 3 ants. The more Lynch episode of everything, music, surrealism and a lot of sweet revenge ...
