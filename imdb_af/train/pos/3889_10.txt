Eddie Izzard is nothing less than a comic genius, and Eddie is at its best. His material is extremely greasy and hilarious, and his delivery is among the best ever seen on stage. Instead of insulting the audience's intelligence, he trusts to draw humor from his wardrobe preferences, Hitler, the moon landing and the British. With so many memorable laughs, you can't help repeating some of his lines. Forever more, "Do you have a flag?" should be considered one of the funniest lines ever made in an essay routine. Every fan of top-of-the-top comedy should see "Dress to Kill". By far the best British uprising competition I have ever seen, Eddie Izzard struggled for the success of the live stage. However, his lack of commercial success in film should not be indicative of how highly talented he really is. "Dress to Kill" is a treasure, one that has happily found its way to home video, and can and should and must be enjoyed again.
