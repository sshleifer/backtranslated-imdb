I just saw this movie in a sneak preview and all I can say is ... "What did I just watch ????" And I mean it in a good and bad way. <br /> <br /> The plot is really simple. Quieter and Black play friends / neighbors. Stiller is the focused hard worker while Black is a dreamer. Black intends this idea to create a spray that wipes out powder. The idea becomes very popular, and Swart becomes very rich. The exuberant lifestyle that Black gets, and the fact that he's still trying to be the best friends with Stiller, makes Stiller envious. <br /> <br /> As I said, the plot is simple. Everything else is simply strange. The direction is strange, with a strange rotating opening shot at out-of-the-box sequences. The dialouge and the acting are very strange; strange in a slap way. And the soundtrack is the strangest thing in the movie, from the weird "Envy" song that appears again to the scene, where you think you're going to hear a classic 80 song, but suddenly it's in Japanese. <br /> <br /> So, the real question is ... is weird funny? It depends entirely on the individual. I was cracking the unashamedness of the movie. After the show I heard people calling it terribly unfunny and glad it was free. Strange, I understood their point. There are no jokes whatsoever, so if you are not hung by the uniqueness of everything, you will hate this movie. Absolutely hate it. <br /> <br /> This movie is meant to lose a lot of cash at the cash register and become a DVD cult classic. If you can laugh at a movie with no real jokes, like Cable Guy or Punch Drunk Love, then I suggest you see it. If you don't, walk away from this movie. It just hurts you.
