It's one of those movies that no brain or mind needs, it's a very funny time you have forgotten in the next hour or so. I was really surprised by John Abraham's play. He usually plays the gangster like character with the emotional face, thus playing the complete opposite and making it successful by shining between the comic geniuses such as Paresh Rawal and Akshaye Kumar. I was also very surprised by the Akshaye's 3 girls because there is not much talent, but mostly about Akshaye's dissapearence (opposite the other girls), I was surprised they managed to figure out and real persona and you distinguish between them being a good thing, also the majority of songs are good, it is colorful and fun, so on a boring Sunday evening, it will ease your mood.
