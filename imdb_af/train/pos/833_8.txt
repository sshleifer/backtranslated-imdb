First, I want to say the director has a wonderful use of titles in his solid shots. I really enjoyed them. I really enjoyed this movie, but I told Pierce Brosnan, Greg Kinear is pretty dark. Brosnan melts so well in this character, that it's really hard to remember that it's the same guy who played. It also shows its scope and depth as an actor. It's kind of an indie movie and was really nice to see especially with all the mainstream movies flooding the movies at this time of year. I found the characters well made. The twist in the middle that I felt was especially good. I also liked how the characters came down realistically. So many times in characters we have this caricature of people who are not really characters but walking stereotypes. I like the different approaches this movie takes. I think sideways when I think of this movie, but I think it's more viewable and a better movie overall ...
