Perhaps it was because of the history of the Irish problems in the 1920s and then the sad Civil War that the Free State engulfed after the signing of the treaty before the movie. Anyway, the sudden turn at the end brought tears to my eyes. <br /> <br /> Victor McLaglen is not as famous today as he was, and he had to be better remembered. In this movie, I think he plays himself as he would have been without his innate talent and brain. For example, the screens where his friend in the crowd challenges men to fight with him are probably quite reminiscent of what McLaglen actually did in previous years when he was a world-class bastard boxer. John Ford is partly responsible for that; The IMDb trivia section shows how he got McLaglen tied up to get a very bad hangover for the trial scene. This director can also bring a lot into his actors, even without such tricks. However, McLaglen is mostly in control, especially if his character is almost completely blots (which is difficult for an actor to make credible) and he also plays Gypo Nolan with a deep and emotional power that is surprising to anyone just McLaglen later in his career in "The Quiet Man." saw. I especially like the contrast between this role as an IRA man and the much more naturally controlled performance he gave to Hangman's House as the IRA man Denis Hogan. <br /> <br /> In the silent man, of course, McLaglen is a rifle against the local IRA. Victor McLaglen was big and bully, in the old-fashioned sense, but he was also a good actor and capable of wide variety and fine nuances of performance that we would not expect from such a man today. This is a very sad comment about our own set of expectations and prejudices. <br /> <br /> As usual, Ford packs a lot of film. All the characters are excellent (although the Commandant's mostly American accent is distracting). NOTE: There are spoilers for! - To know that Gypo once drew the short straw and was ordered to kill a man, but let him get out of it, we really put the man pulling the short straw to run Gypo, and Mankind shows him most especially when they take Gypo in Mary's room. <br /> <br /> John Ford really shows his genius here and takes what could be a horrific yet expected outcome for the whole story and rather uses it to make a totally unexpected and yet very satisfying end Don't just think of Gypo and the other characters, but of poor Ireland during that tortured time.
