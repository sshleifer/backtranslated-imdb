With lots of sunshine, glowing light and shadow filtering through windows and in rooms, shots that go through crowds with hand-held camera, quick editing and extreme close ups follow here and there, photography is the thing in this interesting, artistic film. <br /> <br /> The plot of this movie starts out as a little fluff about a beauty contest. The film starts on a hot Sunday at the local swimming pool, where we meet the sweet Lucienne aka Lulu (played by Louise Brooks) - a little show before the gawking men next to the pool, she soon decides to enter France into the beauty competition of the Miss. Suggest Europe, much to the chagrin of her very jealous, in-the-mud fianc√© (a very annoying fellow, really). The ten contestants show themselves in swimsuit, while the winner is chosen as the longest applause participant (I wondered, could the girls not only slow down to extend their time - and therefore applause - on the catwalk?!) . Lulu is soon being chased by a prince and a Maharaja, but her hot-tempered beau doesn't like the attention paid by other men or her lovers of the public. It's really that he just wants to cook her in his home. Louise Brooks is beautiful and charming, helping her to improve this movie, but it's really the way it is photographed, which kept my interest the most. . A bit distracting is the oddly baptized sound, which is a bit off. The pressure on this version looks very clear and full of beautiful contrast. When I watched it, I just tried to overtake the sound problems and visually watch the movie, and I found the movie to be excellent, worth seeing.
