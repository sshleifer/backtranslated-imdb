This movie sat in front of me on my Tivo for weeks. I feared a self-supporting yuppie movie about bad relationships. I was wrong; It was an impressive outing in New York's devouring libido. <br /> <br /> The format is the same as Max Ophuls 'La Ronde,' based on a play by Arthur Schnitzler, who is "inspired by" credit. It starts from one person, a prostitute, standing on a street corner in Brooklyn. She is picked up by a home contractor, who has sex with her on the car's car, but can't come. He refuses to pay her. When he looks down, she answers his cellphone and takes a message. She walks away with his keys. <br /> <br /> The story then switches to the contractor, who pays a professional call to a rich, bored New York woman playing with him until he wakes up, then pulls away. She tells him how desperate and unhappy she is; He tells her how beautiful she is and happy. As he left, she asked if he would have sex with her. She sat on top of him, jumped up and down. This time he comes, the one he leaves. <br /> <br /> The wife and her husband throw dinner for their trendy friends. Hubby (Robert) speaks business, wife (Ellen) bored, and switches the subject to sex, and how often do men and women think about it. Man changes conversations to desert. Later, after the guests leave, Ellen tries to seduce Robert. Robert doesn't want anything and puts a jazz record on it. Ellen turns on the radio; Robert shows the music; Ellen turns on the TV; Robert turns on another TV. Cacophony occurs. Ellen goes on the roof, Robert joins her. Ellen confesses that she must experience more men, other men than Robert. Robert says he must also experience men. <br /> <br /> We are following Robert as he visits an artist, Martin, played by Steve Buscemi. I wish Buscemi could have more roles like this, where he was a sexy, smart, totally desirable man. Robert praises Martin's work, much more than it deserves, promising to get it in a show. Martin is excited, until it turns out that Robert is speaking out of his groin, it's all a mating dance. Robert tries to kiss Martin on the lips, and Martin goes back and says he's not gay. Robert claims he is not gay, Martin scoffs. Both acknowledge that the artworks are bad. Robert goes over, when Martin allows Robert to kiss him. They make out, and Robert goes to Martin. <br /> <br /> Next we follow Martin as he prepares for an art show at a Manhattan gallery. He is beaten by Rosario Dawson, the receptionist, Anna. (I had to cut some of these reviews to keep it under 1000 words) ... and they love each other. <br /> <br /> We'll follow Anna, who will sit down for lunch. Her boyfriend, Nick (Adrian Grenier), comes in, flowers. She is cold to him; He's trying to figure out why. He cherished her information that she had sex with someone while in San Francisco. She cherished the fact that he had stayed with his ex-gf while he was in San Francisco and had sex with her. The latter revelation seems to be a lie. The two of them break out in the lunch, but she decides to break up. Nick is sad. <br /> <br /> And we follow Nick, who confesses his problems to an older woman he meets at a park bench, Joey (Carol Kane). Joey is kind of weird and childish, but is a good audience for Nick, who needs a sympathetic ear. The two of them go to Coney Island at night and watch the stars. Nick falls under Joey's game, despite the age difference between them. They go back to Joey's apartment, and Nick gradually realizes he wants sex with a crazy old woman. She's on top of him, doesn't want to let him go. But he manages to escape. <br /> <br /> (This is by far the best Carol Kane role since she played Latke's wife in Taxi.) Joey's phone rang and it's a man calling the psychic friends network. , and Joey is one of the psychic friends. Although she has still been hurt by Nick, she gradually comes into her psychic shit. The man is at his office late at night and wants to have sex with her. Although not Joey's business, Joey goes along and cherishes the man to come. She wants to keep talking, although the man wants to get rid of the phone and find out that he has obscured much money from his company and will be found out tomorrow. His life was ruined. Joey realizes that the man is committing suicide, and she tries to make him believe she is his friend, that she cares for him. And she cares for him. <br /> <br /> But the man picks up a gun in his briefcase and goes out to look for a prostitute on the Brooklyn waterfront, and we come back to the beginning, to the same prostitute La Ronde begins. She wants to give him $ 75,000 cash if she'll kill him. He tried to kill himself, but couldn't do it. The prostitute does not want to, but he insists, holds her hand, holds the gun inside his mouth and tells her where to go. Eventually the gun goes off and we see the prostitute walking down the street and coming to the corner where she usually does business. The contractor who didn't pay her earlier, rolls in the movie, rolls down the window. They look at each other. THE END.
