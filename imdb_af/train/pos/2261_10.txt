I saw this movie, and the play, and I have to add that it was the most touching story I've ever seen. Until I saw this movie, I was unaware of how terrible life was and probably still for the South African children and adults who lived and lived in that era. It brought tears to my eyes and very sad in my heart that anyone should struggle to live just like that and bring the children straight out of the area and teach them to act and preform and release them. making to tell their own story is simply amazing. It only exceeds a five star, I rate it a ten. Thank you Mr Mbongeni Ngema for such an amazing story. Although it's been 12 years since this story was told, it's still one that is hard in my heart. If there is a VHS or DVD out there on the play, please thank my ASAP. Thank you. PS There was nothing wrong with the children who wanted to bring awareness of their problems and conditions to other people, hoping someone would have a heart and help.
