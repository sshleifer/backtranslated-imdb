It is an extensive (4 hour) remake of the Rider Haggard story, with the ordinary female woman and an extraordinary subplot with Russian soldiers seeking a "Stone of Power" buried with the treasure of King Solomon. It was very well shot, giving a lively sense of wide open spaces in Africa and doing very well. Patrick Swayze is an excellent Alan Quatermain, and Allison Doody is attractive as Elizabeth Maitland, who rents Quatermain to help save her father. Sidede Onyulo as Umbopa, Gavin Hood as McNabb and the leader of Russian soldiers (not mentioned in IMDb's list) is also memorable. For everything that Hollywood can't just leave a good story when they adjust it, this one is well-told and, besides being too long, I enjoyed it. 10/06.
