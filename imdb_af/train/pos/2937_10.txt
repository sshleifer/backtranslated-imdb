I know it's rough, and I know it's not a computer at all, but it's so funny. If you can set it in the early 80's, it's from the early 80's and it all bears the stereotypes of the time - and the movie still makes you almost laugh - if it's really a good comedy. Going with the tradition of what comedies have been for thousands of years, the subject of this movie is extremely. If you can suspend your political correctness for an hour and a half, just to have an overall laugh, than to see it, please see it. <br /> <br /> P.S. Will anyone please post it on DVD, it's so hard to find on VHS.
