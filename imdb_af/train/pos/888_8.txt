One of the better kung fu movies, but not quite as flawless as I hoped to give the glowing reviews. The movie starts well enough, with the jokes visually enough to translate the language barrier (which is less than you think for this era) and make the non-fight dialogue sequence fitting (for a kung fu movie it's a big one compliment). Unlike other Chinese action movies, which were always periodic pieces, or (in the wake of Jackie Chan's Police Story I) cop dramas, Pedicab Driver gives us a glimpse of contemporary rural China. Unfortunately, in the latter 1/3 of the movie, it took a nose in the dark melodrama tragedy I thought was unnecessary. <br /> <br /> The action is generally good, with a duel between Sammo and 1/2 of the Shaw Brothers' only 2 stars, Kar-Leung Lau and then a fight at the end with that bigger guy who always plays Jet Li's bad guy. There is only 20 minutes of battle, which is standard, but which annoys me is the obvious acceleration of the camera frames. I get their half speed film to hurt each other, but there are smooth changes and then there is. It really takes away from the battles when it is so obvious that the imagery is messing up. <br /> <br /> That said, if you like kung fu movies, my opinion won't break you down, and if you don't, you just wasted 2 minutes of your life reading it.
