When I watch the two brothers mix each other through the movie and come apart, I personally am happy to live in the countryside, as they did in the movie. I watched this movie many times and had the book right next to my Bible. After watching the movie, I agree that this is one of the few movies that does a fairness. I strongly recommend anyone who has the chance to go to Montana to be fishing or outside to do so. It is wonderful. I can't think of anyone who can play the role better than Brad Pitt. Do yourself and look at one of the better movies in the modern film era. Highly recommended And as a guide for fishing excursions in Montana and Wyoming, try not to learn how to fly fish out of the movie, because although it looks good on the movie, you have no idea how much exercise and skill fishing actually takes. Thank you for listening Please watch this movie if you want a long sad movie.
