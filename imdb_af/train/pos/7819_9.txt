What a movie! I never thought Richard Attenborough could have such a movie in him. Gandhi always left me indifferent, apart from Ben Kingsley's performance, and I never saw Attenborough as a very good filmmaker. But Cry Freedom has kept my interest as little movies lately. It is an exciting, captivating political film featuring great performances by Kevin Kline and a young Denzel Washington. <br /> <br /> Kline plays Donald Woods, a newspaper editor of South Africa who befriends civil rights activist Steve Biko. It starts out as a difficult friendship, as Woods sees Biko as a black supremacist who preaches hatred for whites. But Biko, with his kind words, sincere attitude and complete transparency, wins over Woods and introduces him to a reality about Apartheid where Woods knew nothing. <br /> <br /> Biko is a decent, just citizen who is altruistically opposed to all bias and the system his people hold down. One night, from an illegal meeting, he was arrested and beaten. The authorities are trying to resolve the matter because Biko has become a great personality in South Africa. But through Woods' efforts, the truth comes out. But what a triumph becomes just a nightmare, as Woods and his family become targets for the secret police. <br /> <br /> This movie has an interesting structure. It actually has two narratives: first it tells Biko's life and death. It's a wonderful first half, totally dominated by Washington's charisma that may still be its best performance. <br /> <br /> The second half, no less interesting, tells Woods's attempt to escape South Africa to publish a book about Biko. Woods has become a state finder, a forbidden person, meaning he can't meet or leave his country. Plus, he is constantly being tracked by the police. Kevin Kline also gives a good performance in the second half. <br /> <br /> Although the first half is fairly straightforward, do the second interesting things about editing, by giving Biko flashbacks and events that suppress the black South Africans. Some may argue it is to make it more interesting, but for me the second half as fascinating as Woods and his family are proposing a bold plan to escape South Africa. <br /> <br /> The last minute was so heartbreaking. was in tears. George Fenton and Jonas Gwangwa's score certainly had something to do with it. Although I have never been a fan of Fenton (can't get his Gandhi score), I think the score for Cry Freedom is one of the most beautiful ever made for cinema. The movie, thanks to the music that is married to the powerful images, sometimes reached incredible emotions. <br /> <br /> Cry Freedom is definitely not a movie that should only be watched by Denzel Washington. It's a movie that has to be nurtured in its entirety. Acting, writing, music, editing, cinematography come together in a perfect synthesis to create an ode to the power of the human spirit. This movie deserves a place with movies like The Pianist, Life Is Beautiful and The Shawshank Redemption.
