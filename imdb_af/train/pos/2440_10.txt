OH WOW. On March 12, 2000, I watched this film at the Irish International Film Fleadh in Manhattan. Both stars were attending and were then available for questions. WHAT A GORGEOUS MOVIE! Although it occurred in Ireland amidst Catholic / Protestant antagonism, the story could happen anywhere between any two groups of people who hate each other. The horror of how fast people can be chased away when they have the chance to evade their hatred and anger is beautifully woven with a moving love story that is immersed in humor and fun. If this one is not included in the US, it will really be a pity. <br /> <br /> As for the stars and supporting players ... FIRST RATE. They call Orla Brady the Irish Meryl Streep, I heard. This is my opinion that she is BETTER than Meryl Streep. They must call Meryl the American Orla Brady! And Liam Cunningham's steady and powerful portrayal of a simple and private man sucked into a political war was brilliant. <br /> <br /> SEE THIS FILE.
