All dogs going to heaven is a movie I have always liked. When I was a child, I watched it every other day. This is underestimated if you look at the IMDb rating and the comments of many people in general. It's not a bad movie as many say, it's a very good movie. It's good and your kids will probably like it. Even though it is rated G, some parents may find it a bit violent. It's actually a pretty dark story, where the dogs are similar to gangsters involved in gambling, extortion and even cold-blooded murder. The film follows a dog named Charlie who has escaped from the pound, is killed by his old friend, goes to heaven, but eventually comes back to earth. Many younger children watching this movie can feel like they're watching a big movie. <br /> <br /> There are a few scenes that few children can scare, but I'm sure they'll do well. Every time I watch this movie, I remember when I was a little kid. I'm sure everyone has a movie that reminds them when they were younger, this is the movie that makes me feel so. The performances of Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise are wonderful, and this is the last movie a girl named Judith Barsi submitted. Unfortunately, she was killed at a young age. It's a pity she had so much potential and not "I deserve what happened. Now that I know her story, I can't see this movie the same, because her voice sounds so sad. <br /> <br /> The animation in this movie is great, the voice work is great, and the story is good, but a little different from many other children's movies. It was popular at the time of its release but was overshadowed by Disney's mega-popular The Little Mermaid. It is a movie that is not developed by adults either, but if you are a child, or if you have grown up with this movie as a child, then you are sure to enjoy it.
