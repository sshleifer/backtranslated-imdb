Anyone who has seen Mel Gibson's Passion of Christ and is disturbed by greedy violence would rather see this film. Although it wasn't a success in checkout or TV ratings, the Fox Movie Channel still finds a good motive to show it annually. I like the way they trained Chris Sarandon and the men who portrayed his disciples to sing in Hebrew. Although Sarandon did not have long hair like any other Jesus would be in other films, his appearance looks very close to what a Jewish man would look like. What surprised me or surprised me was the scene where Caiaphas Jesus told Pilate. "And never forget you're a Jew!" Although it was not a racist comment, Colin Blakely tried to make Chris Sarandon look in the eyes of leading men of those days. Keith Michell's portrayal of Pilate was comparable to his previous performances in "The Story of Jacob and Joseph" and "The Story of David". But if you compare his representation of Pilate with Telly Savala or Hurd Hatfield, you can say that he painted the impression of a Roman lawyer well.
