This complicated western was a milestone in JAMES STEWART's career after returning from the war service. He wanted to change his image by making a western one, largely regarded as the reason for the influx of western in the 50's, as it is very impressive. It's not really photographed in Technicolor. <br /> <br /> Stewart wins first prize for "the gun won by the West" but then the rest of the film has to spend to recover it if it is stolen. SHELLEY WINTERS is a shadow gal with an ominous reputation and STEPHEN McNALLY is the local bad boy-armed man in Dodge City. WANT TO BE Wyatt Earp and DAN DURYEA is Shelley's bad boyfriend. And if you don't know it's a Universal-International movie, TONY CURTIS and ROCK HUDSON (both unknown at the moment), there are a few roles. <br /> <br /> An interesting sequence contains the first Indian attack, through which CHARLES DRAKE reveals him to be a coward who departs, leaving Shelley alone in the horse carriage. He redeems himself later, but it is just one of the dots and turns that the gun switches from one dishonest hand to another - but eventually ends with the rightful owner. <br /> <br /> STEPHEN McNALLY and JAMES STEWART have quite a final shoot that is almost as melodramatic (but not quite) as DUEL IN THE SON's burning guns final. McNally is the perfect villain and DAN DURYEA is equally treacherous in the kind of shame he played in the 40s as a low life. It's nice to see ROCK HUDSON (credited as Young Bull) wearing Indian warfare and TONY CURTIS as a young soldier, shedding desperate look at the then slender and attractive Shelley Winters. <br /> <br /> Worth watching and definitely an above-average story.
