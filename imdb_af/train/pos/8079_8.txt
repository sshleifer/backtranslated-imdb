Not many reviews, so I thought I'd add one. <br /> <br /> DO NOT GO THROUGH THE OTHER REVIEWS! It was an excellent movie. <br /> <br /> RKS is one of the few Indian directors who can actually compile a very good movie. <br /> <br /> AB and Akshay have another example of great acting, like bhoomika, which was a bit unexpected, but nice to watch. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly there wasn't much hype around release. <br /> <br /> Whether filming / other awards nominations, considering how good the movie was. <br /> <br /> Better than, Khakee, I thought and I thought Khakkee was also good movie. <br /> <br /> It's a pretty long movie, but definitely worth it and while it looks, it certainly looks long. <br /> <br /> Can't wait for RKS's next movie and the next AB, Akshay movie always looks good together. <br /> <br /> Bhoomika also performed very well in the movie and should really do well if she continues in the same way in the future.
