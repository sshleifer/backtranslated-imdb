If you want a serious laugh, look at this movie, and the things that Bruce enters into his fellow newspaper. The deleted scenes are invaluable. I don't know why they didn't include it in the original movie. It can't be due to time, as the movie is only 101 minutes long. Morgan Freeman is a brilliant actor, who has been overlooked for too long. Jim Carrey needs meds!
