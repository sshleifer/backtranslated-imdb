If I didn't see the movie in the original theater release, I was surprised when the DVD arrived, as this movie didn't have the wide spread. <br /> <br /> Denzel Washington's director's debut and final product has nothing to envy other films on the same theme by more completed directors. The film has a very professional look. It shows that Mr. Washington learned a lot on the other side of the camera. He brings another angle to this movie. <br /> <br /> One of the best things the movie has to do is undoubtedly the good performance by Derek Luke. He is an actor who, with the right guidance, goes far, without a doubt. His gripping young man, at this point of his life, living in turmoil and suffering for a bad hand, has been treating him so far, is very true. His Antwone is a beautiful portrait of a man in pain who is basically very good and gives so much, but no one looks that side of his character. <br /> <br /> At the worst of his despair, Antwone was sent to dr. Davenport, played by Mr. Washington, in a very sober, somehow muted way. Because of the anxiety in Antwone he misses the opportunity to open himself to this man, who wants to help, but due to the limitations placed on his office only has three sessions and then needs to discharge his patient. <br /> <br /> Things work out, as Antwone can convince the doctor to stay with him. Antwone's past is revealed in detail. The abuse he is in the hands of Mrs. Tate, his foster mother, experienced, is brutal, to say the least. The attempt by an older woman in the Tate's household of a sexual molestation gives Antwone a bitter taste that stays with him through his adult life, because he is shocked by the shame he carries with him. <br /> <Antwone finally finds love with Cheryl, who is patient enough to show him another world through the love she and his support. <br /> <br /> The main shows are indeed very good. Denzel Washington says dr. Davenport also has its own problems. He is also not a happy camper. He can help Antwone, but he can't help himself or his relationship with an adoring woman. <br /> <br /> The talent in the movie is incredible. Joy Bryant makes a fine Cheryl. Novella Nelson, a good actress, is wonderful like Mrs. Tate, the abused foster mother. <br /> <br /> The reunion of Antwone with its unfamiliar family is a bit too pure and sentimental, but of course, if one is to believe that Fisher finally finds happiness, one must also accept that part of the movie.
