RKO studios have decided to borrow William Powell from MGM and Jean Arthur from Columbia for one of their bigger budget efforts to curb the popularity of The Thin Man. They succeeded to some extent. <br /> <br /> Many people forget that, in addition to and earlier than Nick Charles, Bill Powell also starred in some Philo Vance movies. So by this time he was pretty good at the role. Dr. Bradford doesn't do as much liquid lunch as Nick Charles, but the basic blas√© Nick is still there. One difference is that while Nick Charles is an heir, Doctor Bradford works as a doctor. It helps in the saliva of detectives and in fact it happens in this movie. <br /> <br /> He has two murders to solve. A jockey falls from a horse that is in a big race in a big race and dies for no apparent reason. The coach suspects something, but he is frightened by the more conventional method of a bullet. That's after he came to Bill Powell for help. <br /> <br /> Myrna Loy was a more steady influence on Bill Powell than Jean Arthur was. Arthur plays it as more of a dizzy lady than Loy did. But it works here and she and Powell have good chemistry. <br /> <br /> The increasingly reliable James Gleason is the police inspector in the Sam Levene / Nat Pendleton role. All they needed here was Asta and possibly Eric Blore, while Powell's butler set it up. <br /> <br /> Having signed this studio at Powell and Arthur, we may have seen quite a few Bradford movies.
