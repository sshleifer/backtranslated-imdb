A single mom (Diane Keaton) finds herself working on several minimum wage opportunities. When she is discharged, she finds that she cannot support her sons (Michael Seater and Colin Roberts), of whom the latter has asthma. Then she goes to her friend and starts selling drugs. Soon she becomes addicted to the drugs she sells. Her life falls down, especially if her children, her eldest son, find out the truth and threaten to leave her. Then she struggles to save herself with the help of her children, but can she protect her family from the drug masters she worked for? <br /> <br /> Wow! This lifetime movie has some of the best plays I've ever seen! Diane Keaton persuaded a lot, and her character came so crazy, but she was very convincing. She is much better suited for drama than comedy. However, the best performance in the movie is from Michael Seater, who plays her eldest son. He is perfect as the responsible boy who is still young, but tries to be the adult in the family. His play was especially big in the scenes where he confronted his mother with the drugs. Colin Roberts, who plays the younger boy, is also doing a good job. <br /> <br /> A movie is worth watching, especially because of Michael Seater and Diane Keaton's performances!
