Worth to watch, especially with the beautiful twist of a journalist with integrity, you expect a great storyline as the Gray Owl is being deceived as fraud, but it's not to add to the generally optimistic and uplifting theme and drama. of the story and movie. <br /> <br /> It must be Brosnan's best performance to date, he is wonderfully wonderful as the English boy playing Indians. The striking scene is the return to his? Aunts? where Brosnan and the two elderly lady actresses lose a wonderful scene full of nostalgia and life with so little dialogue, only with expressions and good direction. Perfect. <br /> <br /> The story is so little known and the message so universal and all important, it's a real pity, this movie didn't get any better recognition. Maybe it's a bit of a classic and a sleep. I hope so. <br /> <br /> Well done Dickie Attenborough and throw.
