Rosenstrasse is a touch of courage in adversity. Reichendutch women find that their Jewish men are locked in the hands of the deportation. One of the aristocrats, denied by her family, Lena Fischer, finds herself among the crowd, as is General Gudarian's sister. But rank and privilege merit no special consideration. <br /> <br /> Service to the Empire as a female detainee whose husband is on the Ostfront will also learn. In one of the terrifying scenes of the movie, the guards take the wedding band given by her soldier man. <br /> <br /> Let's think it's typical German brutality. In America, today, we fed Lady Bush to order the arrest of Gold Star Mothers (mothers of US service-mates killed) because they are very close to their presence. Unfortunately, in the 60 years of Der Fuher, Der Fumbler has changed. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the eight-year-old daughter escapes Ruth. <br /> <br /> Waiting in the cold at Rosenstrasse Lena Fischer is reluctant to assume that Ruth responds in a way that we typically take German. Even Lena Fisher's brother Colonel Arthur von Eschenbach, who is aware of and against the Holocost, warns Lena against it. but Lena chose to embrace the idea with an American rebellion that even renamed Ruth, the more Ariane-sounding name Helga Lehmann. <br /> <br /> The siege ends favorably on Rosenstrasse, but Lena mourns: What happened to Ruth after the war? Years later, Ruth's daughter Hannah comes out in search of her mother's past and meets 90-year-old Lena under the guise of a personal history of war. <br /> <br /> I found it interesting that Hannah wanted so much to look at the family, but never looked at the fate of her grandfather who was last known on the Ostfront.
