I watched this movie several times in the 90's and laughed my times every time. I love Eddie Murphy as an actor, but this rise is something else. He's so funny. Even the P.C. Brigade will find this hilarious. It's a must see, and even better if you have the guys or girls in for a drink. Michael Jackson's turn-off is like him, if you close your eyes, you believe it's him singing. The things he describes are true to life and you should seriously have a bypass if you think it's not funny. My local video stores don't like this video anymore, but I'd love to get a copy of my hands to show my husband and boys when they're old enough to appreciate the humor. Anyway, highly recommended, hope you enjoy it.
