The Invisible Ray is an excellent performance of both acting talents of Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi. Karloff performs a flawless performance as a naughty and confronted scientist who finds his scientific achievements before his relationships with others, even his wife. His overall personality becomes unbearable as he becomes paranoid. <br /> <br /> Lugosi plays the perfect professional who is passionate about his work, but still finds time to keep up with everyone, but apparently has no real reality. Boesem friends. It was one of his few roles as a good guy and he played it very well. However, it's hard to hear his accent and believe he's French. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with the movie was that it was all based on "junk science", but in one way it even made junk science good. Since the ideas and theories are completely idiotic, they are today "relevant" as it was when the film was made. And they are also so advanced - and will always be. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie to watch again and again. Maybe I saw it 5 times this weekend, and I could easily spend five times. The acting is wonderful and science is amusing. I highly recommend it.
