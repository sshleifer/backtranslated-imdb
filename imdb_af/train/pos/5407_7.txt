I always enjoyed the Pokémon movies. Yes, I know, everybody is very cool, mediocre in some areas and sure, although they are aimed at small children, in some countries they are too adult to protect the statement: "Hey, light up, it's a kid's movie , "but all that is set aside is not yet good entertainment? According to me, they are so and I enjoy them a lot. This one is just as enjoyable as the previous three, and definitely better. It has some very nice and enjoyable moments, as it is the launch of the sweet, fresh Pokemon Celebi. It's not the best Pokémon movie, but I enjoy it more than the third installment, although the third is not bad, and the whole series is just entertaining, harmless, popcorn fun and nothing more to be considered, nothing less no. This film has some high points of intensity and interest, especially around the climax / end, just like all the installments, and the characters, while a little more slender than the previous three, I think, is still fun and humorous . These movies are the lowest rated and most critical of the four features adjustments, and they do not deserve it.
