Victor McLaglen's performance is one of the best in film history. <br /> <br /> I think we can all feel like "Gypo" because we all struggled with what was right and what wasn't and was wrong. It was one of the first art house photos to be released by a large American film studio (RKO Radio Pictures). <br /> <br /> Joseph H. August's cinematography is at its best here. August's beautiful part is mostly overlooked; He did not receive the Oscar nomination he deservedly earned. <br /> <br /> It is a psychological drama, with thought, philosophy, sadness, everything containing as few words as possible.
