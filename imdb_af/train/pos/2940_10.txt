The first time I came across Delirious, I just heard it. I listened to the whole comedy show and I have never laughed so much in my life. Eddie's ability to paint hilarious pictures in our minds and do great imitation is fascinating. When I finally had to see him, I had to do it. Eddie Murphy's performance on Delirious shows his genius! With the new millennium his actions in 1983 were just as funny as it was then. My parents loved it as teenagers and I (eighteen) loved it too. From then on, I had to watch Murphy's other movies, such as Coming To America and Harlem Nights. There will be no other comedian like Eddie.
