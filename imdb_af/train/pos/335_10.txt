I've been trying to find out about this series for centuries! Thanks, IMDb! I saw it as a child and never managed it. Of course, as a 6-year-old I was especially affected by the episode of the cyclops, which was absolutely chilled (I talked so much that my older brother made me a cyclops from a plastic cave figure I still have) What I Also, the atmosphere, which was unusual from the start, was mysterious, severe and extremely authentic. When I read the original years, I experienced the same feeling. It's a very difficult thing to catch - and probably impossible in Hollywood. Every Odyssey I've seen since is a huge discount. The characters in this series were real, real people - old Greek people - and not Hollywood stars in costumes. This is a true masterpiece! But - Why isn't it better known? And why isn't it available on VHS or DVD? I'll just have a chance to see it again!
