"Bend It Like Beckham" reminds me of the best of the 80's teen-bopper movies led by John Hughes. Everything takes place in a bubble gum-colored world where everyone is attractive. There are a few easy-to-say decisions that sometimes deviate from the mostly happy proceedings, and huge amounts of plot are summarized by pop-tune settings. Nothing wrong with that. "Bend It Like Beckham" is an absolute treat from beginning to end. My wife and I completely conquered ourselves through the cornball cheesiness, even though we got rid of it, and in the end, as embarrassment, as it is to admit, we applauded (and we almost saw it in our lives room, not in a theater). Watch this movie and enjoy. <br /> <br /> Degree: B +
