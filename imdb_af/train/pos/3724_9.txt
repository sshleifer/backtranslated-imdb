Tigerland follows the lives of a group of recently established men in the army fought in 1971 in Vietnam. <br /> <br /> At this point, America knows they are losing their battle and the director takes us through a 16mm handwritten documentary shot film of the lives of several recruits in the Tigerland training camp in Louisiana. <br /> <br /> The movie is more of a character study, no real plot, but it focuses on a key character Roland Boz, who is a disabordinated but intelligent man, who just wants to escape the camp. We are taken by several characters in the unit and are waiting to unfold the story. <br /> <br /> I have to say it's a good story about Vietnam and more importantly about the army in general. Great play, and very memorable. Also the directors' use of film and style work so well, because it looks much like the old film material you always see about Vietnam. It is wonderful to see how the film shows that all the battles and problems were so important to the problems of fighting this battle. The particular scene where Boz moves away from a training mission where an instructor shows how to use a radio as a torture device just makes everything about war in a nutshell ... and it's useless. <br /> <br /> Fantastic movie. Not just about Nam, but about who individuals should decide what is morally right by being "in the army". <br /> <br /> Rating 9 out of 10.
