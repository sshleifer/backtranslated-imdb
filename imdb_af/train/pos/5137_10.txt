Interesting, fast and amusing. <br /> <br /> I'm not one of those people who watch a lot of television. I stumbled upon this show while one day being ill with a bad case of the flu, and was immediately addicted. I developed quite a loved one on John Burke. Both he and Claire did a wonderful job of presenting the show together. You can really say they both had their job. <br /> <br /> The super-collector segments were excellent. I was interested in things I had never thought of before. <br /> <br /> What I want to know is: What has Jack done to the dog? Did one of the hosts accept him?
