Usually I don't like Emma Roberts, but after watching Nancy Drew, it changed my mind. The actors in the movie made the whole thing exciting and funny. Most of the time when you watch a puzzle movie, you can solve it in the middle of the show, but in this movie it's like you're actually there. The clues must all fit together until you can finally understand the whole crime. I'm still amazed at how she invented it. The whole movie was very clever and the people who watched it with me also loved the movie. The clothes were my favorite part of the movie, it was so cute. I don't think there will be another movie like this until the successor comes out. I give it a nine because the popular girls haven't really been the part, but they still make me laugh. It was a very good movie and a great secret. I definitely recommend it.
