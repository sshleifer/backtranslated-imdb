This is definitely one of Jet's best efforts. Few players are able to play the stoics like Jet Li-kan. The action is rapid fire, and special effects are enhanced for intensity purposes. As a result, it can take Americans a little rude. A bit of disbelief goes a long way in a Jet Li movie. I feel this is an excellent introduction to Jet's work and is looking forward to further masterpieces (especially Fist of Legend) that make it on the US market. A nice mix of gunplay and physical conflict will meet most action flick enthusiasts.
