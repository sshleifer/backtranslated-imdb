First, I have never been afraid of this underestimated jewel as a little boy ("Little Mermaid" on the other hand). As my title says, it was one of my fav babies that I still love as a teenager. It's a beautiful, bittersweet movie about a wrong German shepherd named Charlie (fantasticaly pronounced by Burt Reynolds) murdered by his boss / partner in crime (is ha ha, ha is Carface). Charlie is sent to heaven by default because: "All dogs go to heaven because, unlike humans, dogs are obviously good and loyal and friendly." Chalie is sent back to Earth because he has swung his alarm clock, where he gets even more angry with his best friend, Itchy and a little, Anne-Marie. I always looked at it as a child and sometimes I watch it. Anyway, this is a beautiful bittersweet movie as I said earlier, which may just leave a tear in your eye ...
