Family are about two families who are blood to each other. <br /> <br /> Viren Sahay (Amitabh Bachchan) is a sub-world skeleton from Bangkok. He has a family in India. Once accidentally he killed Shekhar (Akshay Kumar). Like Viren Sahay, he also has a family (a brother, wife and parents). Aryan (Aryaman), Shekhar's brother, is out to take revenge on his brother's death. He kidnapped Viren Sahay's family for the same reason. <br /> <br /> That movie has one turning point (Amitabh Bachchan). The second half of the film is entirely true to him rather than his dialogues, expression more matter. Akshay's trivial role also equated with Amitabh. I didn't understand what Bhumika Chawala did in this movie. <br /> <br /> There were some loose points in the writing; like; Amitabh is shown to be the most sought-after criminal of the city, but still runs in the city. Abduction of his family also seems vague. How can the family of such a large shoe have no security cover?
