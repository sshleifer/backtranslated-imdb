This small-screened movie is a sleepy and retracted giallo. It departs from some of the genre's cliches and accepts a looser approach. It's about a woman looking for her missing lover; A psychiatrist suddenly disappearing for no apparent reason. Her search leads her to a villa, populated by a group of eccentric individuals. In true Giallo style, murder is never far away. <br /> <br /> The role play is really pretty good. We have Aldofo Celi (Thunderball), Alida Valli (Suspiria), Horst Frank (Cat o 'Nine Tails) and a very young Sybil Danning (80's shouting queen). The main actress is Rosemary Dexter, and while I'm not familiar with her, she does a good job of leading the picture. <br /> <br /> One of the distinctive features of Eye in the Labyrinth is its music. Atypical for a giallo is a jazz-rock fusion soundtrack. This score, compiled by Roberto Nicolosi, recalls Miles Davis, especially his work on In A Silent Way. This is an excellent soundtrack and really gives this movie a different feel to most gialli. The fusion groove emphasizes the bad atmosphere and complements the sunny sea views where the film mostly exists. <br /> <br /> It's great, so we really have to talk about the killings. Well, this movie is a bit short in this regard. It's certainly not of them, but they are little and far between. The dream resort is probably the best offered as well as a memorable burning series. But it's really not a particularly violent movie. Still, I don't think it should disappoint too many seasoned fans of the genre. The mystery is pretty compelling and it has enough eccentric characters (the idiot boy Saro and ITS improperly inappropriate truncated accent?) And moments of the bizarre to satisfy; while the sleaze factor is maintained continuously. <br /> <br /> Eye in the Labirint plays like a giallo version of an Agatha Christie secret, as it contains a group of unsympathetic characters in a villa, all suspected of murder; We have the mandatory flashbacks outlining their relationships with the last hours of the (highly unsympathetic) murder victim. Although this is not an example of the genre, it is certainly a pleasant one, as it does not borrow too much from other subgenre films. For allo-enthusiasts, I give it a thumb and one day I hope a good DVD transfer. It definitely deserves the treatment.
