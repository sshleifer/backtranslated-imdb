I love bedbugs and broomsticks so much that it makes me cry a thousand tears of joy every day, every time I have the great pleasure of seeing it. I would also like to repeat the simple fact that I love it so much. Many said. I have 27 copies on video and I love them all. I also love anyone else who loves it. I love you. My favorite scene is the dance scene at Portobello Road. I learned the dance movements and learned it every day. I have some recordings of myself singing the song. If anyone can play the drums or guitar, I think of bedbugs and broomsticks. I hope to call it 'the buds'. love me
