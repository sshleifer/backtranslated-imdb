*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** This is undoubtedly the best movie Rainer Werner Fassbinder ever made and even with the amazing screenplay, the film is enhanced by a good performance by Hanna Schygulla. Movie begins with Maria (Schygulla) and Hermann Braun (Klaus Lowitsch) just marries while the bombs continue to fall and Hermann is sent out after the devastating days of war and now Maria and her mother and sister have to scrape to survive. Maria decides to get a job as a dancer / prostitute in a club providing US GIs and she meets a black Army soldier named Bill (Greg Eagles) and they see each other on a steady basis. Maria heard her husband Hermann died in the war, so she became very serious with Bill. But one day while they were coming to Bill, they saw Hermann at the door. He didn't die and when he got into the room, a rogue came and Maria broke a bottle over Bill's head and he died. Hermann blames him and is sentenced to a long term in jail, telling Maria that she will succeed and get him out. The war ended and Germany had to rebuild and one day on a train. Maria meets Karl Oswald (Ivan Desny) who is a successful businessman in textiles and she uses her charm to find work. Maria is determined to do well and climb the corporate ladder and become Karl's mistress. She tells him she will never marry him, but he is in love with her. Hermann goes out of jail, but goes to Canada to convince all that Mary has done since being locked up. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** <br /> <br /> One day Karel dies and just leaves Maria in his will and Mary buys her own home. Then Hermann finally came to his wife and they are both ready to start their marriage, although they have been married for quite some time. But Maria left the gas on the stove and the house exploded with both of them. <br /> <br /> There are so many interesting things in this movie that it is one of those movies that can be studied and talked about to great lengths. As in all Fassbinder films, the use of color is used in a very interesting way. As the film begins, the colors are brown and gray to represent war-torn Germany. But as Mary succeeds, they change into bright rich colors such as red and white. The rebuilding of Germany with all the sounds of construction is used as wallpaper and the film remains focused on the exploitation of Mary. Fassbinder wanted the repeat sound to remind us of what was going on in Germany at the time. Hanna Schygulla was never better and her performance is the key to the success of this film. With a lesser actress it would just be another interesting movie, but Schygulla is so strong that her performance raises this movie to an elite status. Schygulla shows Maria as very determined and smart, but at the same time she uses her beauty and femininity to get what she wants. She is not embarrassed, and she also does not feel guilty of it and Fassbinder wanted to show Maria as a woman who sells her soul practically to survive. Schygulla was not nominated for an Academy Award, but she did a good performance that will stand the test of time. Fassbinder himself appears in the film as a peddler and his own mother, Lilo Pempeit, plays Frau Ehmke. I heard a lot of things about the end of the movie and it has to do with whether Maria deliberately left the gas. Later in the bathroom she ran water over her wrist and seemed to be sad. It's just speculation and if you think I'm wrong, please email me. I think she was too excited because Hermann was at home and left it accidentally. (Remember her for no reason?). When the will was read to her, she was of the opinion at the time that Hermann and Karl became friendly without her knowledge and I think she felt that everything she did was nothing. That's the reason for the bathroom scene. So when the house explodes its accident. But I think the reason why Fassbinder has such an end is to show that anyone who sells their soul has no business life. Fassbinder was fascinated by survivors, but he was also incredibly passionate. According to him, Maria cannot have both ways. A fascinating movie.
