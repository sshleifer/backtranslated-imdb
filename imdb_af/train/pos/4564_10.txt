If there ever was an inspirational story that anyone who is disabled or not can move, despite the chance and make it (even if it is an expression, it can be a wide cabin that is an ultimate personal truth ). MY LIFE FOOT is it. This is a tough movie to turn around: the less tranquil aspects of Christy Brown's personality occur in two key screens - one when his sister declares she is pregnant and is getting married while his father has a bad reaction and at dinner table when the woman who has been issued to him enabled him to communicate effectively, has announced at an important moment (the inauguration of Brown's art) that she will marry another man. It's hard. Very, very difficult. More so because it is a man who cannot respond to these events and can only express himself in the only way he knows: via screaming, screaming and profanity that is aimed at hurting himself. However, this is not a story of sadness and family dysfunction, even though there is a bit of a bit to do with the autobiographical account, but one of a man who overcomes his severe disability becomes a functional man and a power is considered in the art world. Daniel Day Lewis won an Oscar for his powerful, unforgettable performance as the flawed but stubborn Christy Brown, and Brenda Fricker also did her support role as Brown's solid mother.
