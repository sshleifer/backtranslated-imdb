"That '70s Show" is definitely the funniest show currently on TV. I started watching it about two and a half years ago, and as soon as I could see it, it was a good show. I like all the characters, but my personal favorites are Fez and Kelso. Leo was also a wonderful character while he was there, I really hope he comes back because he's screaming. It's classic when Fez "your son of a bitch!" Go and when Kelso "burns!" Call, always make me laugh. They are both great characters and always have something funny to say. Jackie is hot, just another reason to watch the show; She started to look really nice, but damn, somewhere in season 5-6, she just got really hot. I've seen most of the episodes more than once, some like 10 times, and there's still hilarious. This is one of the few shows I can watch over and over and still laugh as much as I did the first time. The cast is classic; Almost everyone is funny, with many shows there are only a few funny characters. I will be sad to see this show end next year, but it is going to be one of the best shows ever.
