It's just as good as the original 101, if not better. Of course, Cruella steals the performance with her outrageous behavior and outfits, and the movie is probably made because the public wanted to see more of Cruella. We see much more of her this time. I also like Ioan Gruffudd as Kevin, the rather clumsy guy. Using Paris as the climax of the movie was a clever idea. The movie is worth looking at your age, provided you love animals.
