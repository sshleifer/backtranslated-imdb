Starlift is a pleasant and interesting setback for the all-star musical photos released by every studio during World War II. When you get such stars as Gary Cooper, James Cagney, Doris Day, Gordon MacRae, and Randolph Scott, etc. In the film and with such people as the Gershwin Brothers, Cole Porter, Jule Styne and Sammy Cahn, it's easy to take film. And the plot is not even in the way. <br /> <br /> Which plot is there, includes two Air Force-designated men, Dick Wesson and Ron Hagerthy, who are trying to meet Warner Brothers starlet Janice Rule, as a gimmick both from Youngstown, Ohio and Hagerthy His father came, Rule's dentist and half of the town were told. The scheme works too well, because Louella Parsons quickly places them as an item in her column. Yes, Louella is also in the movie. She would have liked Warner Brothers or Jack Warner to devote more to her than the other studio bosses, as she also used this studio to announce her Hollywood Hotel radio show again in the day. <br /> <br /> But the rest of the plot Also touched on the real life of Ruth Roman, she also plays herself to get her studio and others to go to the Air Force Base for the soldiers and women going to Korea . Some of the names I mentioned and others sing and act in a show at Travis Air Force Base where much of this movie was shot. <br /> <br /> One specialty number was shot for Phil Harris' talents singing / telling a ballad Look Out Stranger, I was a Texas Ranger assisted and assisted by Virginia Gibson, Frank Lovejoy and Gary Cooper. Yup, Cooper seemed to have had a good old time joking his image. <br /> <br /> These are the oldest clich√©s when you say they no longer make them like this, but they really don't because you don't have a studio system that has all this talent under contract. It's one thing about the downfall of the old studio system that we can grieve.
