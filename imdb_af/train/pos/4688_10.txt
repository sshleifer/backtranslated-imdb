I gave it to my 6th grade about 17 years ago, and the students loved it. I also liked it. The story of the termites and their interaction with their environment is incredible. Throwing creatures is deep and they all play well. The battle between the two cold-blooded titans is truly classic imagery. <br /> <br /> Alan Root did amazing camera work and it had won the Best Documentary Oscar. The copy I got did not tell Orson Welles (Derek Jacobi) and it is not called the "Mystical Castles of Clay", just "Castles of Clay." This makes me think that this should have been done with Welles added for strength and an Oscar push. <br /> <br /> I was fortunate enough to find this VHS just recently and it's now my children's favorite movie. They brought it to the latest family gathering instead of a Disney movie. If you can get this movie, you are indeed happy.
