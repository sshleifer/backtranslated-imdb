I first saw the movie at a festival. There were very good movies, but little had thought of me long ago and an Insomniac's Nightmare was definitely one of them. Tess is definitely a gifted movie maker. The shots were wonderful. Casting was perfect. Dominic shone in his role, which she made perfect. There wasn't much to know about his character, but she wrote the story so much that we care. And Ellen - I can't wait to see where she ends! She shows a lot of talent and I hope she does some more movies. With all the million dollar budgets trying to get a cheap excitement, Tess shows that it doesn't need everything as long as there's a good story and actors. Kudos for everyone involved in this movie. And thanks to Tess and co. for distribution on DVD!
