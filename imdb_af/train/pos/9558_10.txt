So I see myself as pretty big in the anime scene, with very few shows that I simply won't see. <br /> <br /> However, this show will recommend to anyone. <br /> <br /> Quite possibly the most original series to date, it has just about everything I could ask for. A Bible story, so to speak, about an unconditional love that will NOT be allowed into a very blatant comedy, and a very well-composed voice-processing role (Japanese and American translation). <br /> <br /> If Not for its terribly funny aspect, it would just be another anime. <br /> <br /> More or less, as I have noticed, a "love it or hate it", very few people I saw. to this series will eventually be an aversion to it. <br /> <br /> Originally to the core, with everything you can ask in the afternoon, bet the house on this series. I'm ready to make sure you enjoy it.
