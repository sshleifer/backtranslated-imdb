The 12th animated Disney classic is a reasonable movie told by a simple story. Even though it is a bit dated, it deserves a place in the Disney classic list. <br /> <br /> It's not under Disney's best work, but is satisfying. One of Disney's most "simple" works, yes, but hold a certain magic and spell (of which old Disney is known). It was an important movie because it saved Disney from a delicate situation. If it were a failure, there would be no more Disney animated classic. <br /> <br /> "Cinderella" is somehow like a return to Disney's 1st animated classic ("Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs") bringing the fairy tale genre back. It's not clear where the story takes place, but I think it's somewhere in France because it's based on a story by Charles Perrault. <br /> <br /> There are many nice characters like Cinderella, the Prince, Bruno (the dog), Jaques and Gus (the two main mice), the Fairy-grandmother (for a fairy tale she is surely funny), the birds, the King and the Great Duke. <br /> <br /> Jaques is very smart and amusing. I love his voice. It really has the mouse-like quality. Gus may not be that smart, but he is humorous. <br /> <br /> The King is hilarious, but I think it makes him so funny is his short temper. The Great Duke is also a very cool car and funny. They are two of my favorite characters in this movie and are responsible for many of the most entertaining moments. <br /> <br /> The prince is definitely one of the most beautiful in Disney. No doubt Prince Philip of "Sleeping Beauty" was inspired on this prince, because they are very similar. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Lady Tremaine (the stepmother) is not supposed to be nice. because she is cold, jealous, bitter and cruel. Her daughters (Anastacia and Drizella) are not much better than her. However, the stepmother is not as irritating as her ugly and selfish daughters. Sinderella, the main character, has nothing to do with them. Cinderella is soft, friendly, beautiful and lovely. By the way, I think her beautiful pink dress is much nicer than the one given by the Fairy Godmother. <br /> <br /> Lucifer (the cat) is hilariously malicious. The way he walks, raises his nose in the air and those arrogant and sneaky facial expressions make him funny. Ironically, he is very much like the stepmother when it comes to personality. He always agrees with the stepmother's attitude towards Cinderella. Lucifer has the right name for him because he is such a devilish and average cat. Yet there is nothing about him. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is simple but enjoyable, but not under Disney's best. The best song in this movie is Bibiddi Bobiddi Boo. <br /> <br /> There are many well-known talented voice players in this, such as James MacDonald, Marion Darlington, Eleanor Audley, Verna Felton and Luis Van Rooten. . <br /> <br /> Even though it looks simple, the movie has good artwork as well as its nice details, but never something "out of the world". The king's palace, however, is a spectacular masterpiece, truly majestic and colossal.
