Sure, it was cheesy and stupid and sometimes stingy, but at least the filmmakers didn't try. While most TV movies are bordered on the edge of mediocrity, this movie actually has some repetitive features. The cinematography was pretty good for a TV movie, and Viggo Mortensen showed Aragorn shades in a movie about a man who played his own rules. Most of the playback sequence was kind of cheese, but the scene with the mountain lion was intense. I was kind of irritated by Jason Priestly's role in the movie as a rebellious shock jock, but then it's a TV movie again! Despite all the good things, the soundtrack was horrible. However, it was nice to see Tucson, Arizona featured prominently in the film.
