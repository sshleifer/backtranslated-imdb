I saw it on a Cantonese VCD with the English subtitles. I thought the story was good, but there were times when some of the sub-characters were overworking. It took away from the movie, just like the pretty lame musical score that irritated me throughout the movie. If the musical score is improved, I can overlook the few over-the-scenes scenes. Then the movie is much, much better.
