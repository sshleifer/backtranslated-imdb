One of my favorite movies overlooked by too many filmmakers, an observation that disturbs me. Not only directed by award-winning Ang Lee, it has many young actors who would become big stars, for example Tobey Maguire (before Spiderman), Skeet Ulrich (for Jericho), Jonathan Rhys Meyers (for Tudors), James Caviezel, Simon Baker, Mark Ruffalo, Jeffrey Wright, Tom Wilkinson and Jewel. All the plays were excellent and each of the actors mentioned had memorable performances, especially Meyers who portrayed an evil villain for the sake of death. <br /> <br /> When the biographies and performances of the director (even when he won an academic award) and the actors are listed, this film is usually omitted from their performances. I accidentally discovered the movie on DVD and it became one of my most watched movies. However, it is rarely anyone seen on the cable. I look forward to reading what others suggest, the reasons why this movie is not known.
