There is still much that we do not know about what has been declared by the early ancestors about the great gulf that we understand. In each case, there is a lot about the dangers of knowing too much. On the other hand, there are those who warn us not to prepare for what they warn is the 'end time'. In this film called "The Last Wave", an aboriginal native is not killed for any apparent reason. When those responsible are arrested, they remain silent while disturbing the order of the matter. David Burton (Richard Chamberlain) instructs the Defense Attorney to defend the accused. Although he has been haunted by prophetic images from his own childhood and is known to him by modern signs by a sympathetic Aboriginal named Chris Lee (David Gulpilil), Burton continues to defend the offense as a tribal law and thus not subject to standard justice. no. The movie is fraught with mysterious, dark-appearing images of apocalyptic end-of-world disasters and warns of a future isosami and punishment. Black drama and deep rituals are what this film is about, it's scary and that's why it's not for the torch. Indeed, the simplest hasty appearances can last for years in the nightmares of innocent filmmakers. Good quiet drama. ****
