I loved this movie very much. It advised me just before the end what would happen. One of the better movies about the partition I saw. Urmila Matondkar is also beautiful. It's one of the most personal and down-to-earth movies I've seen on the partition. It's a bit less mainstream than Gadar, and is actually an emotional toboggan run where you start with one opinion of what's going on, and come completely out of one side. It's not a typical Bollywood prize, but rather an art house-type movie. The best part of this movie is that it does not dehumanize one side of the partition conflict when it focuses on the story of another. It does not blame or curse, but let you draw your own conclusions about things.
