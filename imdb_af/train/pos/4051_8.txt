Eric Rohmer's "The Lady and the Duke". could have used a better translation for the title. "The English Woman and the Duke" might have been more accurate. Although it is obvious that this film is not for everyone, it is worth looking at, because Mr. Rohmer, despite the intricate pattern of the story, created a movie that can be seen as an art exhibition in a museum. The mixed technology used in the movie finally works well. <br /> <br /> The strange story of Grace Elliott, a noble lady who was the mistress of the King of England and of the French Duc d'Orleans, is paying attention. The area is Paris during the days of the French Revolution. The country was in turmoil and power was in the hands of the people, who could no longer give to the aristocrats. The images show that the robbers run around with the heads of famous people after their journey to the guillotine. <br /> <br /> Grace's relationship with the Duc ended, but she remains a true friend to the big man who is in danger, himself, to lose his own head. Grace moves through all the abominations without escaping. She even has an enemy in her own home, in the form of the cook, Pulcherie, who will not hesitate to argue at least. <br /> <br /> Watching the movie, the viewer sometimes gives the impression one is going on a journey through the Louvre looking at the big diapers depicting this important era of French history. Instead of deriving the digitization process, we found that it was improving the movie in many ways. <br /> <br /> Lucy Russell, like Grace Elliott, does a great job depicting this woman who has seen many during her lifetime. Her French looks great, because she seems to be fluent in it. Like the Duc d'Orleans, Jean Claude Dreyfus made a fantastic contribution that we believe he is the nobleman himself without any effort. The supporting role was also wonderful. As an ensemble piece, Mr. Rohmer good performances everywhere. <br /> <br /> For lovers of history, "The Lady and the Duke" will be an interesting film, thanks to Eric Rohmer's vision.
