No, not really, but it is indeed a very good movie, and unfortunately a forgotten gem. Black and white suits the movie. <br /> <br /> Straight forward formula, a man had the scourge, and the authorities have to find everyone he has in contact before they die. <br /> <br /> Well directed, and the acting is great. Richard Widmark as the male chief is good but is completely overshadowed by Paul Douglas as the police captain, and Jack Palance (never better than that) and Zero Mostel as the bad stuff. Unfortunately, Palance also plays similar characters in some really second-class gangster or war movies.
