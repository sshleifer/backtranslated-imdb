I can really say I felt the movie in its true essence where the dream works of the dream work in the surreal aspect of the future, like Tom Cruise. I didn't deal much with Tom Cruise's acting ability, but I have to say that he wants to impress at every point in the movie ... not just because of an engaging storyline, but also because he itself assigned to the main character. they merge and then speak and it is beautiful. But I have to say this movie does not come under the "average movie of the weekend" which you randomly choose and look cheerful; It carries strong sentiments and characters, so don't wash this one with your beer and popcorn. It definitely needs more than that.
