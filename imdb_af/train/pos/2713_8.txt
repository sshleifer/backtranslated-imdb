Wilson (Erica Gavin) is assisted by police and sent to prison in prison. This is a wonderful example of the 70-year exploitation, marking the ruling debut of Jonathan Demme. After writing and producing a few mentor Roger Cormans New World films, Demme was given the opportunity to register for the first time, delivering a movie that not only delivers expected and delicious doses of nudity and violence, but also an attractive tongue-in-cheek quality to it; It's often as funny as it is flashing. <br /> <br /> Standout screens include a vibrant and rough vaudeville style performed for the prisoners, as well as a powerful dream / fantasy series for unceasing and naturally suppressed superintendent McQueen (horror icon Barbara Steele , do a wonderful turn in this antagonistic role). I also had a bank robbery and became a carjack scene that was just unshakable. As in other films of this nature, it is also commendable that it is so much a portrait of female empowerment because it is pure exploitation. These women are tough, they do not make any garbage, and they are more than capable of handling themselves. <br /> <br /> Our attractive role-player makes the most of their roles: Juanita Brown as the aggressive Maggie, Roberta Collins as the silly Belle, Rainbeaux Smith as the cute and crooked Lavelle, Gavin as the wide-eyed newcomer, and Lynda Gold (also known as Crystin Sinclaire) in a shiny appearance as an accomplice on the outside. <br /> <br /> As our climax comes out, Demme comes off with a tense bell when our heroines save races to save Belle by predator Dr Randolph (Warren Miller), the kind of man who thinks nothing for profit to pull out of women. . <br /> <br /> Reflecting on John Cales's tasteful score, "Caged Heat" is exciting entertainment and a guaranteed good time. <br /> <br /> 8/10
