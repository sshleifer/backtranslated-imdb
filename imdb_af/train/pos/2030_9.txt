The Man of Snowy River II does not find the wheel again, but is a spectacular beautiful film that hits some good notes. <br /> <br /> For the fans who made the elements that made the original Man From Snowy River movie a hit, (breathtaking scenery, swipe score, sweet romance and cracking action) this movie really delivers. This story counts a few years from the end of the first, Jim (Tom Burlinson) lost his fortune in a breeding of cattle horses. He comes back to fetch where he left off with his spicy, well-bred sweet Jessica (played by Aussie religious woman Sigrid Thornton) who is still trying to break out of her corsets at her ferry station. Harrison is now played by the American Brian. Dennehy). The foil to Jim and the character shaking the plot is the well-to-do top snob Alistair Patton (Nicholas Eadie) who has his sights on Jessica. Add to the mix some social tension around the fields and the stallion with a bad attitude from the first film and that is the plot. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie is the play. Tom Burlinson fits well into Jim's wide edge hat and laconic humor. Sigrid Thornton is a beautiful heroine and the two manage real-life chemistry. The fulfillment of Kirk Douglas's solid shoes was never easy, and Brian Dennehy blunt and screaming, but never felt very authentic in this part. <br /> <br /> The music is fatter and lazy and the movie can play a Victoria tourism rule. However, there is a moment when it feels very self-sufficient, as the director just wants one helicopter shot from the riders to show how beautiful the landscape is without any personal human drama. A little more grain would have been enough here, we are Aussie's, we can take it! There are a couple of many JAWs moments with the stallion convincing faith. The funny thing about this film, however, is that in some shiny clicks some very interesting and pleasant scenes are. Jim puts the hall on the stall (MOUSE PERSONAL PERIOD before his time) Jim and Jessica settle in, the fantastic scene where Jim Alistair's drive shows his trusty sweep. I can see why this character is such an icon. <br /> <br /> Quite a very pleasant sequel. Here's the hope that everyone involved wants to make another. The Man Of Snow River III: The Cruisers. I'm sure we all want to see how Jim and Jessica do their farm. <br /> <br /> The Aussie DVD has a few extra scenes in it. Worth it if you are a fan.
