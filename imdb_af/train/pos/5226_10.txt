What's with all the European (especially England) comments here? All I have to say is that when I first saw this movie when I was 13, I thought it was wonderful. Of course it's stupid. That's the point. You have to watch the movie Dr Strangelove and Men in Black to get the whole joke behind this movie, but come on people, what did you expect to see? I can think of many movies that are much worse than this, and they were expensive Hollwood movies with real actors in them. For what it is worth, Men in White is a very silly funny cartoon of a movie. And with all the stupid, funny things England has done for the past half century, I'm shocked at all the negative comments. Our stupid Americans love our silly humor. P.S., see 'Team America: World Police' for some real laughs that Europeans want. HA!
