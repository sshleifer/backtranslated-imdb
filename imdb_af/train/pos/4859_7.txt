I read that Jessie Matthews was approached and joined with Fred Astaire in Damsel in Distress. Jessie Matthews in her predecessor never left her side of the dam to do any American music films. If they worked for this movie, it would have been a once in a lifetime. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that Damsel has everything in it for distress. Fred Astaire, story and adapted for screen by author P.G. Wodehouse, Burns & Allen for comedy, and songs by the Gershwin Brothers. In response to the Nice work question if you can get it, there is not much you can ask for this movie anymore. <br /> <br /> Except for a leading lady. Although Ginger Rogers has captured several films by Fred Astaire, Damsel in Distress is the only film Astaire without Rogers, while they were a team. Young Joan Fontaine was thrown into this opposite Astaire. <br /> <br /> Her character has nothing to do with Ginger Rogers' parts in these movies. All she basically needs to do is to be sweet and tender. She also doesn't carry anything musical. And if I had to judge all of Fred Astaire's dance partners, Joan Fontaine would come down. The poor woman is just terrible in the things that are looking for. <br /> <br /> Later, when she played in a musical with Bing Crosby, The Emperor Waltz, it is no coincidence that Fontaine is given nothing musical. <br /> <br /> The version I have is a colored one and in this case I think it did a little good. The idyllic lush English countryside of P.G. Wodehouse is really brought out in this VHS copy. Especially in that number I mentioned earlier with Astaire and Fontaine taking place in the garden. Burns & Allen on the other hand, as some old vaudeville troops, fill Astaire in great style in the Stiff-top lip. The surrealistic fun-house series is marvelously performed. <br /> <br /> P.G. Wodehouse's aristocracy is showing off with Constance Collier on her haughty best and for once Montagu Love as Fontaine's father as a good man on film. <br /> <br /> The biggest hit in A Damsel in Distress is a foggy day, perhaps the best-known song about the British capital since the London Bridge. Finished in the best, simple, elegant way by Fred Astaire, this is one of those songs that will endure as long as London endures and even beyond. <br /> <br /> Overlooking young and inexperienced Joan Fontaine, a Damsel in Distress is a classic, classic score, classic dance, classic comedy. Who can ask anything else?
