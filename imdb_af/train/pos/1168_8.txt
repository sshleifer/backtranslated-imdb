Tony Arzenta, a Sicilian hit or professional killer, decides to leave the business, and his former employers disagree. In terms of content, this highly enjoyable action movie does not contain one; In the case of pure entertainment, is it fun? It is very melodramatic, violent, fairly cruel, the car hunts are striking. "Arzenta" is a pretentious but very nice movie? Much better than the current Hollywood garbage that gets the same label. It comes from Delon's short flirt with the 70's Italian B theater. It carefully uses Delon's difficult old persona, which is part of the gallery of bad donkeys that he made in his youth. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the fact that Delon made this movie that he played a role in a good Eurocrime movie. <br /> <br /> The score is very good, with a good introductory song ?????????????????????????????? ?????????????????????????????? Tony Arzenta / Big Guns / No Way Out Blanc (31 years in '73) appears as an unnamed hooker. Meanwhile, Arzenta's girlfriend, Sandra, is played by Carla Gravina (a starlet who almost left the movie after '75). <br /> <br /> "Arzenta" is interestingly filmed? an ambitious visual conception, some expressionist peculiar angles. The film is directed by the prolific Duccio Tessari, the one who also made Zorro (the Delon comedy). Needless to say, these two films, Tony Arzenta (1973) and Zorro, are very different. The first one is a bloody melodramatic violent action movie - the second is a laughing comedy, more akin to a spoof, but remarkably coherent and skilled. Duccio Tessari directed movies like Kiss Kiss. Bang Bang (1966), Sons of Satan, The Moth Butterfly, Â¡Viva La Muerte ... Tua! , Tough Guys (1974), Safari Express (1976), etc.
