I barely remember this show, a bit, but I remember it was wonderful! My oldest brother recently reminded me of the show and I saw an advertisement for the D.V.D set coming out. The network, again screwed to pull it out of the air, so they could sit in the place differently? It should have been at least 3 seasons. Why not, right? Sometimes I think the network managers think they are the "gods" of the entertainment world. But they deceive and flatten out, miss good performance from time to time. Let it be said, they have much more flops than 'hits'. It was one of the poor decisions to cut off the game. Anyway, I get it for my collection.
