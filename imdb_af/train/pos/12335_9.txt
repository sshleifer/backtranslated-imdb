Warning: Contains a spoiler. Corny plot and in many cases horrible acting. Fontaine is wonderful, but some others, especially Richard Ney, Ivy's husband, are very timber. Ney is lying in bed, dying of arsenic poisoning, with every hair in place. Yet the movie is so juicy and so exciting. More faithful to the book than most movies of his era. Threw Joan Fontaine as a poison (and an adultery, which was just as shocking - I'm not joking, kids) was a master stroke. She is just her usual Joan Fontainey herself. As murderers were supposed to, she died by dropping the "front feet through the floor into an empty space."
