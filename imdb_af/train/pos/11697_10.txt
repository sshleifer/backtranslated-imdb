This film was really eye-opening. I saw this movie several times. Only when I was four did I actually remember it and when I was 12. The whole message the director is transporting is for everyone to wake up and not make the mistake of leaving God out of our everyday life. extra mile to insult him. <br /> <br /> A great movie for non-believers and believers!
