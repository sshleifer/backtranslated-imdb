Henri Verneuil's film cannot be as well known as Parallax View, 3 Days of the Condor or JFK, but it's certainly not worse and sometimes even better than these classic genre representatives. Action takes place in the fictitious Western state where the fictional president was murdered. After a few years of investigation, a special government commission decided that the president was murdered by a lone armed man. But one man - prosecutor Volney, played by Yves Montand - thinks there's something more to be investigated and so the movie begins. This movie is not about certain precise theories, but it covers the whole structure of the relationship between government and society in today's world. Such a movie can only be made in the 1970s, but it will never lose reality. Furthermore, it's even a little scary, how accurate is it oracles. 10 out of 10.
