'Five Days' is announced as something special, a crime drama consisting of a series of episodes, each instituted on a particular day by a police investigation. But in reality, this element of the story seems to be less significant than might be thought of. The fact that the action is limited to 24 hours in each episode is hardly discernible, and very few distinguish the program from many other crime stories. In fact, one can hardly help making comparisons with the latest 'Prime Suspect', as one of the sub-quarters focuses on a single, cynical female police chief who retires: and it's not just the absence of Helen Mirren. which makes the comparisons unfavorable. There is a very serious over-emotional, manipulative music and a set of characters seemingly confronted so that everyone in some sense is sympathetic, in another suspect. And it is possible to guess the guilty party before the end, not because of the internal dynamics of the story, but rather because of the construction of the drama as a whole: certain things must be true, the way the series focus, to justify certain characters at certain times. Despite these failures, the series has grown on me: in the end I was very gripped. But it is a sad sign that the BBC, which once made the songs of The Singing Detective, boasts this of "possibly the best drama of the year". Because there is little true originality here, and the demand shows a lack of ambition which is terribly disappointing. "Five days" is actually not garbage; but these are formulas, and one would hope that the best the BBC had to offer would be something that was more innovative and fresh.
