Yes, Shakespeare would indeed have been proud. Laurence Fishburne was not at its best, but certainly not bad. Kenneth Brannagh on the other hand was brilliant. His twilight was wonderful as he was with the audience. Very good work. <br /> <br /> There was sometimes too little drama where more would be expected. For example, Cassio's manslaughter was a little overcast with too much appearance, causing the spectator to turn his head to understand it all. <br /> <br /> Did I mention Michael Maloney? His evil, Roderigo, was unusual; irritating even. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen Othello yet, see it. If you haven't read Othello, see it. If you didn't hear Othello, see it. On the other hand, you do yourself a favor by reading it, as it acted on the scene and also sang it.
