Although Ian Kershaw has removed him from this project due to inaccuracies of Hitler's life and yes, it has been dramatized, but essential. During his later years, Robert Carlyle plays Hitler during this documentary document dealing only with Hitler until Hitler until he became Chancellor of Germany, including the Night of the Langmes. This TV movie (also a two-part mini series) shows how a series of factors allowed Hitler to come to power, eg. the financial disaster of 1930. <br /> <br /> The series follows Hitler and a little different, except the life of Fritz Gerlich and Ernst Hanfstaengl. All in all, valuable and filled with interesting actors, however, I feel it had to be stronger with stronger cinematography; Most actors are portrayed in half-body shots that make me a scene standard, not theater. The pace is sometimes drowsy, and the film suffers from it for about 2.5 hours.
