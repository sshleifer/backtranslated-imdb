Glacier Fox is one of the most heartbreaking and wonderfully photographed wildlife ever made. <br /> <br /> The movie cares for every member of the fox family, from the blind cub to the strongest - their adventures are sometimes hilarious and tragic. Against the inhospitable countryside, the audience's hearts are warm to the relatives. <br /> <br /> The music score and lyrics tell the story with a story about what happens in general terms. <br /> <br /> Man remains one of the greatest predators, but we are undoubtedly left with the jackal being able to live, not just survive as human efforts.
