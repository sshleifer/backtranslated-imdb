This is certainly not the intellectual film with a profound mission, so I really don't think there is too much to not understand if you are not Czech. <br /> <br /> It's just a comedy. The humor is simple, pretty funny and sometimes, maybe, little morbid. Some actors and characters are very similar to Samotári (2000) (Jirí Machácek, Ivan Trojan, Vladimír Dlouhý), so the authors are. But it doesn't matter, the genre is very different and these two movies shouldn't be compared in this way. Jedna ruka netleská will not try to give you a lesson, it will try to make you laugh and there is a chance that it will succeed. <br /> <br /> Not bad movie, not ingenious, but I enjoyed it. Some scenes are really worth seeing.
