The story is about a little girl growing up in colonial Africa, but it's so much more than that. <br /> <br /> Anyone who grows up in the South will experience the same things. A desire for another, one from another race, which cannot be accomplished. Even a look is forbidden. There is no need for words. Their facial expressions say everything. <br /> <br /> This is the story of a black servant, Protée (Isaach De Bankolé) and a white woman, Aimée (Giulia Boschi). Their desire for each other is so strong that they torture each other because they cannot have each other. <br /> <br /> The girl, France (Cecile Ducasse), is lonely and spends all her time with Protée. She really can't see this dance. <br /> <br /> One of the more annoying aspects of the movie is the laziness of the colonial. They can't even escape for bed. There is a world to end; they don't know it yet. Their racist attitudes will be erased with their presence. <br /> <br /> I think I want to visit this Africa. It looks so quiet; especially at night when you only hear the animals.
