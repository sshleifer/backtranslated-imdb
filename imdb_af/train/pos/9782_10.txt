Peaches are truly a wonderful movie. I am writing this to refuse a review of someone called "Auscrit" who appeared on this site. Firstly, the idea that Monahans first movie "The Interview" is somehow TV is an extraordinary statement. Here is a film that is highly praised all over the world. It's just one of the best Australian movies ever made. It fully earned the best picture. Peaches are brave, brave and courageous. For me it works on every level and I've seen it twice now. Monahan is a film maker who shows great skill and incredible sensitivity. For 'Auscrit' to comment on the fact that it is another TV movie and that Hugo Weaving is not good, it simply doesn't get the movie. Or more specifically, it doesn't want to. Frankly, this is the kind of comment you expect from some filmmaker who is jealous or bitter or both. Or someone from within the industry, or distribution, exhibition or bureaucracy. Your average pointer, which I found, just doesn't write comments like that. I have noted other comments on the site and refer to the movie Sommersault. One has to wonder what people think they are looking for. Unfortunately in Australia when SS was released, the push, if you didn't like it, was something wrong with you, not the movie. This manipulation of the media is fairly common below. The reality is the only similarity between the two films, namely that they have rights of continuous films. Unfortunately for me, SS is a movie about nothing, it could be told in 15 minutes. I see it as a one-dimensional film about anxiety. Peaches in comparison is a masterpiece. Personally, I can't wait for what Monahan does, because he's clear to any of his contemporaries when it comes to cinema. Finally, if the film does not already win this year's AFI and IF awards, then this is a real game. As for Auscrit, please find something more constructive with your time
