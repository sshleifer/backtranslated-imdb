I love this movie. It's one of those movies you can watch over and over again and still find encouraging. Congratulations!! I believe everyone involved in making the movie and writing should be proud of themselves. It's so terrible, you feel like you're looking at a real life band. I'd like to see more movies like this. I'm glad they didn't choose the famous Hollywood stars to be in this movie because it probably wouldn't work. And even if Billy Connolly is very well known, he really got caught up and I couldn't predict anyone else playing it. Congratulations, I really believe this movie deserves the Peter Sellers Comedy award for Bill Nighy. And if you get to the final scene ..... Well, what can I say!
