Well done, and with 'New trips' it is a good continuation! Fab to see James Cawley in the latest episode "Vigil" Check it out! <br /> <br /> I like the growing characterization and think we have good replacements for the TV actors in a fan-made piece. This performance succeeds in capturing the feeling very well, as they are at the forefront, it has improved with experience and I hope with even more experience, a strong writing editor and a timing and CGI reception <br /> <br /> Good work for all stakeholders! <br /> <br /> (I have a BIG soft spot for Lefler and McFarland (BIG play), though I "I'm a bit tired of" Lefler's laws. "That's all Shelby is, and that's Cool, she got the ship, Commodore Ian is beautiful (like Fred Flintstone) but doesn't have the eager edge of a commander, the doctor, counselor and Rawlins are right on the money in my eyes, just like the wonderful Nechayev (which is a beautiful accent - a real Russian!

It is not necessary to indicate such a person's sexuality. I hope they show it down and don't let Aster & Zen people be tokens. I don't treat my gay friends differently. They're just ordinary guys. <br /> <br /> Museums are a mixed bag. I can tell and stock all the stock draw OST stuff most of the time, but the timing can now fall flat and then (the end of "Worst Fears Part 2" misses the crisis and the change. Love the fact that they "Galaxy Quest" music! <br /> <br /> I can't wait any longer! Dazza <br /> <br /> "Never give up, don't forget!" <br /> <br /> Viva les Fronti√®res
