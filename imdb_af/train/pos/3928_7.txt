Certainly it is well shot and made, very well shot and made! But the story was just as bad. And Lincoln's performance was even weaker. Not that Henry Fonda wasn't good, but the character he played was nothing but a reward. You mean to tell me that Lincoln was a sensible sleeping ass with no respect for the law or court. I mean who the hell was he supposed to be? Nephew Vinnie? I mean, come on, "I'll just call you Jackass," ???? I understand that Ford is going for a big funny guy, but I didn't really like this guy. He cheats in sports, speaks like a real, sweet and simple, and doesn't seem to be sitting in a courtroom. How do I take it seriously. <br /> <br /> The turn was even weaker. I mean, come on! It was just stupid. The whole story seemed to be thought of by some 5-year-olds in his or her dreams. To say I had enough, it was very entertaining and made me laugh several times so I can't say it's a bad movie. In fact, I must say that it is good enough, nothing that entertaines me and makes me laugh, can be bad, but this lively and stupid story was just as ridiculous that I cannot understand how anyone could not consider. <Br /> <br /> I have no idea how historically accurate this movie was, but if it was true, I really should shake my head.
