A masterpiece of comedy, a horror masterpiece, a masterpiece of romance, if something negative is about a Chinese Spirit story, may be that the special effects look dated compared to modern technology. The film has a simple representation: a poor debt collector must remain in a secluded area while trying to raise a debt. This, of course, is also haunting. <br /> <br /> What I didn't expect for the first time to see this movie is that it's one of the most beautiful love stories I've ever seen; It's without losing any of the slapstick comedies that will have you in stitches. Unlike some movies from Asian cinema, a Chinese Spirit story is not difficult to swallow for those who are not familiar with Chinese culture. Indeed, it plays on timeless, culturally themed paranormal and romance themes. <br /> <br /> Think Evil Dead 2, if they have a wonderful love story in the mix. This movie is for real, despite being overlooked by many. It's absolutely among the best I've ever seen. It's the ability to combine the best aspects of various genres, and cross cultural boundaries to appeal to humanity everywhere, nothing less than fantastic. Highly recommended, 10/10.
