Hickory Dickory Dock was a good Poirot mystery. I confess that I did not read the book, although he was an avid Agatha Christie fan. The adjustment was not without his problems, there were times when the humor, and there were brave attempts to get it right, a little overdoing, and the events that led to the final solution were rather hasty. I also thought there were a few slow moments, and some of the riddles felt filled. However, I loved how Hickory Dickory Dock was filmed, it has a very similar visual style to the brilliant ABC murders, and it really sets the atmosphere, which works with dark camera and dark lighting. The darker moments were somewhat creepy, helped by one of the most hasty music scores in a Poirot adaptation, perhaps not as disturbing as the one in One Two Buckle My Shoe, which gave me nightmares. The plot is complex, with all the essential ingredients, though not as complicated as Buckle My Shoe, and somehow it's a good thing. The action was very good, David Suchet is impeccable (I know I can't use this word forever, but I can't think of a better word to describe his performance in the series) such as Poirot, and Phillip Jackson and Pauline Moran does brilliantly after their integral characters. And the students had great personalities and developed well, especially Damian Lewis and Leonard. Overall, solid mystery, but not the best. 7.5 / 10 Bethany Cox
