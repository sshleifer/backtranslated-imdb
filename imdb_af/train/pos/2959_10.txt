It was a Saturday night and a movie called BASEketball was on TV. I always wanted to see it, but never worked when it was in the theater. Son I was wrong. Words can't describe how funny this movie is, with the main roles of South Park creators, who share a natural on-screen chemistry when it's funny. The next day I posted the repetition and exactly one week after I first watched it, I saw it 7 times! I'm obsessed with that, and I know everyone who appreciates trekking and matts will appreciate this movie. A MUST SEE, THIS IS MY # 1 COMEDY OF ALL TIMES
