All dogs go to Heaven playing on the dogs criminal underworld. The movie is a pleasure for children with a comic and dark but satisfying and happy storyline with lots of songs and dancing. It features Charlie, a co-dog criminal who is killed from the dead. He meets a homeless human girl who looks at him, and through this relationship he realizes the meaning of life and self-sacrifice. This is a cute animation that is very much loved by my eyes as a child. I would highly recommend this movie for kids. I'm not sure how adults react to it. (I tried to look at VHS a few years ago, but those recordings don't last long, do they?)
