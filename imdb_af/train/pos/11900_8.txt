Both visually and musically stunning. A treatment for both the eye and the ear. The essential Victorian element of the opening round was absolutely captivating, helping to create a Christmas scene that Dickens himself would be justly proud of. Technically, the production is visually stimulating and the special effects are both imaginatively imagined and creatively achieved in a traditional stage. The dance of many of the main artists is amazingly good. Photography and lighting are first class and the sound recording fits the overall high level of technical skills employed. A great movie for the whole family during Christmas and a wonderful discovery that can withstand more times.
