I went in The Straight Story, expecting a sad / happy drama with good direction and some good acting. This I have. What I didn't expect was an allegory for the trials of human existence. Solve it to Lynch to make a simple 300-mile journey on a lawnmower and turn it into a microcosm for the human condition. <br /> <br /> If you haven't noticed, watch it again and notice the centuries of the people Alvin meets, the terrain he drives, the reactions people give him, the kind of discussions he has . One of the first is about pregnancy and children, one of which is outside a cemetery. The last road he has downloaded is haunting, especially in this context, as it narrows and hides his fear and nervousness. The last mechanical failure can be seen as a death and the miraculous regeneration of its engine, in which it achieves the desired reunion. <br /> <br /> I just hope the people who have considered it as a slow juicy melodrama take the time to look with more holistic attention.
