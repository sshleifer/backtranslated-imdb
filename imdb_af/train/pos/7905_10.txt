I feel very sorry for people who go to the movies with a pencil and pencil to write down errors and keep notes on how bad a movie is. I feel equally disrespectful to people who go to movies and cannot suspend reality and / or enjoy themselves 90 minutes of their boring or busy lives! Get a GRIP people. EKGTB is a very entertaining movie. If you take movies seriously, it is NOT for you. If you expect the movie to look like the book in any way, it's not for you. But if you enjoy the full hilarity of the Priscilla queen of the desert, or the "I see hell" of Moulin Rouge. Or the brutal comedy of "The Sweetest Thing". Then let yourself escape to Cowgirls. It has some very funny parts. Hilarious actually. It also has very good music; kudos to kd.lang. I also mentioned that it has 90 minutes from Uma Thurman ..... should I say more?
