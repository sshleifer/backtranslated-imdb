I grew up to watch this series. I was about seven / eight years old when it was on. I still remember the first episode called the "New House". It got the h * ll out of my fright! I can almost hear that image, laughing crazy. And the end, O my God! The listener spirit comes into the room for the child: Yikes! It was classic TV and it was one of a kind series. I got a DVD collection for sale on the internet: 2 actually. My question to any reader: Did anyone buy this set? It's a bootleg. Both sellers claim they have a very good copy. I have a sketchy and weak DVD from the "The New House" section, and some other episodes that are a bit better, but if anyone knows if it's much clearer, it'll be worth it to me. buy and share with my children. A good series, smart, frightening and constantly supernatural. Thanks in advance to any supporters who are the lowest on any of these- In fact, I'd like to discuss it. Chris Walker
