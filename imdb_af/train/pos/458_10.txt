My wife, Kate, and I absolutely loved the series and can't wait for the next one. (Hopefully there is a sequel!). I would like to know what the catchy song is called and who wrote it, maybe because I'm "old and gray" and still interested in life :-). If someone has the full lyrics, please send it. <br /> <br /> Of course, one major reason why my wife and I liked this series is that we were 75 years old and retired, but still very active intellectually. It is wonderful to see a show that emphasizes the contribution to society that can still be made by older people with special skills and experience. The human interest that represents the interactions of the characters and the younger people around them is an important part of the show. <br /> <br /> This series is very entertaining and very sophisticated, in keeping with some of our other favorites, "Spooks" and "Hustle".
