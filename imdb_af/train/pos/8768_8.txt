I saw this movie at a store in the cheap section. I actually remembered life to see the advertising and trailer for it. I thought, "What the hay" and buy it, basically because the plot sounded interesting and Claire Danes had always been someone of talent in my eyes (that was also before I became a big Kate Beckinsale fan). <br /> <br /> So it's about two girls hiding after a holiday in Bangkok, being banned for drugs (of which they are innocent) and then sent to a Thailand prison. The film follows what will happen to them and will sometimes question their innocence. <br /> <br /> Both Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale give good performances, and the plot of this film unfolds unconventionally and brings some good moral discussion questions. <br /> <br /> I think it's a solid good movie, but there could have been some improvements. It could have been longer ... it would have helped to strengthen these characters and would have helped more insight into Thailand's legal system. <br /> <br /> However, this is a good movie with some good performances. <br /> <br /> PS For all your pop culture junkies are looking for a two-minute role by Paul Walker. I didn't even see him for the first time watching the movie.
