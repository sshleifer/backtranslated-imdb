I have never been big on IMAX movies. They are cool, but as soon as you feel the first rush of "Whoa, it feels like flying!" the movies themselves are usually pretty stingy and ordinary. <br /> <br /> The exceptions are the powerful "Everest", the exciting Wild California and now the BBC's "The Human Body", a super-sized look inside our bodies. <br /> <br /> Our bodies are machines of complexity that are simply unthinkable. This 50 minute movie can be 10 hours long, and still won't work with all the systems, just as I type this review and listen to my radio and most of us take it for granted. <br /> <br /> Here you can see the inside of a pumping heart (looks like an alien spaceship), the inside of your lungs, the tiny hair in your thrombus that processes sound, the development of a baby inside a mother's uterus, and surprisingly, some of the ... um, less attractive features I thought would be ashamed of (pimples, tearing acids in the stomach ...) <br /> < br /> This movie also has a rather funky style of it, which sets it apart from other IMAX documentaries. For example, we've all seen sperm find its way to the egg, but have you ever seen the voice of Marvin Gaye's "Let's Get It On"? It's creative moments like what makes "The Human Body", not just a health lesson, but also fun.
