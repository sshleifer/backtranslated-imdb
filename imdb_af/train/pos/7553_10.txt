When I saw this movie a few days ago, my eyes were completely tied to the screen. The greatness has kept my attention to such an extent that I have focused my attention on its duration. I would recommend not only watching anime fans, but anyone who enjoys a good movie period (or who really likes strange things). The style of art is beautiful, the sound is perfect, and the symbolism in it is breathtaking. I heard complaints about the strange insertion of English text into the movie, but I think the way it is done is complementary to the strange style of the movie. The self-assigned description of "Hello Kitty on acid" does not fit this film of absolutely epic proportions. I'd like to find more works by who made it and see them.
