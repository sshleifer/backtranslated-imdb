Let me start by saying at the young age of 34 I was suddenly widowed. I was devastated because he was not sick --- he died unexpectedly from a wreckage - his carotid blew out - he died behind our house. There was a lot of speculation from the police because he fell on something and it founded his head. I was a suspect for murder until the autopsy returned. <br /> <br /> My children were as traumatized as I was, so in love with a good father figure like him. I had three small children, no training, no financial support. I have it very, very difficult. <br /> <br /> Within two years, my in-laws attacked me verbally, physically, emotionally, and spiritually. I didn't grieve for the kids, and lit up masks and showed people what they wanted to see, didn't show my pain during holidays ... No one stood up for me and my choice to spend one vacation, except Of course, the sadness I saw, advised me to follow my heart and soul. My in-laws didn't find it! It has forever changed my relationship with them, and I have never been back for a holiday. This is just one example of how my sadness was not done! My own (new) man saw me as if I was talking about the trauma when I shared my soul. I fall apart, can't breathe, hyperventilate, and generally disappear for a few days when I even try to pass on the hidden pain. <br /> <br /> Now about this movie ... <br /> <br /> Today my soul is stirred, my heart broken. My fears and pain reappeared from the real demons that this movie offers; how to grieve compared to how others expect us and the demons. Adam Sandler perfectly portrayed the terrible pain you are facing, overcoming and, above all, working through your own time! This movie snapped up all the pain I've been trying to solve over the years. You see when something so badly affects your soul, so deep that utterances are all that comes out of your mouth in moments of thought. You can't handle it without being dead and dead in death. <br /> <br /> The Bible has a scripture, Romans 8:26 that I clung to, that when my mouth and soul do not know what to pray for, God's Holy Spirit is grieving at God's feet - I don't have to talk. Sandler fully depicted it! <br /> <br /> There is a scene in which he was inaugurated in a court hearing, for mental health commitment purposes, and he goes back in to meet his in-laws --- (familiar with me) --- and he tells for them the wonderful truths he has inherently possessed that he cannot overcome. It's a very powerful and powerful show. I started bawling and had a hard time after wards got up to walk out of the theater, my legs feel too weak to do so. My son was with me and saw it first hand, my precise movements while trying to keep it all together; a lesson to him, my youngest who barely remembers his father. It was 13 years for me, but this movie brought me back when I lost my in-laws forever when they demanded a mask on my emotions and my dedication to their desires, rather than respect for my own. <br /> <br /> I'm writing this so if you're a gripper, you're prepared for this movie, but highly recommend it in the 1000-star performance Sandler has given. <br /> <br /> If you are not yet flu, please take a lesson from his movie and listen and accept people's choices in their sadness and let them find peace in their own time! Sometimes the soul cannot express the words to convey our pain. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie with tissues and not without preparing it ... to your soul!
