Surviving Christmas is a surprisingly funny movie especially in the face of bad publicity when it was first released. Ben Affleck is funny as a stupid millionaire who pays the family home to his home to be his family for Christmas. He then drives the family crazy with overcapacity for Christmas. I haven't been a Ben Affleck fan in the past (although I like Daredevil and Paycheck), but here he is well in this role. I also like Christina Applegate as the daughter in the family who can't even hold Affleck's character. Sure you can see where this movie is going, but you don't mind. Ignore what the critics say and hire this movie because it is nicer than many Christmas movies.
