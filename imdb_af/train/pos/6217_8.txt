Follow the fleet, a RCO production in 1936, stars Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers in a complex romantic comedy. Although Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers had many similar romantic movies together, RKO helped them to re-create a worthwhile storyline incorporating appropriate societal situations at the time of its creation. The story of Follow the Fleet relies heavily on the use of layered story lines between the two sets of main characters to create a satisfying romantic comedy. <br /> <br /> The general plot of the movie revolves around Bake Baker, a US Navy sailor played by Fred Astaire, and Sherry Martin, Bake's former love and dance partner, now a singer and dancer is played by Ginger Rogers. Their story begins when Bake is on the ship and his shipmate Bilge Smith finds a picture of both of them. Bake reveals that the last time he saw her, he asked her to marry him, and Bilge suggested that they try to meet. with her when they are on land, hoping they can have a friend. <br /> <br /> The next big scene starts with the second plot of the movie when Connie Martin, Sherry's sister, gets into Paradise, where her sister works unless accompanied by a man. She turns around to find Bilge behind her with a bag of drinks, so she plays it as if waiting for him and also buys his entrance into Paradise. Connie then finds Sherry and tells her she's depressed because she's not lucky. Sherry does with men, so Sherry suggests that she get a makeover from her friends while acting on stage. Connie gets over and comes back to the counter, and comes back to Bilge, who is stunned by her eyes. It starts with the second romantic story between Bilge and Connie. <br /> <br /> In the rest of the movie, the story and emerging actions are passed between changing comedian reliefs of the two couples' problems causing various mini-emerging and falling actions within the overall plot. Bake and Sherry hit it out of their first moments as they competed in a dance competition and eventually won. It reminds them of the success and pleasure the two have when they are together. Similarly, Bilge can swing Connie through his romantic efforts to please her, and they go to her home. <br /> <br /> This series of happy events will soon be followed by troubled measures that bring the rising action back. Bake the Sherry the night before to go to the ship before midnight, and tell her he will come to her that morning. Unfortunately, the ship sets a course after the razors come back, upsets Sherry and makes her think Bake is still a typical sailor looking for a good time on land. <br /> <br /> The mood is changed again when another subplot is entered into the movie when a "big shot" takes a tour of the ship. This alternative storyline is used to create a buffer between the stories of the two main relationships of the film, as well as build confidence and love for Bake's overall good intentions. The party is interrupted by the unconscious music coming from Bake and his companions when they missed the sound of reporting on the deck. The ladies are intrigued and ask to hear them play, and Bake likes to entertain them with some dance, which ultimately helps brighten the sphere of the movie and bring the sailors happy. <br /> <br /> After returning to the couple's entangled stories, Sherry tries to prove she doesn't need his help to land a job. Unfortunately, Bake is unaware of his audition and is going to bring in a good word for Sherry if he hears his friend in the studio talking about the remarkable lady audition. Bak takes it upon herself to help Sherry by tampering with her water so she can't sing right and destroy her audition. In addition to Bake's mistake, Connie spent all her money repairing a ship, hoping that Bilge would take over as captain. She also planned a remarkable dinner for him when he had to come, but Bilge was aware of her intentions and hoped to get married soon and was no longer interested, so he got up. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie continues in the same format of mini-emerging and falling action until the climax between the two couples is reached, and the movie ends with the happiness of both couples. Using the changing stories helps to build interest and emotion within each couple, as they deal with all their struggles with both happiness and pain. The enthralling stories can also relate to one another, including other unrelated subplots to convey the narrative to the concluding scenes. <br /> <br /> Although Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers have featured numerous films that include romance, comedy, songs and dance, the fleet follows a unique film for the two actors who successfully use the subplotting technique to tell the narrative between the two main characters.
