Now it's more like that! The first movie had some dialogue and some poor acting, but the team seems to be gathering these things for the successor and bringing out a solid, enjoyable, hilarious and creative comedy that is all on the edge of their seats will keep. all the way through. <br /> <br /> Seriously, it's just full of good stuff, full of creativity, and it's less of a 80-movie spoof at the same time. The scenes in hell are great, and so are they in Heaven. There is really no shortage of the crazy-cap adventurous skirt this one promises, and you will never see another movie like this. Even the hammy-final act of the movie is not as bad as the first one, and is generally heart-warming and enjoyable in its extremely clich√© repertoire of family-functional movie bliss. And even Keanu Reeves, despite about 30, is not that bad here. <br /> <br /> Sounds like a good deal for me.
