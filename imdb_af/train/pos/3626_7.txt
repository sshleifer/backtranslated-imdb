This effort is based on the true story of Jim Morris, a high school science teacher / baseball coach, inspired by his players to try out the benefits and fulfill his lifelong dream of playing in the majors. Dennis Quaid, no stranger to sports films, plays Morris with enough conviction to make the part work and the producers do a credible job of reviving the real events that led to the short-lived Morris as a relief jug for the turbulent Tampa Bay Devil Stones. . The first half of the film, which deals with its bunch of Baseball High School players (all too old to really be in high school) is less effective and probably a little too long. Overall, the film suffers from some pacing issues and some extra subplots that we could probably do without. However, it is still a reasonable movie with an inspirational theme that proves that baseball is the national pastime for some reason. GRADE: B-
