I accidentally found this movie many years ago and then wondered (still) why it didn't receive the award. Well written, nice play, one ironic turn to the other, and THIS IS AVAILABLE in what the deadly characters are trying to do. I would not recommend this movie for people with short attention; It requires sufficient intelligence to understand that there may be a core truth in this story.
