A lot of American students and their tutor decide to visit the ugliest part of Ireland to study ancient religious practices. Despite being repeatedly warned about the dangers of getting off the closed road (by the local, sly Irish guy, nasp), they only do it, and with their inside on the outside with a family inbred cannibals ( the descendants of the notorious Sawney Bean clan, which, according to the film's foolish plot, picked up from Scotland and settled on the Emerald Isle. <br /> <br /> If you think pornstars plus low budget crunches are automatically equal to tons of nudity and awful acting, then think again: Bose Breed is a brush with adult stars, but in reality there is not nearly as much nudity as what one expected to involve in the 'talent', and the play, although worthy of Oscar, is not all bad (with the exception of Ginger Lynn Allen, who we know can do wonderful 'French' , but whose Irish are common). Angry Race opens in beautiful style with the brutal blow of a few amorous campers: after a few short undercloth sex, the silicone reinforced hottie has been dragged out of the tent and half torn; The man cut off his arms and legs and roasted on a spit. It's a very good start, and offers good for the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, after this promising start, things are starting to descend seriously: we are introduced to the main characters, pleading an annoying bunch of thirty-two just to become cannibal chow, and being subjected to a quite a bit of time in the form of some horrible fake substances, a lot of blarney about murderous druids from local Irish weirdo Gary (Simon Peacock) and worst of all, a sub-scream, postmodernist talk about horror movies conventions (how smart!). <br /> <br /> Then, just as it seems the movie never gets better, director Christian Viel has decided to become serious: a man gets a knife running through his head and there is " a free sex-in-the-shower scene with beautiful blonde Gillian Leigh (not a pornstar, but I'm sure there is a career waiting for her). Then things quickly improve as the cannibals kick in the best meat cutlery, and the film is transformed into a real carnage. Gary pulled a donkey up his ass (over time!), And was strangled with his bowels; Ginger Lynn kicks a mutant; Jenna Jameson was torn open, cut open and grabbed her silicone breast implant by tangled cannibal; a man is covered by cheese wire; and Taylor Hayes is bloody, bruised and naked with a dead fetus between her legs (apparently, she is trapped and used as a breeding stock). <br /> <br /> All these are so shameful that they are confused. the less interesting things worthwhile, and earn Evil Breed a final score of 7/10. <br /> <br /> NB. A lot of turbulent production and studio interference led Christian Viel to leave the project. Re-shoots were done and the gore was heavily cut for a US release. The good news is that the British DVD (the version I watched), although the movie is not flowing so well, and being cursed with a terrible end, seems to be relatively rude, as far as the blunder is concerned. (only 13 were cut from the movie).
