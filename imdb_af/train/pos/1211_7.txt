I grew up on this movie and I can remember when my brother and I play in the backyard and pretend we were in Care-a-lot. Now, after so many years, I get the movie with my daughter and watch her enjoy it. If you are older and you have not watched this movie with your children, just keep it in your arms and watch them get excited about the care and care! The songs, especially "Forever Young", are very sweet and memorable. Parents, I highly recommend this movie to all children so they can learn how to care about others! When it comes to all the trash that is on TV, you can increase your children to have the right state of mind with movies like this.
