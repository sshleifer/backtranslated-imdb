I totally agree that "nothing" is a fantastic movie! I didn't laugh so much when I watch a movie for centuries! and David Hewlett and Andrew Miller are fantastic in this! they really work well together! This movie may not appeal to some people (I can't really say why without spoiling it!), But everyone himself! I loved it and recommended it! <br /> <br /> Directing is great and some of the shots are very clever. They might have had a lot of fun filming it! <br /> <br /> Although there are really only 2 main characters in the movie and not a large number of props, the actors can print it and make the movie look pleasant.
