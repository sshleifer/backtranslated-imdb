This is by far my favorite of the American Pie Spin offs, mainly because the main character (one of the young Stiflers) in most of the others always seems unrealistic of nature. <br /> <br /> For example, AP: The Naked Mile. You have a teenage man surrounded by naked college chicks and have a particularly hot on his way to get rid of his virgin problem and he ends up in the middle of the action and drives a horse back with his girlfriend who slept in mind he gave a "debt-free pass" for the weekend. I can appreciate the romantic aspect of the whole thing, but let's be realistic; Most people watching this movie are not looking for a romantic story. <br /> <br /> While the most recent installment finally realizes who the audience is and good old Erik Stifler seems to wake up and smell the smell of roses and as always lend Mr. Levenstein made his "perfectly natural" eyebrow humor for the comparison and made a touch with this new movie.
