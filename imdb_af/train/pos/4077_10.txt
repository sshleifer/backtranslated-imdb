I only saw it on UK TV in the early nineties, but I enjoyed it so much, but I had a chance to paste it. Many years have passed, but the film has always held me and I lost the hope of seeing it again, the most important thing that stuck to me was the end, the hole castle part really touched me, it's easy to watch, have a great story, good music, the list goes on and on, that's OK, i say how good it is, but everyone will be there own best bits with them as soon as they have seen it, yes the animation is In addition, and beautiful to look at, it shows its age in very few parts, but it has now become part of that beauty. I'm so glad it came out. on DVD, as it is one of my top 10 movies of all time. Buy it or rent it just to see it, the best view is at night alone with drinks and food in reach, so you don't have to stop the movie. <br /> <br /> Enjoy
