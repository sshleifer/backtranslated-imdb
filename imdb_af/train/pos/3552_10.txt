I just want to add two cents, and forgive me if I repeat something that has already been posted, but I feel it is worth reminding people of the eternal genius of Damon Runyon. Without the wonderful street, hilarious writings of Damon Runyon, this movie would never have been made - not even most other classic players who did gamblers and the like before 1960. Damon Runyon worked as a newspaper man and he was from Colorado, but he certainly did the street scene of the East Coast. If you're not a dedicated fan of old Hollywood comedies, I would recommend some other movie from Damon Runyon's writings; "The Lemondrop Kid," and "Little Miss Marker", both have Bob Hope, who, apart from his politics, has always been a funny man. (As a liberal west coast I find his politics pretty funny, too!) Damon Runyon lives !!!!
