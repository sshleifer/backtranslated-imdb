THE MELTING MAN ... a tragic victim of the spacecraft, he died MELTING ... never understood that the race had long since burned ... <br /> <br /> A Man (Burr DeBenning) not the kitchen stove. But instead of shouting something, a NORMAL person will scream, he shouts something like AAAAATCH-KAH !! sounds. This movie you came in is not a normal movie. You've just taken your first step in THE UNKNOWN MELTINGMAN, the well-known late-70s gore movie featuring Rick Baker's amazing makeup effects. Baker was just about to become a superstar, and did it simultaneously with his famous "cantina strangers" in STAR WARS. For some strange reason STAR WARS has become a household name and has the irreconcilable merchant. <br /> <br /> This may have something to do with the fact that this movie is just indignant. From the Opening Credits ("Alex Rebar and The Incomparable Smiling Man". That's really what it says!), To the chubby nurse who walks through a glass door, to the fisherman's head that goes over a waterfall and graphically breaks rocks. , this movie offers many, many moments of pure incomprehensibility. "Why did they ... but how did he get ... why are they ...?" After a while you stop wondering why and watch it as it is - a very entertaining piece of garbage. <br /> <br /> An astronaut returns to Earth in a melting radioactive state; he escapes, and his mind as well as his body dissolves, begins a mad melting spree. The authorities decide quickly that the smoker should be stopped, but (probably not wanting a panic) he wants to catch him as quietly as possible, so they send one man with a geiger counter to him. > <br /> Storywise happens surprisingly little during the movie The melting man blows to kill people A doctor is looking for him with a Geiger counter, several characters are introduced, questions are asked and left, and eventually the doctor comes on the meltman, but is not shot by a security guard after explaining that he "dr. Ted Nelson "is not. The melting man ends and ends in a big puddle of goo. The end. <br /> <br /> It's so brainless that it somehow ends up being fun, Despite a rather downward end, a widescreen DVD edition is thought to be planned, a very special movie.
