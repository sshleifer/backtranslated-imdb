I thought this movie was made very well, Heath Army was very convincing and his Irish accent was flawless. Orlando Bloom and Naomi Watts were also very good and credible. How true it is is what I really did not do, but it is why people sometimes become what they do. Perhaps those in authority have always been corrupt and I found it interesting that more than 30,000 signed a petition for Ned Kelly to NOT be suspended. Maybe there was more truth in this movie than at first thought? In many ways it reminded me of Cold Mountain, which was another good historical film. All in all, I would highly recommend this movie and I'm somewhat amazed at why it didn't do better in the theater.
