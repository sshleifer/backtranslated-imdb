"How to lose friends and alienate people" is not based on Tiger Woods' infidelity. This is a mediocre romantic comedy based on Toby Young's book on his experiences as a journalist who holds celebrities. The movie stars Simon Pegg and Sidney Young, a brilliant British journalist who takes a job in a famous New York magazine. Young is uneasy to catch all kinds of shenanigans to alienate around him, hence film title. He is unwavering, risky and moronous. But for some strange reason, he is a bit of a nice character. Sidney is a friend of a co-journalist, composed Alison Olsen, who played Kirsten Dunst quite admirably. Sidney, however, longed for the sex-pot actress Sophie Maes by the fantastic. Megan Fox is played. This foxtrot is short on acting skill, but high on an "eye candy" material. Sidney gets in all kinds of tomfoolery to move journalism in the magazine together. This is the peak comic moment of the movie. However, I think director Robert Weide and scriptwriter Peter Straughan may lose some viewers and alienate original rom-com material by developing an indisputable romantic plot line between Sidney & Alison. although Team Weidstraughan otherwise formulated an entertaining story. Pegg tied his character to the wire with his hilarious performance as Sidney Young. Jeff Bridges is rebuilding The Dude bridges with his enigmatic supporting work such as Clayton Harding, the magazine's suave prez. But the rest of the movie's play was not worthy enough to appear here. "How to lose friends and alienate people" should not be completely alienated, but you may lose some movie friends if you make it a superlative romantic comedy. *** Average
