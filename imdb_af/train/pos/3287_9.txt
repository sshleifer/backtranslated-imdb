My friend and I chose 'Paperhouse' from a random stack of movies on our weekly Horror section trip. None of us heard this, but the blurb on the box was really promising. And the film didn't disappoint, although I probably wouldn't call it a horror movie. <br /> <br /> 11-year-old Anna Madden draws a home and visits it in her dreams. She certainly sleeps when she sees the house, but it's actually so much like a completely separate reality. What does not seem to be far from the truth in the light of later events. Anyway, she finds that she can add home, content and environment by simply adding the picture. <br /> <br /> While this is going on, Anna is becoming increasingly sick with fever, and besides, it gets totally obsessed with home and her drawing. She and her mother are also dealing with her absent father; he has a job that takes him away for long stretches, although one gets the impression there is more to the story than that. <br /> <br /> OK, so the artwork sounds good enough - but frankly, there's really something threatening about it. The dream world is honestly surreal - for example, the house is just a gray block in the middle of a deserted field. The people who made the movie did a good job of making us very uncomfortable with this alternative world / constant dream. <br /> <br /> One of the things Anna adds home is a boy Mark, who looks to be the same patient who keeps talking to her doctor (I don't give it away, you know right now that he seems to be the same child. In fact, Mark cannot walk because of illness; In Anna's drawing world he can't walk because she didn't draw him legs. She blames herself for his real illness, and tries to correct the situation, but ... everything starts really weird. She even brings her absent father into the drawing, with disastrous results. The bits with the dad are really scary. <br /> <br /> I don't want to throw anything away, so I'll stop there ... There's a lot in this movie. I'm sure you'll analyze a ball that does this thing, do the killing with your pals after watching it. Is it a simple story as it seems or is there really low meaning? I don't know, but it's quite fascinating. There was a "Nightmare On Elm Street" quality about it, because at some point reality and dreams cross. I like such things. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is that it feels like it could end many times, but not. I'm happy with the end it had (some of your sensitive types want Kleenex handy!), Although it really does have a variety of conclusions. Anyway, it doesn't feel exactly pulled out when it's actually over, but as you look and drop, it's a little nervous. <br /> <br /> Still, "Paperhouse" is a real Good movie. This is well done, and acting - especially Charlotte Burke as Anna - is also. Burke, who has never appeared in a movie before, is a real gem. I don't know why she never did anything again, but she is actually very convincing and pleasant to look at. <br /> <br /> "Paperhouse" is not a horror movie, it's a fantasy / tension / something different movie, with certain definite horror moments - but you can still see it with your family and not worry be that your little brother or grandmother will be multiplied by blood splashes or something. <br /> <br /> Give it a chance, you won't regret it! And maybe you should also read the book ...
