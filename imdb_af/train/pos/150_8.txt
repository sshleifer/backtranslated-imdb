The latest film by Spanish director Agusti Villaronga is a study of how children experiencing violence and isolation in their remote community develop into upset young adults who need certain psychic tools to cope with their hidden spiritual weakness. Whether these instruments are religiously pursued, caring for others or just entering a macho image as a male prostitute. Villaronga is making a successful study of how these vices affect three teenagers living in Spain under Franco. The three testify to the disturbing double deaths or their friends before they are teens and then bury the emotions they experience with their counterparts until they meet at a hospital again for those suffering from tuberculosis. <br /> <br /> The movie style of the text is typically visually cute as you would expect from the Spanish author and is very much reminiscent of the co-Spanish Pedro Almodovar's work on sexual desire themes, both heterosexual and homosexual . An element that is different between the two directors is that Villaronga questioned a supernatural undertone with a claustrophobic, eager realism used against Almodovar's use of surrealism, although both styles are similar. <br /> <br /> The piece gives insight into upset young psyche and contains disturbing violence and scenes of sexual nature. I strongly recommend watching this movie as it contains elements that will remain in the audience for a considerable period after the show.
