It has the funny jokes from all the Cheech & Chong movies. It's the first one I've seen with these guys. I found it really good. My dad actually advised me to get it. WHAT A GREAT ROLL MODEL, and my BIG MACHINE bought it for me, to know what it was like. What a family I have. Well, this movie is pretty good and nice to rent if you want to see a good classic. But I have to warn you, it's not funny. It has its moments, but not so funny, there's something about Maria. Check it anyway. I'm sure you'll laugh. Unless you're an anti-drug activist or something.
