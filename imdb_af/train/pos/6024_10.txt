I saw ZP when it was first released and found it a huge disappointment. His writing was forced and bowed and fakey '60s. It's politics too early and ridiculous. And let's face it, I was still under a love game, known as BLOWUP: and I haven't quite shaken it yet. Now the "love" is distorted with all sorts of nostalgia it calls and, oh well. . . Good luck to me! <br /> <br /> But time trials and times were good for ZP and the time was for me a teacher. I repeat this movie every ten years and it just gets better and better with age. And ZP is its own "experience" and is just really linked to BLOWUP by its creator, the late, Mr Antonioni. <br /> <br /> Twelve years ago, I was very fortunate to have an absolutely pristine print, projected at its correct size (immense), restored by an Italian government cultural agency that knows a good work of art when they see and know how important it is to keep such a beautiful beauty. Until today I remember the fall of the audience when Death Valley's first shot appeared. It was like a thousand-volt visual shock that Antonioni deliberately gave us a new level of awareness. And indeed, what follows is a completely different place. <br /> <br /> What's amazing is how this movie comes in its own. <br /> <br /> I remember the second time to see it --- the early 80's --- I started to feel love for the movie as a whole and especially for Daria and Mark. While these two looked like a clever-shade version of Zefferelli's Olivia and Leonard (read: Romeo and Juliet), they now kept me busy - especially the girl in her urgent demolition alliance. She took her time. . . To live. Everything, everything dies around her. <br /> <br /> At the exciting theater, the day of Reality quickly wiped out my new, new "enjoyment". The inscribed shoulder-loaded, big haired 80's whisper. "But it's a hippie fantasy --- let it go." <br /> <br /> The power of Antonioni's vision, I realized, has already worked for me first, the FIRST time to answer that, I answered a "Uh-Huh" "80s" and secretly, possess and jealously guard my "love". <br /> <br /> But this is the good art, living it inside of you, and if you want it, it has its way and you love you: secretly, jealously and possessively. And you are "changed". <br /> <br /> Was excited to see Turner Classic Movies decide to show ZP in its March lineup. Undoubtedly, ZP should be seen on a giant screen so it can really take you into its constructed environment. But hey, sometimes even a look at the beloved in a newspaper photo is no better than no look. <br /> <br /> Today, reality hit, ZP was secretly withdrawn and replaced with the wine-like antique of ALICE'S RESTAURANT. <br /> <br /> So it's still too difficult, too "disturbing", also "what"? <br /> <br /> Perhaps it is, as with all good art, living it while everything dies around. <br /> <br /> Peace.
