One of the more intelligent serial movies in recent history. ZODIAC KILLER offers an imaginative backdrop to the background and history of one of the most notorious serial killers. The filmmakers create an unexpectedly good insight into the pathology of this mysterious killer, and anyone who remembers Zodiac will be intrigued. Others will want to discover more about this mysterious criminal. Unlike many serial killers, Zodiac was not mad, but very methodical and self-promoted. The director plays the expectations of the viewer and pulls it down. The film was built as a murder mystery, or a "cold case" style thriller. It's an intelligent investigative / procedural style horror movie that gorehounds are looking for inexpensive tension. <br /> <br /> Some people don't like any movie shot on video. This attitude is very old-fashioned and provincial. It's an attitude and view of movies that puts technical issues above entertainment value or artistic value. These attitudes are on the way out. ZODIAC KILLER is a low-budget movie, no doubt, but critical viewers will look beyond it and find a carefully formed jewel.
