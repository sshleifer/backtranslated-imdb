Yes, it's an ultra-low budget movie. The play is therefore not award-winning material and sometimes the action is slow, because the filmmakers shoot longer rows and not a million moments that are then worked out in a movie. This film features an excellent script that takes vampirism seriously, explains it and develops a complete plot of it. Apart from the vampire story, we get detailed genetics information, legal and law enforcement, martial arts action, philosophical music, and some good metal music. Kudos goes to Dylan O'Leary, director / writer / lead actor. It is beyond me how this man could fulfill all these roles and do so well. I think to appreciate this movie, you need to be well-versed in all kinds of themes to see that the author did a lot of research and knows about all of these things. There is also fantastic camera work, interesting camera angles and one underwater vampire attack, something I haven't seen before, but which pays homage to the underwater summer attack in Fulci's Zombi. The casting is good, as far as the sexy woman is indeed sexy. The main vampire also looks perfect for the roll. The female victim looks vulnerable. My only complaint is that for a low budget horror flick, there had to be more nudity. If you want to see an original vampire movie with a wonderful story, this movie is for you. I look forward to future projects by Mr. See O'Leary.
