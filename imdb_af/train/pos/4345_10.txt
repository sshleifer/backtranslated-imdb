It's no wonder this movie has won 4 prizes, it's a movie that hangs on any soul. It's no wonder why Paul Reiser had 20 years to go in and talk to Peter Falk about his idea. I can understand every part of it, it's a movie that will make you cry, just a tear or thousands. <br /> <br /> Story: 10/10 When Sam Kleinman gets a letter from his wife about her, he leaves for something else to find his son and him on a road trip to find her, and while they do, they find something lost, friendship, family and love for each other. At first you know what is going to happen, but no one is not so easy to finish. It's a ride between a father and his son, a man and his wife. It's no wonder Paul Reiser took 20 years to write this beautiful comedy. <br /> <br /> Actors: 10/10 Well, you can't say anything other than I intend to say, it's with Peter Falk In this he is a legend he does in movies, is magic, if you use Peter Falk in a romance / comedy, what do you think you get? A perfect outcome, it's no wonder that this movie is perfect and has won many prizes. As son Paul Reiser does an excellent job, though he is not a good actor, it does not mean it doesn't work. Peter Falk and Paul Reiser play the perfect Father and Son, the rest of the role is good enough, but you don't see them so much, just say they do what they will to make it even more shine. <br /> <br /> Music: 10/10 It doesn't always work when music is used, sometimes it doesn't fit but it's not the thing in this movie, the music is perfectly in harmony, it even makes the movie more compelling. This part of the movie will shine as well as the other parts, a good soundtrack for a Romance / Comedy. It certainly is. Overall: 10/10 There are so many novels / comedy movies on tapes, DVDs, Blu-ray and whatever, but this movie is one of the specials. It does not happen every day that you can create a story like this, it takes years to think and it is actually what it took to make it, a big piece to be bought and kept in the human soul If you grow old and see your father in old age, I think this movie will sparkle like no one else has.
