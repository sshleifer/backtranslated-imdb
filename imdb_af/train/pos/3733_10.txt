I had an uncle who commits suicide after serving in Vietnam because of spiritual problems he experienced after returning. So when I saw a movie on a pay-per-view channel one night, I was intrigued. I wanted to know what my uncle was going through and felt like he was ready for Vietnam. I went out and rented this movie and I have to say this is the most heartbreaking movie I have ever seen. I bought the DVD immediately after renting it. The way it emotionally engages you in so many different directions is something I've never experienced with any other movie. As far as Vietnam's subject films go, I think it's the best one, though Platoon runs a close second. Besides this, I think it's also Colin Farrell's best performance as an actor. I love him in most of his movies, but in this one he was incredible. I gave it a 10 rating because it is one of my top five favorite movies.
