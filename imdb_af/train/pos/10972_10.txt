I just saw it recently, but I have been aware of it for a number of years and have always been intrigued by its title. It belongs to me now as one of my favorite movies. It is difficult to discover the incredible topic discovered by the Maysles, but everything in it works great. It has so many unforgettable images and moments where you feel you are encroaching in a very private world. I fell in love with this movie and with the characters in it. It is as if the filmmakers have thrown a lot of the audience and drew us into the strange world of eccentric Beales, a true aristocratic family. It has a tangible atmosphere and I found myself able to get out of there and cook my corn on the bat at my table. It has an air of sadness that permeates throughout. A fall of greatness for this once valued family. The money went, but their gaps and grasses remained, as well as their beauty. It took me from the first frame and long after the movie was finished, I was surprised at their fate. If you're wondering if I've taken a walk along East Hampton beach, I still hear Old Edie's voice at night and see Little Edie's silhouette dancing in the window behind the thick hanging branch. Unforgettable.
