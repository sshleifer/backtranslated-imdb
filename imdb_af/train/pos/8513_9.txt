I have always had the philosophy that every person has a different taste, I found this movie to be wonderful and I think every college student out there will agree with me. Despite this, it's not a movie with a plot, it's about real guys and some of the "problems" they face. I found the movie hilarious (especially the parts with which they played the practical jokes on each other). Simply put, if you're in the same "wavelength" as these people, you'll find this movie incredible. I don't think it will win Golden Globes or Oscars, or that people in this movie will become future Hollywood stars, but it is a kind of "cult classic" among young people who relate to their experience. To me, the man who stands out most is Hans: the Scandinavian man, who, according to him, is a viewer, but gets all the chicks. The "little ones" also play a big role in the movie, especially when they are drunk. If I continue, I can give you a spoiler and I don't want to, just go and get the movie and you won't regret it. I give it an 8/10
