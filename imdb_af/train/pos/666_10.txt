Episode two of the season one is a wonderful holiday story of love, betrayal, ... and a murderous, escaped, lunatic dressed as Father Christmas. <br /> <br /> A woman (Mary Ellen-Trainor) just killed her hubby. on Christmas Eve for his life insurance. What begins as a perfect crime, begins a struggle to survive as a depraved, psychopath-wearing Santa Clause suit (Larry Drake, perfect over), and threatens her life ... as well as her precious young girls. <br /> <br /> This episode is warmly remembered by even those who are casually acquainted with the program. By the way, this particular reviewer looks at routine every Christmas. Most notable for his increasing tensions and interpretations, And All Through The Houst is among Tales From The Crypt's best.
