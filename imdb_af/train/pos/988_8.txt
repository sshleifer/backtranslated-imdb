I like this movie. When the man who was on a bank died of $ 40 million in gold, his cell-mate was used as "bait" to lead them to the high-tech mad killer partner (implanted through a monitoring device in his jaw without his knowledge). It's an action, spy type movie with enough comic scenes to keep it light. It reminded me of the enemy of the state. Well done and well enough plot.
