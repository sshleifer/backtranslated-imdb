This is one of my all time favorite movies, PERIOD. I can't think of another movie that combines so much nice movie features like this one does. This movie has everything: Action, Adventure, Science Fiction, Good vs. Bad and even some Romance (without even an innocent "cock" on the cheek between the Pazu and Sheeta). Perhaps best of all, you don't have to be in Mensa to get it and enjoy the movie as you do with some Miyazaki's other movies (I don't know about you, but I watch movies for a break. make think). It's just a fun movie that everyone will want, so do yourself a favor and go buy it. The only acidic note is the American Dubbing. I have found that Vander-Geek is simply irritating. But everything is not lost, the original Japanese version is on the two-disc set and it stone! Who cares if you can't understand spoken Japanese? If you can read at a second-level level, check out the original Japanese recording with English subtitles. You won't regret it.
