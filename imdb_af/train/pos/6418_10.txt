I loved this movie. This is a definite inspirational movie. It fills you with pride. This movie is worth the rent or worth buying. It must be in everyone's house. Best movie I've seen long ago. It will make you angry because everyone is so common to Carl Brashear, but eventually it gets better. It's a story of romance, drama, action and lots of funny lines to keep you in. I love the quotes a lot. I use them all the time. They help me to stop me from doing what I want to do. It shows that everyone can reach their dreams, all they have to do is work for it. It's a long movie, but every time I see it, I never see it being so long. I'm so worried that it's going so fast. I love this movie. I watch it when I can.
