Let me set the scene. These are the school holidays and there is absolutely nothing in the movie. I'm with my friend who decides to see. We are looking for a movie that will soon start and "The Grinch" comes up. We buy tickets without knowing what to expect. What we got was a fun roller coaster. <br /> <br /> Jim Carrey (who I can add is my No.1 actor in the whole world) was absolutely beautiful like the Grinch in this Ron Howard's best movie (following Apollo 13). The way this movie was made, the scenery, the actors, the props and the music were just amazing. It brought this child movie to life. <br /> <br /> The story is based on the story of the grinch. As we all know, the Grinch is a terrible person who just can't stand Christmas. He lives high above the whoville and has never mixed with the townspeople. But one girl is going to change The Grinch's look at life and others drastically. <br /> <br /> Cindy Lou Who (played by adorable new actress Taylor Momsem) meets the Grinch as the sort of part of him immediately. She tries to break the barrier and help the Grinch move and mingle with the villages. <br /> <br /> All this movie is a lot of fun for the whole family, both kids and parents. A FIXED 10/10. Well done Jim. <br /> <br />
