Kurt Russell is so credible and the action is so inevitable that it reflects on the fact that it is important to realize that there are important themes that are honest to do well. [Fear of the alien overcomes, learns to rise above early conditioning, the power that can bring love and friendship, etc.] in the storyline. It's so rare for a 'man's action movie' that even I [who thinks most A / A is a violent dad] likes the movie and recommended it to every guy I know ..... It's a pity that this one has been overlooked because by law it had been one of the biggest action adventure box hits - it has something for everyone without losing credibility or losing the almost non-stop action moments. I'm afraid the answer is that it's not a hit lies in the fact that adults won't see it. Anyone under the age of 20 has probably not only seen more violent action in their video games, but will probably not capture or care for the multi-layered multi-themed beauty. This movie can convert someone who avoids A / A as indifferent violence. If a man takes his wife if he sees it in a cable list, he sees this movie, he will be much more likely to fetch her with other action flashes.
