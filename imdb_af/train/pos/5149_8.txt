It's a low docking drama that doesn't cover any new ground, processes all the cliches and is sloppy with facts. For example, Munich is a very flat city. So why is it completely in the movie? For example, the end of the Great War in 1918 was not a surrender, but a ceasefire. Yet, it is made known as a surrender. For example, European news sellers did not shout (and not) headlines while crocheting their newspapers. Yet this rigorous American practice in the movie is employed. For example, the Nazis did not accept the German eagle until they took power, but there it is on the reader, as Hitler delivers one of his blunt winds. In fact, most of this disappointing production consists of little more than Hitlerian fianc√©. The film also continued myth that the ballroom hatched at the Munich Hoffbrauhaus. It wasn't. Robert Carlyle makes a fine representation of his subject. But his supportive role is at best adequate and often not even. These comments are only based on the first episode. One can only hope that the second will be better but not bet on it.
