First, someone mentioned here that because it was released in "limited" quantity, it means it should be bad ... that's exactly what the "big five" Hollywood studios want everyone to think so that they can "pass" or "ignore" features that are not desirable without losing face or imagination by censoring them directly. to this point, this production has been released because it is regarded by some as "unpatriotic". <br /> <br /> Now I absolutely loved this feature; I think it's better than Charlie Wilson's War, even though it's a "fictional" version of something that never happens, but it's always so important. It is for anyone and anyone interested or affected by current US foreign policy, "home" or "aboard". The country "Turkey" and "the emerald" certainly try to look Iraq and Baghdad just like the corporation "Tamerlane" goes for "haliburton" (with Vice-President Dan Aykroyd playing Dick Cheney, LOL). there is silent for a moment actually where the movie IS DEAD, not even sarcastic (main example will be how John Cusack character treats his depression but not just). <br /> <br /> I found ALL characters to be related to something / someone or specific stereotypes. now word of counsel; If you are not politically active, especially regarding the aspects of globalization, you will probably not enjoy this feature, as most of its content and within "jokes" is aimed at certain "personalities" that are not visibile to the general public. on the daily basis ... (main exception would be Hilary Duff who plays the well-known materialistic pop star, I must say name (S)?). At its CORE, the feature is an anti-globalization gig period. The message is undeniably rendered with comic revenge. Joan has a line on one point that goes like this: "and here we have a book written by whom you know, about how I conquered the world and solved the problems with my dad." .PRICELESS))) <br /> <br /> The sister and brother Cusacks are playing well as always, as in Grosse PointeBlank. I'll say a little more "mature". Marisa Tomeihere doesn't show her butt and chest to impress us (as she did recently "Before the devil knows you're dead"), but instead she has a very serious role and controls it to silence . <br /> <br /> Many critics don't get it (can't do it). , or don't want to. It's not a "regular" movie, but more of a comic documentary. This feature stands for delivering a message and not getting Oscars, or having "visual" to get the viewer to buy the latest "HDTV experience" TV sets. I even noticed in my local newspapers that this movie is getting worse -views because it is not "artistic", while PRO Iraq war movies get good thumbs up to "balanced" apparently and "enchanting". One wonders how many the world's mainstream media are concentrated in the hands of a lot of guys. .. <br /> <br /> I bet this feature will prove a hit overseas, so much more than it will be in North America. As I have already mentioned, it is all a satire about US foreign policy and how it was hijacked by "special interest groups". If the "ordinary" American soldier wears the corporate logo of Tamerlane on his coat of arms, it is insulting. BUT EFFECTIVE to show reality as it is, or will soon be the way things go so far. <br /> <br /> Some PRIVATE shots: at "liberation", the land gets commercial advertising; a hilarious scene about how future journalists will probably collect "news" ("everything should be better than this x-box bulls")); soldiers handling their "frustration"; <br /> <br /> Overall, I do not recommend "conservatives" or "hard core" patriots of any kind. This feature is not used to reach people's souls (as mainstream propaganda and commercial interests always try to do so). Instead, it contains a well-defined message for realists, and after some ideological goals it always seems to be "always".
