The year is 1896. Jeff Webster (James Stewart) doesn't like people. There is only one friend he has, and he is Ben Tatum (Walter Brennan), an old sympathetic man. They will manage a cattle herd with them. It will be their key to riches. In Skagway they run into trouble when Sheriff Gannon (John McIntire) takes the cattle. Now Jeff just needs to get it back and run it through the American Canadian border to Dawson. Now they have a group of other people with them, such as the ladies Ronda castle (Ruth Roman) and Renee Vallon (Corinne Calvet). There are the two men in the gold business. The fourth collaboration of The Anthony Mann and James Stewart, The Far Country (1954) is indeed a fine Western. The acting work is excellent. Walter Brennan makes a great sidekick for Stewart. Rut Roman is brilliant and Corinne Calvet is beautiful. Jay C. Flipping is very good as Dawson Marshal Rube Morris. The big Jack Elam and Kathleen Freeman are seen in smaller roles. It's great to watch Jimmy Stewart overcome I have the problems in his way. There is only the man and his gun. But he is also vulnerable.
