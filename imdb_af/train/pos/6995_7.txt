Quite nasty piece with Bela Lugosi as a crazy scientist (yes, a Renfield-like assistant and his mother, a dwarf and yes, the scientist's wife (sounds like a Greenaway movie actually fun) Lugosi gives her woman injections from the dead brides (why do they? Who knows?) so that his wife looks nice. He gets the brides after he made a nice clever trick with orchids that invade the brides in the altar. Fabric, a newspaper reporter just bites HAPPENS to walk around and decides to sniff a story. She gets all sorts of clues about the orchids and Lugosi. The sky knows where the police are. a kind of a strange doctor who may be centuries, all in a far-fetched plan to get a fake wedding to catch the mad scientist, but it seems the scientist has an x-ray vision, like He's following her plans, Oh no! What will happen? I actually liked this movie is a bit of a guilty pleasure. Lugosi is wonderful here, his hangers are all very strange, the story is really nasty in some places that make it most visible. A nice view.
