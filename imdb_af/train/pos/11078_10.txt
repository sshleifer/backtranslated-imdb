I watched the movie today and it just blew my mind away. It's a real masterpiece of art and I don't understand why most people think it's rubbish. The main idea of ​​the movie - take your ego away and you'll have real power! It was the main battle at the end of the movie and Guy Ritchie showed it in a wonderful way. "The biggest enemy will hide in the last place you will ever see" - do you remember it from the movie? Because we are true enemies in us - this is our ego. The voice we always tell us is important, it gives us our pride, it says we should not give, but only to take, which causes our aggression to be in control, creating all the negative feelings and thoughts. GR expressed this idea in an astonishing way and showed that the only way to get real control is when you lose control and just let go of your personal importance. A wonderful movie!
