Oh, a Kelly / Sinatra sailor. So familiar, right? Yes, but this is not the one you usually hear. On the village road. But if you stay around, you can learn something. Okay, probably not. Anyway, Anchors Aweigh tells the story of two sailors on a three- or four-day leave. Joe is the "Sea Wolf" and Clarence, the book-like type, begs Joe to get him a "lady". Now, after being picked up by the hairdressers, they get a little Donald house. That's where they meet Susie, that requester, that Jezebel. I just joke! Clarence falls in love with her. At least he thinks he's doing it. Is he right? Or is he a moron? Or is he just being deceived by society? Find out all this and more if you look at the trumpet fanfare} ANCHORS AWEIGH! <br /> <br /> P.S. If you want to see Kathryn Grayson, be nothing but sickly sweet, try Kiss Me Kate (1953).
