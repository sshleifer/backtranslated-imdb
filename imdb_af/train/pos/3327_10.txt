I love and admire the Farrelly brothers! How do I just see this big movie 3 years after it's released? It made me laugh, it made me cry and it warmed my heart. Big Time. It is difficult to describe in my rotten English - but I have to try anyway: <br /> <br /> The role play is excellent - from the main to the supporting roles, the acting is great, the dialogue is good and the movie is perfectly targeted and edited. <br /> <br /> I think the Farrelly brother movies are often underestimated - they are not light comedies - they are theeeeep! They talk about what life is about (I won't tell you!). <br /> <br /> In my case, this movie confirmed to me what relationships are about: <br /> <br /> If you love someone: set them free, let them be - try the passion and the pain to share and always be together. <br /> <br /> I'm not a sports hater, but definitely a sport ignorant. . But in this movie - the vibrations get you. I could smell the atmosphere of Baseball. Finally, this movie explained to me what a sports fan could mean to you and what cool fan families there should be. <br /> <br /> Thank you, Pete & Bob! <br /> <br /> PS: If you haven't seen it - please see KINGPIN!
