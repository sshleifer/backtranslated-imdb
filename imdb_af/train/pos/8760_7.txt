It is refreshing to see a movie that you think will end happily like almost every other American movie, and then be surprised if it doesn't. I like a happy ending like the next man, but sometimes it's better to predict things in a more realistic way, and I thought Brokedown Palace did it very well. <br /> <br /> The end, with one friend, basically sacrificing herself for the other and thereby releasing her earlier bad behavior, which they had in the first place in the situation, moved a lot. I would have done almost without the last line, proving that she didn't really do the act she confessed, because it would have made the movie more about the friendship between the two girls, and less about the crime. . Whether she did this or not was not that important. <br /> <br /> The story itself bordered on the clich√©, but the actresses kept my attention to their excellent achievements. Very realistic, very fascinating. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10.
