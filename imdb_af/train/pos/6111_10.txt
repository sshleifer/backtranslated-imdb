I accidentally got my Tutor Friend first or two years ago while TV was surfing. Before that I had never watched any Korean movies before I was in my whole life, so MTF was really the first Korean movie I ever watched. And what a wonderful surprise! I was from the beginning until the end of time, and had a good time laughing. His cartoon style is very different from that of the Hong Kong comic movies (which I used to for all my life and was tired too), blowing fresh air into my humdrum movie show experience. I thought there were quite a few scenes and tricks in MTF, which were almost hilarious, witty and original. <br /> <br /> I watched MTF the second time a few days ago, and I've been watching it once, softening the surprise / comic effect on my kind. However, this negatively affected my opinion of the film. Instead, something else has come through this time - it has moved me - the story of how two young, apparently 'enemies' who are completely incompatible, are thrown together and how they gradually resolve their differences and start caring for each other without the feelings To realize themselves, remind me of the long school days. For me, Su Wan and Ji Hoon are actually compatible, as they both have something that is pure and genuine in them, a quality that separates them from people like Ji Hoon's sweet friend. <br /> <br /> The movie is divided into two separate parts - the first part deals with the "battle" between Su Wan and Ji Hoon, and is more violent and quicker to fit. After Ji Hoon passed his final exam, and Su Wan dance the (challenging Ji Hoon's) dance, things start to change. The pace slowed down and ... Ji Hoon suddenly realized he was taking care of Su Wan more than he could ever have imagined. So the 2nd part deals with the development of their mutual feelings, which naturally lead to a happy ending, along with a final build-up with the gang boss. <br /> <br /> Just one last note. I find it a bit incredible. The fact that a 21-year-old self-declared "bad boy" would feel embarrassed to be almost naked in front of the girl, he bulged and lost his "cool" just a little. strange. I think it shows that Ji Hoon is just a boy who is pure in heart and is not really what looks like. Btw, Kwong San Woo (Ji Hoon) HAS A sexy body and perfect figure! ;-) <br /> <br /> MTF is definitely on my list of top 10 favorite movies of all time.
