In Paris, granted and unsafe bureaucrat Trelkovsky (Roman Polanski) hires an old apartment without bathroom where the former tenant, the Egyptian Simone Choule (Dominique Poulange) commits suicide. The unfriendly concierge (Shelley Winters) and the difficult landlord Mr. Zy (Melvyn Douglas) establishes strict rules of conduct and Trekovsky feels through his neighbors. In the meantime, he visits Simone in hospital and touches her friend, Stella (Isabelle Adjani). After Simone's death, Trekovsky feels obsessed with her and believes that his landlord and neighbors are setting up a scheme to force him to commit suicide. <br /> <br /> The strange "Le Locataire" is a disturbing and creepy story of paranoia and error. The story and the process of madness and the loss of identity of the lonely Trelkovsky are slowly evolving into a nightmare atmosphere in the horrific location of his apartment, and what indeed happens is completely unpredictable. The performances are wonderful and Isabelle Adjani is extremely beautiful. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Inquilino" ("The Tenant")
