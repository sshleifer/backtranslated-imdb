For the first time I caught the movie on HBO (probably) 1981 and 15 years old. I thought the movie was hilarious. I remember not seeing the Alfred E. Neuman images in the theater trailers. When MAD Magazine saturated the movie and suddenly stopped halfway with excuses from the "ordinary gang" to surprise themselves with such a shit, I just assumed they were fun on themselves, which I am sure they were, but about they (and Ron Liebman) were so embarrassed to remove their names from any credits, I was quite surprised. Surely there are many worse movies associated with it. Watch the movie on video now (at age 32) with MAD references recovered, I get another kick from it. And I'm a Ron Liebman fan (Hot Rock, Where's Poppa?) I think it's his crown jewel of performances (Speak It Again)
