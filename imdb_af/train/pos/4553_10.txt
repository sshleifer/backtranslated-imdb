As far as I know the real guy playing the main actor, his performance has seen and said it was an excellent portrayal, I agree with him. It's a fantastic movie about a pretty gifted boy / man with a special body part that helps him. Oscar and BAFTA win, and Golden Globe nominated Daniel Day-Lewis plays Christy Browna, cerebral palsy, spending most of his life on the floor, in a wheelchair and carried by his family. However, he has a special left foot, he can write with it, paint it and hold things with it. He learns to speak in the film later, it is very good for a guy like him. Also with Home Alone 2's Oscar tournament, and Golden Globe nominated Brenda Fricker as Mrs. Brown and BAFTA win Ray McAnally as mr. Brown. This is the Best Director Oscars nominated for Jim Sheridan, Best Writing, Screenshots based on another medium's best picture and best picture.
