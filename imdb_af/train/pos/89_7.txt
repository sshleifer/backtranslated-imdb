To be honest, I had no idea what this movie was about when I started it. That's how I watch movies where possible. No prejudice. I thought it would be a movie about stoners in the forest or something. I was wrong, kinda. <br /> <br /> Initially loading was boring, but once it started, it really chopped me off. I know the feeling of being in something dangerous where you feel helpless, but doing things that you don't want to do. <br /> <br /> Another user commented on how this movie was stupid and indecent, but I wanted to disagree. These things don't happen. I'm sorry, but not everyone lives in a dream world where nothing bad can happen and crazy situations are unconditional. Really sorry, but the reality of the WORLD is that it happens. The creator of this movie as well as the actors did a good job of portraying how things can only go bad and how people can really make bad choices. Sometimes things get well, sometimes they get bad and it's life. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie.
