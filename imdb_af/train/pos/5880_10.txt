On the contrary, to the person listed above, I felt that this movie was very funny, especially in the scenes, where there is a lot of mix. I don't want to give away the plot and storyline to the people who haven't watched it yet, but I'll say that Paresh Rawal doesn't have an extensive role like previous Priyadarshan movies, for example Hera Pheri and Hungama. Paresh Rawal plays a wonderful role in the small role he has given, John Abraham does equally well, Akshay Kumar has shown that he is no longer in this movie as he had from Waqt and almost all his films to Andaaz. Although all three heroines in this movie were on a debut, they had a very good job of especially Nargis which is very nice and warm. I would say that if you like Hungama or Hera Pheri, this movie is a must see.
