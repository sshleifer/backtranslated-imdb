Tony Hawk Underground came to a point where the series really started to lose its brilliance. Tony Hawk Pro Skater 4 did not meet expectations and really left the series in the air about what Neversoft and Activision could do with the series that would be different and interesting. <br /> <br /> Underground introduced the story fashion, which was very cool because it made a whole new world for Tony Hawk Pro Skater fans. Another feature that has been introduced to which fans, and made it possible to get off the skateboard, is good, because now you can actually get up, run and do all sorts of new things. <br /> <br /> The levels are good, Neversoft also improved on a problem that started with Pro Skater 3 and that was the length of the flat designs. The first two games for the PS1, N64 and Dreamcast were great because the levels were nice and long and some hidden features in some. Pro Skater 3 and 4 were shortened due to a handful of added features and systems really pushed their limits. In this version, they have shortened those qualities, there are not so many people wondering the streets. In fact there is virtually no one in some levels, and the graphics and skater physics are a bit, but not many. <Br /> <br /> This game has one thing, the story mode is a bit short, of course it is Neversofts first time it with Tony Hawk Pro Skater, so it's understandable. That being said, you will definitely complete this game within a day. <br /> <br /> Overall, a great addition that was very refreshing.
