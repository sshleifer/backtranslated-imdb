Riding Giants is a wonderful movie. It really shows how these people lived back just to navigate. Their lives were basically surfing, living, breathing and fun. They didn't care about money, work, daughters or anything. For them, the waves were their girls. I have never been to a surfboard, and it seems so hard, I don't understand how they can stay on them, it doesn't make sense at all. It's a great movie and if you like to navigate, you really should see this movie. If you are a surfer and you want to find out who started surfing, how it came to life, who is really famous about it or whatever, then you really should see it. It may be a documentary, but it's really good. -Tara F.-
