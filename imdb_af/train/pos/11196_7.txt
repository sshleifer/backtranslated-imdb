'One-Round' Jack Sander is called it because he is a carnival boxer fighting any man in the audience. If they can win one round, they win a prize - a popular way to get customers into travel shows long ago. Jack is in love with the ticket girl, Mabel, though her head turns quickly when Bob Corby enters the ring to try his luck with Jack. What no one knows in the battle is that Bob is the camp so he can beat Jack - though it does a little work. As a result, Bob asks Jack to become his sparring partner and give the carnival track. Later, Jack improves so much that he also becomes a legal boxer. Slowly he is working on the rankings until he is almost ready to tackle the Champ. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the Champ and Mabel are starting to walk behind Jack's back - although Mabel is already married to Jack. So, when the final battle between Jack and Bob takes place, it's very personal and Jack is ready to kill him. Is he good enough? Will the righteous anger against Bob help or hinder his performance? Vote and see. <br /> <br /> This movie was edited by Alfred Hitchcock and today this type of film looks strange to a director known for secrets films in the 1920s. Hitchcock had no fixed genre. He directed or wrote (he did both for this movie). In fact, this film is in many ways more indicative of Hitchcock's silent style, as a somewhat similar plot emerged in one of his next silence, The MANXMAN (also Carl Brisson as the unfair man). So, while it looks like a standard boxing movie of the day, it wasn't a radical departure for this great director - even with his rather formal ending. <br /> <br /> Overall, while a little predictable and If Ian Hunter plays a boxing champion, it looks stupid, the movie works well. While it's far from a perfect silence, it's worth seeing and packing a nice punch.
