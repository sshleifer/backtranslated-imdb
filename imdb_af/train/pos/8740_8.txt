There are good details in A Bug's Life. Everything is covered. The movie looks good and the animation is sometimes jaw. The movie is not too horrible, it's basically a modern approach to Kurosawa's Seven Samurai, just with mistakes. I enjoyed the character interaction and the bad guys in this movie were really bad. It seems that Disney usually makes their bad guys copy-cut. The locusts are threatening and Hopper, the chief bad guy, was a brilliant creation. Exit this one.
