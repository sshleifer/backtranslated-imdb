John Carpenter's Halloween is quite a horror masterpiece. It tells the immortal story of escaped psychiatrist Michael Myers, who returns to his hometown on Halloween night to steal and kill a group of babysitters. <br /> <br /> It was first and foremost the best in the Halloween franchise. Carpenter shows great restraint to slow the story down and build similar characters; unusual for an abomination image. <br /> <br /> Even more unusual is the non-existence of blood and gore, and yet it remains the scariest Halloween so far. Get it! <br /> <br /> Halloween marked the film debate of Jamie Lee Curtis and a focal point in late Donald Pleasance's career. A true classic.
