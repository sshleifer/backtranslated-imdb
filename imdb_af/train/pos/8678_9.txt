Does the peacemaker strike? Apparently. After the violent start with Spike, Tom and Jerry turn everybody together, but Butch shouts and wants to know why. This is a good question. <br /> <br /> "Cats can go with dogs, can't they?" He asked Tom, nodding his head. "Mice can come with cats, right?" Jerry nods "no" and then sees that is not the right answer. <br /> <br /> They go inside and Butch sets up a "Peace Treaty" (with professional artwork!). Most of the rest, and most of the cartoon, are the three of them very nice to each other. A refreshing change of pace. I found it fun to watch. I can make a million of these cartoons in which each one beats each other. <br /> <br /> Anyway, you knew peace wasn't going to last. A big piece of steak spells the death of the "peace treaty", but on the way it was a good change and still has regular Tom & Jerry clever humor.
