I grew up in Houston and was nine when this movie came out. As a result, I remember nothing about the movie. But I remember the sensation it caused Gilley and the mechanical bull to Johnny Lee's hit song "Lookin for Love", which still brings back memories of childhood when I hear it. <br /> <br /> But for a few years I saw this movie for the first time as an adult and all I can say is I was blown away. Few movies hit me harder. This movie is as raw and real as you can get. From Uncle Bob's mansion, the chemical plant in Texas City, Gilley's dance hall, and Bud and Sissy. And maybe it doesn't have a wider profession. But no matter how you feel about country music (I can't stand it, despite my Houston roots). Urban Cowboy is a unique cut American cake. That's why I love it!
