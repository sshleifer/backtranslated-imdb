Steely, powerful gangster supreme Frankie Diomede (the always terrific Lee Van Cleef in fine robust form) has arrested himself and sent him to prison so he can eradicate an insidious partner. Fawning goofball small-time hood and wiseguy wannabe Tony Breda (a friendly portrayal by Tony Lo Bianco) also gets busted. Frank and Tony are an unlikely friendship behind bars. Tony helps Frank break out of the joint and help him seek revenge on a rival group of people led by relentless Louis Annunziata (played by Jean Rochefort). Director Michele Lupo, who works from an absorbing screenplay by Sergio Donati and Luciano Vincenzoni, keeps the neat story in a constant fast pace, keeps a pretty keen but occasionally light sound color and puts on the exciting action pieces a sizeable rip-grabbing brio (a turbulent jailhouse shower blast and a protracted mondo destructo car race as the definite exciting highlights). Van Cleef and Lo Bianco display a nice, loose and engaging screen chemistry; The relationship between their characters is alternately funny and touch. The exaggerated Edwige Fenech is unfortunately not given much to Tony's shiny girl Orchidea, but must at least take up her frenzied, gorgeous body in a very valuable, free, newly-dumped scene. Riz Ortolani's coarse, pulsating, syncopated funk / jazz score definitely hits the psychological swing spot. The sophisticated cinematography by Joe D'Amato and Aldo Tonti is also impressive. A very fine and entertaining little winner.
