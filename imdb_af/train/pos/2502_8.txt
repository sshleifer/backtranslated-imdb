This movie surprised me! He never heard of Hyde or Gackt. I didn't expect much! The reason I wanted to see this movie was because someone mentioned that the movie contains some serious action scenes in John Woo style! Normally I am very careful when demanding it! There is only one John Woo and to this day there was not one director coming close to his brilliance when it comes to action! The fact that the "Moon Child" has a vampire has convinced me even more! How can you go wrong with firearms flyers! Sounds promising and interesting! The first thing I noticed about this movie was that the pace was slow! It takes time to set the mood! This movie features some good Hong Kong style action scenes! But "Moon Child" is not an action movie! It's a drama about friendship and loyalty! The focus is on the characters and their relationship with each other! The pop singers Hyde and Gackt do a good job in acting and are very credible as friends! The only problem I had was with the plot! A few times the movie seems to skip a few years without explaining what happened and why they had to hit it! For example: As one gang member dies (very dramatic moment), Alexander Wang Kei (Hyde) sees blood from one of the attackers! Without warning and explanation, the movie shoots 9 years and most of the friends are no longer together! Even without a proper reason given, Son (Alexander Wang) and Sho (Gackt) must kill each other! I know it's done to add some serious drama! Because of the actors it is very effective, but sometimes it feels forced! Apart from the bugs in the plot, this movie has an atmosphere and grind that makes it difficult not to keep this movie! It's hard to explain why this movie is great! But this is not! The overall experience you get is heart-warming and sincere!
