I only saw Martin's day when I was just 10 years old, at home, on The Movie Channel, and still remember the impact it made on my life. It touched me because no other movie touched me, and I remember blowing my eyes out. <br /> <br /> After the first time I saw it, I couldn't find it anywhere else. I will ask and no one ever heard of the movie! I think it was one of the few scarce movies that many people didn't know, because nobody and I mean nobody knew what I was talking about. I searched and searched throughout, watch video shelves, and scan cable TV lists, but always came short. In the end, I found out in 1996 that I could order it specially, and I probably saw it at least 50 times - and that still keeps me going. <br /> <br /> Martin's Day is about Martin Steckert, a man in jail (but really a good man), who wants it back to the special lake where he grew up as a boy . It was a special place where he lived from nature, spent time with his dog and left alone to enjoy life. Soon in the movie, he escaped and started his way back to the lake. <br /> <br /> It's not long before the police get him, and Steckert grabs a child as a hostage to convince the police to return. Soon, Steckert and his hostage (the 2nd Martin) will be best friends, and have lots of fun adventures - from the robbery of a toy truck, to a train ride, all heading for this special lake. <br /> <br /> During the movie, Steckert made a big flash of him at the lake than a boy. <br /> <br /> I won't ruin the end for you, but I'll tell you, this movie is a must see. This is the best movie I've ever seen in my life! I am without a doubt the biggest fan of this movie ever! I managed to find the song that the two Martin's singing throughout the movie ("I'm going back, where I come from ....) I even plan a trip to Canada to see the lake and the cottage where Martin My Day is filmed, Crazy, I know - but that movie is just as much to me.
