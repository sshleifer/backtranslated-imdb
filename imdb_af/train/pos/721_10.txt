ROCK N ROLL HIGH SCHOOL holds a special place in my heart because it made me aware of the Ramones. I was too young during the seventies to be very aware of them, although I had an older cousin who was a big fan at the time. I finally watched RNRHS on television, one afternoon in the mid-80s when I was about fifteen years old, laughing. (Isn't every high school child's dream to fiber and blow it up?) A year later or two later, I recorded a film recording and kept the concerts of the Ramones concerts over and over and think again, "Man, these guys kick ass! I have to watch some of their albums!" The rest is history. Twenty years, over ten Ramones MPs / cassettes / CDs, and three Ramones later on, they're still one of my all-time favorite bands and RNRHS breaks me every time I see it. Now that Joey, Dee Dee and Johnny left us (R.I.P. everyone), we have at least this movie and tons of good music to remember them.
