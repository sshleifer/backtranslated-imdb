This movie is simply brilliant. The cinematography is good, the acting spectacle and the story is absolutely breathtaking. This is the story of Donald Woods, a white South African who was liberal himself until he found out the reality of apartheid. Kevin Kline is quite convincing - so much so that, when Donald Woods appeared on television a few years later, I recognized Kline's portrayal. Denzel Washington is also in a masterful performance, as always. <br /> <br /> I urge you to see it. It's been long, but it's worth your patience because it tells such an amazing story. Remember, people, it really happened.
