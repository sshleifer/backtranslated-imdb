Let me wish my own happy birds to speak. Tisk the reviewer who dissed the movie. A lovely story that will enjoy people of all ages. Paulie is a lovely little treasure. He has quite a few smart lines that really made me laugh. I especially liked the dance series during his showbiz stint. You can forgive the obvious cliches as you roll up in his quest to be reunited with Marie. A beautiful film featuring two strong characters who really befriended the little parrot, separated from his young owner. Would have liked to see more of the woman who gets blind and has to leave their mutual journey. I love her artistic and poetic inspiration, a shame that she couldn't share Paulie's reunion. Bless Paulie in his new home, finally with Marie, perhaps with the beautiful young man who helped him defeat the antagonists to complete his journey.
