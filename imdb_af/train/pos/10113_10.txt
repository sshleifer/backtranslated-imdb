I loved this movie. If I'm Not Ed Wood Jr. fan is not, I prefer his "unlimited enthusiasm" and recognize his shortcomings. His movies are fun, but his personal story is one with pain. I hoped and was delighted to find that this film is about understanding his turbulent life, rather than just welcoming him with posthumously. From start to finish, this film evolved from a documentary in mythology, after which the cast and viewer are unexpectedly linked and to Ed Wood Jr. <br /> <br /> What we get is people who know Ed Wood. best to speak to him of all perspectives, positive and negative, and we like our character as much as Ed. We gain insight into Ed's personal and professional life: from his romance, to his drinking, to his sexuality, to his friends, to his enemies, and even to his filmmaking. <br /> <br /> The movie itself was shot. in a low-budget way that apparently disappears out of respect for Ed, as if using the techniques of most theater films from 1996 would not be respectful (such as wearing a nicer suit than the president). The set designer uses a sense of humor and also a great deal of insight when it comes to every rollid with their background. <br /> <br /> Fans will be thrilled to hear personal testimony about Ed Wood controversies, and be new arrivals. surprised that this man really was. The DVD is impossible to find jewelry ("Crossroads or Lorado" and photo galleries), but the real treasure of this movie is the surprisingly engaging and interrelated story. <br /> <br /> Ed Wood had a habit of defining people through their association with him (for better or worse) to the point where one woman in history would go as "Swimming Pool Owner" to him and promptly dip his friends into her pool. This ability to define a person's legacy is common, as the most amazing effect of the film is not just a well-rounded idea of ​​man Ed Wood Jr. but also to give a comprehensive view of the community he created. Somehow, without even more that one cast member being screened at once, the connection that Ed Wood created among the different people in his life will become clear, and the viewer will feel great of involvement left behind. <br /> Even the title hints on the B-list horror genre, but in the end, we see that even this is a friendliness. What begins as unrelated stories by random people ends with the conclusion that all the casting will be turned into an unpredictable cohesive forever that will bring history into the hasty unity with Wood's legend. <br /> <br /> In many ways, a life is contradictory, Ed Wood Jr. could not be condensed to a single point of view. This joint effort is closest to knowing what we can ever get. Being self-contradictory, at the same time, it is respectful, challenging, considerate, gripping, fun, sad, friendly and fulfilling.
