A Bugs Life is a great movie that is not only for children but also for adults. The story is around a colony of ants and their fight against the evil locusts returning each year and stealing their food (a Mirror of the Magnifying Seven). There are some great computer animations and the voices are good too. You're going to love it !! 8 out of 10
