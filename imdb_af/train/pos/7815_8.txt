'Cry Freedom' is a film about how far people are going to find the truth. <br /> <br /> The first half is an interesting representation of an unlikely friendship between activist Steve Biko and Editor Don Woods (played by Dezel Washington and Kevin Klein). While the second half with Woods looking for answers to Biko's death. <br /> <br /> Although most people favor the first half of the movie, focusing on the unlikely friendship between Biko and Woods. I found the second half much more interesting about Don Woods' struggle to hear Biko's story around the world.
