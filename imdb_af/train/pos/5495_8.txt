One of the best documentaries released in the past year. Some points ... <br /> <br /> 1. Hugo Chavez was elected president of Venezuela in 1998. His support comes mainly from the poorer regions of Venezuela. <br /> <br /> 2. In 2002, a coup briefly laid down Chavez. At that time, Irish filmmakers Kim Bartley and Donnacha O'Briain were in Caracas, a documentary writer on Chavez for British television. Their film deconstructs the coup and its aftermath, unraveling the history deployed on-site, outside, and within the presidential palace. <br /> <br /> 3. Chavez aims to release Venezuela from the free market policy imposed by the US. Although Venezuela's oil was already state-owned, it was managed for private benefit by drivers who wanted to replace Chavez. <br /> <br /> 4. Despite the world's fourth largest oil supplier, Venezuela remains overwhelmed by poverty, its resources literally sucked by foreign multinational corporations. <br /> <br /> 5. The documentary begins with the portrayal of Chavez's first years as president before the coup. It focuses on its popularity with the poor and its various policies that have been popular with working-class residents (educational plans, oil revenue distribution, grass roots democracy, etc.). <br /> <br /> 6. Chavez was a great supporter of education and printed thousands of copies of the Venezuelan constitution. It encouraged children and adults to learn and understand it. <br /> <br /> 7. When Chavez came to power, he immediately promised to redistribute the oil profits. It made the oil companies understandably nervous. <br /> <br /> 8. A media war broke out. The six private TV stations immediately opposed the state television station. They questioned Chavez's motives, common sense and sexual orientation. <br /> <br /> 9. Without media support, the coup would not be successful. The film makes it clear that coups rely heavily on the media to disseminate information and that the news can be easily produced. <br /> <br /> 10. Under the guise of a democracy restored, the opposition silenced the state television station, disbanded the National Electoral Council, Supreme Court, National Assembly and took control of the army. <br /> <br /> 11. Money interests, backed by the military elite (encouraged by the US and the CIA), organized a militia on the presidential palace to bring about the coup. Snipers shot at Ch√°vez supporters, but the private media stations saved footprints, and it turned out that the return of fire to the opposition march was actually diverted safely. <br /> <br /> 12. Police went on a rampage against Chavez supporters and flowed the streets further. <br /> <br /> 13. Chavez, imprisoned, refused to resign. Of course, the media / government lied and said he resigned, but Chavez's cabinet members conveyed the truth to the international community, eventually returning the cable to Venezuela. <br /> <br /> 14. People got up and pressed on the return of the president they chose, who only constitutionally replaced a referendum. <br /> <br /> 8.9 / 10 - This doc is just an hour away. Nonetheless, this is a particular piece of journalism and deals with a form of "media warfare" that is rarely touched. Make a good companion to "The Battle of Algiers". <br /> <br /> Worth watching.
