I hired this movie over the weekend, clipped the surround sound system, and has some good sound of special effects. This movie is a good movie rental, the special affects enough to scare my fiance, but I noticed that some look incredibly computer-generated. I didn't go to the movies and saw them, but it's a scary late night, not like a movie. I would recommend it!
