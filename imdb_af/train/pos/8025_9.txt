I love this movie. The songs and story lines are very nice. and the song "goodbye" always moves me. What a brilliant thing to do to bring dolls to life, in a way that you actually care about these things made of cloth and dust and whatever. great voices and great talent. Why were all the other muppet movies that came to this one so much less interesting, moving and funny? it is sir. henson is just as much missed?
