Jon Voight plays a man named Joe. Joe is shaken by a haunting childhood. He has a strong fear and hatred of religion because of his traumatic baptism. He stops his work as a dishwasher and goes out to become a hustler for rich people. He met a misfit named Ratso (Dustin Hoffman) and the two for a relationship. They go out and work together to help each other. They become thieves. The two grow remarkably close and cannot live without each other. However, there is something very important that Ratso has not told Joe, and it can destroy any hope they have of surviving the city. It is one of the greatest films ever made. It is a heartbreaking and breaking portrait of too many lonely men who have nothing to lose, but each other. Their story is devastating to watch, but is ultimately important for people to care for. It's one of those movies where the characters almost resemble the seemingly crazy people you sometimes get on the streets. The difference is that this film is from their perspective. Their lives are shown to us and it is devastating to see the pedestrians in this movie, treat them like dirt, especially if we were once in one of the people. However, the film doesn't try to make you guilty. Instead, it shows you the rough side of the hustling lifestyle. It's not a pleasant and easy lifestyle like many Hollywood movies, such as MILK GELD and PRETTY VROU. The lifestyle of being a male hustler is a dirty, angry and ugly life, and it is sad that people are falling apart like Joe's character in this movie. Regarding most of this film, it came out in 1969 and it was the test of time perfectly. Today's audience will still find good meaning in this film and will still love it as much as critics and audiences throughout 1969 did. The film has been evaluated X, but what I see on this movie is that sexuality is portrayed in a much more honest, realistic and effective way. Anyone who has previously had sex will know how humorous, uncomfortable and terrifying hell can be and this movie does not leave any of it. The sex in this movie may not be as graphic as once thought. Movies rated X, such as MIDNIGHT COWBOY, A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, GREATS, LAST TANGO in Paris, and FRITZ THE CAT all look remarkably soft compared to the shocking things people can get with R-rated today. The sex scenes in MIDNIGHT COWBOY will look pretty strong, but they're definitely not sexy. They are not graphical, but they are realistic and that is what people should keep in mind when they see this movie. The course language used in the film, especially the word "fag", is used effectively and is not free. The violence is very shocking to watch even today, but it is again necessary to portray the world of a hustler. I'm really happy to see that MIDNIGHT COWBOY is not dated and is still as influential as it was in 1969, if not more. I can't recommend these classics enough and I hope it will still be an audience because it is truly a very special and memorable experience that will not be forgotten soon. <br /> <br /> PROS: <br /> <br /> -Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman are both sad and wonderful to watch. They have never played such roles before, and they are completely different from usual. You will forget who they are playing in minutes! <br /> <br /> - Beautiful Score <br /> <br /> Not quite dated or campers, as many films of that decade come down as today. <br /> <br /> - Wonderful and quick editing <br /> <br /> Suitable: <br /> <br /> Only for adult audiences <br /> <br /> The opening scenes are well done, but they can only be a little stronger.
