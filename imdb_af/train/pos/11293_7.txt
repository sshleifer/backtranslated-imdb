William Wyler had ordered this adaptation of Moss Hart's hit Broadway game with music / poster-vivant recruitment, but his own military obligations intervened and it came to a most unlikely helmsman: George Cukor. The "women's director" has a substantial touch on the many documentary-like sequences of Air Corps training, and he invests it with more unhackneyed humanity than the generic genre, especially in the war. Certainly, the pants (and wholly white, except for one unbilled Chinese-American site), are a lot of newcomers who are nicer and healthier than in real life, and talking about home and mother and the woman and child is getting pretty thick but this is effective propaganda and unmistakable stirring. Lon McAllister, Edmond O'Brien, Martin Ritt, Red Buttons, Peter Lind Hayes, Karl (by Andrews Sister), Malden, Kevin McCarthy, Gary Merrill, Lee J. Cobb, and Don Taylor. Also for a very early glimpse of Judy Holliday, who doesn't appear in the picture for half an hour, but has some good little rows than O'Brien's worried sick Brooklyn spouse. Badly his rights are confused and the only pressure anyone knows is 16mm; Clearly, after Twentieth Century Fox released it (to considerable success), the rights returned to the army, and if there is a good 35mm pressure there, it probably lies somewhere within the Pentagon. It is ominous and stingy in patches, but it also captures the rigors of military training and the horrors of war alive, and it deserves better to see.
