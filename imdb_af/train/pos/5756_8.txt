Anarchy and lawlessness rule highest in the Elkunk's podunk gate. The city's guys deposit the demanding veteran Aaron of Vietnam (a wonderful robust and engaging performance by Kris Kristofferson) and several of his fellow veterinarians to clean the place. The plan goes sour when Aaron and his cruel cronies decide to take over Elk Hills after they've got rid of all the bad elements. It is Aaron's decent governor brother Ben (almost played by Jan-Michael Vincent) to stop him before things go out. Writer / Director George ("Miami Blues", "Gross Pointe Blank") Armitage creates a beautiful amorous, cynical and wicked, subversive redneck hacking contemporary winners: creating a sharp, no-nonsense tone, aligning the pace alive and inevitably, and stages the abundant action scenes with considerable muscle plates (the exciting explosive climax is particularly strong and agitating). The first class cast of well-known B-function faces is an important asset: Victoria principal as Ben's lovely girl Linda, the wonderful Bernadette Peters as the flashy saloon singer Little Dee, Brad Dexter as the undecided mayor, David Doyle as a slender bank. president, Andrew Stevens as a friendly gas station servant, John Carpenter movie regular Charles Cyphers as one of the 'Nam Battles, Anthony Carbone as a smart casino manager, John Steadman as an old diner owner, Paul Gleason as a average strong poor Shakedown bully, and Dick Miller as a talented piano player. Moral: Don't hire other people to do your dirty work. William Cronjager's shining cinematography, Gerald Fried's vibrant, harmonious hillbilly bluegrass score, and the abundant raw violence add to the overall trashy pleasure of this unfairly neglected little dozy.
