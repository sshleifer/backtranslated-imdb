Always keep this movie off the video cover. Eventually, it bought to buy it for a fiver in a buy and a boy making a movie. A simple impressive display from all the cases and it is so beautifully filmed. Even at times from afar, so you can hardly hear what the dialogue is, as if you are really so far away from picking pieces of the story. It really moves, often amusingly and very visibly. Not much dialogue, but is so filmed that you feel so much. A 9/10 of mine. A must see.
