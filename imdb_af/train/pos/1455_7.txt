Mardi Gras: Made in China is an excellent film depicting how two cultures have much in common, but are not even aware of the influence each society has on each other. David Redmon opens your eyes and shows you how the workers in China produce beads that cost little to nothing and are sold in the United States for up to $ 20. When Redmon asks Americans about where these beads come from, they had no idea and it was stupid. When he told them that they were being made for less than in China, nothing with terrible pay and unacceptable working conditions, Americans were sad, hurt and a little remorse, but didn't really seem to stop buy after they found out the truth. . When Redmon questioned the workers in China, they did not know that Americans wore their necks and paid so much for these beads. The workers laughed at what the purpose behind beads was and couldn't believe it. This movie is a good movie that we think in other countries besides our own. <br /> <br /> M. Pitts
