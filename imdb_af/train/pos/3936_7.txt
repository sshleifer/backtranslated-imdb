It is an impressive and idealized portrait of Lincoln's early life (born in 1809 Hodgensville-Kentucky - and died in Washington in 1865). Ford's excellent movie takes off Abraham Lincoln (Fonda) from his youth. He studied law, common law and began practicing as an attorney in 1837. This Hollywood biography follows Lincoln from his loghut days, initial relationship with Mary Todd (Weaver), following the couple's first ball and his departure for congressional candidate. But the main focus is on a brother (Richard Cromwell, Eddie Quillan) charged with murder, the back trial with amusing court tribute schools and the protection of their mother (Alice Brady). The Lincoln Fonda as defender-advocate and Donald Meek's prosecutor is nothing short of brilliant. <br /> <br /> Excellent performance by Henry Fonda as idealistic traveler, Springfield lawyer, was to die for Ford from this movie regularly, as ¨Grapes of wrath, my darling Clementine, and Fort Apache¨. Except for sterling acting by Alice Brady as a sad mother, she was a great actress of the silent movie, but this one is her last movie because she died of cancer earlier. The Lincoln's actions that evolve make for quite attractive entertainment. His depiction shows a nostalgic longing for things that are old and old values ​​and describes his goodness, sincerity and intent. Lincoln, like John Ford, was a fair man who never changed the ideals of his youth. This American masterpiece is right on both counts, such as stunning biography and wonderful drama. <br /> <br /> Another biography of Abraham Lincoln is the following: 1) ¨ Abraham Lincoln (1930) by DWGriffith with Walter Huston, Una Merkel, who spoke from his birth to his murder; 2) ¨be Lincoln in Illinois¨ (1940) by John Cromwell with Raymond Massey, Rut Gordon, on similar events on Ford's film through his career as a lawyer 3) TV version entitled ¨Gore Vidal's Lincoln® with Sam Waterston and Mary Tyler Moore as Mary Todd.
