That's what one of the girls said at the end. <br /> <br /> Is the soccer game a metaphor for a qualifying match between girls (or more generally, a free-thinking group) and authority? "In Germany" does a future mean hope? <br /> <br /> This is one of the most memorable movie experiences I have ever had - despite the rough cinematography and plot, and light-skinned (though I enjoy the movie - they love and are well above expectations amateurs). The ridiculous situation is well caught. I can feel the frustration being refused to be a match (female and soccer winner) and I can't stop thinking how to make a convincing disguise. I wonder why there is no women's section in which protection against dirty language and bad behavior can be given - defeating the wrong reasons for the denial. <br /> <br /> The film is very clever - the great title, the real-time filming, the spontaneity and various methods to put the viewers into the characters' shoes - the game that is so important, but inaccessible (not shown), the dormant light and cheering of the stadium, giving birth to the van, and its futility when inwardly communicating with the celebrating crowd. I can feel the comfort of the radio, the drinks and the food, and of course the kindness and consideration of each character to others. At the end credits I am amused that no character has a name - he's just a "soldier" and she's just a "girl" or "sister".
