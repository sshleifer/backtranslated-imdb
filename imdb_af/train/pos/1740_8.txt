This movie was not so much promoted here in Greece, even though it had good actors, great writing and quite a good photo was not a blockbuster movie in my country. The movie itself is very powerful, it's about the difficult time a newcomer had to go through when he returned to his hometown after he was released from a 5-year prison sentence (drug). The end is rather sad. Mourikis tries to keep up with his part and he handles it pretty well ... Lambropoulou is wonderful and very sexy in a strange way and of course Hatzisavvas is once again close to excellence ... 7 out of 10 because very little Greek movies can make such an impression!
