"Dance, Fools, Dance" is an early Crawford-Gable vehicle from 1931. Crawford plays a Bonnie Jordan, a rich young woman whose life is made up of parties, drinks, and smashing her clothes from a hunt to jump and swim. It all ends when her father dies and leaves her and her brother (William Blakewell) potty. Bonnie gets a job on a newspaper called Mary Smith; her brother goes to work for booters. The chief is Jake Luva - portrayed by Clark Gable while still playing a rogue. Later, of course, he would become a romantic hero, but in the early 30's MGM used him as a bad man. Not realizing that her brother is involved in illegal activities, Bonnie cozies to Luva. <br /> <br /> Gable and Crawford made a good team. Her facial expressions are a bit on the wild, but with her dancing, one of the things that make the movie fun. Look for Cliff Edwards, the voice of Jiminy Cricket, as Bert. <br /> <br /> It is always interesting to see the precoded movies, and "Dance, Fools, Dance" is no exception.
