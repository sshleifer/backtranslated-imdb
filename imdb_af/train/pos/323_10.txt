It is truly an excellent movie with a revolutionary message (both in form and content) that should not be missed by any fan of French New Wave or Underground movie. There are scarce opening or closing credits - we have only fallen into the world of consumerism, revolution and youth. This film has little to do with documentaries and is more interesting to play with our ideas of advertising and its relation to reality. Lines of real and not real are crossed in ways familiar with documentary films, but this time we do it for the sake of consumption and marketing, not to describe the real.
