I saw it for the first time when they showed it in the east of 1993/4 and didn't think much about it. I bought it on DVD last Saturday when I started with Michael Jackson (I have previously held his music) and now enjoy it more I am older. It's a good movie, but it won't be this classic movie like The Sound of Music, West Side Story, The Wizard Of Oz etc. Michael Jackson as an actor was good and so were the other members. There was a disturbing scene like the little girl, Katie, who was beaten by gangster Frankie Lideo, played by Joe Pesci. The scene that scared me when I was younger was when Michael turned into a robot. My favorite song on the movie was Smooth Criminal I think it was better than Thriller in my opinion.
