I have a lot of time for all the Columbo movies, but this one was extremely well written, and the solution is very effective. However, my main memory of this one is opening a scene in the middle of the film, between Columbo and the killer (I apologize if I didn't remember every detail of this exactly). This is Columbo's most striking image I have seen: the view inside is the darkness of the closet where the victim was murdered, and in the outside room, which is lit by daylight. Columbo sits in a high-backed chair looking at the doorway (and us), considering the cupboard, and almost in silhouette due to the contrast in the light. There is no sound. The camera slowly moved out of the room and onto him. He is deep in meditation, looks gently at a cigar, tangle of cigar smoke slowly as he thinks. Then the dialogue begins. Excellent.
