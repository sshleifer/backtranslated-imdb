I have to agree with most other posts. Was it a comedy? a drama? for me it leaned a little too much on the comedy side. I could have been a good movie without the comedy and it was terribly confronted. Jamie is still in the Julio and what is his name. How many times do you walk in New York to someone you know in downtown Cleveland. And how can Robert Pastorelli dig up the Yankee stadium to hide the gold. Again, a comedy or drama? But it was still very entertaining for a Sunday morning. I enjoyed Kimberly Elise's performance, she is definitely a beautiful actress and wants to take her craft seriously. She is a younger actress who will be viable.
