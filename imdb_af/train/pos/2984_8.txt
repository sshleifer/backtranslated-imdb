David Zucker directed one of the most enjoyable comedies of the year with this goofy farce. Yes, it is a matter of acquired taste and depends on a wealth of sophomoric gags, but it is consistently funny throughout the recent comic efforts. The movie is loaded with all sorts of jokes ranging from the blatant to the more subtle nature that you have to pay attention to in the frame, or you'll probably miss them. Like his previous efforts that include "Airplane!", "Top Secret!" And "Naked Gun" flies the humor almost every second. There are so many moments that work, it's easy to reflect on the few who fall flat. What sets this film apart from other light imitations in the spoof genre is that it has a real story line. While others were dependent on making too many famous scenes in almost random movies (take "Mafia!", Please), this movie tells a new story with similar characters. It touches on sports films in general, as well as satirizing the right sports industry rather than compiling any particular movie. Even for people who don't care about 'South Park', his creators, Matt Stone and Trey Parker, make a good pair of top actors with natural chemistry. The movie also makes extremely effective use of atos, sports experts and other celebrities, especially a hilarious bit with Robert Stack or "Unsolved Mysteries." By the way, keep up the credits for a final joke with Bob Costas and Al Michaels. All in all, Zucker, in words that may apply to the movie's sports mix, has been a housekeeper.
