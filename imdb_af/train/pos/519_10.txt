I saw this movie for the first time about 20 years ago and never forgot it. It is beautifully filmed and the story keeps sounding all the time. It is hard to believe that it was made in 1946, as the story is still fresh today and really reminds one. I'm not very knowledgeable about movie technique, but the special effects in this movie have been taken into account when it's made. In addition, the play is fantastic, and the use of English and American actors is amazing. I recently bought the DVD so I can watch whenever I want. I strongly recommend any interested in British war movies after the war to see it.
