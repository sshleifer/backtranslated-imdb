Okay, first of all, I got this movie as a Christmas gift, so it was FREE! FIRST - This movie was meant to be in stereoscopic 3D. This is for the most part, but when the main character is in her car, the movie falls to 2D! What !!?!?! It's not that hard to roll into a car !!! SECOND - The story is not very good. There are many things wrong with it. <br /> <br /> THIRD - Why do they show all the deaths at the start of the movie! This made the movie suck when some were killed !!! Watch it for a good laugh, but don't waste your time buying it. Just download or something for cheap.
