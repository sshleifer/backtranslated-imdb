The part where Meg visits the mechanic and he says, "Is the piston short?" (implying poor sexual energy on the part of her fiancee) was hilarious. I love Meg Ryan and she is as nice as ever in this wonderful movie. Very sweet and very intelligent too. Her innocent outrageous expressions have wished she was yours. The hero treats the car mechanic well to physical transformation. Einstein had a romantic side to his psyche? The puzzle around the press and audience was well done. It is terribly underestimated and earns awards and efforts for a revival. It forfeits one vote for the inclusion of the highly unlikely recovered theory bought by the US government. I don't see why it doesn't appear in the top 20 romantic comedies of the century. Great Movie, it has the presidential seal of approval!
