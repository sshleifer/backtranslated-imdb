2005 Toronto Film Festival Report It is official; "Takashi Miike" has been snapped. <br /> <br /> The annual midnight screen of the new Takashi Miike movie, "The Big Spook War" or "The Great Yokai War" or "Yôkai daisensô". Call it what you want, it's a fanatic ride. <br /> <br /> The fearless programmer Colin Geddes said this movie was originally aimed at children in Japan. Think of "Lord of the Rings" or "Neverending Story" for Japan. After the show I can understand where they are going, but it is 'Takashi Miike'. He directed the '01 movie 'Ichi the Killer' when it was handed out at the festival's barf bags. And no, it wasn't just a marketing slip. <br /> <br /> Plot Summary: A young boy with a distressed home life is "picked" and he bumps into the middle of a Great Spirit War where he meets a group of friendly spirits who become his travel companions . <br /> <br /> It's not really for kids, but not too young. Certainly, they see how frightening they are with some of these spirits (even the kind children). It's different from what I've seen in the movie before. A fantasy of course, some very funny (but dark) material. You won't be bored, it can guarantee. Will it ever affect North America? Questionable. <br /> <br /> My rating = B
