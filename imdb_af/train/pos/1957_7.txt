Yes, I will say before I start commenting. This movie is incredibly understated. <br /> <br /> Sharon Stone is great in her role as Catherine Trammell, like Morrissey as dr. Glass. He is an analyst who sent her to evaluate her after the death of a sports star. Glass was drawn into a seductive game that Trammel used to manipulate his mind. <br /> <br /> The play was good (except Thewlis) <br /> <br /> Stone really has a talent with this role. She is slim, naughty and seductive and does not look older than she did for the first time. She really impressed me (like in Casino). Morrisy was also good. He showed a great deal of aversion in a role it needed. Thewlis, however, was lame. He ruined his character and was completely over the top. He really sucked. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is not that good first, but Stone is a hobby to watch. Investigate Thewlis.
