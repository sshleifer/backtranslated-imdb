A remaining melodrama typical of his period (mid-1950s) and appropriate matinee food. Rock Hudson, the one who falls in love with everyone, usually plays his usual stereotype role, but in Giant, the same year, when his material and co-stars (Taylor & Dean) were above average, he is only in this movie. Not good enough to raise the caliber above a coarse story of how difficult it is to be rich and happy. The self-destructive brother and sister (Robert Stack, who comes through the movie in a drunken fool, and Dorothy Malone, plays a brave poor little rich girl all over the top) ends the losers and Hudson gets Bacall - what is rather wood in this part that doesn't have enough character or white to let her go. To paraphrase Oscar Wilde, the good end happy and the bad unfortunately, this is the meaning of fiction. However, I was interested to read that the film is based on a true story that justifies the plot. Like other films of the era, homosexuality is disguised in heterosexual terms. Maybe the movie could be tackled again: Stack's character would have a greater truth if he hid homosexual feelings for Mitch by marrying. Todd Haynes's Far Van Heaven has greatly improved everything that heaven allows, also directed by circus. Maybe Haynes can repeat Written on the Wind and give us a memorable movie.
