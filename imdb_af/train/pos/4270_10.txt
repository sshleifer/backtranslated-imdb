Ko to Tamo Peva is the best comedy of all time. Believe me I have seen many movies and comedies, but tell me what makes you smile every time you look at it. But the truth is that humor in this comedy is special. It's characteristically true for Serbs. And all the former republic of Yugoslavia knows this very well !!! So I think the rest of the audience (for example: in Europe) can't enjoy it so much. Because the subtitles ruin the hole thing. But at least they must try !!!! Yes this is ironic! This is the best movie in Serbian history and the world doesn't understand it! :-) If you get the chance to see this one, don't blow it OK!
