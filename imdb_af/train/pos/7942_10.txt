Giallo fans are looking for this rare movie. It is well written, and full of all kinds of ordinary low life populations. I don't want to throw anything away, so I don't want to say anything about the plot. The whole movie creates a very bizarre atmosphere, and you don't know what to expect or who to suspect. Recommended! The only place I saw in getting this movie in English is from European Trash Cinema, for $ 15.
