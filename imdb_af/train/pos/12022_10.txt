As a big fan of the original, I avoided this movie like the plague when the bad reviews started eight years ago, but I just watched this movie and found it a very pleasant surprise. <br /> <br /> Oh, if you're looking for a repeat of the original, you're in for a great disappointment, but if you're looking for something very different, a little edgy and politics, then this is the movie for you. <br /> <br /> Gregory is now thirty and works as a teacher at his old comprehensive school, where he is pursued by a fellow teacher and has sexual dreams about one of his students. When the student insisted on meeting Gregory, a series of misadventures emerged that included torture, break and trespass and all kinds of unexpected twists and turns that delighted and surprised me. <br /> <br /> If you look for something original, then I strongly recommend this movie. I just wish more people had gone here when it was released and saw it for what it really was.
