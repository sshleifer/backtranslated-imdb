This movie was very, very funny and very, very funny. All the actors are really and very strange. The overall "look" of the film was also different, dreamy and bleached, which only added to the spacious, fumbling, strange atmosphere of the whole thing. <br /> <br /> It's not for everyone, I mean, it's not what you would call "mainstream", but that's what I liked about it. This is different from what I have ever seen. . . Unpredictable, with a strange rhythm and punch lines in the strangest places. The kids are so heartfelt goofy (and pimply) that you can't help but feel for them. In other words, it is far from the "hydrated" versions of teens. <br /> <br /> Everyone who makes me a good thing.
