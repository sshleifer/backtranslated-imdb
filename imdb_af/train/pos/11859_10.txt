On MTV cribs, all the ballers and lashers draw the classic movie Scarface from their DVD collection. This may give you an idea that Scarface is a "gangster movie". Sure, there are gang members and mobs in it, but it's not the point of Scarface. Tony Montana (Al Pacino) is just a Cuban retreat looking for a new way of life. He falls with the group and becomes a well-known drug lover. Montana was all to do what you wanted to do with your life. The classic phrase: "Say hello to my little friend!" is in Scarface. This quote is always coming to mind when I think of Brian DePalmas movie, Scarface. It falls under my top 10 favorite movies. I'll rate it *** 1/2 (from ****). Definitely a movie to watch. Phenomenal.
