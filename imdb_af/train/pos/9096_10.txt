Adorable! I saw in October with my children domestic imports into Philly. We all loved it so much that we saw it for a second time with my parents. I didn't hear them laughing for years! It was the first time I could remember seeing a movie that my parents and children could enjoy. It's really cute and we can't wait to get it on DVD. They need to make more movies like Domestic Input. It is refreshing to go to a movie that can enjoy three different generations (and not be ashamed). I haven't seen a movie that's been cute since My Big Fat Greek Wedding. I loved Mindy Sterling as the mother. She was also in Austin. Howard Hesseman is also here and he is hilarious. I remember him from WKRP.
