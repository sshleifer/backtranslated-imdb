It is a very good movie and one that I enjoyed watching several times. Michael Caine is wonderful as always. Michael Caine received a reputation for playing any role in any film, regardless of the quality or lack of the same, but he plays a good turn to play Sidney. From the beginning it was written so well. Who would have thought that Ira Levin, who wrote such creepy things like The Boys of Brazil and Rosemary's Baby, could write something. Let's look at it - Michael Caine, Chris Reeve, Dyan Cannon, Henry Jones ... how are you going to go wrong with throwing this good right through Sidney Lumet. <br /> <br /> I'm really reluctant to go up because if anyone wanted to give anything about this movie, it would be a crime. Just look and enjoy it.
