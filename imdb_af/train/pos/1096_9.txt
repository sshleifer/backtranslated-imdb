I saw the movie scene in 1980 for the first time. Yes, it is a relic of a different age - a domestic comedy that occurs in rich middle-class America - but well-executed is well executed. But it is also a document of his age - a celebration of post-war optimism, the baby boom and the growing consumer age. This movie is not a "guilty" pleasure. <br /> <br /> Three wonderful sophisticated protagonists - urban Melvyn Douglas; gemused Cary Grant; daffily determined Myrna Loy - complement each other and an unforgettable team of characters. <br /> <br /> My favorite scenes - "That means we must blast" and "Miss Stellwaggen" and "This little piggy". <br /> <br /> Love it.
