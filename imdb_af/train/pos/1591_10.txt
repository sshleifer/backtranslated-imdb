My mom and I have just recently become addicted to this show, and laugh at our chicks! I only saw about 10 episodes, and I'm disappointed that I didn't pay attention to this hilarious series before they were canceled! The story line is very funny, the characters have great personalities (or not so big, but they are still funny!). I TiVO every episode of What I Love You. Amanda Bynes and Jennie Garth, as well as all the role-players, never leave me bored as I watch! There are some inappropriate languages ​​for children and sexual content, but with a parent guide you shouldn't have too many problems. There is a kind of "Friends" type relationship that attracts me to this show. I really enjoy it.
