One of the best love stories I've ever seen. It's a bit like a slow-moving train wreck, yet lovely. Big Edie and Little Edie look like family members after they have watched this movie repeatedly and are infinitely quoting: "This is a damn beautiful day, now it just keeps you going?" The opening explanation of Little Edie's costume doesn't promise that movie will live forever, and so will Big Edie "The World Famous Singer" and Little Edie "The World Famous Dancer."
