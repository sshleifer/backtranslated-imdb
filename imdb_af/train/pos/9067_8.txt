After being forced to sit through some real stinkers (Racing Stripes, Shark Boy and Lava Girl) - I really enjoyed watching "Fried Worms". For once I didn't guess the end! It was funny and entertaining and, despite the title, did not apply a lot of turbulent humor. My sons (6 and 10) also loved it. Oh and my 45-year-old "boy" had a smile on his face all the time. It is a family movie that is not only tolerant for the parents. The relationship with the little brother is so close to real life. "He doesn't stop to just annoy me!" The way the new child tries to make friends and how those friendships actually form is also right in the way children act. Of course, the parents have to take a little bit of goofy - but my favorite scenes have made the Dad accustomed to his new job. Have fun!
