I loved this movie when I was little. Today at 17 this is one of my all time favorite animation movies. Beautiful animation and attractive characters are just two of the things to keep this movie. Although many may not enjoy the songs, most of them are well done and go along with the story. It focuses on Charlie, a ruddy, handsome German Shepard, who initially looks unlikely to some. But in the end it will conquer you. <br /> <br /> Not a kiddie movie. Often very dark and frightening. A treatment for Don Bluth fans and animation buffs. But keep a tissue handy. ADGTH fails to make me cry and will do the same for those who are sensitive to film. It is probably one of the greatest non-Disney animated films of all time. Along with Watership Down and my neighbor Totoro. <br /> <br /> BOTTOM LINE: A Heavenly Masterpiece.
