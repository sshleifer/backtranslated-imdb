Life Stinks (1991) was a step under Mel Brooks' other productions. He dies as a rich man who earns a bad bet with his "friends". Brooks claims he can live like a homeless man for a month. His shocked and amused friends accept this unusual bet. During his "stay" in the Bowery he meets a lot of strange homeless people, one of whom gets his fancy (Lesley-Ann Warren). They raise a friendship while teaching him the many tricks she learned while living on the street. Can Mr. Brooks on his own survived without the luxury of dirty riches? Will he win this unorthodox bet? Who are his true friends? Find out when to find LIFE STINKS to find out! <br /> <br /> This movie was beaten unfairly. Sure it's not a classic like its previous movies, but it's still nice. I like the way Mel Brooks pays tribute to Charles Chaplin in this movie. If you watched Chaplin's previous silent movies, you'll also get the humor. <br /> <br /> Recommended for Mel Brooks fans.
