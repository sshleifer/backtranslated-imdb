This display is fast, colorful, dark but fun, hip and somehow clean. The role-play, including a wonderful rotation of special guests (ie Molly Shannon, Paul Rubens, The-Stapler-Guy-From-Office Space) is electric. It has murder, romance, family, and zombies without ever coming out as a cartoon somehow. You really work with these characters. The whole production is an unlikely magic act that has left me, something of a skeptic, if I say it myself, totally worried and coming back for more every Wednesday night. I just read it again and it sounds a bit like someone who paid me to write it. It's really that good. I just heard a rumor that it was canceled, so I thought I'd send out a good will flank. It's one of those shows that goes under the radar because the network packs can't figure out how to make it sexy and sell cars with it. Make yourself a great favor, if you don't have one yet, and enjoy this jewel while it lasts. OK, so one thing. This show is clever. What this means is that every Hollywood writer / "writer" in Hollywood will put a stick on their knees, which before they sit down to see it and defend themselves with a "I could have written that type of speech to no one else. In their loneliness, not a refurbished Hollywood hotel room, in other words: the internet, this is a common interest / anonymous website, before giving your Wednesday TV hour to Dirty Sexy Money or Next Hot Model reviews or whatever out and about, these internet critics are not going to comment, give my fave a go, it's fun, good, unpretentious fun.
