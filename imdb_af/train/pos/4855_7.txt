Whether or not you like this movie version of The Ghost Train depends on one thing and one thing alone: ​​your reaction to Arthur Askey's performance. He tends to steal almost everyone. stage he is in, and not always in a good way. Sometimes you wish that he would just sit down or work back to make the characters' characters function and develop (to some extent). But somehow it stays back to Askey's Tommy Gander character. <br /> <br /> Personally, I like the movie, and even like Askey to some extent. I always look in the early morning when I can't sleep and I really can't find the energy to look at anything else. There is something about watching old b / w movies in the silence of the break that I find attractive.
