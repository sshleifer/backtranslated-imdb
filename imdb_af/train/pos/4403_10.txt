Driving the devil, like Ang Lee's later Brokeback Mountain, is a film of aesthetic and historical importance. Movie lovers should see it at least twice as his artistic nuances are worthy of being overstated. <br /> <br /> A perfect piece of art, surprising depth of humanity. I really do not remember another war movie, will catch you so much, change your existing concept of history and politics, will restore your faith in humanity. After seeing so many murders, so much suffering, you don't kill yourself, but rather you estimate the bond between people. The actors' performances haunt your heart, the music drives your mind. Some shoots, not just a few photos, they surpass themselves, become the sight of soul. So the true sense is that the movie is a genre of art. <br /> <br /> A movie like this doesn't need long comments or reviews, all of which in itself indicates. Ovation to the film that includes Tobey Maguire, Jeffrey Wright and Jewel Kilcher, the film artist and composer of the beautiful and lyrical music, which is a feat!
