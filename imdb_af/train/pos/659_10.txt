One of the last classic of the French New Wave. For direction, Cineaste Jean Eustache drew the simplicity of the early-century cinema; For story, Eustache drew the pain of his own intricate love life. So many things can be said of this movie - acting brilliantly; survive itself superfluously; occasionally hilarious; emotionally draining ... etc. etc. In my mind any complaints made against this film can easily be overshadowed by its many strengths. Every film student, writer or anyone willing to handle a 3-hour movie with no scanty clips, no music video overstatement, no soap opera-like plot twists, and no banal dialogue should make this movie a point to see no. Everything is to admire: the writing (concise, clever, surprisingly funny), acting (everyone is simply in their respective roles), and simple direction (the viewer feels like a casual observer in the film) movie memorable. It is undoubtedly a movie that stays with you.
