I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, but it's nothing new. <br /> <br /> Everyone here grouped it with other war movies, this movie is wrongly categorized! It's no longer a war movie if one has flown over the cuckoo nest 'is an asylum movie or' Cool Hand Luke 'is a prison movie. It's a movie about individuality, deviance, confidence and the cost of that personality type. <br /> <br /> The plot is the same as "One has about the Cuckoos nest" and "Cool Hand Luke", she's in good company, and it keeps its own. These are the movies that they have to keep and compare, not "Apocalypse Now" or "Platoon". <br /> <br /> Eric
