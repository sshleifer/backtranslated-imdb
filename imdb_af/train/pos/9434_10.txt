I remember seeing this movie on television a few years ago and not paying full attention, maybe even missing the first half, so I came to the conclusion that it was boring and overstated. I decided to repeat it last night to see if I missed something for the first time. I definitely did. This is one of the most disturbing and incredible movies of all time and has had a lot of influence on movies today and will probably last forever. I can't believe I thought this movie was boring! <br /> <br /> A young Jon Voight and Burt Reynolds give the performances of their careers and are supported by Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox. This story will leave you a sense of horror and fear long after you see it, it's really awful. Oh, and did I mention that the theme song is good too? Well, that's, and this movie has to be seen everywhere by movie fans. <br /> <br /> Everyone should see this movie for the experience. Don't just expect a picnic.
