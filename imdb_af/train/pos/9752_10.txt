I remember it immediately when I was 3 years old, when my parents accidentally pasted a couple of other cartoons in a matter of seconds. Then I was about 8 or 9 years old when I rediscovered it and as I could understand it better, I thought it was a good movie. Fast forward to just a few weeks ago (June 2006) when I discovered it again, thanks to some articles / video clips and not just the same movie. I'm sure it's still good with the kids, but for our 20-30 somethings, it's definitely 'Cult Status' written all over the place. It is a pity that the original production went through a painful process; If Fox gave it enough time, it would probably be recognized today in the public eye. Perhaps if they were to revive it with a completely different story and overall cast, it could be, but it is up to Fox to decide. I walk here, I know. I still think it's a good movie, but it can be better than the best.
