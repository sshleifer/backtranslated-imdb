It should not be War and Peace, but the two Academy numbers would not come if it were not for the genius of James Wong Howe. <br /> <br /> This is one of the few movies I fell in love with a child and went back without dissatisfaction. whether you are interested in what it fictitious or not, BB & C is a visual festival. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying it's his best job, I'm sure I'm not sure. but the look of this movie is wonderful. I love everything about it; Elsa Lanchester, the cat, the crazy hoo-doo, the retro-downtown ness; but the way it is placed on film is breathtaking. <br /> <br /> I even like the inconsistencies shown on this page and the "special effects" that look backwards. it all creates a very consistent world.
