"Hot Millions" is a well-written, well-maintained story about an eclipse that steals (whoops! - too low a word for an observer, according to Peter Ustinov's main character) a "hot million" from the London branch from an American corporation by creating shell corporations on the continent and using the firm's seemingly secure computer to transfer funds to them. (Remember, spoiler police, it's a comedy, not a mystery.) <br /> <br /> From 1968, this movie's portrayal of computers could be naive for today's more computer literate population; but as one who has been working with computers ever since, I claimed that it even happened to be written by and for computer illiterate, probably with the aim of increasing the drop of comedic aspects of this British movie. <br /> <br /> If you have little entertainment for this type of entertainment, it looks like the movie looks in places. Fortunately, it has a pretty complicated ending; Unfortunately, the end credits do not indicate the classical music used in it - the symphonic piece at the end and the piano flute duet in the middle - just the song sung by Lulu that I do not quite remember.
