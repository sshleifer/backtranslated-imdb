The Sunshine Boys is one of my favorite feel good movies. I only saw it when it was the Christmas attraction at Radio City Music Hall when it first came out. I finally saw it six times in the theaters, and if it played today, I'll see it again. <br /> <br /> Now, many of the reviews mentioned the wonderful achievements of the leaders. Matthau was brilliant, but had the misfortune to be nominated against Jack Nicholson's Oscar show by Randall P. MacMurphy in "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. Burns won, although Richard Benjiman also had to earn earnings. Roles were played perfectly , like Fritz Feld audition for the potato chips commercially. <br /> <br /> What prompted me to review this movie, towards the strongly underrated Herbert Ross, Ross, who previously brought a two-person play, "The Owl And The Pussycat" on the screen and makes a full movie from it. Do it again, open the plays without playing them like a photographic stage. It flows out of the story and characters. > <br /> Here we are 20 minutes in the film before we get to the scene that opens the play, where Ben Clark comes to see his uncle and tell him about the comedy special. playing during the first twenty minutes, the order itself is completely new. A few years ago I saw the broad revival of the play with Jack Klugman and Tony Randall, who were wonderful. But I think Ross and scriptwriter, dramatist Simon have improved on that. It's just a great movie.
