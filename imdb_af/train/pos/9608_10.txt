If you haven't seen this movie, I recommend you. This is an excellent true story. I love Alison Lohman. She is such a talented lace note. I also love her in the 7th heaven. The whole story line is wonderful and the way they have chosen there is awesome characters. The play in this movie is <br /> <br /> very awesome.
