Compelling and innovative! At the beginning of this criminal underrated Whoopi Goldberg movie, the authors draw a parallel between Theodore Rex and the Orson Welles classic "Citizen Kane". The authors are justified in drawing such a seemingly diverse parallel, but the viewing public is too often envisaged to underestimate Hollywood jokes to appreciate the subtle similarities between these two movies. In "Citizen Kane" Charles Foster Kane is feared and admired by his colleagues and his mutual, such as Whoopi Goldberg in this movie. This movie is about finding love in everyone's differences. It is an epic investigation into the fear of abandonment and the need for love and acceptance in a society dominated by greed and self-absorption. Everyone who paired Whoopi Goldberg and Theodore Rex formulated a dyad for centuries. The only justifiable comparisons are Bogey and Bacall, Hepburn and Tracy and Hall and Oates. If you would like to see a resounding, celluloid philosophical inquiry into some of man's deepest motives, Bergman's but not so depressed, Theodore Rex should be seen right away!
