A very good start. I was a little surprised to find the machinery not quite as advanced: it had to be shorter, to agree what we saw in the original series. The cast is interesting, although the Vulkan lady comes as a bit too human. She needs school at Spock, which is after all the model for this race. Badly they couldn't have chosen Jeri Ryan. I love Mrs. Park, the Korean (?) Lady. The doctor has possibilities. Do not choose the other men, except for the black man. He is a very beloved one. Bakula must find his niche. In QL, his strong point was his sense of humor and his willingness to try something. Of course he is big and strong enough for the heroic. The heavy was good, though I didn't have their make-up.
