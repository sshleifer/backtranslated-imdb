Wonderland is the fascinating film featuring the interest of movie style John C. Holmes in the brutal Wonderland murders. <br /> <br /> The film's promotion deceives one to regard it as a romantic portrayal of the porn industry in the year of Boogie nights and this is not the case here. In fact, except for a few references made by newsstanders that John Holmes is a pornstar and a brief montage of John Holmes's real life, this film is a severe drama about the involvement of a false celebrity. with murder and how it happened. <br /> <br /> Despite being deceived, the movie is actually busy. The play of all the role-play is excellent and I would like to say that Val Kilmer is wonderful in his ability to finish all the ways of John Holmes. I was totally convinced I was watching John C. Holmes probably watch and act like in real life. <br /> <br /> If you are a John C. Holmes fan or like stories about Hollywood, then I think you'll enjoy Wonderland.
