To be honest With you, I think everything was so good in this movie, there should be no reason why it wasn't in theaters. Death in the movie is great, the fx is great when used. There are a few dull moments when the story follows the little girl but it was all a very good movie that I hope we should ever get the props. The very first part of the movie is probably why it came straight to video with the death of a boy, but afterwards the story is based on a little girl and her mother who visited the mom's boyfriend, who moved out has to try to become a writer. The property he buys seems to be where the Witch (Dental Feast) lives and anyone who lives or lives in her home will be in great danger, do not really want to give away, just a little information if you do this wanted to see a movie, then it is worth the price of the rent
