It's the best movie I've ever seen in all categories. Forget Hollywood - their movies always suck - it's art! Moon Child's story begins with Kei - a Japanese vampire, who dislikes what he has become and remains in denial. His desire for final death leads him to Mallepa, where refugees from various Asian countries live. Here he meets Sho, an orphan who lives on the street. <br /> <br /> From here, the movie is an intense experience based on the visual and emotional part of the movie. It has everything; you laugh, you cry, you get angry, excited, sad, happy ... Never have a movie touched me on the way this movie is done. And the actors are unbelievable - I've never heard anyone speak so many languages ​​without it seeming strange. A great praise for the editor for creating this masterpiece. <br /> <br /> A final comment on this brilliant movie is that it stars Gackt (ex-vocalist of Malice Mizer) and Hyde (singer of L'Arc ~ and ~ ciel) in excellent roles as Sho and Kei . I'm surprised at how Gackt can change his way of talking and trading, depending on what age he is acting. <br /> <br /> It's a must see. If you never see movies, see Moon Child, Crow (Brandon Lee) and the newly released masterpiece Final Fantasy VII - Advent Children. Already in their original languages, of course!
