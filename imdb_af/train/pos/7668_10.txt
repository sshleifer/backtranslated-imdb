I love this movie for two reasons: 1) Jeff Combs is absolutely wonderful. Play the role of the modern wizard at stake. (And is absolutely adorable.) 2) The movie helped inspire a role play I thoroughly enjoy, Mage: The Awakening. I've shown it to several LARP after parties, and it's always a big hit. <br /> <br /> D & D loves Jeff, and it's not really a masterpiece, but it's good and good. The plot is fast moving and easy to do. The special effects are pretty good for such a low budget, and the screenplay, while nothing stars, is not done too badly, and in all the right places cheesy. A great way to spend an evening.
