I watched this movie once and maybe look again, but although Jamie Foxx is good at the movie, I feel they could use a 'less funny' character than Alvin Sanders. Foxx's scenes, for example in jail when confronted by Edgar Clenteen (David Morse), are too funny. David Morse is another wonderful portrayal of a cop. Its tough traits mostly silent features are perfect for its role. Again, Morse meets Doug Hutchinson (Bristol) in the theater. Morse finishes hard on Hutchinson. They are both perfect for this scenario in every movie. I personally like the quality in a movie, where actors in the same situation end up as a previous movie, as the two did in The Green Mile. Overall it was a good movie.
