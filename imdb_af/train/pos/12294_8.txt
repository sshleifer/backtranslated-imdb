I think I always felt that the Hotel du Nord was studio, the movement of people's cars and camera was just too effortlessly smooth and stages filmed in the place. But no problem - it's still a very underrated lovely compilation of Marcel Carne. The plot sometimes looks temporary, as if they make it up as they went along, but because it is unpredictable, pay attention to the bitter end. The money shots when the 2 lovers are alone in their room are anointed with a little silent dialogue, but it's so nice to fall into any foolishness that can be accepted. Are these 2 young people symbols of a cancerous hopelessness in pre-war France or just idiots? Suicides are fairly common; If the suicide was young and healthy with their lives before them untouched, would you think anything other than what they were just wrong fools? <br /> <br /> Arletty played the prostitute well - she kept the zipper on her dress anyway! I just saw a few movies with Jouvet - he is the impressive invention as a pimp in HDN. My trouble is level: every time I see his face, I think of Sonnie Hale in Evergreen! <br /> <br /> A remarkably atmospheric, well-activated and photographed movie happens with so much, it needs a few views to get it all in place. Annabella and Aumont made a very nice couple; Francois (Heurtebise) Perier in his 2nd movie had a small amusing part as a gay man. All in all: wonderful.
