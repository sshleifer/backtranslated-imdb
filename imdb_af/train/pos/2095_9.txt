Let's talk about any discussion about using non-Asian actors playing Asian roles. The movie is 67 years old. In 1937, studio heads believed that any actor could play any role. Actors were under contracts and did not always have a choice as to what role they played. End of the story. <br /> <br /> It's a really great epic story of love, individual rights, class and men's and women's issues. The centerpiece of the film is two brilliant performances by Luise Rainer and Paul Muni. <br /> <br /> Muni plays a Chinese farmer, who is going to take a woman (Rainer). From the beginning he treated her with respect, at a time when women are considered as little as hired help. Without giving away too much of the movie, they go through the highs and lows of all relationships. Although the story may take place in the late 19th / early 20th century, the story and many of their feelings seem credible. <Br /> <br /> Unlike the fact that the movie is about 5-10 minutes longer than it needs, and the performances of Charley Grapewin and Walter Connolly are typical 1930's cartoon characters, this is a wonderful movie that unfortunately, has become a victim of political correctness. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10
