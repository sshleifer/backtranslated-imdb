I really don't know what people have against this movie, but it's definitely one of my favorites. It is not preaching, it is not anchored by its moral, it should not be controversial. It's just God. Any possible God, no matter what the religion is. And it's very funny. <br /> <br /> Jim Carry plays Bruce Nolan, a TV reporter who usually sits on the lighter side of the news, desperate to prove himself (more or less to himself) that he can be taken seriously and do a good job in anchorage. This ride is slowly driving away his beautiful girl Grace (Jennifer Aniston). When the final straws are performed, he cannot laugh, but shouts in the face of God, which in turn gives Bruce his powers. Bruce then makes his life better for himself, until he is found guilty of helping others, where he then misses the point of his powers. Meanwhile, his constant excitement about his own life makes him self-centered and leaves his relationship on dangerous ground. <br /> <br /> OK, it was quite long. But as a plot, it works well. The step-by-step way we experience God's challenges is much better than bundling our problems together and hiding it pretty well. <br /> <br /> As you probably know to hear about this movie, Carrey's play-perfect play (which he is fortunate enough) remains and controls and gives atmosphere to the movie scene. Whether they want to admit it or not, the role is written or rewritten exclusively for Carrey. Without him the humor will flatten, as humor is half. And the humor is very good in the first place. But without Carrey, it would feel like a wonderful life. Wannabe. <br /> <br /> Jennifer Aniston is wonderful and no matter what some say. This is not the only excuse for the third act. At least you don't think when you see her. She gives a real show and lets you forget that you are watching a movie, she and Carrey feel like a real couple. <br /> <br /> The movie feels gogooood (see the movie to understand), has a very nice feel, tackles the idea appropriately and better than expected and overall should never be clapped to save Carrey's career not (it was not everywhere).
