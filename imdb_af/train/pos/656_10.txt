Of all the reviews I read, most people were very busy with Alexandre. No one Marie or Veronika ever thought that they would be especially Alexandria, but only slightly intelligent but not intellectual, as most of us are, however difficult it may be for anyone to admit. Alexandre is perfectly away with life, completely cared for, and given and gives what he wants. the girls allow it, veronika loves sex, marie is his patron. is there anything wrong with any of these? is anyone really in love? I do not think so. Although the French New Wave cinema tends to pretend, and so forth, it's simply wonderful because it doesn't need a plot to create emotion. Convenience is perfect and everyone in Alexandre's position can ask in an urban area. I'm looking for a patron, anyone interested?
