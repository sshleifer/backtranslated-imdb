Loosely based on the James J Corbett biography "The Roar Of The Crowd", Mr. Jim is a wonderful picture that includes not only the rise of the pugilistic prancer, Corbett, but also the wind of change in the boxing sport around the 1890s. <br /> <br /> The story follows Corbett (a perfect cast Errol Flynn) from his humble beginnings as a bank teller in San Fransico, to a fight with a former boxing champion who eventually leads him to fight the terrifying heavyweight champion of the world, John L Sullivan (beefcake delighted by Ward Bond). Not all the fights are in the ring, and it's all the vignettes that fall into Corbett's life, making it a great entertaining picture. There are class problems to be overcome here (played perfectly like fellow club members paying to have a pen or two) and Corbett must not only fight to get respect from his so-called peers, but he must also overcome his ego. as it grows as fast as its reputation does. Along with the very wonderful Corbett family, and all their stoic humorous support, Corbett's journey is as enticing as it is joyful, but as bitter and brave as he is, he is a very nice character and it is a character who got the tagged fit he got from Mr. Jim. <br /> <br /> The film never falls for a moment, and it is a testament to director Raoul Walsh that while we eagerly await the final battle, the outer rings keep entertaining us, not even the love interest sub plot makes this picture hurt {thanks Alexis Smith}. The battle order is really good, and they show perfectly how Corbett has become the camp, his brand of dance rings around the slugger fighters is now firmly in boxing history. As the final scrolls we all come to earth, as a post-conflict meeting between Sullivan and Corbett puts all the brutality in context, and this is where humility and humility become the absolute winner and as far as the viewer goes. .. .......... it will be sure to be sure, 9/10 for a great picture.
