It is still a sharp and compelling film directed by Sam Fuller in the early 1950s. This minimalist and fast-paced director has something special for his previous films - a role-playing game with a few stars. Richard Widmark, Jean Peters and Richard Kiley star in this film about a group of communist agents trying to sneak secrets from America - and they will stop nothing from being successful. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with Peters on a subway car that is being watched by federal agents. They know she's a link in a long espionage chain. Unknown to everyone is the game map in the equation. A small-time bag (Widmark) is also on the train and he manages the secrets Peters has. Widmark thinks it's just another wallet he has plundered - only later does he realize the seriousness of what he has been stolen. Now it is Widmark on its own - with Commies and the FBI hot on its route. <br /> <br /> Widmark and the rest are exceptional and the movie is going from start to finish. Although she did not receive the best invoice, a special mention should be made of Thelma Ritter. This supportive actress may have shown her lifetime as a chair pigeon. Rarely was she given so much opportunity to act and I was impressed with her ability to play a broken and sad old lady. <br /> <br /> As far as writing and directing are concerned, they are very good - but with a slight exception. Initially, I loved how Widmark and Peters were dealing. It's one of the few times on the movie, you will see a women's seat in the mouth! Now it's difficult. Later, inexplicably, they become incredibly close - too close to being credible. Yet, with so much drama and such an effective Noir-like movie, it can be overlooked. See this movie.
