Rohinton Mistry's multi-layered novel seems impossible to customize for the screen, but the resulting film is filled with passion, emotion, humor and pathos. The story is somewhat slow, but there is always something on the screen to enchant the audience. The movie gets a perfect time and place with accuracy. All the actors are Indian - more or less known to a "western" public - but they are a joy to watch, especially the girl who is very convincing. Don't be put down by the title and plot summary - it's a movie to be seen on the big screen. We have a lot to learn.
