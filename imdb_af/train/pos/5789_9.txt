This is one of my favorites with Mariette Hartley and Robert Lansing "Sandy" and the Agnes Moorhead and the small spacemen episodes. <br /> <br /> It is an important task, from mid-1961, on the long Cold War that the US has been intervened. The closed city square, the scarce dialogue of the hungry characters, their thin uniforms and the minimal action, say "everything: the absurdity of an unpleasant conflict that threatens to destroy human life, modern civilization and all that sweet and redemption about it is. <br /> <br /> This is a "fable" because it was made at a time when events turned out differently, such as the second Berlin Crisis (Spring 1961) and the subsequent Cuban Missile Crisis (October 1962), It would actually be a fair representation of one of the big cities in the US, devastated and packed with some unfortunate survivors, I also see it as a "fable" because it is not just a warning story, but being the most redeeming of all our popular myths: it is a love story that is in an impossible situation and involves two highly-mismatched lovers.
