I personally looked at it to see the footage of the 60's and 70's. It was fascinating to learn how the drug movement really started and became pop culture and an ultimate compromise in life. The classic rock star interviews are titillating and humorous. You feel as if you are in a secret and at the same time nod your head ... because it feels so good and familiar. I loved it, all the segments of the 60's. I highly recommend it for all aspects, such as rock music, hipper movement, politics and good history. I tagged the box to say that it contains a spoiler, just because I have no idea what a spoiler or not in this regard can be considered, as I have discussed what is in all 4 segments, so I just wanted to be safe be.
