An excellent movie about two men who love the same woman. One of the policemen (PÃ©rier) killed her, but all the evidence seems to incriminate the other (Montand). The unfortunate Montand does not know who the other lover could have killed her, and Pierre also does not know that Montand had a relationship with the girl. Montand must absolutely find the killer ... and what a great ending! Highly recommended.
