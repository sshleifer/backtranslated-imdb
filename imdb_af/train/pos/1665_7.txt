The movie looks like a breakthrough for "Immoral Study". Most likely, I never got much involved in the burning need of the female artist to die of male nudes and therefore all the fuss about "Now, who pulled this penis?" sounds a bit free. Dialogue in this movie is quite awful, even though it is visual, this movie has its moments. I almost dig it when Tassi got a mental picture, but then the movie appeared on the penis again. Highly recommended for those who have not seen one yet.
