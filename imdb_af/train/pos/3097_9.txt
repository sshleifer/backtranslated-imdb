This show was fantastic. It was complicated and well written and all the characters were nice, without being terribly sweet. Even Jonathan Koek was the Philandering boyfriend. As our airwaves are filled with crap such as American Idol and Dancing with the Stars, it was nice to see a drama that was not for sea opera. It was always interesting to see how each character would be linked to the following circumstances. It is really annoying that we finally get a show that reminds you and has wiped out a bit because of a mysterious number most of us don't even pay attention to. Some of us are not sheep. This show may not be missed by many, but by some pretty loyal fans.
