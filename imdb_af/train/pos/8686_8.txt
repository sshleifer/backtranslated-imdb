The second official episode of the series "Columbo" ("Murder by the Book" later filmed, hit the airwaves first). Robert Culp, who will fit into various future roads with Peter Falk's detective, is awesome as the shrewd head of a sophisticated private detective agency that kills a client's wife when she refuses to throw in his extortion schemes. The two stars are well adapted to this clever cat and mouse exercise which is one of the best in the series.
