This movie really woke me up as it slumbered the main character of this brave, different movie from his life. The old John (Ben Chaplin) leads his mediocre safe life from a bank. a small provincial English town, until the incredibly beautiful, wild, girl-to-death for Nadia (Nicole Kidman), ordered by Russia's e-mail, enters his life to become his beloved wife, according to John's plan. But a glitch comes on - Nadia doesn't speak a word of John's language. Although calm and emotional on the outside, John becomes so interested in beautiful Nadia that instead of using the full refund policy of the corresponding service, she buys her a dictionary to start the communication process. <br /> <br /> What happens from now on In the plot, he really shakes poor John from his sleep from a well-paid safe in a decisive decisive action figure, giving the viewer a subliminal message "you would probably also acted ". <br /> <br /> Kidman, Cassel & Kassovitz make a good team that sees Russians and they are almost indistinguishable from the right thing, "almost" only because of the small accent that appears in their Russian dialogues, but little enough to surprise a native Russian by the hard work done to get the words right. Nicole Kidman demonstrates her talent again by playing a character that is completely different from the previous roles, at least from the cultural background. <br /> <br /> The pace of the movie is fast and engaging, and you're definitely not ready to stop watching when the end titles appear, you rather feel in the middle of the plot, and stay a desire to see the successor as soon as it arrives. <br /> <br /> My advice is to go out and get this movie right away and see and enjoy it. To sum it up, it has an unusual plot, great acting and under-surface ideas. Like the idea of ​​"rude awakening" of the artificial safe routine life of a wheel in a society's machine, the life that members of the Fight Club were so eager to stop and the machine that Pink Floyd sings was ("Welcome to the machine!"). I'm sure John was, in the end, rather with Sophia on the way to the unknown than not meeting her at all. <br /> <br /> Thanks, authors, for the big story, and everyone else for this great movie! Please make a successor! And you can place it anywhere and call it the place because the authenticity of the place is irrelevant to the 99,9999 percent of potential viewers. I'm sure of that.
