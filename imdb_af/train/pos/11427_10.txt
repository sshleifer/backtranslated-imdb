I loved this movie because it was so perfect in my mind that I thought life in French colonial Africa had to be in the 50's ('my' generation anyway). But I was really surprised by his quiet pacing and the glorious end. Within the last 5 minutes of this movie, you need to focus carefully on what happens. I have never been impressed with the "wrap-up" of a movie. I remember screaming "wow!" When I realized it was over. On the other hand, my two daughters fell asleep !!
