It is a brilliant sci-fi movie that is very strange in how men and women both see the same movie. I talked to many people about the movie and almost every man loved it and said it was brilliant - while most women thought it was just disgusting and stupid! This is the only film I know of such polarized views based on gender. Perhaps many women have only a lower tolerance for disgusting or oppressive plots - but whatever the cause, I have always found this difference fascinating. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with a murder and a subsequent investigation led by Charlton Heston. It is set in the near future and murdered the head of the major international Soylent Corporation. As the film unfolds, you soon realize that it is a terrible and highly unfair future American society. The wealthy live in beautiful apartments with security and all the fun that money can buy (including "furniture" - a euphemism for paid mistress who comes with the apartment). At the same time, the masses are dirty poor, unemployed and in many cases they live in abandoned cars or residential languages. Overpopulation and smog have taken a serious toll and the future is indeed a pity! <br /> <br /> Why the rich man died and the terrible truth he couldn't live with, I really shouldn't discuss it - it can ruin the movie for you. However, the movie has a great plot and play and is super-exciting to watch. Plus, it features Edward G. Robinson in his final screen display as the crunchy sidekick to Heston. Though not easily depressed or sick, it is a great scientific film that is allegorical and deep.
