The choice of Sylvester Stallone to perform Renny Harlin's lead player is commendable, as Stallone is that kind of tough and insane person who previously delivered the required exuberant aura to the characters of Rocky Balbao and Rambo. But to compare The Hard series with Cliffhanger is a far-fetched idea. <br /> <br /> The exquisitely crafted opening scene introduces the audience to the excitement, excitement, and intrigue of their subsequent bloody and dangerous encounter with the criminals. The elevator and the high altitude transfer of hard cash in one-to-one costumes is something that has not been filmed before. <br /> <br /> The biting cold of the snow-covered Alps and the unfolding fraud and betrayal among the antagonist forces make one tremble with trembling. The forces of incredible adventure and relentless murder kick the drama to the end. <br /> <br /> Good movies aren't made every year and people don't get a feast for every now and then. Apart from the dirty language / parlance that causes excitement under certain scenes, the movie can be seen as one that will not fade its fascinating appeal, even after so many years.
