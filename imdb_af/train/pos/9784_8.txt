Sensitive film does not have brilliance and, to some extent, narrative structure, yet is excellently shot and executed. However, the narrative structure point is questionable. While giving the impression of loosening, ending up nicely in the final scenes, linking his thoughts to what the modern viewer can describe as a "story", I am skeptical of whether * it needs * a "story structure" which is definitive and observable. It will inevitably be compared to SUMMER AULT in that its central protagonist (I'm not sure it's the right word!) Is a young and very young woman, whose newly discovered sexuality confuses and empowers her - although of course Cate Shortland's movie packs this aspect better. But while reckless viewers offer the opportunity to dismiss this movie as a clich√©, PEACHES is, in some ways, much more ambitious than SUMMER AULT. Maybe that's where it doesn't. This is definitely very different from Monahan's first feature - THE MAINTENANCE! I'm not quite sure how the sex scenes between Weaving and Lung added to the story. Who knows - maybe they did. They definitely hit the compromised and defective character of Weaving's character. Although I personally think it was achieved without the need for these scenes. <br /> <br /> ***** JUST SAAR THE FILM AGAIN ***** **** <br /> <br /> On a second show, I can see how some like it telemovie as a trait. But I don't know how clear these 'categories' are, or even if we have to make that distinction. Anyway, I think there are enough layers in the film to distinguish it from Hallmark's efforts. On the other hand, the structure of the film is very formal, and its content is hardly challenging, at least in the way SUMMERAULT, TOM WHITE, THREE DOLLARS, ILLUSTRATED FAMILY DOCTOR, BOTH WAYS and THE MUMAN TOUCH are. The performances are all right, but I realized that the main reason I enjoyed the movie was because it fits the "Australian" genre, without necessarily adding anything ... and I can understand that reasonably good reason for another person * NOT * to enjoy it! Indeed, it was only before Lung entered the room in her Vietnamese dress that the movie really started to punch. But this leads us to a different debate - * should we expect a movie to challenge us all the time? Certainly, I enjoy being challenged by a movie (or a book or other people), but is there no place for just a nice story? <br /> <br /> I don't have my first post on this movie because I'm all aware of the Orwellian overtones of such an act. But I will downgrade my initial rating of an 8 to maybe 6.5. <br /> <br /> As far as the nominations for AFI Best Film are concerned, my votes go to THE HUMAN TOUCH, THREE DOLLARS and see both ways - and I think LOOK must win both ways.
