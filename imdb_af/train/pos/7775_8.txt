Another in that doesn't make them that category. This story of a family with some real skeletons in the closet still qualifies as good clean, sometimes overnight fun. Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone are at their peak as the upset Hadley brothers and sisters, and they really took the roles and ran with them. Malone won an Oscar and Stack nominated in the supporting categories. Both honors are extremely well-deserved. They compensate for the somewhat thin lead. No Bacall or Hudson can ever be called bad actors, but they both had better parts and played them much more convincingly than they did here. It is difficult for me to accept Rock Hudson to play such a red blood heterosexual as he does here, but it is more of a personal bias than anything else. But it doesn't detract from the movie's overall entertainment value, which is considerable and this movie is extremely visible. If you're a little night and this movie is going on, I want to see it. It is worth the effort.
