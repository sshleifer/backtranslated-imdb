... will probably be the best word to describe this movie (in my opinion). In addition to a huge bunch of fan service for fans (well, it was superfluous ~), it was the story that blew me away. Hurray for Takahisa Zeze and Gackt! and I know some people will differ with this one, but it was not one of the big three actors (the guys who played Sho, son and Kei) who gave the best performance. it was Taro Yamamoto, son # 5 of the Royale battle! <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong, I like Hyde, I adore his voice, but the problem is that some of his scenes come off a bit, but I loved that scene where he danced with the dead man's body killing the other guys. And Gackt was not that bad at all, I chose how his character was similar from the beginning. nothing I can say about my background on Lee-Hom Wang, I won't pretend to know him, but he wore his own weight with the star-studded cast. <br /> <br /> This film paved the way for one of the best collaboration I've ever heard, Orenji No Taiyou (forgive my spelling if it's wrong). while the full song lasts about nine minutes, you won't see the length, because you'll love Gackt and Hyde. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this movie is a must-see, not just for fans (great fan base), but for those who enjoy a sci-fi, futuristic movie, Asian style .
