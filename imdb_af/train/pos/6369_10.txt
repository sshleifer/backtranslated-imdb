I loved this movie! I am biased as I am a great Disney fan, but I enjoyed myself a lot. The action starts running in the beginning of the movie and just goes on! It's a bit of a room for Disney, they don't spend much time on character development (my husband pointed it out) and there are no musical numbers. This is strict action adventure. I thoroughly enjoyed it and recommended it to anyone who loves Disney, whether young or old.
