Yesterday I went to the theater alone, because in Mexico most of the time films from other countries are part of the so-called "cam√°ra alternativa" (alternative camera). But after watching this movie, I realized that not all foreign films are alternative. Fortunately, this is a good example. But I said I enjoyed this movie so much. It was finally happy. This movie is a little spoonful of hope in these days. And the most important lesson for me is this at the end of the day ... love is the main force behind us. It's a good option to watch a good movie in Spanish ... and I have to call the good music. Especially the main song of the movie. It's a good song! !!
