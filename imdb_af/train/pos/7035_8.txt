Cusack does his best David Niven in this one, although I don't know if anyone except me noticed it. <br /> <br /> Taking this into account, it's a wonderfully over-saturated "want to be taken more seriously than Austin's powers, but still pretty d * mn funny" reworking an undervalued comedy classic . <br /> <br /> Hillary Duff does an over-sexualized Britney Spears shot dance version of Mata Bond. The authors built a small reverse Oedipus twist in the plot - interesting choice. <br /> <br /> I never knew how calm Montel's voice was in this movie. I think he has found a new calling that made voice surplus to system. !
