I originally caught it in 1996 in his one week at a kiosk. I was impressed and my feelings didn't change much. <br /> <br /> Documentaries on the notorious Edward D. Wood Jr. covering his life and movies. There were interviews with people who worked with him or knew him. They include: Vampira, Dolores Fuller, Bela Lugos Jr., Loretta King, Gregory Walcott and Paul Marco. Interviews are mixed with clips from the movies or bizarre relaxation. It's interesting (somewhat), but was it really necessary? I've seen Wood's movies and they're just terrible. Wood had ambitions, but not a little talent to run them. I won't say he was the worst director ever, but he's there. Do we really need a document on a very mediocre movie maker? I like the fact that they didn't try to make Wood a kind of saint. More than a few of the interrogators (especially Lugosi Jr.) hate the man and it comes through hard and clear. They also completely ignore his films in the adult movie industry in the 1960s and 70s. Still, it is important if you are a Wood fan. The best interviews are with Vampira (who dismantles Wood) and Dolores Fuller (a long-time friend).
