Poorly thrown, horrible scripture full of holes, hot blonde is eaten alive, The evil scientist has a serious nasty mustache, one man takes a platoon of trained armed man and comes out of the victorious, terrible special effects, they recover the problem by blow off the monster ... Awesome. The only missing thing was an unnecessary graphic sex scene during one of the killings. Haha. Good tidy fun with predictable twists and laughable one linen. I really enjoyed this movie, but before you look, make sure you're a good laugh. I recommend this movie to people who can watch a movie and not take it so seriously. I can't think in my right mind that this movie was made for people to take it seriously. But if you can see it and sit back and just enjoy it, I really think you can enjoy this movie as it was meant to enjoy it. Very simple. So get some popcorn and a few beers and enjoy a nice evening with friends and this movie. It brought me joy in my life.
