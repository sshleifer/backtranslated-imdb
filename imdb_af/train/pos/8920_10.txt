I wasn't aware of Steve McQueen in 1958. I just knew I was very scared to see this movie. (I was devastated by the movie "Trantula" at age seven ... but I was ten now). The first scene where the Blob crawls the farmer's test stick and informs his hand was enough to leave me the theater. But I stayed and suffered from each of our monster attacks. I felt so horrible when Steve and his girlfriend barely made it out of the doctor's office, and even more so when The Blob entered a movie and devoured much of the audience. . . so much in the fact that it is ooooozzzzed from the front doors, too big now to just fit through one. It was indestructible and unlimited in growth potential, and when it caught Steve's arm in a sift-like dinner, it looked like it was a sure dinner. <br /> <br /> To say that the Blob was cold would be a contemporary description, but ultimately better icy than to scare and break small children. <br /> <br /> I remember going home tonight with my uncle Nick, trying to be brave. He knew I was in trouble, and when I got into bed that night I could not only feel the Blob in the room, but when I called the courage to look down on the floor, there was the red pulsating , heartily hungry man sitting waiting for me to get up and go to the bathroom. It took months to recover. <br /> <br /> I'm now 57 years old. . . I made it. <br /> <br /> Of course, the Blob wasn't destroyed.
