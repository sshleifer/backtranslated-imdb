I find it very interesting that Lee Radziwill, Jackie Kennedy's sister and the nephew of these women, will encourage the Maysles to make "Big Edie" and "Little Edie" the subject of a movie. They can certainly be regarded as the "skeletons" in the family cabin. The extra features on the DVD include several contemporary fashion designers who credit their ideas to these oddball women. I want to say that anyone interested in fashion will find the discussion fascinating by these designers. (ie "Are they nuts? Or do I miss something?"). This movie is hard to come by. Netflix didn't. Facets do.
