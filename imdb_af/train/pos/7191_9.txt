Reed Hadley makes a better faint Don Diego than he does a brave and daring Zorro, but it is almost at the point because this series contains the bar - no best theme song of any series, and the best version of Yakima Canutt's famous stage stunt. There are also other good stunts, lots of action and lots of hair-wreath-crown-hanger chapter finals, but if you for no reason have to watch this movie to watch the sturdy stunt, you should see it slowly again. It's incredible, and despite the lower budget for this chapter, Yak turns the stunt better than he did in the much more celebrated movie "Stagecoach." Indiana Jones, Eat Your Heart: It's the Right Deal!
