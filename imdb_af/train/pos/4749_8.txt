I really enjoyed this movie and it was a bit difficult to do if your brother made another 30 seconds comment. But I enjoyed this movie, mostly because I'm accustomed to the usual HK action movies. Most of the movies like this, don't look at the story line, watch it for the silly action. And senseless action is right. You get Jet Li Jump, spin, kick, punch, shoot, make impossible jumps and evade countless bullets. It is true that this movie was released to a larger audience after Li was in Lethal Weapon 4. This is one of the reasons the ratings fell on this movie. Most people probably expected to see a movie so polished as a North American movie. But you have to remember that most HK movie budgets aren't nearly as high as a North American movie. The style of a HK action film is usually very different, usually required in much of the wire work. If you want to see a good action movie, you should see it, try to ignore the dubbing. <br /> <br /> My score was an 8.
