I didn't read all the comments, but at least one poster mentioned that the 30 minute version might be shortened. I'm curious about this because the later parts of the movie didn't make me much health even when I chewed them. 30 minutes also looks very short for a movie in 1917. "Poor Little Rich Girl", who was Tourneur's next movie, is 65 minutes long and the "Pride of the Clan", which was his previous feature, was 84 minutes long . So I am relieved to see that I was not crazy, there must be part of this movie and therefore the resolution didn't make much sense. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to review or comment on a movie that you can only see half of ... but I would recommend this movie anyway because of the truly fascinating view we offer from the inside of an east coast film studio of the time. This is the earliest movie I have personally seen based on the film industry itself. The main character is a movie star played by Robert Warwick. He later became a starring Hollywood actor and appeared in almost all Preston Sturges films. He plays a Western actor who may be vaguely modeled on William S. Hart, who looks slightly warwick. After the very fascinating rows in the studio, we see them on a spot shot where he discovers a land girl (Doris Kenyon) and convinces her to come to New Jersey for a very poor screen test. After that point, the movie looks great in the shape we have now. It is recommended to anyone interested in film history for documentary value, but in the form we want it is not much like a movie and is not a very good example of Maurice Tourneur's work.
