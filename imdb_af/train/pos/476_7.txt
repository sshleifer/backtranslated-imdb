A brilliant player plays a tournament and falls in love with a woman he meets there. In itself, this would be a very bad angle on a story. So, there's more. There is also the fact that the chess player of the world is completely alienated due to his brilliance at play and the fact that there is a history that haunts the player. <br /> <br /> This film pushes back and forth from romantic clumsiness to tournament tensions to historical events that the chess player has formed and works pretty nicely. It's easy to grow on the two main characters and make it easy to believe that they can beat it together the way they do in this movie. The addition of the tournament is also very good and creates a good tension. <br /> <br /> I don't know the power of the chess players, because I don't play the game, but it looks good and credible. All in all, most of the movie goes off very easily. It is also easily forgotten. That's why it's nice to look at, but nothing more than that. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 chess players caught between a smoke and a hard place
