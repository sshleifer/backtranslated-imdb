Not to mention Pierce Brosnon's best performance. Of course Greg Kinnear is always good. Really, when was he really bad? I think this movie is incredibly understated! Using colors in this movie is something very different in today's film world where every other movie has the Payback blue filter. I also like the way they used the song through Asia. To prove that even what was previously thought to be a kinda cheese, really cool, can be correctly placed. <br /> <br /> I made my first feature when it came out. Because my movie was a hit movie, I had to check anything in the released genre. After I saw it, I'm sure it had some effect on me through the process. It was pretty cool when my movie got on the IMDb that it would recommend this movie if you liked me. How any of the others are related, I have no idea, make an even more interesting coincidence. <br /> <br /> http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1337580/
