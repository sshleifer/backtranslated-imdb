This photo was banned from American movie houses in 1930 due to the nakedness of Hedy Lamarr (Eva Hermann) who experienced all kinds of problems in the 1930s, but not so much for the male population. This story relates to a young woman named Eva Hermann who gets married with an older man and is worn over the threshold on the wedding day and never man carries on and worries about all kinds of small things like his shoes and killing insects. Eva leaves her husband's house and lives with her father and tries to explain her situation. On a hot summer day, Eva takes a ride on her horse and decides to go for a swim in a lake in the forest. Her horse walks away and she runs to him and is observed by a young man who gets her clothes and returns to Eve. These two people are becoming well known and there is a romance that begins to blossom. There are many more interesting problems that arise when you see this movie to its end. Enjoy a great Classic movie that was a Shocker Film in 1933. Enjoy.
