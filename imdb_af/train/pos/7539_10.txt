I really enjoyed watching this movie. like most people who watched it. I wasn't sure I had done it. Whoopi Goldberg is a very funny comedian and she has done many funny movies. ie sister behavior. <br /> <br /> But it wasn't really comedy. It's a drama with comic moments. so if you are looking for a lazy riot, keep looking. <br /> <br /> This movie is about a black family moving from a beautiful neighborhood in the city to a higher middle class environment. I will say more, but it thinks it will spoil the movie. This movie is not only about racial relations between whites and blacks, but also about relationships with the black community. I think it's worth a chance. if you are not really interested in seeing another movie about race relationships, this movie is not for you
