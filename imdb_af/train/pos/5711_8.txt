In Le Million, Rene Clair, one of the big directors and the big pioneers of the movie, created a gem of light comedy that, for all its lights, is a pioneering and technically brilliant movie featuring the subsequent filmmakers like the Marx Brothers, Lubitsch , and Mamoulian. The plot, a spectacular story of a poor artist who wins a huge lottery pot, but has to look for the missing ticket throughout the town. It's basically just a device to support a series of amazing comic scenes that are in a dream world of the director's imagination. <br /> <br /> It is one of the most impressive aspects of this film, although it is in the center of Paris and contains nothing that is actually impossible, it achieves a sustained and entertaining fairy tale / fantasy atmosphere, in which it seems that people are singing as much as they speak, or that a push over a stolen jacket must take the form of a soccer match. Another unforgettable element is that Le Million includes what the funniest operation can ever be on film (Oh, that blonde-braided soprano! "I laugh, ha! Ha!") Also a joy is the casting: Clair has a group wonderful, distinctly different character characters, each illustrating deadly satirical accuracy, a bourgeois-French "type", so that the movie looks like a set of Daumier pictures, comes to life. <br /> <br /> The grace takes a while to roll, and I didn't find the characters so emotional, as they can even be in a light comedy (as they are in many Lubitsch movies, for example). ) For these reasons, I refrained from giving it the highest score. But these small lots should not derive from an enthusiastic recommendation. <br /> <br /> Do you see it? With pleasure. Highly recommended if you want a classic and influential work of cinema, or just a fun comedy.
