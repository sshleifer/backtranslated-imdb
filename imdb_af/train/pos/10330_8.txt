It's actually a trilogy of Somerset Maugham's short stories. The first one is The Verger, which is about 15 minutes long and very pleasant. After 17 years, Albert Foreman is dismissed from his church work because he cannot read or write. So what does he do? Of course, open a tobacco shop! <br /> <br /> The second is Mr. Know-All, which was actually a story I read for school 6 years ago and immediately forgot until I heard the familiar introduction. Another 15 minutes one, and also very good. It worked better on movies than in a book for me, but maybe it was because I was just 14 last time. <br /> <br /> The 3rd one is almost a deviation. Almost an hour is dragging it simply. It's not that bad, but not as fast and funny as the last 2. I watched it for the first quarter and then skipped to the last quarter and found that it still made sense and I really didn't miss it! <br /> <br /> Overall, I give them 8, 9 and 6 respectively.
