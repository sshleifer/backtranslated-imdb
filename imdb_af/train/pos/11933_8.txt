I think it's a beautiful family movie. There are many hilarious scenes and heartwarming moments that occur throughout the film. The actors are great and the effects are well executed throughout. Danny Glover plays George Knox who runs the terrible baseball team 'The Angels' and is right through the movie. Also fantastic are the young actors Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Milton Davis Jr. Christopher Lloyd is good as Al 'The Angel' and the effects are great in this top Disney movie. A touch and warmth movie that everyone should enjoy.
