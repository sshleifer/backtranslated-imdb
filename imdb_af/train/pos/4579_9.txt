I think this movie was pretty good. It's strange that the Olsen twins are now 13 and boyfriends and everyone. I really enjoyed them when they were little kids at Full House. Anyway, the casting was good and the movie was somewhat funny. I have some sort of mix between all the switches and their names. It's just kind of an older version of it taking two.
