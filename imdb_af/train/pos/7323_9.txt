Brutal, emotional Michael Myers kills his sister at the age of six on Halloween night in 1963; On October 30, 1978, he escaped from a spiritual institution and installed a new terror in his hometown Haddonfield, Illinois. He is constantly pursued by a psychiatrist (Donald Pleasence). He only knows how angry this young man is. <br /> <br /> It opens up with a bang, and sets up a really exciting and atmospheric chiller that is actually better. to the many treasures it helped to inspire. It is subtle compared to the nasty carnage, many of the subsequent movies were; subtle and scary. It retains the ability to make me jump even after repeated views. How many movies are there, really, that can be terrifying even after they have seen them before? Not much. <br /> <br /> Pleasure is wonderful in what was probably the definitive role of his career; Jamie Lee Curtis, in her film debut, became a bona fide screaming queen after working in Halloween, as well as a number of subsequent screen-shots. She is an intended victim who is worth rooting. <br /> <br /> Co writer / director John Carpenter knows what works in this movie, making excellent use of shadows and dark air; Notice how most of the movie falls after the night. With this photo, he and his former associate, Debra Hill, created a franchise that created seven successors, many imitators and an upcoming "re-show". <br /> <br /> It's very quotable - who can ever Dr. Loomis' (Pleasence) speech describing Michael Myers to the sheriff (Charles Cyphers, a reputable repertoire player in several of Carpenter's previous works)? <br /> <br /> It's great, and worth looking out for. This is my favorite John Carpenter movie of all time. <br /> <br /> It's not quite infallible - there are script holes, but overall, it's making a big impact. <br /> <br /> 9/10
