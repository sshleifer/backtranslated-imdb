I always enjoy watching movies that make you think, and don't just drop the answers to their audience. "Revolver" is one of these films, and although many reviewers have said it is difficult to follow, with a little concentration and an open mind, I got it. First time. True, it does not compare with other thought mucks such as "The Usual Suspects" or "Memento", but in its own right it is an intelligent and thoughtful film. <br /> <br /> Another thing I really liked about this movie is how beautiful it is. Every scene, every camera angle has been thought for centuries. If you see it, you'll know what I mean. <br /> <br /> Finally, look at it with an open mind and you'll enjoy it. If not, no one ever said "Revolver" is for everyone. And that's me 2 cents.
