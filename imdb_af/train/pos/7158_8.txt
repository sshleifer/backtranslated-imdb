Holes (2003, Dir Andrew Davis) <br /> <br /> When Stanley Yelnats IV is found guilty of stealing, he is sent to 'Camp Green Lake'. At this camp, the Warden and her two henchmen, Mr. Sir and dr. Pendanski, camped to dig holes to the hole to the hole. But for what reason? Stanley plans to find out. <br /> <br /> I never really wanted to watch Holes, and I have to admit, I just watched the movie because I'm such a fan of Shia LaBeouf, but even if you're not a His fan is not, it doesn't matter. 'Holes' is one of the Disney movies that the whole family can enjoy. The story is wonderfully written and contains a great idea to include flashbacks to the past. It is not distracted and really gives a good story. All the throws are great. The young stars work well and the addition of Jon Voight and Sigourney Weaver is a joy. Shia LaBeouf shows he can even act at 17 without any mistakes. It's a Disney movie that you'll definitely enjoy as a family. <br /> <br /> "I'm learning about failure." - Stanley Yelnats III (Henry Winkler)
