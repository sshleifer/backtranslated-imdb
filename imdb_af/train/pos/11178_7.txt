MINOR SPOILER <br /> <br /> Minor small Stephen King player. It's not perfect, by any imaginative force - even if the slack performances of Dale Midkiff and Denise Crosby were better, there is still the mismanaged mystical story elements they have to contend with. The old Micmac cemetery, Rachel's terminal sick sister, and the Jacob-Marley-Victor Pascow never really come together in something coherent and the film in place feels confused and overstuffed. But few horror movies are really perfect, and what this one might lack in other areas makes it his willingness to shock. "Pet Sematary" may actually be one of the cruel horror movies in recent memory, with his murderous zombie baby and his bad insensitive depiction of Zelda. It's politically wrong, it's tasteless, it's unnecessary - yet it confuses us with a way that 'safer' horror movies can never. Add to that one of Fred Gwynne's best performances and Mary Lambert's witty direction, and you have an intense, terrifying movie - even with the Hokey end. Highly recommended for genre fans. 7.5 out of 10.
