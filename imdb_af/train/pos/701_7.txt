I didn't know what to do, except so I think it was much better not to have much. Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad short film. Tess Nanavati is a relatively new director and writer, so I think she deserves a lot of kudos to make this movie. You could say it was a love for her. The play (outside Dominic) is a bit cheesy and the quality of the movie is not good either, but for a very low budget film it is good. There were times when the story line became complicated and there were parts that turned on, though I didn't feel it, because of the ability to understand the movie. If you love Dominic Monaghan as much as I do, I tell you. The gag reel was fun, I won't spoil it, but there's a specific scene that makes the DVD worth buying just so you can watch it over and over. If you like the movie, watch The Pink Mirror, a movie also made by Jagged Edge. I know Dominic fans will enjoy this little piece of heaven.
