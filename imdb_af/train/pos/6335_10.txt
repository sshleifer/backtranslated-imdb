Well, I come from Bulgaria where it is almost impossible to have a tornado, but my imagination tells me to be very scared. This man (Devon Sawa) has done a good job with this movie! I don't know exactly how old he was, but he didn't act like a kid (well done)! Now about the tornado - it wasn't very realistic, but scared you! If you want to have a nice time before the tally, this is the movie!
