I only saw this movie when it originally came out. I was about 9 years old. old and found this movie both very entertaining and very frightening, and unlike any other movie I've seen up to that time. <br /> <br /> BASIC PLOT: An expedition is sent from Earth to the fourth planet of Altair, a major constellation in constellation Aquilae to find out what happened to a colony of settlers landing twenty years ago have not been heard before. <br /> <br /> THEME: An inferior civilization (namely ours) comes in contact with the remnants of a very advanced alien civilization, removing the Krell 200,000 years. The "seed" of the destruction of one civilization is initially transferred to the other. The theme of this movie is very good. Evil. <br /> <br /> I first saw this movie with my brother when it originally came out. I was just a boy and the tiger screens really scared me, just like the battle scenes with the invisible power of creation. I was also amazed at how real things in the movie looked. <br /> <br /> What really catches my attention as an adult is the truth of the movie "Prohibited Knowledge" and how relevant it will be when we do it (if ever) come into contact with an advanced (stranger) civilization that is much more developed than we are at present. Advanced technology and responsibility seem hand in hand. We need to do the work for ourselves to gain the knowledge along with the wisdom of using advanced technology. It is, in my opinion, the great moral of the movie. <br /> <br /> I learned in the graduate school that "knowledge is power" at best, in fact, is not correct! Knowledge is "potential" power, depending on how it is applied (... if not applied at all.) [This is not what you know, but how you use it!] <br /> <br /> The overall impact of this movie may be realized somewhere in mankind's own future. It is knowledge in and in itself is not enough, we need to have the wisdom upon which knowledge is dependent to really control our own destiny OR we will end up like the Krell in the movie - just cut out. <br /> <Thank you to those who responded to previous versions of this article with comments and corrections, they are all highly valued !!
