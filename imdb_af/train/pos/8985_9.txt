Although DiG! was closest to what the music industry is, as it is highly manufactured. The director deceived the audience into believing that the Brian Jonestown massacre vanished from the earthquake after '98. And the rivalry between the Dandy Warhols and Jonestown has been milked. The truth of the matter is not really exposed in this movie. <br /> <br /> It says this movie is endlessly quotable and is an interesting look when we look at two groups of talented musicians who create their art. One of the best things this movie is about is a unique perspective between the indie music scene and the larger corporate scene. <br /> <br /> Mostly recommended for the music and the two fantastic bands.
