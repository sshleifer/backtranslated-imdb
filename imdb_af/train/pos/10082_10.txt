The movie is truly attractive, unique and constructive. The story is universal because it is a battle between good, evil and the world. The most important thing is that his rating is wrong, misleading, and a travesty. Blockbuster rated it as being an X-rated movie. The truth is, it is closer to G than PG and should be seen by children who can read the clear and simple subitems.
