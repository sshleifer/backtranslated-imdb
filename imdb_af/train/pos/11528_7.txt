I saw Lady with Red Hair back when it appeared, and didn't remember it as something to cherish. The truth is that, despite his base in a true story, his screenplay is stupid and incredible. The real merit of the picture is the cast. A constellation of some of the best supporting players of the 30's and 40's makes a backdrop to the delicate, intelligent work of always underrated Miriam Hopkins, and the wonderful, spectacular performance of Claude Rains, which is usually the best thing in the picture. What an actor! He never won an Oscar, but he is in the good company of Chaplin, Garbo and Hitchcock. Perhaps Lady with Red Hair has his best work in movies. See it and enjoy it. <br /> <br />
