"COSBY," in my opinion, is a must-see CBS hit! I'm not sure I've seen every episode yet, but I still enjoyed it. It's hard to tell which one is my favorite. Also, I really loved the theme song. If you asked me, even if I was all, it would be nice if Madeline Kahn hadn't died during the show. Ever since, I've always wondered how the show would have been. Everyone has always produced a good performance, the productions design was spectacular, the costumes were well designed and the writing was always very strong. To conclude, although it can be seen on TBS, I strongly recommend that you catch it only if it goes well.
