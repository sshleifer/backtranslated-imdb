As known to long-haired youngsters who are incredibly interested in this Herr Graf's silent rations, aristocrats like to keep up with exclusive and mainstream heat in the summer, as well as making horde people more comfortable. Such bizarre travels around the world also happen in the "Three centuries", a beautiful and elegant piece of work done by old hands, namely Herr Buster Keaton and Herr Eddie Cline. It was clear that this German count most liked the first segment focusing on the Stone Age due to the affinity that this aristocrat feels about ancient times. chose it as the second segment that took place during the glory of Rome (it had included the cause of the fall of the Roman Empire, that is, Barbarians, or the same thing, Germans). Of course, the third segment takes place in modern times, but this Teutonic aristocrat believes that even 100 years ago should qualify as modern. <br /> <br /> The leitmotif that Mr. Keaton and his companions move to endure the strange and distorted. hilarious events during three different ages, the quest for love, a very complicated subject to understand for aristocrats who prefer the search for money and self-interest. Every time the "Three Century" is shown in the Schloss theater, it is always a pleasure to watch a funny, witty silent movie (even for a serious German score), an oeuvre full of gags and gadgets , puns, pratfalls and acrobatics, visual and astonishing technical tricks, an absolute silent delicacy that is perfect for enduring the various and rough summer storms. <br /> <br /> And now, if you allow me, I have to temporarily take my leave because this German Count must flirt with an old Teutonic heir who doesn't see her age. <br /> <br /> Herr Graf Ferdinand Von Galitzien http://ferdinandvongalitzien.blogspot.com/
