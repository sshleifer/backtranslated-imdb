It's a reunion, a team and a great episode of Justice. From hesitation to resolution, Clark made an important leap from a troubled teenager who was afraid of a controlled destination, for a Superman who, like Green Arrow, set aside his emotions to his few loved ones, ready to run the whole planet ed. It's not just an exciting story about teamwork, loyalty and friendship; It's also about the decision that is more important in life, a lesson for Clark. I don't want the series to end, but I hope the following episodes will keep up with what Justice shows without a "rewind" push and a good ending here at Smallville --- and a wonderful start to Superman. <br /> <br /> In this episode, however, we had to see more contrast between Lex and the team. Nine stars should give it enough credit.
