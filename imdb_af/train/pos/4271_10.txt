This is the best movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I saw the movie on Dutch television ever in 1988 (?). <br /> <br /> That month they showed a Yugoslav movie. every Sunday night. <br /> <br /> The next week there was another big movie (with a train, rather than a bus), the name I didn't remember. If you know, please let me know! Anyway, how can I see this movie again? A DVD of this movie, where? Please tell me at vannoord@let.rug.nl <br /> <br /> The next week there was another big movie (with a train, rather than a bus) I didn't remember. If you know, please let me know!
