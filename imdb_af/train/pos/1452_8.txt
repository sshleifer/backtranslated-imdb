As a transplanted New Yorker, I can be more critical than most in City Hall. But I have to say that before I get to the story, I was captivated by New York City's location shooting and political atmosphere created by director Harold Becker. <br /> <br /> For example, there is a reference to Woerner's Restaurant In Brooklyn where political boss Frank Anselmo likes to eat. There was or was a Woerner's Restaurant on Remsen Street in downtown Brooklyn when I lived in New York in 1996. It was actually favored by city politicians, although they had some other hangouts. <br /> <br /> No surprise, because the script is co-authored by Nicholas Pileggi, who continues to write political and organized crime stories. He knows the atmosphere very well and knows for sure how the two worlds cross as they do in this movie. <br /> <br /> A detective, played by Nestor Serrano, is going for an unofficial meeting with a relative of evil boss Anthony Franciosa and breaking things out and three are killed, including an innocent 6 year old son whose father walked to school. The story mushrooms and at the end it reached within the city hall itself. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino plays mayor John Pappas and John Cusack is his deputy mayor a transplanted Louisiana, a state that has a tradition of fine corruption itself. He is the outsider here and in the attempt to do damage control, Cusack finds out more than he has negotiated. <br /> <br /> Danny Aiello plays Brooklyn political boss Frank Anselmo, and for those of you not from New York, his character is based on the end of the Borough President of Queens Donald Manes, who also scandal has been brought. He is actually the kind of Brooklyn politician I knew in the day whose friendship with organized crime and favors was done to them. Do Aiello. <br /> <br /> City Hall was the film screening for Anthony Franciosa, one of the most underrated and undervalued talents ever on display. No one looks at anyone else if he is. <br /> <br /> Already, Pacino's best moment is when he killed at the young child's funeral, he takes over the proceedings and turns it into a political triumph for himself. She's a complex part, he's a decent enough man, but one got stuck in the corruption it needs to stand in a place like New York. <br /> <br /> For those who want to know about political life in the Big Apple, City Hall is highly recommended.
