Raggedy Ann & Andy is the first movie I've ever seen in the theaters. My dad took my sister and I, and the funny thing is - when we got home, Pa asked us. "What do you want to do now?" and we said we want to watch Raggedy Ann & Andy again! lol, and my dad actually took us back to the theater to see it again - at least, that's how I remember it. I was then five years old. <br /> <br /> This movie was pretty scary for a five year old. The scene with the giant ocean of candy and the hypnotic camel scene. I don't remember much about this movie. Of course the beginning was wonderful and some scenes. I wish I could find it again and will probably look it out now. <br /> <br /> I remember loving Raggedy Ann & Andy.
