I watched the movie at the Nashville Film Festival. It was beautifully done, from cinematography to acting. This is the story of a father and son, and how they appreciate each other during a family crisis. Beautifully written with dialogue that never fails, the film shows the acting talents of Paul Reiser and Peter Falk, among others in this outstanding role. The film starts with the aging father (Peter Falk). He tries to find out why his wife (Olympia Dukakis) left him. The father presents himself unnoticed on the threshold of his son and daughter-in-law. The father and son go the next day to look at property and eventually take a classic road trip. They fish, play pool, watch a baseball game, get drunk, get involved in a barroom noise and dance with strange women. But more importantly, they each confront the unspoken tension that any family can influence. It's the kind of movie that touches the heart and appreciates those closest to them.
