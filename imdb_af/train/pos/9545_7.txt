I don't know if this movie should be recommended to fans of "Tetsuo" or not. Why "Tetsuo"? Because you can easily name it about this movie as a very obvious "Tetsuo" rip-off. The concept is similar, editing is as cumbersome and fast - which is good, because apart from making the movie more dynamic, it is caused by low budget and other factors. <br /> <br /> There is much more gore, less eroticism and, in the case of 'Meatball machine', called the transformation of man into a creature called a machine (sounds known). Necroborg (very original), caused by clever little strangers. <br /> <br /> These skinny outer space scums actually use people as ships for their gladiator games that they play with each other. Their seizure of the body somehow manages to set up an insane amount of mechanical parts in which they seem to move from nowhere and turn it into a murder machine targeting other Necroborgs. Their goal is to defeat another alien who is in another Necroborg, ripen it from the body and eat it. <br /> <br /> All in all, the plot sounds a bit silly and I didn't expect much, but at The End I really enjoyed this movie. <br /> <br /> As I said, it's a low budget slip, but it's still relatively decent. Don't expect much from actors, they are usually not very good, but it can be tolerated. I like the atmosphere and gore, some bizarre situations and the way the movie is directed and edited. Although the story is not too original, it has some charm - at least for me. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10.
