CREEP is a straightforward dramatic horror movie set up in real time that doesn't want anything more than just showing that a mutant is attacking an empty subway platform for 85 minutes. And it does just that. Nothing more, nothing less. Director Christopher Smith pulls the drama as far as he possibly can by setting up a series of characters who actually have a reason to be in the subway after it is closed. He also deliberately vague the origin of the titular Creep (illegal experiments taking place underground in the 60s) and that little bit of secrecy usually works. Unfortunately, he undermines himself to the end by actually holding back a bend that ends where more genetic malformations would appear (they are both presented). Yeah, you heard me right - I wanted to end a stone quarrel! Franka (RUN LOLA RUN) Potent is good as the terrorist female head and the rest of the role play is good.
