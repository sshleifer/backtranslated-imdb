An imagination is a terrible thing to waste ... especially if you have talented actors. Author / director Jones doesn't waste time sticking the viewer with his main character. <br /> <br /> Anyone who shared a flat with a slab will cry with laughter. Anyone who has arrived while a meter maid places a ticket on your windshield will only cry. We all tore a terrible toupee of a man's head. These are just a few pieces of what is in store when you watch "Cross Eyed", a sad movie that must be a stepping stone for Jones and his resentment for humor, both before and behind the camera.
