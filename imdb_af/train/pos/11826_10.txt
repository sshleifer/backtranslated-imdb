I have never attended the midnight show of a movie before "Dick Tracy" came out. <br /> <br /> I still have the "t-shirt ticket" I had to wear to be allowed to look around here and, Like this shirt, Dick Tracy has been holding me since. <br /> <br /> If you saw the movie, the sharp footage, bright primary colors and strong characters are undoubtedly etched in your brain. It's a wonder to see. <br /> <br /> As a director / star / co-writer / manufacturer, Beatty works in a movie and shows it here, taking a well-known American icon and re-creating a new era. Still in the 30's, "Tracy" has some sort of timeless quality like all good movies do. I have traced how many times I watched "Tracy" and I still catch something new every time I do it. <br /> <br /> The others are all, too, starting with Pacino's Big Boy Caprice (and reminding him to do the comedy with the best of them), even Madonna's breathless Mahoney is relevant to it environment, she can act (GASP!). <br /> <br /> But there are still such themes being touched upon, as the need for family, true to one's self, good to evil, even Machiavellian themes is explored. Strange for a cartoon, but hey, it works. <br /> <br /> All in all, "Dick Tracy" is a classic to himself. Compared to other films of this decade, it makes a strong statement. It's a good, strong film that doesn't depend on blood, violence, curse or nudity to make its point. <br /> <br /> There is a lesson to be learned here. <br /> <br /> Ten stars. Great Scott!
