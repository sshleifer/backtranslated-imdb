I've seen this one about 10 times, so there must be something about it that I like! <br /> <br /> 50's American sci-fi movies were almost a mixed bunch: they were either intelligently made and / or thought-provoking or cheap and tasty cheese. Forbidden Planet is a bit of both, but in that rarity for the genre, color. <br /> <br /> It also started with the writing - although Shakespeare may not have recognized it, it was based on its timeless play, thus ensuring a certain lifetime itself when done well. <br /> <br /> This is the story of one man-killing id that has been constantly enlarged by machines. A dead race turned 200,000 years earlier. Along the way the plot brushes with 50's stereotypes and wheat so pure, you sometimes wonder why you look at it, but always do it. This is the best triangle thing ... yuk! It's Disney's cartoon still good, and the cartoon wallpapers straight from the cover of the Galaxy magazine, etc. Looks even after 50 years well. Robbie drives the car across the desert far into the distance, but it's a hoot! <br /> <br /> All in all, with all the flaws, the best of its kind and we should be grateful that such pristine pressure survives.
