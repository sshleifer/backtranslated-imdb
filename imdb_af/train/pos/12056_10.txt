While I loved beloved home movies such as Amityville and Poltergeist, it made a huge bunch of Hollywood horrors for TV adaptation of Susan Hills book packages. <br /> <br /> With a brilliant cast (much of what starred in Heartbeat and other TV dramas), great acting and fantastic surroundings (convincingly portraying the life of 1920), it has all the right ingredients to make attract viewer in what is a powerful ghost story. <br /> <br /> Herbert Wise doesn't need to have blood, violence or gore to send cold chills into the back of an audience. With your own imagination, the woman in black is a figure of fear and fear, and whose presence is never absent when she first appears. <br /> <br /> The main character, Arthur Kidd, a lawyer, learns about his invisible ghost on his mission to establish the estate. The widow dies and Arthur spends a few nights in her brave house in which he sees many peculiarities, which can haunt him for a few days. Some of the screens are very disturbing and claustrophobic, especially the closed room that opens itself up, eliminating the generator and blocking Arthur in the dark. The movie becomes more and more the more you put yourself in Arthur's shoes and his efforts to shake off this ghost. The author adds many cold additions to the story, an example of the tin soldier's repetition. One is eager to learn the meaning of everything. The fact that we never learn so much from the widow leaves the imagination more and more alarming. <br /> <br /> For the most part, the widow looks fierce and intimidating. The scene after the turn of the generator sent the cold chills to me, a woman who never appeared on an isolated wetland with a cry of wind? Even on such traits, I could appreciate how it isolates. And the scene in the inn was perhaps the most horrible thing I saw, one that I didn't want to see in a hurry or show to elderly relatives. I often woke up at night and thought she was behind me in my sleep. <br /> <br /> The black woman is a big TV movie and a lost gem. I agree to some extent that the internet hype for this movie has been completely overwhelmed and can see why people were disappointed after spending the best of Â£ 50, but I think the net has beaten hidden gems because it left movies like this make . I think it is still brilliant and fantastic and I consider it the greatest ghost story of the last century.
