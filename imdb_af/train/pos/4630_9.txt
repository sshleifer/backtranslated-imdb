This is the second Eytan Fox movie I saw. The fantastic actor, Lior Ashkenazi, who played in Walk on Water, also has a small role in this movie. <br /> <br /> But the real stars are the young Israelis living together in a small apartment. Noam (Ohad Knoller), Lulu (Daniela Virtzer) and Yelli (Alon Friedman); and the Palestinians who join and join them - Ashraf (Yousef 'Joe' Sweid). There is kind of a friend / sex in the city that is going on (mostly gay), and everyone just wants the war to end so they can continue with their lives in peace. <br /> <br /> But that's the rub. No matter how many posters you set up or how many raves you have for peace, the war won't end. Many have tried to bring the two sides to the table over the years, but they just want to keep it for some reason. There are many on the Israeli side, both there and here in the US, who just want everything and will not consider peace. There is a lot on the Palestinian side that would seem to be out of work if peace were ever to come. It is in no one's interest to end this war and the children suffer. <br /> <br /> Looking at this funny and engaging movie is always on your mind. It won't go away. You know something that will happen tragically and of course, do it. With the feelings on both sides running and revenge as a motivator, tragedy always happens, making it a mature version of friends / sex in the city. There is no superficiality. This is the real life, and it was a beautiful thing to see.
