It's a wonderful and unexpected movie. You start with a young person who hopes to enter the qualifying soccer match between Bahrain and Iran. If Iran wins, they will come to Germany in the 2006 World Cup. The problem is that the young people are a girl and girls (or women for the case) are not allowed to sit in soccer matches. What follows is a wonderful comedy, played with perfect skill by a small ensemble cast. The film explores the absurdity of the restrictions on women's freedom (and the young soldiers too). There are some excellent pieces, especially when one of the girls has to go to the toilet and of course the stadium has no toilets for women. The work of the camera is of the simplest and in some ways this story could be interpreted as a stage game. Yet it is the small scale that the film bites. Great theater? No, probably not; great entertainment - for sure.
