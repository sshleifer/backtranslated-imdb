The basic storyline here is, Aditiya (Kumar) is the spoiled boy of a millionaire, Ishwar (Bachan) who owns a toy industry. In Ishwar's eyes, his son Aditya can't do anything wrong. Aditya's mother Sumitra (Shefali Shah) warns Ishwar to bring his son on the road before it's too late, because Ishwar is a patient of lung cancer and has only 9 months to live. As his son and married to Mitali (Chopra), Ishwar Aditya is forgiven, but when the happy couple Aditya and Mitali come back from a honeymoon, Mitali is pregnant and it forces Ishwar to kick Aditya out of the house to make him more responsible to make. Aditya does not know that his father is suffering from lung cancer, and he does not know his father kicked him out of the snake to make him more responsible, Ishwar cannot bring him to high Aditya to which he is dying, starving and pregnant woman. it's a race against time so Aditya does everything he can to prove himself to his father and the climax comes when Aditya gets his big break in the movie industry and his dad tells him he's about to die. <br /> <br /> This movie is absolutely brilliant, it is the breakthrough in Indian film needed for the Bollywood industry. Shah's direction is almost flawless, but what movie has no flaws? The best part if this movie is the father's son relationship is a tearjerker. the song interludes are just put in the right time, the view is good, the only part where this movie fails, is where the jokes between Boman Irani and Rajpal Yadav are jokes too long and after a while they are annoying, but overall if it's a brilliant movie, I advise anyone. Read this review to review it, regardless of other reviews. 9/10
