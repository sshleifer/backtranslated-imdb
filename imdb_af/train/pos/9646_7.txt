There is definitely emotion between the two main characters exploring their relationship - one based mainly on physical attraction from the beginning. And there are also emotions in the inner workings of Mathieu's family relationship with his mother's problems - and how it will affect their relationship. But the problem is that it remains very unanswered (unless I'm just too stupid to pick it up). Why is Mathieu in a mental hospital? What led to the breaking of the boys? And the cutback between today and past is a little difficult to follow first. The main reason for this movie seems to be enjoying a little homoerotic mocking excitement, or a male nudity. But as a love story or character study, it is lacking and unsatisfactory.
