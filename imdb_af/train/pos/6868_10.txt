I saw it in Detroit in what had to be its original run. I literally rolled into the hallway of the theater. It was so funny. I didn't see it, but would love it. Where do you get a copy? Anyone who says it is dated or exaggerated is just a lot of poseurs to me. Every shit is either malignant, erotic or perverse hilaries. Everyone! There is not a bad one included. The opening sequence, for example, for parody 2001, contains gorilla go-go dancers with hanging breasts. Felinni would have filmed it if he were white to the wicked. If you come to this movie with an open mind and a quick heart, you will pencil it in your best list.
