I only saw the film on the cable five years ago and I couldn't stop sleeping. Everything about this movie looks like the storyline, the characters, the environment. Regarding the film, I wouldn't call it a good movie, but for what it is supposed to be, it's fantastic. It gets meaning over. The movie may be as good as ever in a comedy film. Corben Berbson, Fred Gwynne, Ruben Blades, and Ed O'Neil are hilarious. For those who haven't seen it, I'll give you a brief summary: Four criminals meet in a small town in Montana after receiving a letter from their friend over a bank head. But when their friend is arrested by two policemen who drove him from New Jersey, they try to figure out what is happening and the hell breaks loose. The movie is really a big banker comedy and is like a poor men's version of Oceans Eleven, with only four criminals who can't stand each other, and in Montana rather than Las Vegas. All in all, if I want to laugh, I strongly encourage you to see this movie.
