This short is a mystery. Words fail me here, as it is almost indescribable. Technically exceptional after more than 90 years (the footage is remarkable and sometimes varied). It is not something you look at if you have things that are commonplace or "normal" because it is most certainly not. It's a strange one, gang. Well worth checking out, but if things like Ren and Stimpy hurt your head, you can beat it over.
