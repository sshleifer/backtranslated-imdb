It is a collection of documentary documents lasting 11 minutes and 9 seconds and a framework of artists around the world. The documentary is variable and deals with all kinds of concepts. The only thing shared is 9/11 as a theme (very small in some cases). Some of the events are weak while others are very strong; some are politics, some are not; some are only about 9/11, some only use 9/11 as a theme to touch human universal feelings, emotions and tragedies. some are mainstream, while others are abstract and artistic). This movie has not been censored in any way by anyone, so the thoughts you see are very raw and powerful. <br /> <br /> It's a very controversial movie, especially for conservative Americans. I think two segments can really tickle the real vines (one from Egypt where a dead American soldier and a dead Palestinian bomber come back as spirits, another from the United Kingdom who tells the American backing of Chile on September 11, 1973) 50,000 deaths and abominable atrocities). The segment from Mexico was the strongest, telling the towers and the resulting death in a lively way (you have to see it to believe it). <br /> <br /> Although the final product is uneven, with some segments virtually "useless", I still recommend it. It is very difficult to arrange this film because the segments differ across the place (some poor, some very strong). I give it a score of 9 out of 10 simply because some segments were excellent and cover issues that are usually censored (Mexico segment, UK segment, Japan segment, Egypt segment).
