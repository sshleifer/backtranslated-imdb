I've always been a big Cybill Shepperd fan, since I saw her series a few years ago !! This film definitely shows her in her best light !! The movie was so beautifully cast and played !! She occasionally drops small, amusing lines, just to make this movie one of the best I've ever seen !! Everyone works for themselves! Especially Robert Downey Jr and Cybill Shepperd, they really made the movie true !! I also loved the little bit where Mavis lost her wig and she almost died when she fell on the floor !! This is the best movie!
