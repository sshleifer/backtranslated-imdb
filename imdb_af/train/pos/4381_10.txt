This versatile drama has it all: top speed, incredible photography, good story. This is often compared to "Braveheart" because both movies take place in historic Scotland. Although I like Braveheart, I think it's the best of the two movies. Jessica Lange delivered an incredible performance (had to be nominated for an Oscar). Liam Neeson is fantastic in the title role. Tim Roth plays one of the most bad, despicable characters in film history (nominated for an Oscar). John Hurt is excellent as Lord Montrose, another dishonest character. I'm always amazed at the incredible variety of characters John Hurt can play. It's a story of a dispute over money between Rob Roy and his tribe, and Lord Montrose. Rob Roy is a self-made man who will not solve his problems with Montrose if it violates his honor. Montrose, who inherited his title, has no honor. And that's basically what this story is about; Honor the ordinary man against corruption of the nobility. This movie is very entertaining, it has to appeal to everyone. It has romance, action, beautiful scenery, and has an exciting plot. One of my favorite movies.
