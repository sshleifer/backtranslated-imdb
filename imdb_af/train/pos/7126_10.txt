This movie responded to me on two levels. As a child I was evacuated from London and planted on unwilling hosts in a village. As I escaped the bombing and had experiences, hearing valuable memories (for example, a nightingale, singing a dark night for the first time) and enjoying a life I could never have in London, I have my family missed and worried about them. Tom is an old man whose wife and child are both dead and live alone in a village. Like an old man who is now without a woman whose children are married and live in another province far away, I am lonely again. . The boy's mother is a religious fanatic with many strange ideas to raise a child. Since a deep love between old Tom Oakley and this young boy has grown, Tom is looking for him and eventually saves him from very strange and dangerous circumstances. At the end of the story, there is a lot of tension as it seems as a result of a bureaucratic statement that the child is losing someone who has developed a loving relationship with him.
