This whimsical film had the accident of being released at the same time by the highly popular "Amelie". Both have played the wonderful Audrey Tautou the central role. Laurent Firode, the talented director, has one of the nicest films in recent memory from France. <br /> <br /> The film deals with the chance, as its English title suggests. The French title refers to how butterflies can create wings of chaos over the Atlantic as they fly, as well as hurricanes in the Pacific, something not to be believed by looking at these colorful insects. From the beginning, the director interprets all the characters one sees in the movie and how each one has a connection with the other, something that is hard to think, but in the context of the movie it looks good. <br /> <br /> A casual meeting at the subway sets the tone for the movie. Irene, who is going to work, is asked by the woman sitting opposite her to tell her what her Zodiac sign is and continue reading from her paper. Irene, it looks like it will cross paths and will find her soulmate the same day. After Irene left the train, the quiet young man next to the woman told her that he had the same date of birth as Irene. They seem to be destined for each other, but unfortunately they won't join the last frame of the movie again. <br /> <br /> Audrey Tautou is great like Irene. Faudel, who plays Younes, does not have much to the end, but he shows that he is present and plays his part well. The talented young film makes a valuable contribution to the success of the film, which is as light as butterfly wings. <br /> <br /> We are looking forward to future films by Laurent Firode because he appears to be a director with the heart in the right place and an ear to the way people are connected.
