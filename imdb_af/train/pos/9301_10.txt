I originally saw this very dark comedy about 2000 or so on cable TV. What a surprise and delight! Everyone is armed in this movie secretly! Dreyfuss plays the "mental" don (remember the New York shoe that had to be schizophrenic? Art mimics life or vice versa?). Diane Lane and Ellen Barkin are on their most beautiful and NOT playing! So prove that beauty and toughness go together! Then there is the big "bullshit" scene between Barkin and Jeff Goldblum (Rita and Mickey) where they verbally play the world "bullshit". This film is both subtle and bare. For all the shooting, it can be a very quiet movie. And you have the opportunity to see various actors in their final or near final roles. Joey Bishop. Richard Pryor. Henry Silva. It's not a movie for everyone. But if you like a movie that plays and moves many words without blowing everything in sight, it's the movie for you. Roger Ebert pours on this movie. He's wrong. THIS is a great fine movie! Maybe it's not just for Ebert. I see it as a 10 because of how good it is and how funny the script can be, while it's not really a direct comedy movie. I find it so nice that I bought it on DVD because it just isn't shown on cable TV. Now it's all mine!
