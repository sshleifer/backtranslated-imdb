I've seen this movie several times, and just saw it today (on TCM) because of Geraldine Fitzgerald. She is a very underrated actress and I have to admit that I have been in love with her since I first saw her (probably in Wuthering Heights 40 or more years ago). The real star in this movie, however, is Paul Lukas, and he earned all the awards he got. He makes it clear, whether we like it or not, that the end justifies the means. Naziism had to be stopped, and everything that helped was good. He gave his children a line to be bad and that they should not be bad, but as he said earlier when he talked to adults, he would do this thing again without hesitation. Luke gave an excellent portrayal of a man caught in this situation and made it clear that what he did was very difficult to do. <br /> <br /> Some people think his victim was a Nazi, but I didn't think so - I think he was only after the money. His next of kin knew it and so they didn't use much. <br /> <br /> One interesting point in the movie, and probably also in the play, is the fact that Muller (Lucas) is a German. While the anti-German hysteria of World War II is not repeated in World War II, there was considerable anti-German sentiment, and some Germans were in the same way as in California with people of Japanese descent. It was something of a brave act for Hellman to write a play about good Germans at this stage (perhaps she thought they were the ones who signed the Nazi Soviet Treaty!). The American and British air forces have bombarded the German cities and have no doubt about the death of innocent civilians. However, I think the Dresden bombing and fire storm happened later, after "Watch on the Rhine" was released. <br /> <br /> The title is something of a play, as the "look" looks west, from Germany. In fact, Watch am Rhein was a German army marching song - used in World War II, but the Nazis had their own marching song that was also used. But Muller is a German and he is busy with his own Wach am Rhein. <br /> <br /> All the other actors did an excellent job here. Although Bodo was too much, there are children like him. I'm surprised he didn't give up his dad's secret. In real life he can do it very well.
