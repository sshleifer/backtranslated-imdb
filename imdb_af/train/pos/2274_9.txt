Although I like Kurt Vonnegut, I'm not specifically interested in spy stories and I didn't know it. The only reason I watched it was Nick Nolte, who was one of my favorite actors since I saw "Breakfast of Champions" and "Hotel Rwanda". But the film made me a pleasant surprise. Of course, Nolte was big, but so was the plot. There were relatively few political intrigues, and much more focused on the moral question: by reading his anti-Semitic radio commentaries with hidden secret messages to Americans, he actually contributed to the general attitude of Germans (and, as it turned out later, Americans) to Jews of Hitler. What carries more weight, his service to his country or his unconscious contribution to anti-Semitism? The dilemma is even more prominent, as these words are never spoken, not even as narrative. Howard Campbell Jr. (Nolte) is a person who has learned to hide his feelings so completely that he does not open even in his memoirs. The inner conflict of such a character is almost impossible to portray - but with the help of excellent acting and photography, this film manages. <br /> <br /> There are other points to it, such as the humor or the ironic use of romantic clich√©s (such as the song White Christmas), which makes it really different from the average American movies. I recommend it to anyone who is bored with Hollywood spy movies.
