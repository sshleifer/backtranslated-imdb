It was wonderful. Once I saw the Japanese version, it was probably the scariest movie I have ever seen. It was not blood and intestines, it was ominous, atmospheric and scary. When the mother-ghost lent over the bed in the Japanese version, I almost had a heart attack. I was worried that the American version would be watered, and that Buffy would take away the dark, avid nuances of the original version. I don't have to worry. The makers of this movie wisely held the same Japanese people who were involved with the original movie, and gave the movie the same man. They also have it in Japan in the same place, in the same house. In fact, the Japanese director had pain to reproduce the same movie as it was in the original, the only difference being the decision of American actors. It actually became an advantage because it added the element of "strangers in a foreign country" to the complete horror. Not only were they haunted by an absolutely frightening and relentless ghost, but they also trapped in a completely foreign country that had problems integrating society. It just added to the overall anxiety built into the movie and I thought it was an excellent touch. <br /> <br /> Buffy does a very good job. She looks vulnerable and can convey her fear well. There is none of the clever aleck remarks that are so common to American horror movies, or one that detracts from the overall darkness and horror of the characters' situation. In fact, it was easily as good as The Ring, which I also thoroughly enjoyed. I hope the future of the US horror will follow, the Japanese New Wave of Horror begins with the incredible success of Ringu. We finally get movies that can actually be categorized as "Horror" !! 8/10
