This unhealthy silent jewel tells the true story of a POW escape during World War II. The performances are incredible, especially Anthony Steele. The film works on different levels: cerebral, emotional, visual and literal. The dialogue is ingenious and is very true. In fact, an unusual all-around authenticity places this one head-and-shoulder above most war epics.
