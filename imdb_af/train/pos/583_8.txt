In a small town in Montana, two brothers are growing up. One of them is Norman (Craig Sheffer), the other is Paul (Brad Pitt). Their father is Reverend Maclean and they grow up with his lessons related to religion and flying fishing lessons. In this movie, fly fishing represents life, a bit. <br /> <br /> The story is good and your attention, though there are a few moments you need to do a little action. Probably the movie has these moments because it's not really about the events that are happening, but about the message. Some things are already happening though. Norman goes to Dartmouth to study. After six years he comes back and becomes involved with a pretty girl named Jessie (Emily Lloyd) and he is invited to learn in Chicago. Paul became a reporter and is known as the "fishing reporter". He is well-known and seems to have a great life, but he drinks a little too much and plays too much. <br /> <br /> The movie is very well aimed, it has a good score and all the actors are good. The most beautiful thing in this movie is cinematography. The mountains, the forest and the river look very nice. If the movie was just made for these things, it was good enough to watch. Fortunately there is more.
