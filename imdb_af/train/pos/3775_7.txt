My Tasks: A good but imaginative mess. <br /> <br /> Keanu Reeves (yes! That Keanu Reeves) and Alex Winter return as the two punk-rock idiots in this sequel to the time-proud adventure comedy. BILL AND TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE, now a cult classic. In this sequel, Bill and Ted are much more to do than to travel through time. They can just as well travel heaven and hell! At the start of this sequel, Bill and Ted are preparing for a "Battle of the Bands" competition that makes them more famous than ever. Meanwhile, the time-wizard of the first movie (the ever-observable George Carlin) has for many years in a futuristic civilization a university that gave up Bill and Ted's names. There is an evil tyrant (Joss Ackland, from the HUNT FOR RED October), to get rid of the two idiot rock stars once and for all. So he sends out two identical Android replicas (in the words of Bill and Ted: Robot Us's) to do the dirty work. <br /> <br /> After that, Bill and Ted experience death and have to find hell, with residents including the duo's worst memories, and then through Heaven in an attempt to return to their friends. save ... and their performance. Along this exuberant journey, they play board games with none other than death (William Sadler, of THE HARD 2), reminiscent of a similar moment in the 1957 foreign film class THE SEVENTH SEAL, helping some intelligent alien help creatures and more. <br /> <br /> BOGUS JOURNEY's variety of exuberant special effects tricks are not up to date standards, and even some of the humor and pre-time look and feel are somewhat dated (to be honest, The movie also feels that it was released in the wrong year, even for the 90's. But with this no lack of imagination and a lively turn through both the show and the direction, BILL AND TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY is fun, imaginative and yes, scary. <br /> <br /> Rating: *** 1/2 out of 5.
