This is a good show, and will make you cry, this group of people really loved each other in real life and showed it time and time again. Email me and let's talk. I went to Australia and they really talk like that. <br /> <br /> I want you to enjoy Five Mile Creek and surrender these good stories of right and wrong and friendship to your children. I've had 40 episodes on DVD-R that I've collected over the past 5 years. See my Five Mile Creek tribute at www.mikeandvicki.com and hear the extensive theme music. Let's talk about them. <br /> <br /> These people are so cool!
