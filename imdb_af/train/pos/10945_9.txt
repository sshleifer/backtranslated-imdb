Best show since Seinfeld. She's really funny. Her total self-centeredness, the hankering gay stoner neighbors, the departure for songs or cartoons, make it the latest show on TV. One of the few ways I make to look. The scene with the wise old black lady in the drugstore ("Oh, wait for you to be close, you look old." Turn your finger and walk away lol), the cough syrup overdose, sleep with God, it's all so funny or so stupid it is just a lot of fun. The shows are bad points for her sister and police alone because they are too normal! I really can't wait for the next show, something I've never felt for any show.
