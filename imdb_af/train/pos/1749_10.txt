Steve Carrel proves himself as a leading man in this wonderful, original, fast breath of fresh air. I found myself hilarious about how brilliant it was. <br /> <br /> Basically, the film's title says it all: Andy Stitzer is a 40-year-old man working at an electronic store. He is a nerd who loves video games and comics, and has the largest collection. His counterparts working with him in the store find out that he is a virgin during a first-class sex-dialogue-filled poker game, and then Andy has to go through a pretty funny as hell. Excessive rude sexual awakening, but always upset that leads to him does not lose his virginity, but eventually he becomes happy. <br /> <br /> Leave the little ones at home, but take the whole family to see this wonderful romantic adult comedy. It will hook and crack you from the start, and by the time it is over you will wish you are wearing your extra-thick absorbent underwear. Only other thing I can say about it is too bad. Steve Carrel was not recognized as a abandoned man 20 years ago. He will definitely win the best breakthrough male performance in next year's MTV Awards. You can get your hard earned dollar on those people! <br /> <br /> I give this one a perfect 10!
