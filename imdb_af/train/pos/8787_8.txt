This film strengthened my opinion of Errol Flynn. Of course, while Flynn is best known for its savoir-faire and sprezzatura (to put in some high-falutine European terms!), This film offers him the opportunity to (please but slightly) act as an actor. a petty social climber with a big ego and a sense of nerve to fit. The supporting role is excellent; everyone looks well chosen for their roles. <br /> <br /> The story moves fast and, while not particularly thorough (it misses, perhaps deliberately, the opportunity to comment on the largely unequal distribution of income during that time), it is absolutely entertaining and satisfied. From what I know of Jim Corbett, the story is also fairly true to history. I also loved the great depictions of the 1880s San Francisco. All in all, there is little to keep from this movie ... well worth the time to see it.
