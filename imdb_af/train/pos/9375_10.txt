Before Nicholas Cage was a big action star, he was a good actor. This lesser-known film is where Cage delivers one of his best performances. "Red Rock West" was a low budget, almost unknown movie, but is one of my favorite movies of all time. I discovered it was running down the video store hallway, and wanted to see Cage and Hopper (also good in the movie) appear together. Go get this one, and I'm sure you won't be disappointed.
