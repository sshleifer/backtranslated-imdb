I watched the movie before reading the Michelle Magorian book and I both enjoyed it. The movie, more than the book, made me close to tears several times. This film touches the deepest points of the human soul and never lets go. I encourage so many people to watch this masterpiece as much and as soon as possible. I give it ten stars.
