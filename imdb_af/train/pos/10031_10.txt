Previously I wrote that I loved "Titanic", ended at his end (many times over), and I'm a guy in his 60s. I also wondered why this great movie, which has won so many awards and was applauded by so many critics, was only given a 7.0 score by imdb.com users. <br /> <br /> Well, I looked at the crash of user ratings. While 29.0% of all votes rated 10, 10.7% rated it 1. This 10.7% of these irrational imdb users have effectively pulled the overall score to 7.0. <br /> <br /> In my previous comments, I blamed this very unusual voice pattern (a sudden surge in 1 ratings, with a high 10 rating but only gradually and then suddenly turning and jumping on the 1 rating level) On just one thing: hate Leonardo DiCaprio. Believe me, I have had enough conversations to see young people (young men, mostly) who despise him left and right. They absolutely hate the man, and they will have no part to give him a "Titanic". (To answer another user: I am NOT talking about someone who likes the movie and has given it a 5 or 6. Everyone has their own taste and is entitled to their own taste. But nobody can convince me that the just 7.0 imdb score overall for "Titanic" has been so drawn to a modest number of ridiculous 1 ratings, is a fair reflection of the overall movie. <br /> <br /> Let me demonstrate my point by comparing the imdb user voice pattern of "Titanic" with 5 randomly selected locomotives and critical "bombs" (there are many more, but these 5 will prove my point). "Heaven's Gate" (1980) was quickly pulled out of the theaters after a very poor box was shown, and imdb voter ratings were: 23.2% 10 ratings and 9.2% 1 ratings (overall score of 6.1). Big Top Pee Wee (1988) has 4.3% 10 ratings and 9.9% 1 ratings (overall score of 4.5). "Cat People" (1982) has 6.1% 10 ratings and 2.6% 1 ratings (overall score of 5.8). "Blind Date" (1987) has 3.0% 10 ratings and 2.8% 1 ratings (overall score of 5.3). "Jumpin 'Jack Flash" (1986) has 4.4% 10 ratings and 3.7% 1 ratings (overall score of 5.2). WHAT HAVE ALL OF THIS FILMS COMMUNITY WITH "TITANIC"? All the percentages of their 1 rankings are lower! AS "TITANIC" AND NO OF THIS STINKERS IS NEVER FOR A SINGLE AWARD. Again, "Titanic" got 10.7% 1 ratings! Compare it to the other 5 movies I just mentioned. <br /> <br /> Could there be any other explanation than the Leo Factor Hate? <br /> <br />
