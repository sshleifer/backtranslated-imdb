It is in many ways a very strange HK movie. First of all, many of the action sequences are really not so much fun. The very first rifle battle in the movie is just stupid. Not cool silly, or even funny silly, but just stupid. That's not to say there aren't any big action scenes, but most of them just aren't on the level of some of the other movies I've seen. The opposite is that this movie actually has characters, not just people. All the main characters are interesting (except for the head bad guy, who is flat as a billiard table) and most are fairly well behaved. All the key players in this movie are just nice to watch. The dialogue is pretty witty and doesn't look much in translation. This movie is worth seeing, but I hope the unmotivated American audiences don't think it's the best HK to offer.
