* !! - SPOILERS - !! * <br /> <br /> Before I start it, let me say that I both had the benefits of watching this movie on the big screen and the "Authorized Version" of This Movie, which in 1997 by Stephen King self made. <br /> <br /> Both benefits have appreciated me for this version of "The Shining," more. <br /> <br /> Let me also say that I have read Mr King's book, The Shining, on several occasions over the years, and while I love the book and a big fan of his work, Stanley is Kubrick's story of this story much more compelling ... and SCARY. <br /> <br /> Kubrick really knows how to convey the fright of the psyche straight to the movie. Towards the film AND writing the script, himself, he got the title "Magus" out of the question. Kubrick's genius is like magic. The film world lost a good director when he died in 1999. Among his other outstanding credits are: Eyes Wide Shut, 1999; Full Metal Jacket, 1987; Barry Lyndon, 1975; A Clockwork Orange, 1971; 2001: A Space Odyssey, 1968; Spartacus, 1960 and more. <br /> <br /> The Torrences (Jack, Wendy, his wife and Danny, their son) live in the Overlook Hotel for the winter; Jack was hired as the caretaker. It is his job to oversee the hotel maintenance until spring when the Review reopens its doors during the hard months of the snow. There are many wealthy tourists who will flee to the Colorado Mountains for a snow-summer outing. <br /> <br /> The Hotel was an impressive piece of architecture and staging. It lent itself to the atmosphere by having a dark but at the same time "welcoming atmosphere" itself. The furniture and furniture was the entire period (late 70's - early 80's), and the filmography of the landscape entering the hotel into the opening scene is brilliant. Not only can you enjoy the approach to the Review, but it also determines in your mind how abandoned and secluded the Hotel is from the rest of the world. <br /> <br /> The launch of Wendy and Danny's characters was a stroke of genius. You get the whole story of their past, Danny's "imaginary friend," Tony, and the story of Jack's alcoholism all in this beautiful, neat introductory scene. There was no need to stretch history over two hours of the film; Of course, Kubrick saw it from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Closing time. Again, the picturesque ride on the mountains to the hotel (this time with a family in tow), the interaction between Jack and Danny was hilarious while also portraying a very disturbing exchange. <br /> <br /> The initial tour of the Review is quite breathtaking. Even if the "staff" exchanges things, you get the opportunity to see the majestic fire places, the high cathedral ceilings and expensive furniture, dormitories and cornice in architecture. "They did a good job! Pink and gold are my favorite colors." (Wendy Torrence) Even the "staff wing" is well designed and beautifully built. <br /> <br /> The maze was a wonderful touch, reminiscent of the Labyrinth in which the Minotaur of Crete guarded. When Jack Nicholson stands at the scale model of the maze staring at the center as Wendy and Danny enter, it's a magical moment; one who tells you right away, there is heavy energy in that house; something is seriously wrong, already starting. "I don't want to go there unless I've had at least one hour to find my way out." (The Hotel Manager) <br /> <br /> Scatman Cruthers, like Dick Halloran, was genuine and open in his performance. His smile was natural and his performance was wonderful. You can actually believe you are in the hotel, take the kitchen tour with Wendy and "Doc." His explanation of "the brilliance" to Danny was very well delivered, just like his conversation with the kid about Tony and the Hotel. It was credible and sincere. <br /> <br /> The cut and pan scan of the hotel itself, with the mountains being left behind, the cold air rotating, the fog coming from the warm roof of the snowy hotel, adds so much to the atmosphere of the movie. It also indicates the "half-to-hell" point, so to speak; the turning point in the film. <br /> <br /> Shelley Duvall's portrayal of Wendy Torrence was masterful. (So ​​WHAT if she also played Olive Oyl?! It just shows her wonderful diversity!) Honestly, before I saw the movie on the big screen in 1980, I said, "What? Olive Oyl? * Lol * (Popeye was also released in 1980.) But I took it back as soon as the movie started. She's brilliant. In this Fiend's opinion, it's her best performance to date! (Although I loved her in Steve Martin's " Roxanne "1987. <Br /> <br /> After setting up the pearl sheets of information you need the viewer to be: the Torrence's past, Danny's broken arm, Tony, the history of the Hotel itself, the fact that Danny is not "mental" but rather clairvoyant instead, and the general explanation of the Hotel, everything you get in the first 3 rows, the movie never stops you. <br /> <br / > The two caregivers of former caretaker Delbert Grady (the girls appeared to Danny several times, first by Tony in the flat v If the family ever came for it, icons that Danny could identify with, and of which he was scared, were at the same time. They chased themselves, and they did Danny how and how they killed in a rather graphic and material way. Kubrick's Tony was written as a guided spirit, like a spirit guide he obtained as a result of his arm almost cut from his body by his own father. He was ... "the little boy living in my mouth." He will appear at the end of Danny's finger and physically talk to Danny to talk to Danny. Not as in the book, I realize where Tony was meant by Stephen King to be Danny's projection as an older son, to save his father. Kubrick unleashed the small turn and somehow made it frightening when Tony "took Danny ...". The idea of ​​Danny's parent herself trying out her younger self is not ... scary. <br /> <br /> The "Woman in the Shower" scene, done by Lia Beldan (about whom I can't get any other credits because something was done before or later), like the younger woman and Billie Gibson ( who previously or lack of credits for works), was seductively offensive and disgusting. It was dramatic and frightening. Horrible and scary. When Nichsonson looks in the mirror and sees her decomposing flesh under his hands; The appearance of sheer horror on his face was so complete and real. Jack quickly began pulling from the jonesing alcohol to a certifying insane person. The deterioration of his character's spiritual condition is thoroughly and thoroughly documented by Kubrick. Jack's direct friendship with Lloyd the Bartender (as only alcoholics, would be spiritual patients and drug addicts) shows his urgent need for the atmosphere that Lloyd uses him; namely alcohol ... "hair of the dog that bit me." (Jack Torrence) In Jack's case, it's bourbon on the rocks, free to Jack. "Orders from home." (Lloyd the Bartender) Nice game on words. <br /> <br /> When Wendy find's Jack's "script" is nothing more than page by page of the same line, it is typed over and over again, albeit in 8 or 9 different creative styles. When he asked about the shadows, "How do you like it?" and Wendy whirls and shouts with the baseball bat in her hand ... is so attractive. That's the point where she realizes how devastated the whole situation is ... how messy Jack is. It is very scary, dramatic and provides a strong presence. This, along with Danny's hotel lobby views, fills with blood, imposed on Jack and Wendy's scene, and with the confrontational end of this scene, it may be the strongest scene of the movie. <br /> <br /> The "REDRUM" scene. Wow. What do I say? Which mother would not wake up by the awakening to see their young, upset son with a big knife standing over them and talking in that freaky little voice, calling out a "REDRUM" over and over ? Even if it had NO meaning, it would still be as scary as the 7th level of HELL. It was something everyone could (and did) remember. Speaking of unforgettable scenes ... <br /> <br /> Nicholson's final assault on his family with an ax may have been one of the terrifying scenes of film history. Its ad-libbed line, "Heeeeere's Johnny!" was a stroke of brilliance and is one of the most memorable scenes in the history of horror. It's also down in horror movie history. <br /> <br /> The end ..? Kubrick's end was perfection. I felt it ended beautifully. No smear, no blemish, no tear-idiotic ending for this movie. Just complicated perfection. That's all I will say in the end. <br /> <br /> Who cares what is taken out? See what Kubrick IN has. Hire it, look at it, buy it. It's a classic in the horror genre, and for good reason. IT RAWKS !! <br /> <br /> * I'm My * ... Take this movie and put it in your Stephen King collection, and take the 1997 "Authorized" version by King and paste it into the kiddie section. That's where it belongs. .: This movie is a 9.98 from the Enemy :.
