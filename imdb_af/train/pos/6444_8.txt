The line is, of course, of the Lord's Prayer: "Your will will be done on earth as it is in heaven." Sweden, especially the far north, is not my idea of ​​heaven - 30 degrees C The winter temperatures are a bit on the low side for me, but the good people who live there are undoubtedly believing in God's own country. <br /> <br /> The storyline here is well known. Award-winning international musician Daniel is interrupted in the middle of his career, returning to the village in northern Sweden where he was born. He is convinced by the local minister to help at the church choir, and makes an unlikely talent in class action, and they enter a match in Innsbruck Austria. There are echoes of the band players of "Brassed Off", the models of "Calendar Girls" and the dancers of "The Full Monty". But of course, he causes many emotional upheavals, as some of the more weakened villagers realize their value and rebellion against their oppressors. He faces hostile men and an increasingly dubious pastor, but nothing but death will stop him. <br /> <br /> Despite the somewhat crowny story, we learn many and many characters like humans rather than caricatures, despite the fact that many of them are recognizable types. I wondered if the woman clerk was not punished for so long. Sweden is one country in the world where such violence is pretty much discouraged (he was also a little young to be one of the bulls of Daniel's youth) and the Puritan pastor with a secret passion for girl magazines was a stereotype, but wonderfully realized by Niklas Falk. <br /> <br /> Michael Nyqvist is simply wonderful as Daniel, the weakened but driven musician, and there is also good music. I've been raped for the entire two hours. The end is what you make of it, but it's not spoiled to say that Daniel reaches what he wanted to do.
