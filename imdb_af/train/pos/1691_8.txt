This movie is funny and suitable for any age. It's definitely family-type entertainment. The film does a great job of playing people in the middle-western town of Big Bean, Illinois. Where we should assume that nothing ever happens, as the excitement (pre-invasion) of the decade is the new (and only) exit of the Interstate. The location appeals as annoyingly boring and totally unlikely to the Earth's invasion by Martians. But this Martians is totally incapable, despite being well-equipped with an arsenal of dreadful and deadly weapons ... including one set to destroy the Martians too! The Martians dip their lines and just throw the right accent to make us the viewers and the residents want to help them ... leaving the earth. J. J. Anderson plays the very young Halloween carnivorous duck has only good lines. Watch this movie for entertainment and entertainment; It's not thoughtful. But it is subtle and pleasant.
