Lily Mars, a small village girl living in Indiana, dreams of raising it on Broadway and her aspirations, is being lifted when successful Broadway producer John Thornway returns to his hometown for a visit. Lily tries everything she can to get Thornway to find her, but he is only very annoyed with her fraud. When Thornway returns to New York to set up his performance, Lily (unknown to John of course) follows and Thornway finally gives her a small role in his next show, but only as a favor to her family. However, Thornway is falling for this young child. girl and a romance flower, jealous of the leading lady of the show, Isabel Rekay. When Isabel gets excited with the John-Lily romance, causing friction with the show, she leaves, and John decides to make Lily the star. Isabel returns later, and Thornway has to tell Lily that she is back to her little role in the play, which can also endanger romance. Many charming film, and a refreshing change to see Garland, put the comic touch in her role (her reading of Lady MacBeth, while supposed to be humorous, never threatened her singing career). I enjoyed Heflin's character (Thornway) more when he was annoyed with Lily rather than being romantic. The film should be somewhat predictable and the scenes are not as well composed, but a very enjoyable movie. Rating, 7.
