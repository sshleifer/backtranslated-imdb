A Mouse in the House 'is a very classic cartoon by Tom & Jerry, true to their tradition but with their own jokes. It's hysterical, hilarious, very entertaining and quite amusing. Artwork is also of good quality. <br /> <br /> This short is not just about Tom trying to catch Jerry. Butch lives in the same house and he also tries to catch the mouse, because one cat will be in the house in the morning. And that's the cat that catches the mouse. "<br /> <br /> If you ask me, there are many funny gags in this cartoon. The funniest thing to me is, for example, when Mammy Two Shoes sees the two lazy cats sleeping and sarcastic:" I'm glad you enjoy the siesta "and she hopes they are happy because she doesn't blow the two cats. Another funny gag is when Tom disguises himself as Mammy Two Shoes, and beats Butch with a frying pan and Butch does the same trick to Tom. more funny than that is when the real Mammy Two Shoes appears and both (stupid!) Cats think they see each other as Mammy disguised and then they both fall to the back, of course she gets angry, and as soon as she gets angry, she is not someone to waste, but even Jerry does not win this time because he is also driven by her.
