In my opinion, the center of the film, especially the love center is a bit too long, but all the time you can imagine this desert feeling. But the best thing that made this movie unforgettable is the huge explosion pictures, their color, slow motion and the pink tidbits music is unique in movie history! <br /> <br /> Destruction in its stopper and popular shape.
