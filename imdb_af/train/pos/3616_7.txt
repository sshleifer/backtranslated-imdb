Casting unknown Michelle Rodriguez as Diana was a stroke of genius. She's perfect. Her acting inexperience actually works in her favor. We have never seen her before, so it really feels her story. She also transfers real toughness. However, it works against her because we never doubt her. You never have to be too courageous for her to win, because she will never fight any fighter. We don't think she can beat it. As a boxing movie, it fails. <br /> <br /> Then it's not a boxing movie again. How do you make a movie about a girl who wants to be a boxer who is not a boxing movie? You don't. But Karyn Kusama anyway. Like many indie movies, "Girlfight" denies classification or genre and stands on its own as folklore that can happen in real life. <br /> <br /> Diana is doing poorly in school. She hits people she doesn't like (for example, all the other girls in her school). She didn't fit in. Her father forces her child, brother Tiny, to learn boxing so he can defend himself when things get tough. He gives little money for his boxing sessions and gives Princess nothing, as if she should not defend herself, and nothing worth making her life. Tiny wants to go to art school (cliche, yuck), so he gives Diana his boxing allowance, which actually wants to box. Things get complicated when Princess falls for another boxer, Adrian (Santiago Douglas), who is looking for pro. From there, the story turns to the inevitable ... the two meet in the amateur title battle. <br /> <br /> What left me cold was that I never found this all interesting. It's all just a little too credible. Children with difficult lives growing up in rough urban areas are back to sports. Many professional boxers rose from these circumstances. The mental and physical toughness that this education needs, lends itself to a game like boxing, where anger is your friend. So this time it's a girl. Big deal. <br /> <br /> There is another position to take: finally, a boxing movie about a girl. Women's boxing has been around long ago. The cruelty we usually see in boxing movies is being replaced by conversations about people's lives and their feelings. The whole bakkie is used as a platform to paint a bigger picture. Respect. Overcoming adversity. Self-discovery. <br /> <br /> I recommend "Girlfight" because it has a good spirit and is an example of good work by a first time director. The dialogue never exceeds soap opera quality, but the story itself has actually changed my mind in some things. Yes, the world now looks like a better place. A movie did it. <br /> <br /> Degree: B-
