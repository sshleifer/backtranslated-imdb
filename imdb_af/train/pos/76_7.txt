Vincent Price's succession to HOUSE OF WAX (1953), the movie that confirmed its reputation as a horror icon, also turns into a bitter one? Although inventive? showman. Although a remake, the former (shot in Technicolor) remains the ultimate effort; who said, apart from some resistant comic relief, the compulsory retreat to cheap gimmickry (it was still a 3-D showcase) and occasionally recovered shortcomings (whatever happened to the missing bag that was thought to have arrived at a police headquarters that had a cut head?), it offers more than enough Grand Guignol-type excitement and overall camp value (praising it in a variety of disguise as an inventor of illusions that "missing" Stretchers depicting what made his genius use to stand on his own two. feet.

An interesting sidebar is the latter's adoption of a new detection technique, fingerprint, which is essential to accomplish Price's downfall (in a predictable but rather uncomfortable fiery climax)?

Looking at the star in a tailor-made role, does the movie come out a lot of fun? especially on a compact 73 minutes.
