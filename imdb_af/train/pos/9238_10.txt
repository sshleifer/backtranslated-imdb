Although others have commented that this video is just a modified version of the two shows: "Fire in Space" and "Living Legend". If you see the original, you'll find that the dialogue from this video edition is worked out. I found this video version much better because scenes and lines were added to it. I will tell you if you want to see the show in its original version, see the video versions on VHS. They have more to offer than the original episodes now on DVD. Another good video is Conquest for the Earth, which had more scenes from Galactica 1980 than the actual broadcasts themselves did. Overall, I consider it a 10 because it enjoys you more than the networks wanted to show in the time slot they gave the producers.
