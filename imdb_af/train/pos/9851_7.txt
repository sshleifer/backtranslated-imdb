Shrek, someone? Well, think Shrek in the ice age. Remember the end of Shrek? Because you do it. Now imagine, Shrek turns into a man, and so does the princess. Get it? Fun animation, actually, much more of a work of art like Pixar and Disney pictures, trying to get as close to reality as possible in their drawings. Strong one-liners, some social comments that children will not understand, the good guys win. One more thing: Scrat. By the way, how do everyone know his name is Scrat? 10/07
