Freeman is a good fit for this movie (as he was for "Driving Miss Daisy") and he is not only credible, but he gets a chance to change his image to get a character with reserved dignity and negligence. play. Although there are no guarantees in life, it gives anyone an actor a good opportunity to play different or unique characters that stand out to prevent stereotyping.

It's a movie that is well-directed and written by Brad Silberling. The location manager chose Carson, CA to set up the movie, and the location helps the tone and timing of the movie. <br /> <br /> Silberling was the "subcontractor" to make Freeman this movie, while the actor was between movie projects. <br /> <There is a good chemistry between Freeman and Paz Vega, a Spanish actress, and this makes an effective dialogue between each of the role players, who are diverse and come from different cultures. The film also encourages an understanding between people who not only speak two languages ​​(English and Spanish), but come from two different worlds of ethnicity, race, gender, norms, mores, beliefs, peoples, principles and values. The film strives for honesty and comes true to maintain the film's integrity. <br /> <br /> Part of the comedy is that Freeman plays an unemployed actor who has been out of work for four years. In fact, Freeman is so in demand as an actor he is constantly working on. <br /> <br /> The movie offers an adventure of bonding, caring, sharing, changing and exchanging.
