I'm sure it's a show nobody is so familiar with and can't think well; After all, it's almost near Baywatch Hawaii. With the cast, location, style of directing and its publicity ?? show women walking around the beach and everything. No wonder people have misunderstandings and decide not to see them. <br /> <br /> It was wrong to do so. Because after I decided to watch the show, there is actually more thing going on, real juicy story and conflict, seems very exciting to look at and pretty much ?? addictive. <br /> <br /> The story of the hotel clerks, the driver, the owner and their intricate love life. Also visit the tough hotel visitor and powerful man who is trying to steal the hotel. It's actually more exciting than it sounds here. <br /> <br /> I won't deny that the play sucks, but it's not that bad you look away. The story is not so consistent, but good enough. The soundtrack fits in well with the scenario and the action is all the time. I took a few episodes before anything really happened, be patient. <br /> <br /> Recommendations: I really enjoy it. Zillion Times Better Than Expected. <br /> <br /> Rating: 7.5 / 10 (Degree: B) <br /> <br /> Please rate my review after reading it, thank you.
