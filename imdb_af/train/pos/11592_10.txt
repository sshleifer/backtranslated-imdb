My son was 7 years old when he saw this movie, he is now on a Russian fishing boat and said that the movie he was most impressed with and who had already lived in this thought is the movie of The Legend of the Son and the Eagle. He asked if it was possible for me to get it for him. I'm sure many things are going through his head, because he has only 3 hours of daylight and he is on the ship for 3 months and will have another 3 months before his contract expires. Since we have Indian blood, he joins this movie. On January 27 he will be 47 years old and I would like to get this movie for him. He lives in Thailand and has been a commercial fisherman for the past 17 years. As we all know, this is one of the most dangerous jobs. Can you help me get this movie? Thanks in advance, Dolly Crout-Soto, Deerfield Beach, FL
