The original movie, The Odd Couple, features some great comics. The whole world looks like the story of neurotic neat freaks Felix Ungar and funny, unpleasant, slobbing Oscar Madison. This companion of mismatched homemakers has created one of the most successful TV series of all time, as well as countless, not nearly as well as counterfeit, imitations. <br /> <br /> The Odd Couple movie has wonderful jokes about Oscar's apartment and its messy habits. He says, "Who wants food?" One of his poker player friends asks, "What have you got?" Oscar says: "I have brown sandwiches and green sandwiches." "What is the brown?" It is also a very new cheese or very old meat! "I also love the line about Oscar's fridge." It was two weeks out of service, I saw milk that didn't even stand in a bottle! "There is no doubt that Walter Matthau's Oscar Madison is delighted to watch the screen. He is almost as good as Jack Klugman's TV show version. <br /> <br /> The film is Jack Lemmon's Felix Ungar, Jack makes a lot of, very, honest effort, the problem is that he makes Felix SO depressed and wiped out to be annoying as comics Tony Randall's performance in the series brought the character of humor, warmth and sensitivity to Felix's character, which lacks Lemmon's depiction, Tony's Felix Unger can of course be annoying, but in the TV series it relates to specific situations where the annoyance in the storyline needs Jack's Felix Ungar (watching the different spelling) in The movie never seems to be happy, fun, or interjection. The movie Felix Ungar is a roommate who drives you all the time. <br /> <br /> The movie still has good moments wasting the test of time stand, the "well-known" meat loaf is one of the greatest scenes ever! One of the other good examples of Felix's "small notes" on Oscar's pillow will be remembered forever. However, there are a few dark sides where Oscar goes upstairs, she "cries" near the end after blowing out Felix, and a scene with Felix's Linguine dinner (though relieved by a funny line.) Looks more depressed as comics. br /> <br /> Perhaps there wasn't enough time to see the lighter side of these characters making the series so memorable in the movie. The start 20 minutes is very boring. The same problem occurs with Felix's conversation with the Pidgeon Sisters. The film's end is predictable and too pat. There is very little care or compassion for each of them by the other. The result is that the darker side of the film leads to depression and anger, rather than comedy, unless you watch the big screens described above. It seems that Jack Lemmon's monotone Felix persona puts the film down, rather than enhancing or embracing the comedy between characters. <br /> <br /> It really took the 1970's TV series to make the Odd pair the best it could be. The original movie is still very good. However, the TV series is much better.
