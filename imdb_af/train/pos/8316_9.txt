I watched this movie every chance I got back in the seventies when it came out on the cable. This was my introduction to Harlem, who has fascinated me since then (and Bill Clinton). I was still very young, and the movie made me feel great. It was great to see a movie about other young girls growing up, deciding who they wanted to be, and making bad choices, as well as good ones. I was delighted by Lonette McKee's beauty, the great dresses they eventually had to wear and the funny dialogue. If someone is also raised by a single mother, I really could identify with these girls and their lives. It's funny, these characters look almost more real to me than Beyonce Knowles!
