The US Government does not want us to see this movie because they have a beef with the Iranian government. But this shows us just how civilized Iran really is, despite the content of the film, which focuses on women's struggle for equal rights in the simplest terms: the ability to watch a soccer match on the stadium, which is strict is limited to male audiences only. The film is hilariously funny, and in itself is evidence of freedom of speech and expression in Iran. I enjoyed this movie intensely. Five girls are trying to border the police at the ticket gates to a soccer match between Iran and Bahrain. The upcoming comedy is too funny to describe from the bus ride to the stadium, to the interceding of the police and the subsequent detention of the girls to the resulting end. Don't miss this classic movie. This is a MUST see. One of the best foreign films I've seen in years.
