Seeed this movie for the first time and enjoyed it thoroughly. I am a student of screenwriters and I loved how the minor characters intervened just when something critical / climatic happened in a scene. <br /> <br /> I thought the dialogue was very sharp and the premise of the story is quite shocking. At a specific point, Barbara Stanwyck openly bursts with her daughter's boyfriend; And again passion in her husband she didn't see in ten years AND with the shooting signal 'two shots and then one' she quit her old Shag mate Dutch (the reason she left the village in the first place!) ALWAYS ALSO! The moral majority had to be totally indignant when they saw this movie back in the 50's. <br /> <br /> Keep the costumes and cinematography and the straight of the hip dialogue - just to see Barbara Stanwyck and Co what the 'Bunny' Hug 'is good enough to rent this movie on DVD. <br /> <br /> One of the best films of that time I've seen long ago.
