It is written in stone that Disney animations should simply be musicals. Right? Where? Show me. Because I found this effort to be much nicer for ~ containing the hokey five-year-old standard Disney musical prize. <br /> <br /> While the story was not as surprising as it could have been, it was pretty good, enjoyable and adventurous. I was hoping for a little more, yes, considering the subject, but this movie is not the bitter disappointment or total failure it is complaining to be. <br /> <br /> The animation quality is average, but the dialogue is very compelling, just like the story line, plot, subplot and wonderful creativity I found in this production. I will remember to describe the plot as it did and done, but this movie is worth seeing if you are a fan of fantasy. <br /> <br /> It's in my opinion the best Disney Animated Feature Length Movie. <br /> <br /> It's a 9.4 / 10 of ... <br /> <br /> The Enemy :.
