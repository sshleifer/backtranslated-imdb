Watch this movie on its release and have preserved it since then. What a wonderful group of actors (I always find the decisive one of the most interesting aspects of a movie). Actually, dramatic actress Jacqueline Bisset in this role and Wallace Shawn always enjoy a hoot. The writing is clever, clever and tongue-in-the-cheek, almost everything "Beverley Hills". Love Paul Bartel's doctor and Ray Sharkey's slave. It was racial and rough, but thank you! Unless you are a prude, I highly recommend this movie. FYI for anyone who wants to play six degrees from Kevin Bacon, Mary Woronov and Paul Bartel were in Rock & Roll High School. Mary Woronov and Robert Beltran were together in the Night of the Comet. They were all three in "Eat Raoul".
