The 1967 In Cold Blood maybe more like "the right thing" (Think about it: do we really want to see the right thing?), But it was black and white in a color world and many didn't even know what it was, and there was an opportunity to revive it again for television. Plus, if you do it, you can show things that aren't shown in the original. The book In Cold Blood by Truman Capote was the first "non-fiction novel". Truman's book was actually not 100% of the true story. I thought the Canadian place applied Kansas very well for a TV movie. Search for the elements of sex, drugs and rock'n'roll: Dick's wife, Perry is an aspirin junkie, Perry plays blues guitar.
