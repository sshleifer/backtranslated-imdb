A great 90's flick! Parker Posey is fantastic in this story about the nightlife in Manhattan that requires so much money. Posey gives a wonderful performance as a librarian and a nightmare. It's a good, light movie for Saturday night before going out. The soundtrack rocks, the outfits are from this world, the writing is funny and the actors do a good job. The Redeeming Value: You can make it in this world if you try, just find your niche. I believe Parker Posey is the PERFECT actress for this kind of character: young, fabulous and broken. (You need to watch the movie "Clock watchers"). If you look at Party Girl, you are obliged to have a good time. Enjoy it!
