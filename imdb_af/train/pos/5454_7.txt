It is one of the most daring and most important of the so-called "Pre-Code" movies made in Hollywood in the 1930s. Unlike some Pre-Code films that occasionally drove into subjects that could never be allowed after 1934-5, this film fully immersed itself in a very bad, entertaining plot from start to finish. The conventional morality of the late 30's and 40's was definitely NOT evident in this movie, as the film deals mainly with a female woman who sleeps her way to the top - and without excuse along the way. These "broad" both had sex and used it for every man who could help her get rich - something you've never seen in movies made just two or three years later. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with Barbara Stanwyck working in her father's speakeasy. In addition to her boss, he is also her pimp and encourages her to sleep with a local government official so that he can work the illegal bar with impunity. Although it is not very clear, it seems that Daddy has long "leased" his daughter's body. <br /> <br /> But after being raped and attacking the man by breaking a bottle of beer, his skull, Barbara has enough and heads to the big city. It doesn't hurt that she's still blown up and killed her father, but her feelings that she's had herself been fornication and had nothing to do with it, seems to be the impetus. <br /> <br /> Despite the Depression, Barbara uses sex to get a job at a big mega bank. She starts off with a beautiful human work as a file clerk, but instead of just like a few weeks, she sleeps from one job to another to another, until she sleeps with the head of the couch. . and his future son-in-law !!! All this ends in a tragedy, but Babs doesn't seem to be shaken by the death of these two men. In fact, later, she can initiate herself in the life of the NEW CEO and once again she is on top (perhaps more than one). <br /> <br /> So far it's a great movie because it was so eager and uncontrollable. Barbara played a 100% sociopath - a woman with no morality and no conscience - just a desire to get out of life as much as she can do what she has injured in the process. The brave writers and producer, however, "pulled out" and thought it was important to make a saving end. Since this woman was so angry and confusing, her change of heart at the end was a great disappointment and greatly detracted from the film. In many ways, it reminded me of the termination of Jesus Christ - like a wicked man in one way or another, seeing the light and changing in the unconvincing conclusion. <br /> <br /> My advice is to look at RED-HEADED WOMAN and DOWNSTAIRS. RED-HEADED WOMAN is much like BABY FACE but doesn't have a magical transformation at the end - the top lady is really a skunk deep! In DOWNSTAIRS, a movie much like RED-HEADED WOMAN, the roles are reversed and a man (John Gilbert) plays a similar royal character. Both are classic and a little better than this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is an amazing curio of a short period of often extremely bad Hollywood movies and in this light it is worth seeing for Cinephiles. Also fans of The Duke take note - John Wayne plays a very small role in the film and it is very unusual to see a very young Wayne playing such a conventional role.
