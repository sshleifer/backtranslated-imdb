It's My Bush is a live action project made by South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone. The show was canceled after one season, not because of bad reviews (it actually got good reviews), but because it was very expensive. It's my forest It is nowhere as good as South Park, but it is a very funny spoof of a sitcom and also a pretty good political satire. It's a very funny spoof of an average network TV sitcom. It is also a political satire. guy who is playing in it is my bush much like him! If you can find the show, look it out. There is a lot of laughter to have! <br /> <br /> 9/10
