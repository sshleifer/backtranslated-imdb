Since Douglas MacArthur hit more human lives for the better? As any other American non-elected president, he earned a better movie biography. Not that Universal's "MacArthur" is bad. This is not all it should have been. <br /> <br /> Strangely, the potential was there. From the early "Star Trek" section "The Corbomite Maneuver" (1966) to recent HBO films "Something the Lord Made" (2OO4) and "Warm Springs" (2000), director Joseph Sargent appeared as one of the most explicitly human directors in film, a man who can subtly form the emotional shadow of his actors' performances and apply the audience exactly where he wants them to go. The producer, Frank McCarthy, also gave us "Patton" (197O), the legendary Jerry Goldsmith played both films, and Universal has the fact that the film was "four years in preparation and production". Yet MacArthur is perfect enough and not much more. <br /> <br /> The movie starts early in 1942, shortly before the beleaguered general was ordered by President Franklin D. Roosevelt (Dan O'Herlihy) ?? to flee the Philippines to avoid the Japanese catch. So, this movie leaves: <br /> <br /> · MacArthur's birth in 188O in a border barracks in Arkansas is still subject to attacks by native American members? thereby determining that his remarkable life is the distance from bow and arrow to nuclear weapons; <br /> <br /> · West Point graduation ceremony? first in a class of 95, <br /> <br /> how he joined his famous father, Gen. Arthur MacArthur joined (who earned the Eredienday Day at Missionary Ridge in the Civil War) on missions in Japan, China and, most importantly, in the Philippines; <br /> <br /> · His heroic exploitation in the 1914 excursion to Vera Cruz; <br /> <br /> · how he jumped like a scapegoat over the trenches of the First World War, often wounded and promoted with a blinding speed to the Brigadier General; <br /> <br /> · its post-war service as West Point's latest and most progressive? Commandant; <br /> <br /> · Participating in Billy Mitchell's court in 1924; <br /> <br /> its routing of the Bonus makers in 1932; <br /> <br /> · Its efforts to maintain an army-underfunded army as head of state in the early 1930s; <br /> <br /> · Retirement of the US Army to become Field Marshal (!) of the Army of the Philippines; <br /> <br /> and reactivating his commission by FDR shortly before the outbreak of World War II. <br /> <br /> All this has been left out in favor of MacArthur's long-lasting footage trying to fight off marine disease while being evacuated by a PT boat, so we know that "General Mac" is a legend, but not why; Nor can we appreciate why the allegations of cowardice are so wounded by "Dugout Doug" and so apparently unfounded. <br /> <br /> The rest of his career is currently straight: His island hopping "Hit" em where they are not "campaign, fulfilling his promise to the Philippines" "I will return!" crown performance, winning peace in post-war Japan, then the difference of opinion with President Harry Truman (a dignified Ed-Flanders) about the actions of the Korean conflict that led him to shoot straight, and finally, his proclamation to Congress that "old soldiers are simply blurring," which he has just done, already quite historically accurate, and everyone has a very deliberate lack of comment. <br /> <br /> Sargent and the producers almost painful of decorating the historical record with their own approval or disapproval, and if MacArthur's actions are noble, they will be presented as such; if they appear selfish or bombastic, they will comment on the belief register. is quite knowledgeable about its g how to manipulate their reactions subtly, see Warm Springs? This refusal to comment looks pretty deliberate. Historically, it may be commendable, but it almost succeeds the viewer to place this extraordinary man in any rational perspective. <br /> <br /> Lastly, there is a kind of "made on the cheapest" feel to the movie, because there is "Midway" which is released about the same time. Both films were diverted to television directors - Sargent in this case, Jack Smight on "Midway," and both have a TV look. Even Jerry Goldsmith's march, while serving perfectly, lacks the subtle undertones and the grandeur of his Patton theme - just another way a larger-than-life man is remembered by a very ordinary movie. <br /> <br /> There was nonsense and pettiness in this man, indifferent; There was also greatness and love for him or for him. He must admit that MacArthur did what no military commander did for him. He won the peace. <br /> <br /> In the end, "MacArthur" One likes so many movie biographies. It's a good place to do research on this remarkable man, but a bad place to end it.
