A remarkable documentary on the landmarks performance of the Women Lawyers Association (WLA) of Kumba, in the southwest of Cameroon, in the legal protection of the rights of women and children against acts of domestic violence. In this Muslim culture, where, according to Sharia law, men were always sovereign over women, one can put the trouble of introducing secular legal rights for women and children. After 17 years of unsuccessful attempts, the WLA leaders recently played a few victories and the aim of this film is to share these victorious stories. <br /> <br /> The leaders of this legal reform movement are Vera Ngassa, a state prosecutor and Beatrice Ntuba, a senior judge (juristic person). Both play themselves in this film, which can spontaneously contain imagery, but I think many of them, if not all, consist of subsequent recreation of real-time events for the camera. Four cases are being reviewed, and all claimants play in the movie. <br /> <br /> Two cases involve repeated women battles, with violent sex in one case; The other involves forced sex on a 10-year-old girl; And another relates to the repeated reports of a child, age 8, by a aunt. One of the beaten women is also seeking divorce. We follow the cases of investigating complaints to the outcomes of the trials. The outcomes in each case favor women and children. The perpetrators receive tight prison sentences and / or fines; the divorce is granted. <br /> <br /> The aggressive aunt's prosecution shows that these female legal practitioners are indeed gender-neutral in enforcing the law. Also worth noting is the respect with which all parties, including those found guilty, are treated. This is a very important and well-made film. (Importantly, one of the directors, Longinotto, also provided the 1998 film, divorce, Iranian style, related to related themes in Tehran.) (In broken English with English subtitles).
