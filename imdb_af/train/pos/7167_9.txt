I couldn't comment after reading the very short "Not Bad" comment. This movie is much better than just not bad. The acting is stars, even the role-playing kids, who don't play cute or anything else, but just like my son's friends. The movie is clever and expects the audience to be so good. The double flashback story lines are imaginative and add to the story rather than act as a time-lapse. I watched this movie with my children and I looked at it a few days later. If you have children and are sick of killing movies that inspire a diabetic coma with their syrupy sweetness, then watch "Holes." My 6-year-old enjoyed it as much as my 11-year-old and my husband and I enjoyed it as much as the two. How many movies can you say?
