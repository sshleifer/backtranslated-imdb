My 10/10 rating is just for the fun factor and assume you decided to keep "High Slaughter" even before you watched it. Yes, this is the typical revenge-a-year-after-a-dirty prank story, but how do you not like the things they are pulling here? I couldn't have predicted that bathing place in a million years. OK, so maybe we can be cynical and say that this movie is nothing new. Well, it doesn't matter. This is the kind of movie that the characters in "Scream" probably watched, and this has contributed to their rules on how to survive a horror movie. Who doesn't like watching people suffer to do these things? Obviously, this is kind of a reactionary undertone, as people are punished for doing what the 60's advocate. But still you must love these things! So, with excuses to Don McLean, this master didn't sing for the king and queen!
