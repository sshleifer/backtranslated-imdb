I saw this movie in shine. <br /> <br /> It's probably one of the best movies of all time. It has a timeless value, you can get so much from it, it's great. There are parts that move, funny and just as big. <br /> <br /> All aspects are up, the representation of the story is perfect, every detail is 100% really, even small Irish subtleties are covered. <br /> <br /> Using low and high shots gives two good views about Cristy (look out for it). <br /> <br /> Daniel Day-Lewis's performance is incredible. I've never seen an actor do it. It's really great. <br /> <br /> And it's so nice to look, it's flowing so well, it's probably the closest thing you can get to really experience. I love it. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen it, you should see it. There is no doubt about it, there is something for everyone.
