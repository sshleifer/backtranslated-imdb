This is one of the funniest movies I've seen. I watched it on DVD, and the disc has no special features or even a menu, but it's not necessarily what I care about. <br /> <br /> Depending on whether it's a large studio production or a smaller movie, I tend to rate movies on a case-by-case basis. It's a smaller movie and I'm willing to forgive little things. It says I believe it has one of the most imaginative and original titles I saw. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the acting of all the big players. I especially enjoyed Til Schweiger and Alan Arkin. Alan Arkin has most of the funniest lines. The character portrayed by Claire Forlani may be unrealistic for some people, but I personally got real people with emotional problems who look very much at life's decisions, as her character does. It helped me pick up the nuances where her pain can come from the finer of her humor. <br /> <br /> It's not a movie for kids, but of course it's not about free sex and nudity. There is a bit of adult language, but sometimes it can be very funny. (In particular, Alan Arkin's character, who can't even swear correctly.) <br /> <br /> See also the cameos of well-known character actors.
