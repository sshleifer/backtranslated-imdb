This is an amazing Amicus horror anthology, with 3 fantastic stories, and fantastic performances, just disappearing the last story. All the characters are great, and the movie is quite cold and exciting, plus Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee are simply incredible in this! It is much underestimated and my favorite story must be 3rd, "Sweets To The Sweet", plus all the characters are very nice. Some of this is predictable, and the last story was incredibly disappointing and pretty slim! But the end was really cool! It's an amazing Amicus horror anthology, with 3 fantastic stories and fantastic performances. Only the last story is disappointing! I say it should see! <br /> <br /> 1 Story ("Method for Murder"). It's a wonderful story, with a lot of tension, and the killer Dominic is really creepy, and it also performed very well! It was the perfect way to start a story, and for the most part it is unpredictable, plus the double twist is shocking, and quite creepy! Grade A <br /> <br /> 2nd story. ("Waxworks"). It's a sturdy story with great performances, but the end is pretty predictable, but it is rather creepy and has some tension. Peter Cushing did a wonderful job and I couldn't believe how young Joss Ackland was. , I really enjoyed this story! Grade B <br /> <br /> 3rd story ("Sweet Candy"). This is the best story here, as it is extremely creepy and unpredictable, it also has a good turn! Christopher Lee did a wonderful job, and Chloe Franks did a wonderful job as a young girl, plus the end is quite shocking! I don't want to spoil it for you, but it's one of the best horror stories I've ever seen! Grade A + <br /> <br /> 4th story ("The Cloak"). This is a terrible story that is very poor, and Jon Pertwee irritated me, but the end surprised me a bit and Ingrid Pitt was as good as ever, but it's just boring and has been done many times, plus where was the creativity ??. Grade D <br /> <br /> The direction is great! Peter Duffell does a great job here, with fantastic camera work, big angles, a little creepy atmosphere, and keeps the movie at a very fast pace! <br /> <br /> The Acting is awesome! John Bryans is wonderful here, as the narrator, he had some good lines, I just wanted him to have more screen time. John Bennett is very good like the Det., And was very intense, he was especially good at the end! I liked him very much. Denholm Elliott is excellent as Charles, he was vulnerable, showed fear, was very nice and I loved his facial expressions. Joanna Dunham is beautifully beautiful, and did well with what she had to do as a woman, she also had good chemistry with Denholm Elliott! Tom Adams is incredibly creepy as Dominic, he was creepy looking, and did the job very well! Peter Cushing is wonderful as always, and is wonderful here, he is nice, focused, charming and always has a lot of class! (Cushing Rules !!). Joss Ackland is fantastic as always, and looks so young here, I barely recognized him, his accent was not so thick and played a different role. I loved it! (Ackland rules). Wolfe Morris is creepy here and did what he had to do well. Christopher Lee is incredible as always and is incredible here, he is incredibly intense, very focused and, as always, he had that wonderful look on his face. He was especially amazing. at the end! (Lee Rules !!). Chloe Franks is as rich as the girl, she is somewhat creepy and has one of the best children's appearances I've ever seen! I loved her. New Dawn Porter is beautiful and excellent as a babysitter, I really enjoyed her! Jon Pertwee irritated me here, and was rather slim, and totally unfunny, he also has no chemistry with Ingrid Pitt! Hadn't. Ingrid Pitt is beautiful, and does her usual Vampire thing and does it well! <br /> <br /> The rest of the role play is good. Overall a must see! **** out of 5
