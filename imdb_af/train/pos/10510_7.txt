This is an OK adjustment, but not as good as the TV version. The actors are generally good, but I got Jeremy Northam quite wet as Mr Knightley found, especially when compared to Mark Strong in the TV show. Gwyneth Paltrow is OK and her English accent is pretty good, but I chose Kate Beckinsale's Emma again. There are excellent support achievements from Toni Collette, Juliet Stephenson and Sophy Thompson. <br /> <br /> The script is often played too much for the laugh, the book is a comedy, but there are too many pieces of gags here, and the Frank Churchill subplot is almost completely absent. <br /> <br /> My biggest criticism is the scenery. It's too lazy. England has never been like that. It looks like a chocolate box. Only Americans will do this. <br /> <br /> Despite this criticism, I enjoyed this movie, but I would recommend the TV adaptation more.
