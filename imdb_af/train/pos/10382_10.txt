As with all the other reviewers, this movie is constantly in my mind after 30 years. I remember going to the library and exploring everything I could about this story. I even wrote to the PBS station for more information. In spite of everything, I could only find out that it was a story printed in a newspaper in the early 1900s. <br /> <br /> Quickly to 2002, after years of ebay looking for a weekly basis and there it was a VHS copy of the movie. There was another bidder, but I was determined to win this movie. The rider wrote me to ask for a copy I gave her. Despite owning a copy, I still searched and searched to finally find a site that sold a DVD copy of the movie. You can find it at: http://www.johntopping.com/Harvey%20Perr/War%20Widow/war_widow.html
