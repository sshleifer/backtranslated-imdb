The 1930s. Classic, elegant Adele (wonderfully played with dignified action by Debbie Reynolds) and bitter, frumpy Helen (the beautiful Shelley winters will use a wippo wacko with her usual histrionic panache) are the mothers of two killers. They leave their seamige past in the Middle East and move to Hollywood to start their own dance school for aspiring chicks. Adele begins with the dashing millionaire Lincoln Palmer (always fine Dennis Weaver). On the other hand, religious fanatical Helen quickly falls into despair and madness. <br /> <br /> Director Curtis ("Night Tide", "Ruby") Harrington, who works out of handy Henry Farrell (who wrote the book "Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?" was based on and wrote the script for "Hush ... Hush, Sweet Charlotte", leading a complex and compelling psychological horror thriller about guilt, fear, oppression and religious fervor dangerous to amok. The super-throw has a ball with their colorful roles: Michael MacLiammoir as a turbulent evocative teacher, Agnes Moorehead as a strict fire-and-sulfur stone radio evangelist, Yvette Vickers as a grinding, excessive mother of a bitter wannabe kindster, Logan Ramsey as a snoopy detective, and Timothy Carey as a creepy bum. An extensive talent review featuring Pamelyn Ferdin (Lucy's voice in the "Peanuts" TV cartoon presentations), which serves as emcee and original "Friday the 13th" victim. Robbi Morgan who impresses an evil dead Mae West qualifies as a definite highlight. David Raskin's haunting score, a fabulous scene with Reynolds performing an incredible tango in a nice restaurant, the tasteful depression-era atmosphere, Lucien Ballard's attractive cinematography, and especially the exciting macabre end, is also excellent. and effective. MGM offers this fantastic jewel on a fine DVD double file with "Whoever Tantie Roo?" Both photos are presented in sharp widescreen transfers with their theater trailers.
