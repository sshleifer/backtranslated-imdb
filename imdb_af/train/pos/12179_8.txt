I watched this movie by chance at the flickering channels a few days ago. My expectations were not very high, but it was an interesting movie. In a Guy Thing, Jason Lee Paul, a live, Seattle-based fellow who is about to marry and settle with his fiance Karen (Selma Blair), plays on an inconspicuous middle-class household. We meet Paul for the first time at his baccalaureus party, where he does not desire to encourage any of the normal baccalaureus-type activities that she (surprisingly little) encourages, if he is a bit naughty and in trouble touch and quarrel. Of course, the next thing Paul knows, it's the morning after night, he's in bed with a naked hula dancer, and his mother-in-law calls to let him know that Karen is on her way. Oh, and the hula dancer is Karen's cousin Becky (Julia Stiles). <br /> <br /> Of this little acorn of potential trouble grows a mighty oak of frenetic accident, as Paul is unpleasantly attacked, trying to cover what he did while he looked the appearance of a conscientious, family-oriented good guy who is excited about his upcoming marriage letters. His attempts to secure Karen do not remain the wiser about any potentially wrong things he obviously requires, but approaching Paul closer to the love-loving Becky, forcing him to ask if he really wants life that looks like him . The film contains the right mix of comedy and romance. Worth a watch.
