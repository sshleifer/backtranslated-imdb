I went to the cinema with two of my friends and picked this movie out of the hat without knowing what to expect. And it turns out a very pleasant, dying experience! It is an excellent movie with many unexpected stories, very good dialogues and crazy humor. Of course, all characters are made in the Alan Ford (Italian satirical comic) style, but it didn't bother me for a moment. In fact, this kind of loser bums has a movie that is unique and interesting. Sam Rockwell also has a very good and convincing role, Willian Macy, Clooney barely recognizable and brilliant. But true star is actually Guzman. In this role he played a role in his life! The scene when his character Cosimo dies in the movie is so hilarious that it stopped me and almost died with him! Highly recommended for all "Alan Ford" fans!
