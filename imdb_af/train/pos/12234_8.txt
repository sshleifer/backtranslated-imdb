First of all, anyone looking for meaningful "out-of-mind" cinema that embraces a kind of social message with meaningful actions and soul-searching dialogue spoken by dedicated, emotional, sad peoples, please go away now. You are wasting your time and life is short, looking at the new Brangelina Jolie movie, enjoying a good cry, going out and buying a hybrid car or throwing your conflict diamonds off if it makes you feel better and leave us. <br /> <br /> Don't let the door get you on the road either. The UNBREAKING MEAL is a grade B minus local abomination-epic shot in the Oklahoma desert by a young, TV-friendly cast & crew, awakening himself with an astronaut exposed to bizarre radiation effects. a hospital and find that his body is flowing on him while sitting there like a bunch. The meltman is played by one Alex Rebar, who is recognizable over the first four minutes of the film. But once he starts oozin 'with Rick Baker's extraordinary special effects make-up, he looks more like something you might have spotted in a can before wiping all the running, viscous beans of fat. <br /> <br /> The movie has zero outline and no bandies with plot points: There are a few scenes where scientific types are being driven on an absurd industrial transport machine that conscientiously has some mandatory lines on the effects of radiation but the movie doesn't care. It's a freak show and a wonderful one with a particularly sick sense of humor for those who can stomach it. One big laugh comes when the smoker stumbles upon a young girl in the forest and has such a loss doing that one of his eyes protrude. Hilarious. <br /> <br /> The "hero" of the film is played by Burr DeBenning, a fascinating character actor from the 1970s and 80s television station similar to an early model for the Kevin Spacey prototype; slightly twisted, neurotic and one step ahead of most everyone in the room, even though he looks confused. He appeared just after this movie was made in a bizarre made for TV anthology horror piece called HOUSE OF THE DEAD (or the Alien Zone) which is considered one of the best movies ever made in Oklahoma, where I suspect this movie was made too. The arid, cold rural Midwest provinces are certainly the same. The crayfish that an unlucky flying fisherman chooses for his afternoon of sports, seems to be the same as Cameron Mitchell in NO WARNING. a sick sense of humor, a TV-friendly throw, and some beautiful outrageous gore. At least I realize at least an aesthetic connection between the three movies, as well as the SILENCE OF THE LAMBS which is not surprising since director Jonathan Demme is part of MELTING MAN's role. <br /> <br /> Essentially, as others pointed out, it's a 1950's B movie plot updated for the later 1970's special effects and the inevitable boobs. The movie probably borrows most of its ideas, is PHANTOM FROM SPACE with Peter Graves as an astronaut who also returns to Earth after being exposed to funky radiation effects leaving him on a deadly spree. One of the things I really admire about the film is that there is absolutely no regard for the melting man's motivation. He simply goes on a rampage and the movie's drama comes from the question of whether he will fall before certain characters fall victim to his madness. The film's budget is also wonderfully low and every dime spent on it is on the screen, Rick Baker's disgusting effects to get the lion's share of everything spent on it. <br /> <br /> Sick, disgusting fun, the best Enjoy with a crowd of friends and lots of beer. Why can't people make movies like this anymore? <br /> <br /> 8/10
