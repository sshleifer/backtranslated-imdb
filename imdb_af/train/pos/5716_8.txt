Didn't see any of the Japanese Grudge movies, but I really enjoy it. I rarely get to watch movies. I can jump, if the effect and sound are vivid enough, but to be afraid of a movie, it is rare for me. But I was afraid of Grudge. Maybe because I didn't expect anything when I looked at it. I didn't expect to be scared. I didn't know anything about it either. That was probably a good thing. <br /> <br /> It's a movie that you believe or love or hate. Most people seem to be comparable to the Japanese Grudge movies, but although I haven't seen it, I don't think it's right to actually compare any movie. This film is on its own. <br /> <br /> The story is weak, most people say. I do not agree. The story is minimalist and so deliberately done. The storytelling techniques used, such as the broken time frame, are perfect. The director knows exactly what he is doing and I believe he has his vision as he wanted it. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 8 of 10. It's a movie you'll enjoy watching or hating. It's as simple as that.
