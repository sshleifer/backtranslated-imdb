The Human Tornado is a 70s campsite Blaxploitation movie starring Rudy Ray Moore, which plays its biggest role in the morning. The film tells the story of Dolemite, a bad ass pimpin 'hustler who falls asleep on the wrong side of a white, racist sheriff with his wife. Dolemite barely escapes and travels to sunny California to visit an old friend, a nightclub owner (and Dolemite's "ladies"), Queen Bee. However, it appears that a competitive nightclub owner with Mob connectors is trying muscle on her racket, so Dolemite does business in her own hands. Rudy Ray Moore shows numerous diverse talents in this landmark film, including strong dramatic skills, a mastery of Kung Fu, an impressive singing voice (he gives two songs on the soundtrack), a touch of compassion for the ladies and a general compelling charisma and fine sense of comic timing. This movie has it all, people: a deep plot, blister, a minute comedy, beautiful distressed women, a slam-scared end ... what more can you ask for a movie? Walk, walk, go to your local video store and hire the Human Tornado today. And be sure to share it with your family.
