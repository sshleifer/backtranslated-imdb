The Womansman is funny, with a wide variety of roles, as well as some very stupid but excellent scenes (including the funniest love song ever written). <br /> <br /> Ferrell is his usual quality in a brilliant syrup. <br /> <br /> Tim Meadows plays an idiot surprisingly well and wrote himself the funniest lines you'll find in any comedy out there. <br /> <br /> It's definitely worth a purchase like watching it every 6 months, so you'll still be laughing as hard as you did the first time. <br /> <br /> I am betrayed to think about writing this that it's a mere 4.7 / 10 and I encourage you to vote! <br /> <br /> Remember children - "There is more movement in the sea"
