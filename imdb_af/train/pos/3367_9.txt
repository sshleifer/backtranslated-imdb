This movie has great acting, good photography and a very strong story line that really makes you think about who you are, how you define yourself, how you fit in, or accept to play or break free ... There are already excellent comments on these aspects. I would like to comment on the formal drafting of the film. Actually, it's two people on a roof. There is unity of place and time, with 2 main players and the radio acting as choir. Many directors have changed Greek tragedies into film. Many directors have filmed contemporary stories as if they were a Greek tragedy, but no director, in my opinion, admirable as Ettore Scola managed to approach the purity and power of the great Greek tragedies. in story line and formal setting. N masterpiece.
