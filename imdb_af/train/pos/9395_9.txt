If you keep plot turns, it's your movie. It is impossible to predict what will happen next moment. Nothing is as it seems or ends as you think it will. The characters are all eager and tempting. Cage is at its best. Dennis Hopper shows his beautiful sinister side again. JT Walsh is perfect in his last performance. Laura Boyle blows. Dwight Yoakum makes a movie debut excellent in a cameo. I categorize this movie as "I have a really, really, really bad day" movie. Not a slow minute in this movie. A real sleeper. This movie is underestimated and unfortunately overlooked.
