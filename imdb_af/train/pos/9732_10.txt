How to lose friends and alienated people came out in 2008. It bombarded the US cashiers. It's an absolutely hilarious movie with a great role to play. Simon Pegg is great to play Sidney Young, who wrote the book: "How to lose friends and alienate people." I know this is not a real story. The only way I know is that Sidney wants to go with an actress Sophie Maes. Maes doesn't exist, but otherwise the movie can really be. How to lose friends and alienate people is probably the funniest movie of 2008, and I think you should definitely see it. As I mentioned earlier, the film has a fantastic movie including: Kirsten Dunst (Spider-Man, The Virgin Suicide) Danny Huston (The Number 23, 30 Days of the Night) Gillian Anderson (The X-Files) Megan Fox ( Transformers, Confessions of a Teenage Dragon Queen Jeff Bridges The Big Lebowski, The Vanishing) Overall, how to lose friends and alienate people, is hilarious. I think Simon Pegg and Kirsten Dunst work well together, and I think you should see it. Although there is a strange nudity, including Trans-Sexual, This is a hilarious and wonderful comedy. One of Simon Pegg's best. <br /> <br /> The Plot: Sidney Young, a journalist from England, travels to New York to work at Sharp magazines. As he meets there, he meets an actress named Sophie Maes and tries to sleep with her before his boss does.
