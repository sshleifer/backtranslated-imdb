A group of friends decide to take a camping trip in the desert. They found themselves dead and killed by a mysterious killer in a black pickup truck. "Mirage" is of course inspired by Spielberg's Duel and Craven's "The Hills Has Eyes". These abrasive yarns offer many nasty violence and gore. The movie's gory highlight is a sequence in which a man with his arm and leg chained around a tree chained and then disbanded his limbs when the chain is pulled by a truck. There's also a bit of tension and some exciting stalk-and-move sequences. The acting is pretty lame and the writing is pretty poor, but the movie is fast and shocking. The painters playing the villain are pretty threatening. desert places give a little atmosphere and the gore is quite strong. Generally, if you like low-budget horror movies, give this one a look.
