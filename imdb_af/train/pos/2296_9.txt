_ Actors_ is the absurd story of Jean-Pierre Marielle waiting for a cup of hot water, the story of a conspiracy against actors, the story of aging actors whose careers are less active than they were earlier, but a incredible tribute to French actors and their theater. <br /> <br /> Supported by a solid reflection on theater and acting (the fourth wall, the hidden cameras, playing or not playing), the story of this movie in which most of those famous actors play Their own role (not to be mixed with their lives in front of the camera - the movie is not voyeur) is pretty vague and follows the actors in a series of episodes that make the movie quite amusing. As Andr√© Dussolier leaves the movie and Josiane Balasko leaves to play his role (great actress, his hilaries are serious, especially when she taps into Dussolier's role on herself), as actors run on each other in the street and request signatures. and gossip, we recognize the pastels of other scenes in which everyone (or others) played. <br /> <br /> Actually, for anyone who doesn't know the actors (most of them are at least in their 50's) or not known, this movie has less interest as most of the referrals will be missed but it will still provide good reflection on aging, on acting, on public life.
