Popular radio narrator Gabriel Niemand (Robin Williams, whimsical and silent, hypnotic tones) is known and friends with a fourteen-year-old son from Wisconsin named Pete Logand (Rory Culkin), who wrote a book describing sexual abuse of his parents. To start, Pete has Aids and it further forces Gabriel, as his partner Jess (Bobby Cannavale, well) is a survivor of HIV itself. <br /> <br /> He also acquires himself with Pete's guardian, a woman named Donna (Toni Collette, brilliant!) and when Gabriel decides to meet and talk to both of them personally and go to Wisconsin , he'll discover some secrets he obviously wasn't prepared to find. <br /> <br /> Based on real events that happened to Armistad Maupin (who wrote the script with Terry Anderson) and led by Patrick Stetner, this movie moves a lot faster (90 minutes, maybe a few minutes longer) than one would think a movie of this genre would run. That's good, because it keeps the action and the storyline leaning and clear. It's bad because it leaves several holes in the plot and doesn't suck up any of the plot openings or back story. I'd rather not go into great detail except to say it, if you are not familiar with Mr.Maupin's works or his personal story, you feel a bit out of the loop here. Nevertheless, the performances by Williams (I would love to hear more of his story personally), Collette, Cannavale, Culkin and many of the supporting role players (the servant in the Collete's Donna restaurant, do a good job with whatever small part she has!) and the mood here is established - namely the cold, lonely dark exteriors of Wisconsin and New York - providing a wonderful framework for this story. It may end up not coherent, but it is still a compelling story to keep up with.
