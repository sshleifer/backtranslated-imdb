"An album of songs so old, everyone thinks they're new." This movie has the elusive combination of tempo and mood that sets some movies apart from the start. And why not? Taking talent from Lady Judith Dench as a widow who plays saxophone with a street musician to help him get the songs right, to Olympia Dukakis as the cheerful widow living in a Scottish castle on the maintenance of her many marriages, to Ian Holm as a drummer who loved all the members of World War II all the girl (more or less) swing band. But wait, there's more. Add Leslie Caron to bass, and the incomparable Clio Laine, and Blonde Bombshells is the hottest band in England since the Beatles. Well, okay, not really, but this movie is a winner. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth (Dench) spent the whole movie reuniting the Blonde Bomshells to play with her granddaughter's school dance. And before you roll your eyes, you think how difficult and courageous it would be for a bunch of sex-married women to stand on stage before the Britney Spears generation following an act called "Open Wound." In an age when actresses are over by the time they are 30. Most of the band's second album is a biggest hit and music more than a month old has almost no chance to play. It's great for real talent, real music and an I love this movie, and I know I'll see it much more time and enjoy it every time.
