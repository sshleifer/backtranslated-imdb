It has always been one of my favorite movies, and will always be. Over the past few years I have become a 50's / 60's Sci-fi freak, and try to collect all the better ones that were made at the time. I love many of them how moody they can be, how technically correct some of them were. The big colors and the sets also let me go. It's a pity if they make some of these good old movies again; they almost always make it together. Just look at the recent repetition of the day when the Earth has become quiet, it is completely rubbish! Forbidden Planet is one of the standard feature films of all time, and now they are trying to make it again, and I shake to think how the new one will be! Some things, like fantastic classic movies, just have to be left alone to be what they are, classic examples of great efforts to tell simple stories and give people in the process. As soon as they add all the techno-crap we have available now, the movie looks nothing more than the Hollywood sausage factory, nothing special. By the way, I see that the astronauts' uniforms in Forbidden Planet were also used for the "Queen of the Outer Space"! It just tells you that the budgets were a bit lower back then, didn't they? Hi, less money and better movies, hmmm .... Great performances in this movie by Leslie Nielsen, in a serious role, and Anne Francis, Walter Pidgeon (who has always been one of my favorite actors), Earl Holiman, and of course Robby the robot! <br /> <br /> The special effects are fantastic, and the storyline isn't too far-fetched. It's a great sci-fi experience!
