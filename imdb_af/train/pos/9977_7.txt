SPOILERS BY: <br /> <br /> I'm really in the minority on this one, but I like this movie. It's not a classic, but it's definitely involved and quite an adrenaline-driven ride. I definitely thought it was worth at least a 7-rating. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the reason I liked it was because I didn't see the original. Something tells me that with a movie like this it will be the strongest fans the people who haven't seen the original version and thus have little to compare it to. It wasn't a masterpiece, but I got a lot of it and it actually made me see the original. <br /> <br /> There were a few things I liked about it. One was the decisive Kowalksky. Viggo Mortenson was excellent and brought a lot of charisma to play. Since most of the movie fell on his shoulders, he really had to be great and he was. It was a big part for him. <br /> <br /> Another interesting thing about Vansishing Point was the fact that it was made for television. I had no idea this was the case when I looked at it. It looked like it was a big movie and I would never guess it. It wasn't a big screen release. <br /> <br /> I also found the story to be very absorbent. I'm not one for action movies, but I sucked in it. Plus, it was much more than an action movie in that there were drama, mysticism, a love story, strange people, whatever you did. (I didn't even recognize Priestly.) And it was touching. It wasn't a good movie, but it was watchful. <br /> <br /> Then there's the end. It punches a strong punch and if you have been involved in the story so far it is very difficult not to end. I'm not sure how I feel about the end. The implication was that Kowalkski survived and although I am highly skeptical about HOW it would be possible, it is a movie and realism is not an ingredient that is always in the mix when a movie is made. <br /> <br /> So I will have to say that I found the end incredibly unrealistic, but very much touching in a manipulative way, which I am usually, but for some reason, almost forgiven in this movie. Of course, there were many props for the plot (could the villains be more stereotypical?) But the creators had a lot of justice, even though they did have many things wrong. Having said this, I will admit that I can understand why someone who is a big fan of the original hates this version, because I've seen all the original movies, but I loved it with horror to return results. (My great aversion is actually prosecuted.) But I can understand the low ratings if the original is of such high quality. <br /> <br /> People compared it to Smoky and the Bandit. How about a road release of "Legends of the Fall" also "Thelma and Louese"? I certainly feel like both movies (both of which I am a fan of.) But I don't think it was a good movie. It was better than average for me, but far from big. But it was an absorbing, adrenalin-fueled, touch film with excellent casting of the main character. My vote is 7 out of 10.
