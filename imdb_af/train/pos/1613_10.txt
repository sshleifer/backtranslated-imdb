This movie is still favorite. Just a pretentious, humorous moron won't enjoy this wonderful movie. This movie feels like a cut hot apple pie covered with French vanilla ice cream! I think it's Cher's best work ever and her most credible performance. Cher has always been blessed with charisma, beautiful looks and a particularly thin figure. Whether you like singing her or not - who else looks like Cher? Cher definitely made her mark in the entertainment industry and will be remembered for a long time after others have come. She is one of the most unique artists out there. It's funny because who would have thought of Cher as such a naturally gifted actress? She is mainly above the so-called movie "stars" of today. Cher is a true actor on the same level as Debra Winger, Alfre Woodard, Holly Hunter, Angela Bassett and a few others, because she is never 'acting', she really becomes convincing. She earned more than the respect of her peers and the film audience. <br /> <br /> Everything about Moonstruck is wonderful - the characters, the scenery, the dialogue, the food. I never get tired of watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Every time I see the scene where they are all sitting at the table at Rose's house, I break the distance to see exactly what delicious food Rose is. serve. I saw the spaghetti, mushrooms (I think), but I can't figure out if they eat ravioli, ziti? What is the main course? It looks great and it drives me nuts! <br /> <br /> Everyone in that family was a hardworking individual and respected and cared for one another. The grandfather was not set aside and patient, he was an important part of the family and he was listened to and respected for his age and wisdom. He was also a beautiful, healthy, independent old codger. <br /> <br /> Loretta's mother wasn't "just a housewife", she was the glue that the family held together and was an example of what a woman, mother, and house manager should strive to be . She was proud of the lifestyle she chose, but she didn't define who she was. High-powered businessmen aren't as comfortable in their skin as Rose Casterini. Notice the bad way she said, "I didn't have children after I was 37. It's not over." You had the feeling that she was the kind of young woman who did exactly what she wanted and went away without the other person realizing what had happened. She was charming, quickly witted and very clever. What a great mom! <br /> <br /> I didn't really like Loretta like Loretta, because she looked like a bit of a know-it-all who wasn't actually so adventurous and in control of herself as she wanted others to think. She could tell others about themselves and where they went wrong, but she didn't really apply common sense to her own life. She is going to marry a middle-aged mum's son simply because she wanted a man and a sense of identity and purpose for her life. She was more conventional than her own mother. She put on her hair and behaved like a matron at a house of detention and was humorous and bored, but under you felt she was vulnerable and lonely and had a lot of love to give the right man. She will probably eventually make a wonderful mom. <br /> <br /> I could see in the future, a house full of Loretta and Ronnie's loud, screaming happy kids and Rose and Cosmo enjoy every minute of it.
