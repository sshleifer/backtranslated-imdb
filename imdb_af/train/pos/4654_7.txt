It's about an eclipse, Peter Ustinov, who infuses a British company, Texa-Conn or a similar infiltrate, acting as a computer worm and security expert. He secretly learns to catch up with the computer, collecting the admiration of his boss, Karl Malden, the hostility of his office rival, Bob Newhart, and the love of his unknown secretary, Maggie Smith. <br /> <br /> Some of the business details were a little dark for these non-business-oriented eyes, but they are credible enough and I have the general idea. Ustinov, the brilliant Peter, establishes false businesses in Paris, Rome and Stuttgart, and uses the Texa-Conn computer to send all kinds of money to these ersatz institutions. Of course, the overseas companies consist of nothing more than themselves, Ustinov, and the addresses are an abandoned artist's loft in Paris, a hairdresser in Rome and a bakery in Germany. He simply visits them to collect the checks he sent himself. <br /> <br /> I didn't think I'd like it for the first few minutes because it looks rather on the slow side. I expected something with a faster pace and more indignation, according to the lines of The Pink Panther or The Lavender Hill Gang. But this movie inserts itself into your good grace if you appreciate the underestimated humor in the plot, the characterization and the dialogue. <br /> <br /> It would probably be a bad idea to get too many of the relatively subtle gags, but here are some examples of the more observable ones. <br /> <br /> Ustinov to Secretary Smith: "Let me have the assets of these companies." Smith: "Assets? What are they?" Ustinov: "Little female donkeys." Now nothing is made of this little exchange. There is a quick cut and no lag for any laugh, which is appropriate because your reaction is more likely to be a smile as a laugh. <br /> <br /> Ustinov is looking for that crummy air in Paris. It is covered with cobwebs. Stones were littered and some of the former occupants' paintings were left behind. The landlord does not speak English and Ustinov does not know French. Ustinov points to a childish painting of a naked woman and chuckles, "Ah." N Fam Fye-tal, eh? "Landlord is crying too," replies, "Vous le prenez pour une anee?" Ustinov: "Oh, old, this is her name!" Tenant: "Oui?" Ustinov: "Entente cordiale!" (Mes amis, if I have wronged those generations, you are not right.) Bob Newhart as Willard Gnatpole (!) Have the hottest times for Maggie Smith and plan to run her home but tell her he is the "itinerary "take. There is an immediate order of suggestive traffic signs. "Please." "Lay-By." "Give way." "Yield." End up with the deadly "STOP / CHILDREN." There is another montage when Ustinov's scheme is about to be discovered by the board - cloudy roofs, police cars, a farewell to Maggie, ending with a plate: PRISON, Wurmbosse. <br /> <br /> Well, maybe one more. I still can't come across Malden as boss, and definitely say: "I never make decisions about decisions," smeared a handful of pills and washed it with a glass of water. <br /> <br /> The play is impossible. This is Bob Newhart's best role, for example. Not that he had so much, and not that his series is not limited, but he is perfect in this part. Of course, the musical score by Laurie Johnson made a lot of effort. She wrote a short concert for flute. Ustinov's passion is music and his overseas institutions are under the banner of fake names like Claude Debussy and Giacconino Rossini. Stuttgart's fake president is someone named Schmidt, and he is an anomalous vowel. Maggi Smith is beautiful, sexy, bourgeois, and doesn't seem to be as stupid as she looks. <br /> <br /> Nice, in its own quiet way, but don't expect comic fireworks.
