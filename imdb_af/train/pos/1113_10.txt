Sandra Bernhard is a very character, and certainly one of the funniest women on earth. She started as a stand-up comedian in the 1970s, but her big break began in 1983 when she stared in the presence of Jerry Lewis and Robert De Niro in Scorsese's underrated masterpiece, The King of Comedy. However, her film career never really started. She made some strange but entertaining pictures, such as "Dallas Doll" (1994) or "Dinner Rush" (2000), but the most amazing parts were the ones she created for her. <br /> <br /> "Without you I am nothing" is undoubtedly her best effort. This is an adaptation of her smash-hit off-Broadway show that made her a superstar? and Madonna's best friend for about four years. In ten perfect choreographies and plays, Sandra turns from Nina Simone to Diana Ross, talks about her childhood, Andy Warhol and San Francisco, and performs songs known by Burt Bacharach, Prince, or Sylvester. Director John Boskovich got Sandra to perform a 90-minute performance that is both sexy and uniquely funny. If you're a Bernhard fan, you can't miss this movie; It is also a tribute to her (strange) beauty about her extremely unconventional talent as a comedy. And this has influenced filmmakers in their work ?? "Hedwig and the Angry Inch", for example, would look very different if "without you I was nothing" did not exist.
