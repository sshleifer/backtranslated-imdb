While on the internet for previous sales prices, I commented on this. Why are they all so serious? It's just a movie and it's not pornographic. I got this short film from my parents 30 years ago and have always been completely satisfied with it. I showed it to many of my friends and everyone loves it too. I feel privileged to own this original 1932 8mm black and white silent movie from Shirley before becoming popular or known. After reading the other comments, I agree that the movie is "racy". Great story! I just wish it was longer. It seems that I am the only person who sells one of these original, at least, so I wonder how much it is worth?
