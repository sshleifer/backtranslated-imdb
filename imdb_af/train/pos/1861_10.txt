... intimate and specific. Yes, a bit of a cinderella story, but only after very winding turns, deserves deeper and deeper in Antwone's psyche. Only superficial performance can condemn this film as superficial. These are the things that heal nations, this is one of our great national stories. Antwone's path to emotional health includes a whole series of family history, the history of slavery and its aftermath. In his first affirmative effort, I hope for the first time that Denzel Washington once again confirms that he has a real beautiful mind and soul.
