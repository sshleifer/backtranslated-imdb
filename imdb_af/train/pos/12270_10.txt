I've been searching for this movie for years, apparently it's not available here in the states, so I bought a copy of Ebay. <br /> <br /> Four young hunters and three of their girls are looking for bush in the bush and looking for a bear who apparently killed several campers. What they find is an old Vietnam veterinarian who has gone mad (killing his victims with a long metal fingernail glove and la Freddy Krueger). Once the night falls, one of the girls goes to a short conversation with her boyfriend, she dies. After one of the group found her body, they all pitch in their tents and wait for daylight. As soon as the sun rises, everyone tries it out, but one by one. <br /> <br /> Seven bodies, not very gore, but some good killings, especially the girls, are dying. The guys are being killed on somewhat bloodless moons (inflated in the car, shot dead, knife by head). <br /> <br /> Overall, INFERNAL TRAP is a nice slasher movie of the late 80's. Nothing new, just done well, fast and beautiful women. 10 out of 10.
