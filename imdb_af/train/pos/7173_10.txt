I just watched the documentary "Fog City Mavericks" on the Starz cable TV. This is without a doubt one of my best viewing experiences ever! It chronicles the San Francisco Bay area artists and creative talent responsible for the best of the best movies ever made. In addition to the famous artists, t also includes segments with Irvin Kershner, Caleb Deschanel and a segment about Pixar Animation Studios. I hope it will be released on DVD. It is a must have for any collection of cinema history and brilliant films. If you are even interested in movies remotely and the people they create, you won't be disappointed.
