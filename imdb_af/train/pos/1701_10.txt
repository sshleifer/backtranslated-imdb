It's a fool's silly movie. If you do not expect Star Wars and enjoy British humor, it can only be a cult classic for you, as it does for my wife and I - the voice of Cary Grant and Jack Nicholson as martians to the over-simplistic population from the Big Bean, it is a movie that you can sleep or watch carefully and somehow enjoy. <br /> <br /> It's not for everyone, but if you enjoy humor, taking a quick mind to see the joke. as it slides through you, this movie will enjoy.
