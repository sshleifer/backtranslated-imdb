Excellent film that reveals how people are connected with the taken for granted, ordinary beads that exchange during Mardi Gras. The film is much more than a comment on globalization. In fact, it humanizes the workers in China, the owner of the factory, the bead divider in New Orleans, and even the revelers in New Orleans. What stands out most is the directing ability to tell a difficult story with intricate details in a simple and seductive way. His wonderful access to the factory is another aspect that is intriguing and I just wish I knew how he got inside. It is a beautiful story without sentimentality or guilt associated with it, and the conclusion offers hope without making people feel alienated.
