<br /> <br /> Charlie Kauffman has made strange metaphysical fears, but this Canadian jewel makes it hilarious. <br /> <br /> Like most foreign movies, the less said, the better it is, but let's set the scene. Two friends Anthony and Dave have been meeting since childhood, they can't handle the world and ultimately means they no longer have to. But this is where even more problems begin. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie, it made me smile after the final credits and it is a rare experience with so many mass-produced pieces "nothing" out there. <br /> <br /> Don't miss this one. <br /> <br />
