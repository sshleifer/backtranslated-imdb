Savvy, gentle talk of Steven Spielberg was his first true business in this genre. A departure from his normal adventure / fantasy cost paved the way for his 1993 success, "Schindler's List". <br /> <br /> Based on Alice Walder's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, the story relates to a young girl's regular hardship for a cruel evil farmer and her painful separation from her beloved younger sister Nettie. While the plot - about compassion, abuse, and the power of love to heal all wounds - is often powerful and moving, it loses its way through the failure of continuity and Menno Meyjes's script. The color press is sometimes difficult to follow and one or more occasions tend to be a bit erratic in terms of time frame. This lapses in the essay cost the viewer the depth and detail clearly in Miss Walker's novel. A real shame that Maestro Spielberg could not solve and correct these problems, as most of the shows are a wonderful example of his ability as director. <br /> <br /> Performances are highly ongoing, with Whoopi Goldberg debuting - which she never agrees with acting performance - like the heart broken Celie who just wants to love. Danny Glover gave solid support, though his "Moses" was a better turn for him in "Places in the Heart". The striking show comes from the untouched Oprah Winfrey as Miss Sophia, the single-minded, black woman who's crushing spirit by a terrible incident with a protesting, high-class white woman. Good support also from Margaret Avery, Adolph Caesar and Rae Dawn Chong. <br /> <br /> Quincy Jones (co-producer with Spielberg, Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall) created a beautiful melodic score and also original blues for the occasion. The editing of Michael Kahn is as always, while photography director Allen Daviau demonstrates complete skill to capture a glorious southern landscape. <br /> <br /> This true relationship of heart will surely bring a tear to your eye, that is Unfortunately, we have so many unanswered questions. <br /> <br /> Wednesday, January 15, 1997 - Video
