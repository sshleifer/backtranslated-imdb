"La Bête" by Walerian Borowczyk is based on the short story "Lokis" written by Prosper Merimée. Lucy Broadhurst (Lisabeth Hummel), an American heir engaged to the son of a poor marquee, arrives at the family's crumbling castle and learns of mythical mysterious cattle wanted to taste the nearby forest. It is fabulous that an earlier lady of the house (Sirpa Lane) was involved with the creature once with perverse sex, and Lucy finds herself busy with dreams of the incident. "The Animal" is an art mix of surrealistic horror, explicit sleaze and porn. There are implicit bestiality, assault, and perversion in the priesthood, germination of mature false ejaculation on fried breasts, masturbation with a rose and most graphics of all, the eponymous beast toying with incredibly large phallus. tasteless.The women here are beautifully beautiful and they are naked most of the time.Overall "La Bête" is a visual feast. Whether from fetish attention to detail, or the visual motives conceived with information, Borowczyk's masterpiece should be looked at with caution and attention. A must see for fans of the European Culture Cinema.
