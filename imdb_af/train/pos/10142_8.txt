Maybe it's just because I have an intense fear of hospitals and medical stuff, but this one came under my skin (forgive the pun). This piece is brave, not afraid to go over and be as satisfying as they come in terms of revenge movies. Not only did I feel myself hateful for the writer and much sympathetic to the "screwee", but I felt that at certain times I felt bad and uncomfortable feelings. This is actually a rare and wonderful thing for a somewhat horrible horror viewer like myself. Some parts are very reminiscent of "Hellraiser", but rather come as tribute rather than imitation. It's a heavy-handed piece that doesn't consider the viewer much to consider, but I enjoy going through a movie at some point. This piece doesn't bring it up and encourage it. I liked this one very much. Don't look while eating pudding.
