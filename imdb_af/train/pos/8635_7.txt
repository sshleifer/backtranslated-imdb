"California" is a good Hollywood shore of tensions and terror, which tells of two couples transporting estate to California to share the cost of gas: A few losers (Lewis & Pitt) and two wannabee artists, a photographer and author (Duchovny & Forbes). Pitt "nails" his character which is the focus of this somewhat predictable thriller. A good look for those in a psycho-murderer.
