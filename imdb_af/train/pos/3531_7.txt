Robert Siodmak does a fantastic job with this B noir with Ella Raines, Franchot Tone and Alan Curtis. And he does it, I can add, without much help from his male actors, that is, Curtis and Tone. It's right Raines, a nice, fun actress who for some reason never reached the status of some of her "noir" counterparts. <br /> <br /> Siodmak's use of sex, light, shadows and music is truly remarkable as he approaches this genre. The shadows, lighting effects and camera angles are all effective. But the highlight of the movie takes place in a nightclub with a very sexual drum riff by Elisha Cook, who is reported by excited Raines. It is this scene that "Phantom Lady" brings in a new area. <br /> <br /> Siodmak's commitment to the material is only compared by Raines. He gives a sincere performance as a loving woman to save her husband. Franchot Tone called this one. Alan Curtis was not upset that he could die and did not seem happy that he had lived. And he was never in love with Raines, except for a brief moment in prison. <br /> <br /> The amusing thing about many of these films is that, as World War II progresses, interest in psychiatry is deepening. But often the terms are used incorrectly in films such as "Besit," "Spellbound" and "The Greatest Show on Earth." Tones are called paranoid by Thomas Gomez. Tones probably linked some of the paranoia to his disease, but he looks closer to a psychopath. In fact, as evidenced by his headaches, he may have had a brain tumor pushing against his brain. <br /> <br /> Phantom Lady doesn't have the biggest plot, but it's worth watching.
