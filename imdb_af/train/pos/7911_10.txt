As a child I loved computer animation, although it was extremely limited and the tools were almost inconsistent. This movie, as I sat in awe and watched the incredible images and almost hypnotic music, shaped the desire to create moving things in the computer. It's a packet match between the music and the video, which really packs a one-two punch. Knowing a child who wants to get involved in computer animation is a MUST. <br /> <br /> Almost 20 years later, I rated this movie as one of my top 3 favorites. The originality, I think, is still unbeatable by most of McMovies today who spit Hollywood. I want to see if I can make it myself again; if imitation is the sincere form of flattery, this movie earns a TON of imitation =)
