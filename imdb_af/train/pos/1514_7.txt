With a few Hammer's stars, this highly effective part of the British horror turns around a home and the plight of previous tenants, whose stories are all told to a Scottish site detective looking for a missing actor. <br /> <br /> Story number one, probably the least impressive of the four, deals with a writer and his wife who just moved into the house and plan to stay for a short while so he one of his horror novels. He creates a demented character called Dominic, who is a very horrible heretic, and finds himself angry, seeing this exaggerated man everywhere he goes. After his wife convinced him to seek psychiatric help, a subplot was introduced that didn't really work for me. I won't spoil it for you. <br /> <br /> The next story (the best in my opinion) dies of the wonderful Peter Cushing as Philip Grayson, a man who soon moved into the house and soon made his way to a nearby laundry museum (which the macabre trade) where he was very scared to find a figure that looks exactly like a woman from his past. Soon after, an old friend (who also has a history with this woman) is in town for business and fall by seeing him. The two men were in a rude awakening because they soon discovered that there was more to this woman than to the eye. <br /> <br /> Story three stars one of my favorite ... Christopher Lee, who plays John Reid. After entering his home with his peculiar daughter Jane, the nanny he was renting became terribly suspicious of the way Reid suppressed his daughter. Well, come find out ... if she knew what Lee was doing, she would surely have understood. <br /> <br /> The final story is a light-hearted vampire story starring John Pertwee and Ingrid Pitt. After buying a cloak from a mysterious dealer, actor Paul Henderson finds himself in the essence he portrayed several times in his career. <br /> <br /> Overall, the pacing and direction was very good, as most of the performances. There were good Gothic touches here and there and an effective score to complement the atmosphere. This one is a custodian and is highly recommended.
