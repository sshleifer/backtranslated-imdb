Rock n roll is a mess business and DiG! demonstrates it masterfully. A project of serious ambition, and perhaps stubbornness, can bring together the filmmaker seven turbulent years to follow two unconscious rock groups. Having said that, the abundance of quality material ensures the film's ability to captivate the audience. If you're ever interested in any area of ​​the music industry, this movie will undoubtedly be an attack. The music in the movie, although it suffers little of the necessary cut and paste, is the price of admission alone. The morning after I saw DiG! I went straight to the record store to pick up a Brian Jonestown Massacre album (I already started with the Dandy Warhols sounds). Primarily determined by exploring rock music, the film succeeds at other profound levels. Dig! is a sincere and sufficient goal, look at the destructive and fleeting nature of the creative process and the people who are trying to kill those powers.
