This is one of those movies you are in when you surf a channel on a Saturday afternoon, and you are drawn into it and finally look at the whole thing. I thought it was well done and it really made me feel like the characters. Although moving a little slower and more focused on the relationship between Bonnie and Clyde and their relatives, it never became boring. We don't really see too many of the robberies for which they were so legendary, and instead most of the shooting takes place when they are caught by the police. I thought Tracey Needham, who played Bonnie, really did a good job with her character. Going from a pretty country girl to a cold killer is a challenging thing to portray, and I enjoyed the subtlety she gave to the role. <br /> <br /> Overall, an above average effort, especially because it's made for TV movie.
