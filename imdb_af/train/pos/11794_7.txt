This is quite the gripping, fascinating, tragic story. Very good, and mostly reasonably accurate, as it is a TV movie rather than a documentary. They created some fictional characters, and several real people combine in one character, but otherwise it's a good story of a very tragic and dark story. <br /> <br /> The final moments of the film, depicting the mass suicide. / murder, is almost taken directly from a sound recording made by Jim Jones. This recording was made during the last 44 minutes of the Peoples Temple's existence. It is available in several places on the Internet. This part of the movie is almost on the point. <br /> <br /> In short, a documentary is not. However, it covers most of the basic elements of the People's Temple story.
