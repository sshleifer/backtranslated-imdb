I'll be honest with Yall, I was a high school junior when this sitcom first broadcasted on ABC. I didn't think I would have it at all. But with John Ritter in it, I felt that it had some potential in it, plus they were something different with what I wanted. The acting was fantastic, not very terrible 2nd-ranked comedy lines, John Ritter always brings his A-game when it comes to comedy. It was a great show to watch, and I'll tell you why it was a good show. My dad who never looked, just watch movies, sports and law and order. He actually sat down with my 3 brothers and 2 sisters, my mom and myself, and watched the show I think because John Ritter was in it. This. I honestly think this show would still be running if John Ritter God rested his soul, I wish he didn't die.
