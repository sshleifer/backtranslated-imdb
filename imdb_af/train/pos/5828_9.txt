The guys are careless repairers working at a radio station, and during a couple of rides in a broadcast building, Curly's perfect mime of a recording of "Voices of Spring" is wrong for the right thing that leads to a radio contract and a musical party.

This is undoubtedly essential for Stooge fans. <br /> <br /> Although the evidence of Curly's poor health is evident in his face and voice, his performance is incredible, and it's probably the last glimpse of the old curler. Some fans think that a bird in the hand is the last big curly short, but its rough voice and slow motion are just too hard to watch.
