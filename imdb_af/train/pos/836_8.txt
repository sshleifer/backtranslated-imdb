This will probably not be the best comedy of the year, a few too many coincidences and plot holes. However, we are talking about a movie where a hit and a white bread vendor become friends, so a few vaguely don't have to come too much of a surprise. Brosnan is excellent in this role, away is the wood James Bond (a role in which he was wasted). If he can maintain this kind of quality, I hope he still makes comedies. Greg Kinnear is also excellent as Brosnan's straight man. I read some negative comments about Hope Davis here, but I thought she was pretty good as a mouse house housewife with a dark side deep inside. There are lots of good chuckles while Brosnan penetrates his way and some scenes where I almost died to laugh. My father (a consultant) almost lost it when Julian described himself as a "facilitator". Like 'Grosse Pointe Blank', another hit comedy, humor can be very dark. If you are, be prepared to enjoy yourself.
