What is most upset about this movie is not that the school kills, as the one depicted, actually, but the truth is that it is run by teenagers such as Cal and Andre ... normal kids with normal families. Using a hand-camera technique, a la Blair witch, Ben Coccio, succeeds in bringing us into the lives of two friends who have some high school problems, although we never know exactly what is behind this issues are not. They typically look like many people hate high school, so what? Part of you don't believe they will ever exercise the very well thought out bloodbath on Zero Day. The surveillance camera scenes in the school during the shooting are becoming increasingly powerful. You can't believe it really happens, and it really happened. The hand-camera technique also creates the illusion that it is not a written film, a brilliant idea that has given the subject.
