I caught this movie at a show in Brooklyn - it's hard to describe the plot; It has many meager characters, but let's just say I'll be hard to pick which one makes me laugh the hardest, I won't know where to start. Even the peripheral roles were well written and performed well. <br /> <br /> There are many little ones that make it unique and very enjoyable, it has a few "devices" that appear and add another hilarious layer. It is refreshing to watch; Not a recycled material I've seen many times. If this movie could reach a wider audience, I'm sure it will be a real crowd, the story is so original and sincere. <br /> <br /> There is a lot here to keep funny stories, accidents and misunderstandings that set the final act and dramatic conclusion. Cross Eyed is a very funny movie with lots of heart; It's a touch with a fast-paced comedy woven throughout. Definitely worth seeing!
