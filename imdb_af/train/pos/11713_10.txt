I think it took a lot of patience for her to get ahead. It's a pity that when a celebrity suffers, that's what helps most people. But in her case, what she did was remarkable. I have been in mental health for five years and I think it is wonderful that mental illness is no longer a terrible word and I believe she helped. I always thought she was wonderful and would always. I'm glad she wrote this book and the movie was made. She is a remarkable lady and I hope she continues to act. She was very busy and faced it. I would really like to see her work more with children, especially child actors. Her ordeal should not have happened and I think she would be wonderful as a mentor for young people. The movie was so close to me that I was very touched. A TBI that caused the onset of my illness and PTSD suffers, it is good to know that someone has the courage to show her life as she did. I believe it helped this people and people in general realize that there are others like them and there is help. Thank you, Mrs. Duke, or Anna, you ever choose.
