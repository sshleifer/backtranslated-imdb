I can't add a lot to the positive reviews already available here - great acting, balanced writing, multicolored characters, a great anti-hero in Tony, good commentary on the thousand-year-old American life. The integral use of psychiatry along with Tony's mother issues is especially fresh and humorous. Several other characters add a lot of depth - Hesh's interesting history as an outsider splashing, Ralphie's total irreparable bitterness, Chris's dual life desires, and so on. <br /> <br /> However, in some of the criticisms, I should especially like the "glorifying violence / belittles Italian-Americans" one.Most of the authors and actors are Italian-American, would they attack themselves? There are several positive Italian-American characters - Artie Bucco the chef, dr. Melfi and her family and the Cusamanos next to the Sopranos. Indeed, Dr Melfi's ex-husband noticed in season 1 that only a small minority of Italian Americans ever had Mob connections (certainly smaller than the portion of African-Americans involved in crime, I dare say it. cases are poverty and lack of opportunity is the main cause. <br /> <br /> Most characters don't really choose the life they have; Family background or circumstances largely imply them. Foreigners (even of Italian stock) trying to integrate usually meet difficult ends - Matthew and his friend in season 2, for example. If you criticize this show, I assume that Frasier made you a psychiatrist, or Will & Grace let you go gay? Presumably you won't listen to rap music that discusses gangs or r'n'b discussing promiscuity or rock music discussing drugs (or any other combination)? People are not as stupid as some of you make up. <br /> <br /> Not everything is perfect. Many characters only appeared once when they had to be seen by all the logic or at least mentioned in previous episodes. Tracee the dancer, Meadow's friend Ally, Uncle Junior's dear friend (presumably for 20 years until they split in season 1).
