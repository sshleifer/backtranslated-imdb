It is not known whether Marilyn Monroe ever met with Albert Einstein (and since the mysterious disappearance of her diary after her equally mysterious death, we can never know), but in their lifetime the opportunity was there. <br /> <br /> From his own play, Terry Johnson describes Nicolas Roeg's Insignificance meeting in a New York hotel room, one night in 1953, between the two icons plus Joe DiMaggio (Busey) and Senator Joseph McCarthy (Curtis) plane. On another level, it elevates - or diminishes - these "personalities" (and a bad phrase) to mere avatars (the characters are deliberately unnamed), once larger and less in status. <br /> <br /> The title Insignificance is both dedicated and deeply ironic; here, DiMaggio's net worth is reduced to a little more than a photo on a bubble gum card. Monroe is also reduced to its constituent parts of dress, hair, lipstick, wrap and voice. By uncovering their uncertainties and reversing their roles, the film brings sharp focus to receiving notions of familiar personality, which explodes the cult of personality. <br /> <br /> Further the theme will be another blast at the movie's climax: Hiroshima in a hotel suite, where 'the actress' is burned in seconds after a bat; a literal deconstruction of fame. Goodbye, Norma Jean. History highlights the writing, which in turn shakes history upside down. As Roeg joked after he first watched Johnson's play, these characters were myths, not invented by any single person, not the public or the press, probably not even by the characters themselves. As played by Theresa Russell, Marilyn (a real-life intellectual cabinet), a childlike Einstein ('The Professor', played by Emil) leads the relativity theory by using balloons and a flashlight, while the professor lower. , in a deliberate parody of her own role in The Seven Year Itch, the movie The Actress is seen in the opening of the film. <br /> <br /> History records that Monroe's former man, fading baseball star DiMaggio (played by Busey as a gentle psychotic simpleton), was unhappy with her iconic dress scene in the movie, which set their breakdown. At the climax, we discover the jealous 'Ballplayer' in a pub, emphasizing the fact that, if I, "I want to see her underwear, I just like the other guys just like the other guys". <br /> <br /> Unlike the Professor, the Ballplayer believes the universe is around - a quarrel shared by Native Americans. But the Great Whore (Sampson, from One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest Fame) operating the Roosevelt Hotel's elevator is all but disenfranchised from its own culture: "I'm no longer Cherokee - I watch television." Meanwhile, "The Senator" is investigating the Professor, who is on the eve of a pacifist speech to the United Nations, but whoever suspects the Senator is a Red. In fact, as he announces to Monroe, Einstein is wrapped up in debt over Hiroshima, and which holds the white heat future. But in an apparently wicked universe, all such worries and aspirations become insignificant in view of a higher (atomic) force. <br /> <br /> Roeg is really the perfect director to bring Johnson's stage play to the screen. Throughout, tortured childhood flashbacks and pessimistic prosperity (ka-boom!) Draw unexpected relationships between time, place and circumstances, with the repeated visual motif of a watch being used to pass time - but perhaps also to suggest that all time is once. ; Every moment exists together. As depicted by his back catalog, it is something of a hobby for a director who is enchanted by the idea of ​​synchronicity - don't look at this now. Here flourishes in 1920 in 1945 and drips in the 1980s, a period in which another 'actor' took its greatest role as the president of the United States. <br /> <br /> If that all sounds pretty heavy (quantum physics is certainly involved), the performance is anything else because of Johnson's witty, zippy script, Roeg's playful direction, setting up a substantial stage - and throwing themselves in star shape. Tony Curtis, in particular, leaves artificial points in the wood panel as the paranoid, impotent senator, seen as a congress with a Monroe mimic (a real, versus Russell's), before being dropped by his distressing member. <br /> <br /> Of course, Curtis was once a fellow student with the right Marilyn Monroe in Some Like It Hot, and whose embrace he memorably described as "kissing Hitler". As Roeg said, "Everything suddenly seems connected ... when the movie started to form, even the actors themselves were part of this endless link." Everything goes in the pot, is cooked and served in new and fascinating ways.
