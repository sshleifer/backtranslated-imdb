Now you love Mr. Carrey's humor or you don't. I, Myself and Irene, had audiences who both walk in herds and on the other hand rejoice and fall into pools of joy. Bruce Almighty is a little more mainstream, but you have been warned. <br /> <br /> If you're not sure, look at the trailer. I saw the trailer three times and still laughed at the same gags when I saw the movie. If you don't see a dog, sit down after using the joke, don't be bothered with the movie. <br /> <br /> Carrey, a timetable reporter who argues "lighter news" God seems to be all his life. God takes on the challenge and asks Carrey if he can do better. Carrey gets the swing of all the powers of God by increasing his brothers, advancing himself, and answering everyone's prayers by single-handed computer commands. <br /> <br /> It is not a highbrow movie or even memorable, but it is very well done within it's very limited intent, almost constantly laughing at Carrey fans, and even any religious cheesiness is probably unsatisfactory for all, except the narrowest approvadders and anti-god squadders. <br /> <br /> On the more thoughtful level, the film asks us to speculate on Carrey's own career - stuck in his "comedy" typing, he largely fails to give an impression as a serious one. actor. after winning two Golden Globes. His most attainable 'straight' role, the Man on the Moon, is less known for his comedy romps - or The Truman Show (on which the Academy called three nominations while Carrey was bypassed).
