The late Dudley Moore had the most famous role of his short-lived career in 1981's ARTHUR, a racially funny and varied touch, that smiled hot, huge stomach lambs and once ripped off when you're in the right mood. Moore received an Oscar best actor nomination for his performances as Arthur Bach, a drunk playboy who "chases cars, plays tennis, loves women, but he has weekends and he is his own boss." Arthur is set to pledge 750 million dollars when he is the spoiled daughter of a sheltered gangster with a clever society girl named Susan Johnston (Jill Eikenberry). Things get tough when Arthur Linda meets Morolla (Liza Minnelli), a waitress / struggling Queens actress stealing for her father's birthday. Moore lifts the screen into one of the only funniest shows of the past 50 years. Last Sir John Gielgud has won a best supporting actor Oscar for his flawless turn as Arthur's acid-tongue butler and best friend Hobson, whose outward contempt for Arthur's behavior covers more paternal feelings. There are other funny contributions by Barney Martin and Linda's dad. Stephen Elliott as Susan's father, and Geraldine Fitzgerald as Arthur's demented grandmother. The film is aimed at a keen eye for comedy by a first director named Steve Gordon, who unfortunately died the following year. There was also a forgotten successor a few years later, but these immediate classics should not be missed.
