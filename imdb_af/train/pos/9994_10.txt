"Life stinks" is a parody of life and death, happiness and depression. The black and white that always occur in our lives. Mel Brooks' performance is brilliant as always, and the other actors work well as well. This film has a bit of Capra flavor, so it's so good. <br /> <br /> There are a few memorable gags like the one when Brooks tries to earn money dancing in the street, and all the people who pass by ignore him, or if he meets a funny guy who Believe, Paul is Getty and then start to scare and hit each other. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen it, you don't know what you are. I missed. <br /> <br /> This movie tells us about the old and eternal battle of the poor against the rich. <br /> <br /> The only difference between this film and the reality is that this movie has a happy ending and has reality. <br /> <br /> Yes, indeed, life stinks.
