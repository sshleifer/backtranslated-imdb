I gave this film a 10/10 with some reluctance, because it is difficult to praise something that has haunted and frightened me for years. The mere threat to the woman in black's face is just plain horror and the accompanying music only exacerbates the fear. <br /> <br /> I saw it when it was on TV for the first time when I was 10 and it has disturbed me for years. I am fascinated by the fact that so many other users have said so. So many movie reviews are about how disturbed or scared a movie can be, but you can believe everyone who posted on this board is really amazing. I mean, I really like horror movies and generally find it very funny, rather than it, but it's really threatening and will probably disturb most people. I didn't see it, since I was 10 and I'm tempted to look it back, but I fear having sleepless nights. I can't quite stick my finger, but I think it's something to do with the fact that fear is the woman's greatest weapon and that we as viewers are as susceptible as we feel the fear so intense. It is remarkable that other viewers' feelings are so unanimous. <br /> <br /> I also saw the stage game, which was an excellent production ... but nothing can be compared to it.
