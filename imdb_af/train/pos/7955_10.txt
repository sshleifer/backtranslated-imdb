This is one of the greatest kid animal movies ever created. I cry every time I see Shadow shouting: "Wait, wait for Peter!" as the family car moves away. It's a must see if you like animals! Best movie ever! The lines in the movie are sometimes silly. Like when Sassy tells Chance; "Cat's rule and dogs shoot!" Lines like this I could do without, but when I was six, I said I loved that line. The storyline may seem to some, but I like it. Shadow if the older dog who prepares Chance to take him over when he's gone, really moves when you think about it. It reminded me of my childhood. I think everyone can find a piece of themselves in 'Homeward Bound.'
