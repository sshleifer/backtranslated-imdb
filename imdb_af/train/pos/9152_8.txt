It's a good movie for 99% of the duration. I feel the end has stained this film of higher praise. <br /> <br /> It is shot on a rather naive. It was clearly done to create a more cold feeling for the film - a feeling of isolation soon becomes apparent due to this filming technique. <br /> <br /> The gruesome characters are very well behaved and especially the "" Joe called. The healthy (normal) characters are a bit too pathetic for my taste, they are supposed to be so pathetic, but it is a bit OTT. <br /> <br /> The movie starts slowly (and the naive camera works smacks of 'B' movie to start with) and very normal, but you soon get a sense of the threatening cruelty, which is one of the most twisted movies about cold sadness. <br /> <br /> After the sudden and incredibly lazy end, I felt disappointed, giving the movie a 9 if the end was in line with the rest of the movie, but as it is, it only gets a 7 on the strength of the 'eeriness' and nail bites earlier in the movie. /> <br /> Give it a watch and excuse the end!
