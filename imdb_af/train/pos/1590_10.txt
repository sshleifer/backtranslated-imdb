I just started watching the TV series "What I Love You" and I have to say it is a joy to watch. I always like to see that new apps are displayed well, as many shows run out before you really get a feel for them. I watched Amanda Bynes, because "it's all", she's really a funny girl, who's best about her comedy, is that it's so natural and what I mean by that is something one can do here , the best friend, not rehearsed. <br /> <br /> I recently started watching the show and fell in love. I just look again, but look forward to the next season. All the characters in the show give something to the whole story line. It's nice to see an old face from other shows I enjoyed watching in the past like "90210 Jennie Garth", "Popular" Leslie Grossman and City Guys Wesley Jonathan. The new character is also very talented, Nick Zano has those charms that make you love him, even when doing something wrong for the holy bosom. <br /> <br /> Overall this show has the right ingredients to be successful. , I'm looking forward to seeing how it grows.
