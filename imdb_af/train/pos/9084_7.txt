Yes, some people said this movie was a waste of money, but I'm the kind of hard dragon / global / sacred crap action fan. <br /> <br /> But if you took my point of view this movie had some of the best action sences, it was pretty good. But she is such a movie that everything is getting harder at the right time, or just when the evil has crashed, something has come to save them at the right time. Although there were some funny lines and gangs throughout the movie that surprised me. <br /> <br /> The 3d graphics were pretty damn damn. I mean for this kind of movie the 3D effects were GREAT !!!! Great battle shown in the trailers remains until the hype the movie had. The battle between good and evil at the end, I have to say it could be longer and slightly better. It was still pretty good. <br /> <br /> Now to the parts I think could have been better. . The start was pretty good with the parts that led to the big battles. I mean if you don't really want to see this movie in theaters, then it is at least a DVD ... overall I loved the movie, but the plot just got stuck and hard to fit.
