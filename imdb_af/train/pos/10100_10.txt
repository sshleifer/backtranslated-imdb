I stumbled upon this (Act-I) by pure dumb luck and it was more than a decade ago. It wasn't even what the cover label mentioned on the tape. It surprised me. It intimidated me. It shocked me. I finally forgot and almost a decade later I thought about it again. Then go and buy both acts. They were even better than I initially experienced. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is that while the Tank Police are continuing and arguing that they are in the war with crime, after which tanks and heavy artillery are justified, they seem to be very difficult with criminals. It is either never shown or is simply a lie, as it seems to be easy to look at most of the time. If it were bitter to be in a state of war, it was really propaganda, it was certainly not shown as such. <br /> <br /> I don't think the original Japanese version could be any where as good as the Americanized. version of this. But with regard to the story, there are definitely some proper explanations in translation missing, but it can be excused.
