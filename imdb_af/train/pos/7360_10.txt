Wow! it's a good movie! The acting was not good at all, but if you watch the movie for a few moments, rinse and watch it again, it is genius! The man in the beginning of the film runs with his suitcase against a three. WOW! I never expected it. Then he puts the boil in a bag and walks away. I bet smoker was against those three of his parents who later sold the drugs. And the genius quotes: "Clean shades, I need some. "" They're yours. If you think you can take them. " ".. Just Brilliant! And the battle is the best I've seen for a while. Look at the second man he takes off after hitting the head of the first guy at the table. WHAT A HIT! And in the middle of the movie, one man shot in a car once, 3 guys fall, he's really good at pursuing. It costs a lot of money to hire these guys like him. The end was brilliant, it was so exciting that James Cahill walked up and down the stairs for 5 minutes and shot Jason Peters after his distraction. Jason Peters falls off and rolls back while he's dead! I can't say with more words how good this movie is!
