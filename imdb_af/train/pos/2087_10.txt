This movie was released the year I was born and will be 70 like I am in 2007. I saw it again last night, as it has not been seen since high school. While it was full of 30's sentiment and the acting was a bit more stereotypical, it was excellent. Pearl S. Buck's story came alive through the magic of Luise Rainer and Paul Muni's chemistry. The novel that Mrs. Buck deserves the Nobel Literature Prize, led by Sydney Franklin, who, along with an excellent script, tells the story of farmer Farmer Wang Lung, whose father gets a bride for him, a maid from the kitchen. from a local landlord. In Buck's story, Wang's success is endorsed by his willingness to listen to his wife, most of the time, and the love of the country. Eventually he realizes that his wife, like the country, is the source of his wealth, happiness and immortality. Buck's stories have always cast strong women in a critical place to influence the outcome of events in the pre-feminist world. Luise Rainer, the German, brings a provisional but determined Boer Chinese woman to life in her portrayal of Olan. Muni also preserves the naive but honorable Wang, who was eventually caught between the two worlds of the rich and the farmers. Other classic characters include Charlie Grapewin, Dorothy Gale's Kansan Uncle Henry of Oz's wizard, Walter Connelly as the mansions, cute uncle and Keye Luke as number one boy - but this time, not Charlie Chan's. <br /> <br /> A classic can be defined as a movie you can see over and over again and never get tired. If so, this movie is a classic, no doubt whatsoever.
