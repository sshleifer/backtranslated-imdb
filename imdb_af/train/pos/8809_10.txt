This document really opened my eyes to what people outside the United States thought about the September 11 attacks. This film is expertly crafted and offers this disaster as more than an attack on American soil. The aftermath of this disaster occurs from many different countries and perspectives. I believe this movie should be distributed more widely for this point. It also helps in the healing process of finally seeing something other than news reports about the terror attacks. And some of the pieces are actually funny, but not so offensive. This film strongly recommended me, and I feel the same.
