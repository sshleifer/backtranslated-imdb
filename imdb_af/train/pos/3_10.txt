"All the world is a stage and its people actors in it" - or something. Who said the theater stopped at the orchestra - or even at the theater door? Why isn't the audience part of the theater experience, including the story itself? <br /> <br /> This movie was a great experiment that said, "Hey! The story is yours and it needs more than your attention. Your active participation". "Sometimes we bring the story to you, sometimes you have to go to the story." <br /> <br /> Oh, no one has listened, but that doesn't mean it shouldn't be said.
