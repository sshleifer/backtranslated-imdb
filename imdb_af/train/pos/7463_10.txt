This movie seems to polarize us. You also love or hate it. I loved it. <br /> <br /> I agree with the comments made, you just have to feel this one. <br /> <br /> Also early in the film, Tom Cruise shows his girlfriend a painting done by Monet - an impressionist painter. Monet's style is to paint in small pieces, so close the painting looks like a mess, but from far away you can know what the subject is. Cruise mentions that the painting has a "vanilla sky". I believe it's a hint for the movie cast. This movie is like that impressionist painting. It's impressive movie entertainment! And it is no coincidence that the title of the movie refers to that painting. <br /> <br /> It's not your typical linear plot. It takes more thought. There is symbolism and there are scenes jumping around and no, you're not always sure what is going on. But in the end everything is explained. <br /> <br /> You'll have to concentrate on this movie, but I think people are making the mistake of focusing too much. When it ends, it's when you have to think about it. If you try to figure it out as it unfolds, you will overpower yourself. Just let it happen ... "go with it ... keep an open mind. Remember what you see and save the analysis for later. <br /> <br /> I've found the top up and thought it's incredibly unique, wildly creative and spell binding. <br /> <br /> But I won't criticize the intelligence of those of you who didn't like it. It calls for a certain taste. If you like existential, psychedelic, philosophical, thoughtful, challenging, spiritual films, see it. If you prefer something, a little lighter, then skip it. <br /> <br /> But if you like me, you will surely enjoy it.
