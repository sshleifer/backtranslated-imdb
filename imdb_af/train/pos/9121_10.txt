SPOILERS CONFIRM TO DO AN OBSERVATION. <br /> <br /> Twenty years from 1984, this film talks about Prince's future in the music industry. <br /> <br /> There is a scene that summed up Prince's music performance of the past 10 years perfectly, which is if you took the best two songs from his last 10 albums, you would have one fantastic album! <br /> <br /> The scene is playing as follows. Prince walks to his dressing room after playing one song and the club owner goes into the locker room to give Prince his fall out of grace in the 90s and to put out albums that will only be the most hardcore fans to do. endure and support his artworks. <br /> <br /> Club owner - "You don't take them as you used to. The only person digging your music is yourself!" <br /> <br /> Spooky huh! How about the musical underline that makes Prince even more angry when he strikes Apollonia on the ground in two separate scenes! It gave me cold fever that it was not the only scene women were abused in this movie. <br /> <br /> I'm all for the comedy sparring between Morris Day and Jerome Benton, because these two stole every scene they were in. But what was funny about throwing a woman in a trash? It was uncomfortable! The other nasty piece was the chalk sketch of Prince's father on the floor invented by the Minnieapolis police, which made Prince go even more profitable! FANTASY !! <br /> <br /> Purple Rain is an entertaining movie overall, as it is the soundtrack of Prince songs that boosts it 110%. But then the film gives us another theory about Prince and his music, because the film tells us that Prince's greatest song of the movie was written by Wendy, Lisa and Princes's wife who wins music father! <br /> <br /> Is Prince And the filmmakers are trying to tell us that Prince stole all his best songs from his father after he found his dad's music sheets of written songs? Maybe that's why Prince started steaming in the 90's because he ran out of his fathers' ideas? ..... Hmmmm .....
