Two warring shopkeepers in a leather shop seem to be secret love, as they match aliases according to boxing numbers. Within this simple idea and everyday environment, Lubitsch produces a rich white, drama, poignancy and irony that never comes up. Stewart and Sullavan are perfect as the average couple with true emotions and tensions, and the rest of the well-developed characters have their own sub-plots and jokes. Although it is mistaken for Stewart's great 39/40 films (Destry, Philadelphia Story, Smith), it's easy on an equal footing and we enjoy a whole host of acting subtleties that we don't see in the other movies .
