Well, I gave this movie a 7. It was better than 'Thirdspace', but not as good as 'In the Beginning' as far as the B5 movies go. I really think the television series has a much better work overall with the special effects and character representation. Let's hope the producers and throw the next series "Crusade" to the standards of B5.
