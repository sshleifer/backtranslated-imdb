ANSWER SHEET is the story of a young, emotionally upset US Navy. His problems lead him to Jerome Davenport, a psychiatrist who helps him realize that his problems are a result of his childhood education. <br /> <br /> Get ready to throw a tear or two. The movie can thaw the coldest heart. I loved the story, which changed something so terribly to make a positive end to someone. ANSWER FISHER is a powerful movie, the most important of forgiveness. Other important issues that make you think are child abuse, adoption and foster care. <br /> <br /> Oscar winner, Denzel Washington does an impressive job in his director debate. There were many scenes I enjoyed watching. They included the beginning (dreams of a little boy, looking out of the giant pancake!) And the end (dreams came true), which tied the story beautifully. <br /> <br /> Another wonderful scene took place when Doctor Antwone urged his family to find answers to his questions about his family who had left him. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene happened when the young man finally confronted his mother and her reaction to him. Priceless. <br /> <br /> All the actors represented their parts well. <br /> <br /> In addition to director responsibilities, Mr. Washington continues to show why it has won an Oscar award and is successful in all its role players. He had a strong presence in this movie. <br /> <br /> Actor, Derek Luke demonstrated why he was so right for the part of Antwone Fisher. He portrayed very real and heartbreaking work. <br /> <br /> Joy Bryant, who played the part of Cheryl, Antwone's love affair, looked like a ray of sunshine on the screen. The chemistry flowed well between the romantic characters. <br /> <br /> Novella Nelson, who is part of Mrs. Tate played, has a despicable character, deserves special mention. <br /> <br /> Even though we only see her A few minutes, the actress playing Fisher's mother delivered an excellent performance. <br /> <br /> Everyone should see ANSWER FISHER.
