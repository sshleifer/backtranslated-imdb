I would have given this otherwise terrific series a full 10 votes if Claudia Black failed! Her inclusion as the stupid 'Vela' brought the series into my estimation. Involving her as a regular, while Ben Browder also included RDA was a mistake. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, we only threatened with the loss of 'Jack' and didn't really need it. series has changed into new episodes of 'Farscape'. <br /> <br /> I was a big fan of the movie "Stargate" and when the series was first announced, I reserved that it could meet the movie, but after watching the first episode that I must admit I was addicted. I always looked forward to new episodes with great expectation
