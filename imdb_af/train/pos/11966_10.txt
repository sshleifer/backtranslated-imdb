It's an excellent series. You will laugh, you will cry, these wonderful people will be part of your family. The way this family cares for each other and helps each other through their crisis sets a good example of how we should lead our lives. There are many good things they do and some bad choices, but they never turn their back on family, they work through problems. Michelle, the youngest daughter, is the cutest thing I've seen. Stephanie, the middle daughter, suffers from middle-child syndrome and with the help of everyone in the family it is better. DJ, the oldest daughter, is excited or her father wants it to happen or not. One thing they all share is that they miss their mother. Danny (Dad), Joey and Oom Jesse love so many of these kids, and that is evident in every episode.
