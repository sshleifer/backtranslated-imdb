As a fan of Paris Je'Taime, I will see New York, I love you with very high expectations. Luckily I went out with all my expectations. It was funny, sweet, fast and entertaining. The movie starts with two taxi drivers (Bradley Cooper & Justin Bartha) trying to get the same area, but arguing which way to go. It was funny, and then the movie goes into some of the best sketches I've ever seen. There were four unbelievers from all the good. I'll start talking to those four. One of the features of Shia LaBeouf is a cocktail at a hotel that finds love in an old lady. The next one has Orlando Bloom as a musician doing business with a woman played by Christina Ricci. Another one, Anton Yelchin and Olivia Thirbly as two people in progress, Thirbly's character is disabled. The best one is Eli Wallach and Cloris Leachman as an old old couple. I would like to point out that Nataile Portman is an impressive director, and writes a caretaker and Ethan Hawke and Maggie Q are excellent as a flirtatious man and hooker. New York, I love you is definitely as good, if not better than the 2006 Paris Je'Taime. The sketch is good, and the film shows how indie movies really should be. However, the film does not have as many well-known directors as Paris Je'Taime, and that is why it was wonderful to meet its excellence. If you want to laugh, see some great dramatic effects, see an incredible amount of good performances, and just entertain, definitely go to New York, I love you.
