EARTH is a must for children and adults. My son had lots of fun watching all these funny birds and polar bears. We can learn a lot from this movie and we must be proud of our great treasure on earth. There are a few animals in danger of disappearing. Exactly the problem must prevent all authorities of our planet. <br /> <br /> This documentary offers many exceptional pictures I have never seen before. Then it is well accompanied by a heavenly music. The director has done a good job here that gets high respect. Nothing can stop me and my family from giving EARTH the highest price. I hope so much that things will create a successor.
