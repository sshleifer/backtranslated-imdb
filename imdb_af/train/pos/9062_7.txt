It's a weekend, I watched this funny movie. and I really like it. all the kids are cute, who reminds me of my own childhood with that silly mind. It is a truly entertaining movie for a group of families during weekend weekend, which can make many memories and laughter. Childhood humor always works. also fun. simple story but cool shooting. good job for director to find the child's path. When it comes to the children's movie, I think of "12 and keep". Another one this year, but different from the child's world, which is actually and cruel. wonderful work. H2EFW focuses on the happy side of childhood, which every child and family needs. P.S. Twitch, I think, is the voice of Nemo from "Finding Nemo".
