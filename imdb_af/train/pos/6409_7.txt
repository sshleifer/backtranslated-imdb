I didn't hear from Brashear before I looked at it. This is the story of him and the man who trained him to help him become the first African American naval diver. A story of willpower. The plot is well written and develops throughout. It looks like a typical underdog thing, and it doesn't take too many surprises. It's also very Hollywood, but hey, I don't know the real man, maybe it's close to how it actually happened. Nevertheless, the work is done, with dramatic scenes and adversity on the road, and it is inspiring to anyone who has ever heard the words "no, you can't" about their lifelong dream. The appearances are all excellent. DeNiro and Gooding Jr. both shine when they are on the screen. Rapaport is also wonderful. The characters are well written, credible and consistent. It is well edited and features good cinematography. The production values ​​are high and it is a fairly convincing task to transport us back to the 50's. This is the only movie I have seen by this director and the author, although I can now look at more what they are responsible for. There is a moderate amount of strong language, otherwise no offensive material. I recommend it to anyone who finds the topic interesting, and / or supporters of those who made it. 10/07
