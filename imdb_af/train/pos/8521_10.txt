I absolutely loved this show. I watched it from the time it was only broadcast in the late 90's until the very last episode. In my honest opinion, it was a wonderful family drama that is so rare these days. Definitely a show you can see with a friend or your kids. Yes, things have changed a little with Jo since we last saw her in the books, but it's still compelling with good stories and good lessons. The actress depicting Jo Bhaer (Michelle Burke) does a wonderful job as the actor playing Nick Riley (Spencer Rochfort). In the course of the series, we get the evolving romance between Jo and Nick, as well as the daily stories and lessons learned by children and students. I recommend this show to anyone.
