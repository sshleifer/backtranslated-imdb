BORN TO BOOGIE is a real "find" - although a rock fan for almost thirty years, I only saw the movie a few days ago and crowned it among the best rock movies of all time; The music is fantastic (T. Rex's cream) and the visuals are constantly exciting and unusual. This leaves this viewer even more beyond the government efforts of Ringo Starr, who has done a good job. If you like the music, you'll be right in T. Rextasy, as Marc Bolan is really the star of the piece, front and center. Even the fact that some songs are repeated does not matter: different places, costumes, musical arrangements and bizarre visual concepts are all used to present different textures and a very exciting humor that has come to an end. a concert film in other hands. As rich and packed as sponsored to boogie, the film is only about an hour long, but what's quite satisfactory. Therein lies my only criticism. The video package suggests something like 71 minutes, and at least one online source claims the movie is 67 minutes, but apparently it's more than 61 minutes of rocking fun.
