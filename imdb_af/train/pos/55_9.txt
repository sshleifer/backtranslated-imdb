I wasn't initially sure I wanted to see this movie if it was on my guide, so I watched it on IMDb and thought the cover looked pretty cool, so I thought I'd try to get a movie like Elephant. expected. <br /> <br /> As soon as I got past the fact that I had failed the Alicia character who had to be played very well by busy Phillips, I realized what good work this movie did for the relationship between Alicia and Deanna to establish. Alicia is so thought that Deanna is played by Erika Christensen almost throughout the film, but in the end we find that despite polar opposition, they have one thing in common except to be present at the shootings. They share loneliness and to what extent it is revealed as the film progresses. <br /> <br /> I just have to say how much I loved this movie and was happy to see all the positive comments about it. I couldn't even get through the Elephant, because it was just like the Columbine tragedy. This movie, on the other hand, was compelling and realistic. Busy Phillips plays off the chain! This is a good thing and I would like to see her progress in some more mature roles.
