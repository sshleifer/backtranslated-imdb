I watched this tape, rewind it immediately, watch it again and laugh twice as loudly. I strongly recommend this band to those who are not hateful, but uncomfortable with transvestites. It shows you that transvestitism is a characteristic, rather than a whole human being. The comedy is not a single problem. This man is brilliant. All comics should strive for his level of listening, intelligence and talent.
