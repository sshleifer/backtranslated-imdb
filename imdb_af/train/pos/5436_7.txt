For years, I thought this knockabout service comedy was a product of John Ford, especially with Victor McLaglen as one of the leaders. It certainly has the same rough home humor that Ford flashes its films. <br /> <br /> To my surprise, I learned it was George Stevens who really aimed it. Yet I refuse to believe that this film is not being offered to John Ford, but he was probably in Monument Valley to make Stagecoach. <br /> <br /> Victor McLaglen with Cary Grant and Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., are playing three Sergeant's in the Indian Army who are going to have a good friend / companion friend. But the old gang breaks up because Fairbanks is engaged to marry Joan Fontaine. Not if its two pals can help it, supported by the regimental beastie Gunga Din as played by Sam Jaffe. <br /> <br /> The Rudyard Kipling poem served as inspiration for this RCO film on barack life in the British Raj. The lead cartoon is so good that it overshadows the incredible racist message of the movie. Not that the makers were racist, but that was the assumption of the British right now, including our prospects, and Gunga Din shows it most effectively. <br /> <br /> The British took India with increments, trading here and there with local rulers under a poor Mogul emperor who was disposed of in the middle of the 19th century. They ruled very little from India, it would have been impossible. Their rule depended on the indigenous troops you see here. Note that the soldiers cannot rise above the rank of corporal and Gunga Din is significantly lower in status than that. <br /> <br /> Note that the rebels are indeed Hindu, not Muslim. There are so many tribes of that religion if there are Christian sects and this strangely cult was quite real. Of course, they may not have the same view of them as liberators. But until India organized its independence movement, until the Congress Party came into being, these people were the voice of a free India. <br /> <br /> However, you cut it, caring people are not a nice thing to do and the British also had their point here. Looking at Gunga Din, I think of Star Trek and the reason why the first directive came into being. <br /> <br /> Cary Grant played his real boyfriend himself instead of the urban Cary, we're used to watching. Fairbanks and McLaglen are doing very well with roles perfectly suited to their personalities. <br /> <br /> However, the best role in the film is Eduard Ciannelli as the guru, head of the strangler cult. Watch the fire and passion in his performance, he blows everyone else on the screen as he continues. <br /> <br /> Favorite scene in Gunga Din is Ciannelli who admonishes his troops in their mountain temple. Notice how Stevens gradually darkens the background around Ciannelli until everything you see is eyes and teeth like a ghoulish Halloween mask. Haunting, scary and very effective. <br /> <br /> It was immediately after the action of this film in the late nineteenth century that more and more of the British public are beginning to question the underlying assumptions that the Raj justifies. But this is the subject of Gandhi. <br /> <br /> Gunga Din is still a good movie, entertaining and funny. It must be shown with a Passage to India and Gandhi and you can see how the Indian independence movement developed.
