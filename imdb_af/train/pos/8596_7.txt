I thought the Sentinel would be a mediocre movie. When I finally saw it, I took a good surprise. The movie is not a good thing, but it is fun and the action scenes are well done. This movie reminds me of TV series like 24 or Alias. It is very similar to the series and it also reminded me of Wolfgang Petersen's thriller In the line of fire. If you are one of the most original and one of the greatest thrillers in the history of movies, you will be disappointed. But if you go with little expectations, you'll enjoy the Sentinel. <br /> <br /> Rating: 7
