zero day is based on columbine high school massacre. and this is a video of two boys. first you don't know what is going to happen, you think it's just a bad student life. until they start talking about the terrible things they are going to do in this school. until they start talking about pipe bombs and guns and go shooting in the forest. they are much to say about this movie. everybody knows this movie is a good movie you forgot to watch a movie and watch a real video made by two boys. <br /> <br /> The two boys act as if they were in a strange cult. they burn all the stuff. like playing station games books dvd's homework things school stuff. These two boys can be someone, your friends, your brothers or the people you see walking down the street. it goes through daily deeds daily (and it makes a gun. In the videos they call it what the bully is happening to them and how people tell things about clothes and the things you are involved in. I don't say she's right but many people do things like that. <br /> <br /> And the thing is, these people are thought to like it because of the sensitive topic they've chosen on this movie. <br /> <br / > so my review day zero. <br /> <br /> let's just say the end shooting scene is messed up.
