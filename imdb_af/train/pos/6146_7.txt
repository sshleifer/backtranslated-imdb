Maybe Disney was hoping for another Mary Poppins, but this is a very different story and while Angela is beautiful, she was a very different artist for the great Julie Andrews. It said Lansbury was thrown perfectly and delivered a magical performance. There is something nice about her character and she is wonderfully supported by David Tomlinson. Tomilinson can carry a song, but he is certainly not much like a singer. It didn't matter he was such a talented actor you barely see. There are a few big cameos of much-loved stars of a different age such as Roddy McDowel who give a winning performance and beloved Tessie OShea who do very little, but it's nice to see the old gal again. It's also great to see Sam Jaffe and the king of English television, Bruce Forsythe, in small roles. The score has some beautiful songs, especially The Briny Sea and The Age of Not Believing. The great number Portabello Road has been stretched to the limit, but it has a lot of theatricality. The effects are still a bit clich√© today, but the scene with German invaders attacked by the wildest army in film is pretty impressive. The kids are not as annoying as other movies, but one struggles to understand what the youngest boy is saying. I loved the march song of the housemate. The housekeeper was very important to Britain and it is a warm tribute. The animation is great, much better than Pixar that I find great. A warm happy movie and it's a wonder it wasn't done on stage.
