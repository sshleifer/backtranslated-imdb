A young woman who is a successful model who is also married and twice committed suicide is chosen by a mysterious and distant association of Catholic priests to be the next "missionary" to the gate to hell. , apparently built by a creepy old but well maintained Brooklyn apartment. His tenants take up the stairs and can reincarnate themselves, but apparently cannot escape as long as a servant is there to close the road. The previous one (John Carradine) is about death, so she becomes the next one by fate or whatever, and the deadly must kill herself so they can be free. Many interesting details lie beneath the surface, her relationship with her father, the stories of the damned, her fianc√©, so one can surrender it as a cheap exploitation horror, but with the sets, the great role and the overall level of bizarre , it is definitely worth seeing.
