I can be biased, I am the author of the novel The Hungry Bachelors Club, published in 1994. The script was written by my good friend and hungry bachelor, Fred Dresch, who was the inspiration for the character Marlon in the film. I could no longer be satisfied with the trailer, I hope to see the movie as a whole and I will comment further. But Jorja Fox, who plays Delmar Youngblood, my character, is stars. She carries most of the emotional vehicles in fine shape. I couldn't have done myself better! It looks like real people, barely formula-driven and grateful, my statement against racial prejudice at home, graceful and sincere.
