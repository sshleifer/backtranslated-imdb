Now, I've seen a lot of movies in my day, but from every single one there were a lot of selections that were very good to me. And I am a 19-year-old man impressed with this movie aimed at a younger audience. It is a very understated gem for those watching foreign films. Almost all the actors are credible, the graphics are decent (for which you don't even mind watching the movie. Trust me, it will be a stupid thing to do), the story is well written and it's a movie that everyone can't just enjoy from the kids. <br /> <br /> Here's basically what this movie made me. The one made me laugh ... many, two, made me feel like the characters you supposed, and three, it's a very high story. By the end of this movie you will feel good. Certainly, which anime out there did not appear to have a young child who had changed into a great warrior and who, in any case, had defeated a great evil. This is a widely used formula. But in this case, it is far-fetched, because although they use puppets for some characters and some average graphs that you would see 5 years ago, they should not be judged. It's very touching, the end is original, and it keeps you in the movie as it is supposed to. However, if you compare it to other movies like "The Never-ending Story" or whatever, it will differ your opinion. Watch it as it is and you'll enjoy it. <br /> <br /> It was a good long time since I was so impressed. The only other movie I got this feeling was when I returned to TMNT when it came out. There's something about this movie I felt about TMNT that really made me love. So don't analyze too much or take this movie too seriously, just enjoy it.
