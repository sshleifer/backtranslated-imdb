I wasn't sure what to expect, but I'm glad I saw it. A smart, slightly twisted comedy that reminds you. I was not quite sure how a director can create nothing but leave it to Mr. Natali and the brilliant individuals at C.O.R.E. To create another low budget set that really looks (as actually as nothing). Well worth your time and money, if you have the opportunity to see it, please go. You'll be glad you did.
