As the story goes into my family, my father, Milton Raskin, played the piano for the Dorsey band. After Sinatra joined the group, my father trained with him for hours. Then my dad told Sinatra at some time that he was actually good at tying such a small group and that he had to venture on his own. By then, Sinatra had enough credits under his belt to do just that! Dorsey never forgiven my dad, and the rest, as they say, is history. <br /> <br /> I have some photos and records for that, and also the Berkley University in California. <br /> <br /> I've seen more than every Sinatra movie more than I want to say, and its movies never get old. . .
