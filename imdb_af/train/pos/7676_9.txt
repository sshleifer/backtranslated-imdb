Brilliant! My wife and I joined the vast line to see Holly at the Edinburgh Film Festival. After watching the movie, I can understand why there was such a long line. Holly is touching an impossible relationship between two people. She is a young girl, he is a devastated Westerner. The film grabbed every leg in our body. There isn't any graphic scene or something that is hard to look at - it's the surrealism of normality that really kicks you in the gut. The film is beautifully shot. Among other things, we had the scene where Patrick Holly learned to drive a small motorcycle. Thuy Ngoyen's ability (can't believe it's her first acting job) and Ron Livingston's performance stayed with me for a few days. Highly recommended.
