Legend of Zu <br /> <br /> I remember well, Tsui Hark's original Zu Warriors made 18 years earlier. More than one Christmas, on a rare week when Channel 4 in the UK showed a week of Hong Kong movies, Zu Warriors was so gripping for a very young viewer and his brother and so memorable that it was in memory of the now grown language ... <br /> <br /> In fact, I think the original Zu Warriors is one of the earliest movies I've seen as a child I can clearly remember the story line and action scenes . And the memories of seeing Yuen Biao, Sammo Hung and others in their classic front. <br /> <br /> When I saw this remake of Zu Warriors, there was a sense of fear. Can it save the dreamy memories of the memory I had from the original, or will it follow the path of other remakes and die a death more horribly than the bad things and their broken necks that you find in that kungfu movies ? <br /> <br /> Well, the answer is I can't say. But that was because it's not really a remake. The stories (and styles) are almost completely different. <br /> <br /> The Legend of Zu tells of the story of King Sky, a lonely warrior, whose master, Dawn, declares her love for him, but her life is taken from her by a monster called Insomnia . Two hundred years later, Insomnia is returned. Dawn is recognized as Enigma, and Insomnia has returned to destroy Zu. Meanwhile, White Eyebrows and Red, with the help of King Sky, are trying to stop Insomnia. <br /> <br /> The plot is not full of twists but has enough detail in it for me. But I can see this movie as one you don't love or hate. The film has many special effects, the majority of which involve several computer-generated environments, such as The Storm Riders and A Man Called Hero. But unlike the other two, this movie was one that didn't overdo the graphics and the whole thing was tasteful. Nothing seems rushed - unlike Held. The backgrounds were complementary to the acting, and did not overwhelm the scenes. <br /> <br /> The story also involves many characters and the mixing of so many individuals makes the movie interesting. It was possibly on the verge of 'too many cooks', but in general each character had its role in the story. But some of the roles seem to me to be "extended cameos," and I'm somehow over to question this necessity. <br /> <br /> Ekin Cheng and Louis Koo play very central roles in the film, but I couldn't say this movie showed their best performances. Cecilia Cheung seems to be aging at least in her scene, but it is pretty pretty raw. Kelly Lin was the new revelation to me. Despite her very short role, I apologized and confessed that I was busy! <br /> <br /> Overall, I have to say, enjoy this movie as much as I enjoy the "original". Since both films are made by the legendary Tsui Hark, the two films are part of a chronicle that shows how films in Hong Kong have changed over two decades. And one nice thing is that you can't really compare the two movies, as many as apples are apples and pears are pears. Eventually, both are very thorough films in their own right. And I go back to remind you by looking at the original again. <br /> <br /> Two to look at but not compare.
