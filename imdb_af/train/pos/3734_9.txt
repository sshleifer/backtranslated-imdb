The inhuman effect of war is a very studied subject in the movies; just like the eternally dehumanizing, but possibly life-saving, dehumanizing effects of military training. Joel Schumacher's 'Tigerland' follows the standard template. We see men treated like dirt, but succeeded as soldiers, with some mutual respect for their commander, and the judgment is reserved for whether such an extreme process can be considered justified. like judging the merits of the war they are trained for (typically, like here, Vietnam). But 'Tigerland' has an interesting performance through his account on a crooked dissident named Bozz (played excellently by Colin Farrell), who understands that all power is ultimately governed by consent and the lack of awareness under their power own complicity. Around this character is a learned, gripping plot built, and it is also a plus that the action never leaves America (while Stanley Kubrick's 'Full Metal Jacket', just another movie of a similar kind, is focused lost after the move to Asia). Although not a film of staggering originality, it is quite well done and captivatingly watching: the best movie of this director I've seen, and among the very best of his genre.
