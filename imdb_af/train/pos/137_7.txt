After some of the negative reviews I heard on this movie, I was doubtful about letting it go, but I had Â£ 3.99 in my wallet and thought about playing a budget like a film and saw it and gave it. glad i did, i enjoyed it. Targeted by starring movies like Chain Reaction, the Ring, Bourne Identity, (Brian Cox), I had to play, even if it was dirty, but it wasn't at all. I found the humor very funny, especially Alfred Molina the star of Spider-man 2 the Character Doc Ock. He was the most enjoyable part of the movie. Of course, like many people who bought this movie, I saw Matthew's name, and it made me feel! And no, its part isn't big at all, it's very short at the end of the movie, it's not a big part that makes me believe why people hate the movie. I suggest you give it a go. Some parts are a poor, well-polished well that needs polishing, the stage work and a little more action. But it is awake.
