Rudyard Kipling once wrote that God has given all people the ability to love the whole world, but since a human heart is very small, every person has that special place where he loves more than any other. It seems like it has become the motto of some of the most prominent directors of today when they confess eternal love for that special place and portray situations in the lives of its inhabitants and visitors. The result is a wonderful collection of short films, Paris je t'aime, in which our guides, Van Sant, Coixet, Cuaron, Payne and others take us on a breathtaking walk through Parisian arrondissements, human feelings, desires and expectations. /> Still another fifteen minutes, always a completely moving story about ordinary people looking for love, whether in a parking lot, art studio, subway station. And Paris your t'aime is about a wide variety of love-love for your partner, child, parent, for those who meant the world to us, but are no longer around, love that needs to be restored, serendipitous love for that stranger as your eyes meet. , or love just not meant to be ... today, but tomorrow - who knows? <br /> <br /> Yet, this movie is not just about love, but life itself, joy, pain, loneliness, confusion, everyday ups and downs. And its main quality is that it is not sweet at all, but rather warm and full of hope. <br /> <br /> I give this movie a 9 because the latter part suggests how some of the stories can evolve, but not all, and that is the thing I lack, and by "further development" means I don't have a specific reference to the characters' future. As far as I'm concerned, I can only say fascinating. Get behind everything, flee to Paris and live the little romance yourself.
