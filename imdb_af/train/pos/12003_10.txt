As a convert in the Church of Jesus Christ of the Last Saints, I try to absorb as much as I can from my new religion's history. I have been invited to attend a show of this film with my sons and other young men and women as well as their families from our neighborhoods. <br /> <br /> On a beautiful spring night we drive to Kirtland, Ohio to the church's historic village there. We had discussions at the Vistor's Center to see this movie. Since my movie viewing was limited to just a few documentary programs, I was intrigued. The only "full-length movies" of the church I saw were "Legacy" and "My Best Two Years", both of which I thought were very well written and preformed. <br /> <br /> Initially, the Missionary interpreter has published tissues explaining that several people have moved deep through the movie to the point of tears. I thought "OK ... but it takes a lot to move me to tears." Imagine my surprise when I cut myself! It is truly a very moving and inspiring will for the Prophet Joseph Smith. <br /> <br /> See it and believe in the powerful message!
