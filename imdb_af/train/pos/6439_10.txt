I got this movie twice within a week and can only sum it up in one word (which I usually don't use lightly): Wonderful! According to me, the best movie ever made. Who deserves Oscars and other awards, if not, this Swedish crew who created cinematic perfection in the last scenes of the film, when all that is said in the story Like the character of Daniel Dareus so many sentiments and long-repressed feelings in the people calling around him, the film did the same to his viewers: You walk out with your head, and your heart is full. Good stuff! The next time you ask yourself, "What is the meaning of life", think of how you feel about a wonderful experience, as it is in heaven: happy, contented, fulfilled. To say this with Virginia Woolf's Mrs Dalloway: "Such moments are enough".
