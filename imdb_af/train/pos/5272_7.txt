Deodato brings us some shocking moments and a movie that doesn't take him too seriously. Absolutely a classic in its own way. This movie offers a refreshing other look at savages. If you get a chance to see this movie, do it. You will have a smile on your face most of the time. Not because it is so funny or anything, but because it is so bad, it goes the other way and gets well, though maybe not clean, fun.
