This movie is shot mainly on a handheld camera by the actors in it. In some ways, a video diary of murderers is in other ways full of a "Columbine" fall. While this movie doesn't answer all the big questions, it gives you an insight into how easy it will be to get away. Through the film you are shown how actors illegally shot guns shot, made pipe bombs and got an action plan for "Zero Day". The actors (if you could call them) were brilliant, they obviously borrowed a lot of their own lives, but at no point did I really act. (Something Tom Cruise must try). The use of the CCTV and the 911 operator at the end was genius, but I don't know if we need the last scene. Overall but a very good movie on a very difficult subject.
