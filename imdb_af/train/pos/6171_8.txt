For those of you who have read Rohinton Mistry's highly respected novel, this film will definitely impress you, as it is an adaptation of the honorable. With the exception of one small subplot, Sturla Gunnarson's feature film debut is an almost dead end recreation of the book (until the last line). <br /> <br /> For those who haven't read the novel, this movie might be a bit tricky. This is certainly not a big dramatic story. Instead, it has a strong element of realism, but I don't want it to be different. The best way to describe such a long trip to movie lovers would be to say it is a small-scale, Hindu version of Fiddler On The Roof. Instead of a Jewish / Russian milker, the protagonist Gustad Noble was a banker in 1970's Bombay during the time of the Muslim Hindi war with Pakistan. He is forced to handle a number of unexpected problems in his life, including his sick daughter, his individualist eldest son, a distant friend who involves him with dirty money and an unhealthy environment. The End is not a happy one, nor is it a sad one, but it is essentially what realism entails. <br /> <br /> Such a long journey is a fine little movie, but if you want to see it, it's good to find it. Unlike the novel, it received very little release.
