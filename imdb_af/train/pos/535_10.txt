A matter of life and death, what can you really say it will do right to the genius and beauty of this movie. Powell and Pressburger's visual imagination knows no boundaries, each frame is filled with fantastic fat compositions. The interactions between the brave colors of the "real world" at the sharp black and white of heaven are ingenious and visually show us just how much more vivid life is. The final court case is also fantastic, as the judge and the jury descend to heaven to hold the court over Peter (David Niven's) operation. <br /> <br /> All the performances are on the verge (Roger Livesey is a conception), and the romantic energy of the movie is beautiful, and there is never a more romantic movie than that (if there) I saw it). A matter of life and death is about the power of love and just how important life is. And Jack Cardiff's cinematography is reason enough to watch the movie alone. The way he makes Kim Hunter's face look, makes her more beautiful, like a genius, he can make a simple thing like a game of table tennis, exciting looks. And the sound design is also impeccable; The way the sound bumps into key points was a decision before its time. <br /> <br /> It is a true classic that can restore anyone's faith in the movie, appreciated at its initial release and today's audiences, but one of my all time favorites, and so I give this movie " a 10/10, in a word - Beautiful.
