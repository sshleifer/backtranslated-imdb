I thought this move was very good. There were a few things that were less than perfect, but overall I was rather surprised. The courtroom scene was finally a bit unrealistic, but was really enough to be entertaining. I found that the movie communicated the hardships to use military training and the sacrifices that accompany it. Being a military pilot I can relate to many of these parts.
