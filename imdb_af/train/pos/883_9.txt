I came back to look at "Read My Lips", a plate of Freedom Freedom in front of me. The food was quickly forgotten, as I was welcomed by director and co-author Jacques Audiard's original and wonderful thriller. <br /> <br /> Carla (Emmanuelle Devos) is a secretary at a firm that is developing large building projects. She actually has significant responsibilities that don't often fall to secretaries and she is competent and ambitious. And is disputed by a male hierarchy that will exploit, but not reward it. <br /> <br /> Work faster than she can handle, and Carla is told to hire a secretary. Give ex-con and general explanation Paul (Vincent Cassel). He talks about his skills and actually has nothing that any legal enterprise may need. After an initial serious misunderstanding by Paul about Carla's interest in him, the two allies become. A strange friendship begins. In a stunt that would have made Carla a great contender for "The Apprentice," she caught her selfish masculine opponent at work with Paul's commitment. Leave the rival. <br /> <br /> Carla is virtually deaf without her hearing aid. With that she heard almost normally. She turns off the hearing aid to defile herself with unpleasant noises and annoying people. She is also very lonely. A heroic make-up was made to clean her a little, but she's really beautiful. She doesn't have a boyfriend. She babysits so a friend can have a liaison (it's a French movie) Worse and humiliating, she comes to a girl's plea to hang somewhere, while the married friend has it with her paramour in Carla's bed. Not nice. <br /> <br /> Since Carla and Paul get to know each other better, the barely oppressed transverse side of the non-earlier criminal occurs. There is a side story of Paul's relationship with his parole officer who complements the main chart neatly and results in his own great surprise. <br /> <br /> "Read my lips?" Genius Paul acknowledges that Carla's ability to read lips, even from a considerable distance, is more than the amusing stall that looks first. <br /> <br /> From there, a caper develops. Enough said. <br /> <br /> Paul and Carla are a real criminal oddball couple. She wants love but will also accept money. He wants her, kind, but business to come before possible erotic saturation. Together, Cassel and Devos are strong actors who carry an unusual crime story to its end. It is very convincing. <br /> <br /> Rent or buy it, but if you enjoy a good crime story, go for "Read my lips." And you might want to see it a few times: I do. <br /> <br /> 9/10
