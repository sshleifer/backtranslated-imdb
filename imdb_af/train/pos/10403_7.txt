It is an Oriental fantasy of a thousand and one Arabian nights. A lot of amazing adventures, fantasy sweets and magicians. The malicious visor Jaffar (played wonderfully by Conrad Veidt) with mighty magical faculties, holding the prince Ahamad of Baghdad (handsome John Justin) who lost his throne, escaped a small thief named Abu (sympathetic Sabu). They arrive at Basora where Ahamad and the princess (lovely June Duprez) fall in love. But Prince and Thief were hunted by Jaffar, Ahamd became blind and Abu became a dog. The story gathers various fantastic ingredients such as starring transformation, a flying mechanical horse, magic, flying carpet and of course the colossal genius (persuaded by Rex Ingram) that gives Sabu three wishes, the magic eye, the figure of goddess Kali with several hands, among others. <br /> <br /> This remarkable picture is one of the best fantastic movies of all time. Produced by London's Fim's Alexander Korda and directed by definitely credited Ludwing Berger, Michael Powell and Tim Whelan with a beautiful screenplay by Lajos Biro and Miles Malleson, the authors and actors of the Sultan, like the Sultan, also spoke to mechanical games. The outbreak of World War II caused the crippling shoot, then the three Korda brothers and co-workers traveled. The USA continued to film Grand Cannon Colorado in particular. The beautiful visual and glittering Technicolor cinematography, setting and FX have won three Oscars: Production designed by William Cameron Menzies and Vincent Korda, cinematography by George Perinal and special effects by Osmond Borradaile is dated today and is urgently needed remastering because colors are exhausted . Furthermore, there is one nomination for the voting and oriental musical score by Miklos Rozsa. This lively story with huge doses of imagination will hold fantasy fans and theatrical classic buffs
