It was actually my favorite series of Scooby Doo when I was younger. I thought every episode had more of it and the villains had a lot of creative thinking in them (and even very scary and credible). Some of the best episodes were: "I left my neck in San Francisco", "Twenty Thousand Screams Under The Sea", "The Ghoul, The Bat and the Ugly" and "When You Wish On A Star Creature". If you've never seen these episodes, please do. This series was a bit of a mixed bag, but there were other episodes that didn't have the same kind of edge for them as Rocky Mountain YIIII! and "The Ransom Of Scooby Chief". Like the series before, it was very good together, interesting storyline and brilliantly drawn. As everyone says, it would have been so much better without Scrappy Doo. The character was tiring and distracting to the story being told.
