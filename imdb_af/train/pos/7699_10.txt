Banned PLANET is one of the best examples of Hollywood SF movies. Its influence has felt more than a decade. Certain elements related to how this wide-screen entertainment was aimed at a fifties now over have dated it, and the movie's sometimes slow pacing doesn't help. But the story's compelling central idea that includes the ancient, extinct Krell civilization and "monsters of the Id" did not lose its appeal and this film remains a relevant "must see" movie. What I am mostly interested in saying here is that the current DVD for this movie is terrible. The film has never really looked so good at home video and its elements have a serious need for recovery. I hope this will happen soon and we get a special edition of this SF classic.
