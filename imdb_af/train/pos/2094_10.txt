Certainly, 65 years have passed since Thalberg's last production was filmed. But fellow IMDB members, come on, this movie is surely one of the 30's masterpieces! It's a 10. <br /> <br /> It was the first movie I saw in 1970 at New York's Modern Art Museum (I was a teenager). Still looking for scenes of such poverty, masterfully photographed, often exciting, and always tempting, it was at my MGM movie at its best. What did audiences feel when they saw a locust, the person through the destruction of a house, the terrible poverty and then the splendor of wealth. <br /> <br /> Last week, those watching the Academy Awards attended a "senior" Oscar winner, Luise Rainer. How big to see an actress who probably chose one of the most masterful, haunting representations in history to return for a festival. <br /> <br /> Okay, so she didn't have to win the previous year (Groot Ziegfeld), but don't blame Luise. Talkies was only a decade old when it was released, and restricted her dialogue. But like Olan, her use of visual and vocal is memorable. <br /> <br /> Large-scale and touch, the more a movie lover can have!
