I really like this movie. All three stars (Connery, Fishburne and Underwood) give credible performances, and Harris is delighted at the top. The lighting and shoe angles in some of Harris's scenes really make his face look deadly. The surprising turn of the plot at the end makes it interesting. Not a good movie, but a nice one. I gave it 7 out of 10.
