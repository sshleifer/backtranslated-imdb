Anyone who thinks anime is nothing but sex and violence will be silenced forever for the movie. It is a fine film that tells of Tetsuro's quest to avenge his mother's death, but also grow up in the process. The journey on the train type represents Tetsuro's journey from boys to masculinity. The music and visual styles of the movie are a bit dated (you can say it's a movie of the 70's) and the animation is just slightly better than your average "Star Blazers" section. But the story and the characters are so strong, it doesn't matter. A must-see for any animation fan!
