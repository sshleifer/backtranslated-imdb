I think Charlotte Gainsbourg is one of the best artists in the world. I can't understand why some people say she's not. Neglected .... ??? Perhaps the one who said she was boring, because he / she was boring. She is a great actress and the movie was excellent. It has many wonderful ideas and very good artists. The direction was wonderful. I portray myself in the French environment with all the sophistication and perfume, flowers, churches, problems, etc. If she goes to the sister's shop, it's just amazing. Everything is good. We have a very good actress, wonderful, for a long time. Alain Chabat and Bernadette Lafont are perfect. I love him more than in his next film, LA SCIENCE DES RÃŠVES. And Eric Lartigau did a very good job. <br /> <br /> Ana
