I actually thought it was a comedy and sat watching it expecting my ass to laugh. Soon it became clear that it was not a comedy, or at least not a "Jim Carrey type". What we looked at was the characters - the movie starts with some pretty, troubled people, gathering to try to fight one of their basic fears - fear of water, fear of swimming. we start to bite into their lives, testify to their problems, guess their thoughts. <br /> <br /> In fact, I made it look much darker than it actually is, and along the chain of events, it quickly brings light and hope to their lives. <br /> <br /> I probably wouldn't have watched the movie, I knew she wasn't a comedy, but rather a drama, but I had good time, enjoyed the story and didn't care spent about 90 minutes with it. <br /> <br /> Many movies deal with the alienation of people in the Western world. This movie shows how people can get together and help each other <br /> <br /> "and if in the light of the dying day you meet her, don't let her pass and leave her, don't lose her, she is you gift from the sun ... "<br /> <br /> 9/10 <br /> <br /> peace and love
