Why is a good actress like Elizabeth Berkley stars in this everyday movie ??? !!! The movie gives good performance (Elizabeth Berkley as a Barbie girl, Ele Keats as a girl without mother and Justin Whalin, a guy who is forever being reduced to his trouble) but the direction is extremely boring and the story is NOT so interesting and original. I can't believe a movie like this was produced for the big screen! Julie Corman (the producer): are you CRAZY ??? !!!
