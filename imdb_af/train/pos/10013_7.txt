As one of the previous commentators said, it laid the foundation of a big movie, but something happened on the way to delivery. Such a waste because Collette's performance was terrible and Williams was credible. I just kept waiting for it to get better. I don't think it was bad editing or needed another director, it could just be the movie. It came as a Canadian movie, like the first few seasons of X-Files. Not cheap, just hokey. Also, it needs a little more tension. Something that lets you jump from your chair. The film reached that moment and disappeared. kind of like a false climax. I can see how to be exciting, would have taken away the "reality" of the story, but I thought the part was reached when Gabriel was in the hospital looking for the boy. This movie should have a track of the director trying to solve these problems.
