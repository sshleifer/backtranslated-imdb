Dev Anand (or Prashant) and Zeenat Aman (Jasbir / Janice) are brothers and sisters raised in single-parent families. Jasbir (the sister) grows in a prosperous environment, but it is not enough to lead her to reject her life and eventually join a hippie movement that eventually leads her drugs. Prashant (the brother), on the other hand, grows in a less affluent environment, but grows into a mature man. The story suggests that Prashant is attempting to save his little sister (who is constantly in trance) from a hostile hippie environment. This movie is the test of time and suggests that cults and hippie groups are a place for those who give up on their lives when they should rather rise and be counted in the presence of the present. Great music compositions in this movie that mean different things in different situations and different people, and the director makes a real sense of it.
