It takes up about a year after the events in "Basic Instinct". Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone) is now in London. While having sex with a soccer player while driving in a car that does not require 110 km / h (ask), she leaves the road and ends in the Thames. She survives - he does not. Police hire psychiatrist Michael Glass (David Morrissey) to see if she is mentally competent to hear. Of course she starts playing with his thoughts and follows many murders and sex. <br /> <br /> This movie was damned before it even opened. It went on forever to get a cast and director, scripts were constant and the movie wasn't happy (Morrissey often complained about the movie). Yet it is not bad. It's much like the first - there's a sumptuous music score, beautiful places, lots of sex and nudity (it had to be edited for a R), a pretty complicated plot and good play, but there is no impact. It feels like a repeat of the first. People are being murdered here with a nice leash (I believe) ... just as people are being killed for the first time with an ice rubbish. In a nice moment, Stone picks up an ice pick and looks after it. She also plays thought with a man and can involve him in murders. The agreements are too clear. <br /> <br /> It also evaluated many Rs. There are many explicit sex talks, male nudity (Morrissey looks much nicer than Michael Douglas), female nudity (Stone looks pretty good) and some bloody murders. The acting is good across the board. Stone is just fantastic here; Morrissey looks sad, but is OK; Charlotte Rampling and David Thewlis are good at supporting roles. <br /> <br /> So - it's not bad at all, but feels like a reminder of the first. Yet I recommend it. People just attacked it because Stone didn't like it well and they thought it was stupid to make a sequel to "Basic ..." 14 years after it was made.
