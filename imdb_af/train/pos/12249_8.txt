Old Jane's fashioned story seems very popular these days. I lost count of the number of versions going there. Probably the reason is that her "ruts" are our "ruts", even on this late date. This TV mini series gives it a fashionable story that is suitable for the novel. Summary Emma is a beautiful "modern" girl when you think about it, although the atmosphere of Jane Austen's world can be a bit artificial today. If you don't look EMMA, I'll just say that self-supporting Emma gets her coming up. It is worth looking at how to know. The acting honors go here to the ladies: Kate, Prunella, Lucy and Samantha. They could have almost had a psychological connection with old Jane!
