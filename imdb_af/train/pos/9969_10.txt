Shawshank, Godfather, Pulp Fiction ... all the good movies. Great movies. But nothing, and I mean nothing, live to the greatest Christmas movie of all, Santa Claus. <br /> <br /> The movie is so big and has so many messages, I cried while I saw it. Seriously, this is one of those movies you have to watch 10 times. When we see Pitch being told he must eat ice cream, we see the sadness in his eyes, and we feel the deep sadness, and then we wonder ... what is so bad about this ice cream? Does this mean that we treat ice as well as everything it does to make us angry? Think movie makes you think. <br /> <br /> This movie has the best version of Santa Claus ever. Unlike other Santas, he is a normal person. We see him in the prison of children and spying on children's dreams, and we wonder; Is the Santa we believe in so much good? This Santa actually actually calls Christ the whole meaning behind Christmas. <br /> <br /> You're sorry to watch this cinematic masterpiece. We just have to stop making movies and do nothing but this epic 24/7. Whether it's Christmas or not, this movie gets a 500/10. Who says this movie is bad is an ignorant fool.
