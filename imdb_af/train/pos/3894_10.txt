I wish I could laugh as much as I first saw for the first time. I've never done it before. <br /> <br /> The strange thing is, I find myself laughing almost as hard after looking at the show again. <br /> <br /> Eddie Izzard is cultivated, gripping, is a man of the world. He is speaking deceitfully about politics and does not feel the need to appeal in political discussion. He's over it. I will contrast him with George Carlin, who uses his comedy to convince people of his ideas and does not seem to have the opportunity to entertain. <br /> <br /> Funniest guy on Earth
