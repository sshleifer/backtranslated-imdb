Lars von Trier's Europe is a worthy echo of The Third Man, about an American who comes to World War II and finds himself in a dangerous riddle. <br /> <br /> Jean-Marc Barr plays Leopold Kessler, a German-Americans who refused to join the US Army during the war, arrives in Frankfurt as soon as the war is left to work with his uncle as a sleeping leader on the Zentropa Railway. What he doesn't know is the war is still going on secretly with an underground terrorist group called the Werewolves targeting US allies. Leopold is strong on either side, but is drawn and seduced by Katharina Hartmann (Barbara Sukowa), the femme fatal daughter of the railway company owner. Her father was a Nazi sympathizer, but is forgiven by American colonel Harris (Eddie Considine) because he can help get the German transport system back on track. The colonel quickly or power signs, Leopold, as a spy (without his choice or chance to think about it) to see if the Werewolves can attack the trains. <br /> <br /> Soon, Leopold gets stuck in an adventure by engaging at both sides of the conflict in a mysterious and film-noir-ish way, where everyone and everything doesn't look what it looks. It is wonderful to look at the naive Leopold for everything (his lover, the terrorists, the colonel, annoying passengers, his disgruntled uncle, even the railway company officials investigating his work ethic) before finally controlling and humorous and violent cooking. The film is endlessly unpredictable. <br /> <br /> The movie is shot stylishly, it always takes place in the night in winter with lots of false snow. She shot in black and white with random color shots. Also, background screens display images that counter counter images in front. Add Max von Sydow's hypnotic narrative, and Europe becomes a dreamy place outside this world. <br /> <br /> It's now a personal favorite movie of mine.
