This is one of the unusual cases in which a movie and the novel it is based on are both great. Perhaps this is because Gorris' takes Nabokov's initial ideas and gives them another interpretation. The final result is a position on Luzhin that makes him more worthy of the Nabokov's one. <br /> <br /> The only thing in the movie I don't like is the influence of Valentinov on Luzhin's fate. I can't imagine Nabokov creating a person like Valentinov and giving him so much influence on the novel's argument.
