I see what my ancestors saw in youthful Bette Davis. She is beautiful in this almost crazy political comedy that actually stares Warren Williams as the political operator, constantly standing behind his maintenance. Vivienne Osborne is brilliant as his ex, and I found myself rooting for her throughout. The Williams character is not sympathetic at all, and he is not even decent. <br /> <br /> Guy Kibbee is one of the best he does. If a candidate has been dragged out of his sleep at a political convention nominated as governor to prevent a competitive candidate being nominated, this whole mess is borne by internal political political warfare in a party called the Progressive Party . If you are of a political mind, you will probably be reflected in a fictional "Progressive Party" by Williams and Kibbee other than the one with whom you are affiliated. I can draw exact parallel, but we're not there. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie for those of us who love these old comedies. If you've ever watched any of the old Wheeler & Woolsey titles (HALF SHOT AT SUNRISE, THE RAINMAKERS), you'll find Frank McHugh, like Williams's right arm, much like Bert Wheeler. He deceived me. <br /> <br /> Yes, both my wife and I recommend this one.
