Just joking about the weight loss thing; Well, you can lose weight you never know. Anyway, what can I say, I love this movie. It has the same sense of youth and innocence that occurs in films such as Stand By Me and The Goonies. Jake's Closet illustrates the beauty of life's simple things and how often we look at them. The film reminds us what it is like to see the world through children's eyes and all the magic, mystery and horror they observe. Jake's Closet offers a unique human story in compassion that anyone who has a youth can interact and fall in love with each other. See it with friends; watch it with loved ones; build a fort wine optional.
