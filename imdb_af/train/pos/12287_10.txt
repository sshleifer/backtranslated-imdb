Although the story is fictitious, it draws from the reality of not only the history of Latin American countries, but also the entire third world. This is the true, pure and raw recent history of these countries, summarized in this novel / film. The cute supranatural things relieve the intensity of historical events presented in this movie. After all the supra-natural things are part of the culture in the third world. Although not critically acclaimed (probably because of the super-natural stuff), it is an excellent film, with a great story and great acting.
