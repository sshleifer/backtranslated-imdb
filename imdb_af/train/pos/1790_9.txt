I love this movie and it is such a wonderful example of a family hazard, a romantic love story and a very sad story. Everything was just as perfect and excellent about this movie. It was such a great mix of actors and actresses and laughed a bit and much of the scream earned this movie many awards. With the mention of a beautiful scenario, and although I would relate this movie to The Notebook and The Family Stone, it was much more cunning, sad and brilliant than those movies. The evening tells of a love story between an old woman who dreams after her younger years and her two daughters stay with her while she is not good. The story that goes back is so strongly told and wonderful I sat on the edge of my seat. You get to know all the characters and by the end I wanted to see it again. It is an amazing sad and lively action and plot movie that is actually one of a kind and must be seen by everyone for how wonderful it really is. All the performances are amazing and the film captures all your attention from the beginning and never lets go. I loved it and am so glad I watched it because it was really an amazing movie ...
