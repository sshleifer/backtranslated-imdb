It was the best Muppet movie I've ever seen! I know Miss Piggy's fantasy of encounter as babies was the cause of Muppet Babies. The songs will stay in my head forever. Likewise, because the silly Nickelodeon show Hey Dude song remains in my head. Sorry, a little bit of the subject there. But anyway I like it, Animal is after the credits that say, "Bye Bye! Bye bye! Bye bye! Bye bye! Bye bye! Hasta Luego!" It made me laugh so hard. My absolute favorite is the play at the end. I was surprised that the Sesame Street characters came into the wedding. I'm just glad this movie was very entertaining. I borrowed it from the library, and now I bought it because I can't keep the library's copy forever. Finally, I declare it's the best movie I've ever seen! In my case, it's even better than Austin Powers in Goldmember, which was my favorite movie!
