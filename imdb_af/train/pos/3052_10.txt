Strange but emotionally disturbing fever about the older man, William H. Macy, who eventually decides to leave the family business (murder of rents), which is being run by his silent, over-proven father (Donald Sutherland) while seeing a shrink ( John Ritter) and flirt with another patient (Neve Campbell). <br /> <br /> Talk about a big dilemma, but "Panic" is a top-notch thriller that looks like "American Beauty" meets "The Professional". Macy and Sutherland are the standouts here. Notable debut for first time writer / director Henry Bromell. I'm surprised this movie hasn't been in the theaters for more than a few weeks.
