I'm so upset that ABC is on another show that gets the chance to be a real winner. This show is so good, the writing and storyline were wonderful, a real original idea for a show instead of another boring reality program. The casting was spectacular! Not only were the characters and actors right, but it is a very talented set of actors. The concept and idea is really a new and cool idea for a TV show. Many of us share this whole idea of ​​"connections". I really love the characters of Steven, Laura, Whitney and Damien. But to be honest, there isn't one person linked to this show that I didn't like, even those that only included a few episodes (for example, Sheri Appleby). The acting and characters are so easy to hold and so talented !!. I wish ABC gave this show more of a chance, and didn't interrupt the show, nor advertised enough. Really unfair !! to everyone !!. This show has shown great promise. I will tell ABC how I feel and will continue to send emails to keep this show alive. Please come with me, I know we can do it. It worked for Jerico. (By the way where is episode 13? I want the last show!). Please support this view and email ABC, we can do it !!! This show is worth it!
