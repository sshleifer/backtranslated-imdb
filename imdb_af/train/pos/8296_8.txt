Everything is idyllic in Suburbia when the small family moves in because the father has a new job in a computer company there. But no paradise would be complete without its snake. Strange things happen when the family joins the local country club without the man, as it definitely holds secrets. The father is not a cutter, but there is pressure on him to attend, as all who are nearby and at work are members. Robert Urich's good old part is a little lukewarm, but Joanna Cassidy as a good natural housewife turns nasty. Suspenseful and well-made chiller with a bitchy Susan Lucci as club chair. Watch out for cult lover Michael Berryman in a little bit of a fall. The movie captures the sense of paranoia and the special effects final is worth the wait. I saw this movie quite a few times.
