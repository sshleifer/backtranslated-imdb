It's not under Jimmy Stewart's best movies - I soon admit it. But while some consider his movie as pure propaganda, I wonder what is so wrong? Yes, surely, like the TV program THE FBI, it is a clear case that the Bureau is doing PR work to try and support. But, as entertainment goes, it's a good job. Plus, surprisingly enough for the time being, the film focuses more on crime than espionage and "Commies". Instead, it's a fictionalization of one of the earliest agents and the career he chose. Now considering the agent played by Jimmy Stewart, then it is pretty certain that the acting and writing were good - as it was a movie with a real budget and a studio that didn't want to waste the star in a third movie . So overall, it's worth seeing, but not very good.
