Well, it's definitely different from anything else Lynch recommends. No supernatural things, no violence, no curse. Nevertheless, this is a beautiful movie. It is a bit slow but maybe it was deliberate, because it is the story of an old man's 6-week trip (this is my best guess for his expensive journey). The characters are everyday people and so they are credible. The performances are good and the final scene was incredibly touched. Everyone who has a brother or sister can connect to it. Lyle and Alvin don't even have to say anything. For a moment they are back in the old days and all the battles have been forgotten.
