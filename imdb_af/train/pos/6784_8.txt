I love Ronald Colman, dashing and debonair, the fellow you see in movies like If I was King and Kismet. I love him as the symbol of civilization as in The Lost Horrizon and Random Harvest. A brotherly batsman is not a favorite of mine. <br /> <br /> But in a double life exactly because his role as actor Anthony John is so indifferent to him, Colman was recognized for 1947 with a best actor Oscar. became his best-known part. <br /> <br /> Colman is an actor who really takes the Method seriously. He just completed a successful race in a comedy of ways and he is quite the jovial man. For a change of pace now that the game ended his Broadway race, Colman brings a revival of Othello to New York. About the opposite part you can get. <br /> <br /> His leading lady in both is his former wife, Signe Hasso, who loves him a lot, but can't change his mood when he's at work. Colman loves her too and wants her back. But he is looking for a spiritual collapse when he confuses himself with the jealous Moor Othello and Hasso with her role as Desdemona. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, as a poor waitress picking up a depressed colleague, Shelley Winters gets in the way of his madness and she comes up like poor Desdemona in the play. Likewise, killing and now it's a case for killer Joe Sawyer. <br /> <br /> Colman's performance is so good that one is great, is it a professional danger with actors? I will be so scared if there are unresolved homicides in or around Laurence Olivier and Orson Welles, they have set up Othello. <br /> <br /> I couldn't buy the story so well, but I'm definitely complaining to Ronald Colman and what he did with that part. I'm sure there was a little regret in him winning the Oscar, as one of the other nominees was his good friend, William Powell, for Life With Father. Others in the course of the year were Gregory Peck for the Lord's agreement, John Garfield for body and soul, and Michael Redgrave for Rouen being Electra. <br /> <br /> Colman gets support from the rest of the role, including Edmond O'Brien who finds himself in the unwanted part of Cassio in Colman's jealous fantasy. Yet, you can't find an Iago equivalent in a double life, no one produces the jealousy. It's all in his own mind. <br /> <br /> One of the most cultured and civilized thoughts of the last century.
