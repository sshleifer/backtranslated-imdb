Thanks to a clever writing and a steady hand of writer / director Kevin Meyer, "Perfect Alibi" is an entertaining and very fun mystery griller. The film begins methodically and builds up steam as the clues begin to reveal that nothing seems to be. Teri Garr and Hector Elizondo are great if they work together to unravel the mystery, and remind me of Nick and Nora Charles, of the "Thin Man" movies. Kathleen Quinlan is excellent as Alex McArthur's tormented wife and character roles, played by veteran actors Charles Martin Smith, Bruce McGill, Anne Ramsey and Estelle Harris, are well done and provide very light moments at the right time. There is even a cameo by Rex Linn. Anyway, I felt I had read a good book in the fire.
