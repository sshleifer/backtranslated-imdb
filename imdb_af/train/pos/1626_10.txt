This movie is actually FUNNY! If you want to rest your brain for an hour, you should see it now. It's called blond and lace, so don't expect deep and meaningful jokes. What this movie is and enjoy all the stereotypes we have about two blondes. It's just a funny movie to watch on a date or with friends (especially if you're not sober. Lol) Pamela and Denise are still nice chicks. It's a mistake to judge this movie as an art piece. Come on, this movie is about BLONDS! It is supposed to be light, funny and superficial. One more thing, I don't think girls will appreciate and like this movie, but man will definitely.
