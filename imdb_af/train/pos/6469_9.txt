This is a very big short of Hal Roach. That's because of two main reasons: The smallest kids in the short are one of the cutest ever on film and the plot has so many funny and well-written elements. <br /> <br /> As for the smallest of the Little Rascals, at age four, I can't honestly think of a smaller child than Spanky. Despite being a rather clumsy and unattractive child later in the years, he was just precious here. And placing the little, little boy in control of even younger children was not just funny, but again high on the cute factor. <br /> <br /> After the older kids fired Spanky to do this horrible babysitting, all sorts of funny chaos broke loose. The gags are reasonably efficient and well done for the time being - with a casual crank call involving a murder and a final scene, where Spanky finally gets the control of the little ones. I haven't seen these shorts for many decades and I'm glad I gave this one a chance.
