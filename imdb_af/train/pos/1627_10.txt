Blonde and Blonde have Pamela Anderson and Denise Richards in almost every scene and if you want more of a movie, you're totally unreasonable. It feels like a late era, Carry On, when the series was no longer burning paths, but was still funny than not, thinking behind or England and you won't be too far from the point. Pamela and Denise are bubbly, charming and clearly aware, this is not a masterpiece they make, although you can give it to me about many things to tell. The supporting role is energetic, even though some of them are not very good; I can't see a few duff turns in a movie that has already been practically forgotten, and make many differences for anything, so don't smile. I really think Blonde and Blonde are bait and I hope you hate me for that.
