DONE IN 60 SECONDS / (2000) *** (out of four) <br /> <br /> "Gone in 60 Seconds" is an energetic, smooth, stylish action photo with high octane strength and lots of fantastic search engines. If you're interested in cars, this production, by producer Jerry Bruckheimer ("Con Air", "The Rock") is worth seeing just to see your eyes on the gliders. Although the film separates a stench of weakness in many areas, the precise feeling of action and excitement is a moderate successful summer excitement. <br /> <br /> The movie stars Giovanni Ribisi ("The Mod Squad") as a young villain named Chicken Raines, who, like the movie opens, fails to list a long list of expensive cars to the powerful criminal Raymond Calitri (Christopher Eccleston). When Kip's life is threatened, his older brother, Randall, "Memphis" Raines (Nicolas Cage), a retired but skilled car thief, is requested to complete a task in exchange for the survival of his brother: fifty steel cars specified by model, color, year and make-up in only four days. <br /> <br /> For the first three days, Memphis pays a team of bandits to help him pull off the lift. The crew includes Sara "Sway" Wayland (Angelina Jolie), a sexy but cunning retired motorcyclist who knows Memphis through previous affairs, a co-named Mirror Man (TJ Cross), the aging and wise Otto Halliwell ( Robert DuVall) Tumbler (Scott Caan), Atley Jackson (Will Patton), Toby (William Lee Scott) and Donny Astricky (Chi McBrde). <br /> <br /> Contribution to the movie's excitement and tension is a sub-plot involving two police detectives, Roland Castlebeck (Delroy Lindo) and Drycoff (Timothy Olyphant), who suspect that Memphis and his crew to zero is good and keep an extra eye on them. <br /> <br /> There is not much time for character development here; The audience gets these people, although they know their lively lifestyle, and wear tough personalities through the film's hard core, stylish atmosphere. To make matters worse for the film, the characters with a sharp cultural tone are not defined. I'm not saying that I think profanity and vulgarism are needed for the exciters to thrive; I actually demand the director's decision to keep out of an extremely dirty language in a movie, which earned an R rating very effortlessly. However, I believe in a movie like "Gone in 60 Seconds," to develop the character's relief strongly, dialogue must be credible and authentic. <br /> <br /> Despite problems, the characters are efficient because of the top level, perfectly thrown artists who are responsible. Nicolas Cage's melodramatic performance is intense and convincing. Angelina Jolie's cunning appearance is quite appropriate here. Delroy Lindo is wonderfully firm and credible. Giovanni Ribisi, Scott Caan, Robert Duvall, Will Patton and Christopher Eccleston offer persuasive support roles. <br /> <br /> The film features standard structure, with a satisfying first action that captures the story's style and character's motives, setting a fast-paced theme of action, but lacking in depth and strong character introduction. In the second action, we still have a few problems: the story wastes time during half of this segment, and never really builds on the third action. While the center of the movie takes a lot of time, and a sex scene offers a solid middle chart, it doesn't quite happen. The third action is actually a mere adrenaline rush with angry wall-to-wall excitement and one of the most intense motorcycle jacks ever filmed. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack to "Gone in 60 Seconds" carries a good deal on the inspirational action scenes. These are screens like the car hunters who make this movie work despite several devastating errors. Dominic Sena, whose career consisted mainly of advertising, has an attractive style and a decisive attitude in "Gone in 60 Seconds", which will provide audiences with two hours of excitement, excitement and excitement, but not much more. <br /> <br /> <br />
