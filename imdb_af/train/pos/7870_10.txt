The film is a true show of how unemotional and selfish the upper society has become. It has many characters and each character represents another category of person. No character is 100% good and moral, unlike the heroes of all the typical Indian movies and no character is 100% bad, but everyone is just different. The movie is a perfect mix of emotions, drama and entertainment. For the very first time, I had a movie that raised some social questions. I would recommend everyone to watch the movie. Madhavi Sharma is a journalist who covers Bollywood's hip-hop parties for the newspaper, but this is the story of how she becomes a newspaper crime reporter. But that's not all, then it shows how she couldn't survive there and when she helped save some innocent children, how brutally her voice was suppressed. Even she gets fired from work. Then she couldn't find a work of crime reporter and had to do it again. Not only her, but also a very large number of characters are interwoven in the movie and everyone gives different feelings while watching the movie. I would like to congratulate the director on making such a big movie. Please do not afford to miss it.
