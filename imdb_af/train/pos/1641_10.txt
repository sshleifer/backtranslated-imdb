I saw it on PBS 25 years ago. It was very difficult to watch. So actually. Looking at this little family struggle in winter was sad. No time for court: the lot threw us together and put our shoulders to the millstone and made it work. It was based on the woman's real diary, which I read many years later. She said in her diary that her parents had died when she was little and all their plagues and sisters had to work the farm to feed themselves. She learned to reap, which was not a lady. She was afraid that no prince's charm would want a woman with tanned, clad hands, but this man was so happy that his new wife knew how to reap, and she was happy to do so. Both were widows and together they worked to build a new home. It was so sad when the baby died. Of course, if they had it today, I'm sure it would be good. It just makes the tragedy extra sad. I cry so hard. But then they went out and successfully pulled out a new calf. Spring is on its way and life continues. In her diary she still had two sons and they lived.
