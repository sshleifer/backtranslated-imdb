Other commentators also set out the plot and the social parables and comments (or better) I could, but I would like to take part in this little jewel of a movie. It involves much more than 50 years later in every category - script, acting, photography, set design, sound design ... it's actually a classic kind. It was my first exposure to the "young" Alec Guinness, and it is clear from the first frames that made him so special to finally get a knight. <br /> <br /> I only evaluate it as an "8" because it is actually a light parable that examines human nature, but it doesn't really make it; And because the plot takes the easy way out in the end, rather than actually resolving conflict between the inventor and the mill workers and industrialists that drive him across the town. Also, a few minutes of thought reveals the basic flaw in the logic of the script - wear is hardly the determining factor in purchasing new clothes (especially clothing); Children grow up, people change sizes, gain and lose weight, and keep up with the latest fashions, as long as the tissue is woven. And if nothing else, the manufacturer would make a fortune providing indestructible materials for military uniforms (especially BDUs). <br /> <br /> Still, it's a good movie. If you get the chance to see it on a classic movie channel, you need to.
