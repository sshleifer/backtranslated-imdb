Sports movies have never been my thing, but a little of them work for me. The best ones are those who focus less on the sport and more on the character, such as Raging Bull, the Wrestler and Girlfight. It's a good legal message for Karyn Kusama, and an excellent first performance for Michelle Rodriguez. Girlfight feels realistic and involved, it's enough to make it a memorable movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is enough forward. Princess Guzman is in her fourth year of high school, but due to her picking battles in the corridor she is close to eviction. As a possible way to unleash her anger, she records for the Boxing lessons at the club where her brother is training (on the wishes of his father). <br /> <br /> Over the course of ninety minutes we saw the viewers something extraordinary. Princess almost literally changes from a girl to a woman. We see it in her body as well as her behavior, especially if one of the boys at the club has drawn her to her and she gets it in. There isn't a bad scene or a lame / confronted moment in the movie. The only mistake I can say can be corrected is that one of the subplots ends up feeling like an unfinished note. Apart from that, Girlfight is a good movie.
