This movie surprised me, it is and will remain my favorite movie of all time, mainly because it has virtually rolled every emotion into its 157 minutes. What is the hardest part I have to take is that when I want to hear the incredible music and songs from the movie, put it in my DVD player, so I wonder if anyone knows who's singing the songs in the movie and wherever they can be found, as I watched everywhere, I can think sporadically over the past 5 years. My favorite quote from the movie is when the court says in court: "But asking your own words for direct confrontation, isn't it a direct call for violence?" Biko replied, "Well, you and I are in confrontation, but I see no violence!" <br /> <br /> CRAIG ROBERTSON Fife, Scotland
