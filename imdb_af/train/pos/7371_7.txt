An exciting thriller that is similar to liberation as to scenery and surroundings. There are also some very innovative shots and good music, though the folly and sometimes seemingly dishonest attitude of one of the characters is inappropriate for the situation, although it is not a mayor problem. It also raises interesting questions about vengeance and limits of friendship. <br /> <br />
