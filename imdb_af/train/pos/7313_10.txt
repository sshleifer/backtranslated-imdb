Some spoilers If you're a big horror movie fan, you'll know that Halloween has paved the way for many slasher movies. Often copied, never duplicated, this movie is a real horror classic and is definitely one of the scariest movies ever made, if not the scariest. I actually saw this movie after seeing the rest of the series (don't ask me why). I honestly saw the other 7 movies before I saw this one, that's just how it worked out. But I'll have to say this one blows everything else away. It's really scary, and since Michael is challenging from the back of a forest or wandering in the dark, it sends your spine down. My favorite part of the movie was when Michael stabbed a man and leaned his head on one side. It is one of the first images in film history. <br /> <br /> Later slashers, like the Friday 13th movie, were more fun and less intense than this movie. I like the F13 series better than the Halloween series, but this movie alone is better than all the F13 movies. Michael Myers is such a scary villain because he is realistic, you can imagine a crazy man like him going to kill people. I admit that this movie gave me nightmares after watching it for a few nights. <br /> <br /> What is good about this movie is that it does not rely on humor or humor to entertain the audience. It's just pure terror. It's too bad, the later movies of the series have swung about this one, as it is so good of an example of a spectacular treasure trove movie as they come.
