This movie is incredibly realistic and I feel a great deal of justice to the crime that many people do not understand because of a lack of experience. The many people who think they can understand what goes through a victim's mind are arrogant. As a victim, I feel that Dawson has done a fantastic job in Maya's role. I agree that this is an incredible brave movie. It looks like rape of another, more realistic point of view than any other movie I've ever seen on the subject. The end has dragged a bit for a while, but I know that many victims suggest this kind of justice, since the chances of an attacker jailed for their crime are about 1%. It is good to see a movie closer to reality than most would dare.
