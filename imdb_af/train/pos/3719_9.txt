Just captured at the Toronto International Film Festival. It's a good story, said in a compelling way. The handheld camera approach to action scenes is added to the intensity of the scenes (in a documentary style, not a Blair Witch style). Joel Schumacher shows he doesn't need a big budget to create a nice movie. <br /> <br /> The actors were strong, especially the actor who plays the focus of events in the movie, Boz.
