EVERY TIME there were different kinds of movies. These different movies came together, although each one had something different to offer .... <br /> <br /> It seems obvious at first, but I thought I would indicate it during this review because it Looks like some people may have forgotten. It's just a fun movie for Pavarotti fans. That's all it is. It doesn't claim anything else or something bigger. People who refuse it as something that does not have a promise do not see the whole picture - literally. Hollywood always makes movies that are scandalous vehicles for people. (Bodyguard or The Preacher's Wife with Whitney Houston are two examples that are out of sight.) <br /> <br /> First I want the movie as a Pavarotti vehicle. There are worse things in this world - and worse movies. The song is fantastic and the choice of arias is fun. The movie starts with Schubert's Ave Maria and then Leoncavallo's Matinatta. Pav sing arias from La Gioconda, Manon Lescaut and Turandot, but also sing popular music such as "I left my heart in San Francisco" and the song nominated for an Oscar & Golden Globe, "If we were in love" music by John Williams & lyrics by Alan & Marilyn Bergman - all 3 previous Oscar winners. <br /> <br /> The story isn't that bad. It's built for Pavarotti, so of course it's not going to be deep or universal on the average movie viewer. It is a story of a famous opera singer who was traumatized on a bad night at the opera years ago. When asked to sing again, the "MET" in NYC loses its voice of fear. Doctor Pamela (or Pah-MAY-lah in Italian :)) played by Kathryn Harrold - gives him a shot to heal his psychosomatic reaction. He offers her the opportunity to whistle with him, and she accepts with reluctance. <br /> <br /> They start a relationship, she knows he's married and promises not to fall in love with him and he thinks she'll just be another woman. Despite this, they fall in love (so the song "IF we fell in love") and with her help he overcame his fear and goes back to the MET where he triumphs. I won't tell you how it ends, but it's pretty predictable. It's not always a bad thing. <br /> <br /> The performances in this are not that bad. Pavarotti (who plays Giorgio Fini) is not an actor, so if you expect a Spencer Tracy or Tom Hanks performance, you will be deceived, not Pavarotti. He knows he's not a thespian. What he is is cute, charming and charismatic. He's making himself fun, and if you just let yourself have fun, it's not that bad. One funny line is when he tells Pamela (Harrold) that she is a thirsty plant, Fini can give you water! "and of course, she says," I don't want to be watered by Fini! " Kathryn Harrold loves and does a good job as a semi-uptight woman who learns from this exorbitant man to live a little. One of my favorite lines in the movie is: "Life should never be life size." And there is Eddie Albert who does his normal good job as Fini's manager. There are several "self" cameos by real conductors, singers, etc. And it is filmed on site at the Metropolitan Opera in Lincoln Center. <br /> <br /> If you like opera, if you like Pavarotti, or if you just let yourself go and enjoy a "little fling" as he suggests in the movie, then you can enjoy this movie for what it is. I know I do every time. :) <br /> <br />
