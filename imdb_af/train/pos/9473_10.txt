I was fortunate to see it on a preview of last night (October 20) and I was incredibly surprised by the wonderful plot and truly heartwarming. <br /> <br /> While the plot is not particularly complicated or extremely new, the story unfolds in a way that feels fresh, unique and clear "indie" in style. It's not something that can easily be compared to past films, but it is a unique kind of classic middle-aged depressive love story. <br /> <br /> I was particularly hit by the decisive movie of the movie. Up to every last extra in the family it was a beautiful and talented role. The three daughters did a wonderful job, the talent was evenly distributed between them and none of them delivered the other two. <br /> <br /> It was really a great movie suitable for all ages and laughing out loud funny as it really gets and heart warming. It was a wonderful break from the generation of jokes and nudity of recent films.
