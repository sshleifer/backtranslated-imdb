An unexpected pleasure because I didn't hear anything about this movie. <br /> <br /> Disgusting because it has a wider audience. <br /> <br /> A wonderful human story with a social message quietly said, although predictable in its resolution. Solidarity acted by the principals. Beautifully photographed with muted colors swinging at gray, capturing the nostalgic tone of the film. <br /> <br /> My recent decline in Chinese film (Shower, The Road Home, Not One Less) was an exciting one I hope to continue investigating. China and its people are a wonderful canvas for filmmakers. "The King of Masks" can be highly recommended as a starting point for anyone who is also interested in recent Chinese film. <br /> <br />
