But this is a great martial arts movie. Liu Chia Liang does not stand for anyone as a combat choreographer, only comparing Sammo Hung at its best. It is immediately evident from his proud display of technique - just like flashing camera angles. - during battles. The direction is tightly controlled to excite not only the speed and movement of the viewer, but to scare her with the exact skill displayed. This film also benefits from Liu's participation in the camera. Liu's performance at the banquet scene opening the film is one of the highlights of Kung Fu film history. Liu is supported by the beautiful and talented Hui Ying Hung (from My Young Tannie Fame) and 'Hsiao Hou' whose acrobatic apsem is, and preferably for any amount of wire work. As for the plot, this film follows the non-unusual theme of revenge, but with character and moral development on the move, and a most appropriate resolution. The humor in this is also the best. If you just watch one kung fu movie ever, it would be a good choice - it has everything.
