One of the many Mare Melodies cartoons that entertained American movies during World War II shows Bob Clampett's "An Itch in Time" a hobo flea that sits on Elmer Fudd's dog. The old man becomes a real sadist while he makes a house on the dog's back, but Elmer warns the dog: "One more shoulder watch and I'll give you bath!" Meanwhile, the flea makes dynamite on the dog! * And that's not the end! I noticed that in one scene Elmer read a comic book with Bugs Bunny and Porky Pig. Clearly, Elmer and Bugs often co-die, but Elmer never co-dies with Porky (unless you're the very short "Any Bonds Today?"). But to me the thought of Elmer about these other famous characters from his own genre is the metaphysical nature of his world, as though he knew about their existence in his universe, although they did not appear in this cartoon. <Br /> <br /> Of course I'm probably going too far in my analysis. I'm sure the cartoon is meant to be pure entertainment, and it is definitely entertaining. As for the "I might like this line", it sounds like something that the sensors did not allow but somehow missed; I, for one, don't really know what it's supposed to sound like. Was it something sexual? In the end, I thought I saw everything, I would be tempted to search more, rather than doing what the cat did (though it was neat). <br /> <br /> * The guys behind these cartoons probably had a thing for TNT, didn't they?
