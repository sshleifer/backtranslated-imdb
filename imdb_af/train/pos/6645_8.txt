An ultra-modern home in an affluent environment is the cause of each of its inhabitants bizarre (and lethal) behavior. Or at least that's what Lara Flynn claims Boyle's character, Col Kennedy. After a series of deadly incidents in a gigantic house next door, Col knows something to give. Mark-Paul Gosselaar also dies as the mysterious architect. <br /> <br /> My opinion: The House Next Door works because of Lara Flynn Boyle and the places (beautiful home) and stylish sets. Boyle is a talented and dynamic actress, not to mention completely stunning. She brings credibility to her character and makes the film intriguing. Without her it would have failed. "It is so alive" states a prospective buyer with reference to the house. Yes, it lives. But the story itself is not so much. <br /> <br /> To prevent Boyle's presence from happening much here, as a huge amount of movie is spent or waiting to see how the house will affect its current owners. The results are predictable. But I kept it anyway. The cinematography gives the film a polished look. 8/10 based on Boyle, the prospect of an evil ultra-modern home, the places and cinematography, and decoration and wardrobe.
