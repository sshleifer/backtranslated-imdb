I recently read the novel "Mother Night", I have owned the DVD for quite some time, and watch it so often. Few movies I have owned and seen have reminded me and as much as Mother Night has, I am amazed at the brilliance, not just from Vonnegut, but from the translation of his text to the screen. <br /> <br /> Don't rent or watch this movie on VHS, it should be done on DVD, and it must be accompanied by the director's commentary on the movie. To see how they have taken a fairly simple story, yet were complicated in their content and dialogue, and made it work so well, I think any viewer will be surprised. <br /> <br /> The deletions in the movie are little of the text and do not frighten it much, the movie can only be the book and is the best fit I've ever seen. I recommend the book and the movie so that it means a disorder to just say look. <br /> <br /> It will change you if you do.
