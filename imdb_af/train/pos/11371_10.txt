This is a remarkable piece of cinematic performance. From the beginning I was totally addicted to the (real) story Lt. Viktor Burakov (Stephan Rea) is crying as he performs the autopsies on the remains of children's bodies. It is then the compelling story of Andrei Chikatilo, played wonderfully by Jeffrey DeMunn (The Green Mile). In fact, he plays it so well and so sympathetically that the viewer almost makes him miserable until we remember what he is. The psychiatrist Dr. Alexandr Bukhanovsky, marvelously played by Max Von Sydow, was utterly credible in every detail and the point he made when talking about paranoia in the Soviet Union is made clear by the actions of the Communist Commissioner Bondarchuk's local action. Joss Ackland. For me, however, the outstanding show was by Donald Sutherland, who once again proved what an excellent character actor he really is. I was almost in tears when he told Burakov how the FBI followed so closely and admired his work. This film depicts Silence of the Lambs in the shade, from the atmospheric and stunned Soviet landscape, to the superior performances of everyone involved. <br /> <br /> I rate this movie 10/10
