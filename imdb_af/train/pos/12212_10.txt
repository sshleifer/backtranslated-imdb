What is so taboo about love?! People seem to have great problems with the transgender. <br /> <br /> The title of this movie didn't catch my eye. It was about 4 minutes in the movie, which caused me to stop switching. I couldn't believe how freaking this movie was wonderful. It touches so many levels of human emotion that it hasn't failed to move me one way or another. This is by far one of the best independent movies I've ever seen. I didn't see these characters as gender, just human. I would recommend it to anyone who loves movies. Especially independent films. Praise all fearless filmmakers!
