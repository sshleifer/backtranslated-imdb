It's been almost 5 years since the release of this stylish action movie. I watched this movie almost 10 times and this is a good effort by Gautham. From my perspective, I feel this movie is virtually flawless. Surya as ACP Anbuchelvan-no doubt.classy.Yyothika played her role as Maya very well. The character fits her very well. The character who caught the attention of filmmakers was Pandia.Jeevan played the role of Pandia very well. Ruth and terrifying .Jeevan earned the Best Villain award in the ITFA 2004. The supporting role of Daniel Balaji, Devadharshini and others did well. <br /> <br /> Racy screenplay, perfect timely dialogue and brilliant narration by Gautham. The soundtrack by Harris Jeyaraj is all grave busters while the BGM fits the movie very well. Cinematography by RD Rajasekhar is rich. Peter Hein choreographed the stunts well. The editing of Edthony is exactly. Above all, Kaakha Kaakha is a perfect police film filled with real doses of action and romance. <br /> <br /> Even some Hollywood movies can't compete with Kaakha Kaakha ... no doubt.
