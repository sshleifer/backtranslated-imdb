After Chicago I started losing all respect for Richard Gere and then came The Flock. There is just such a nice smile and some face movements can get you, but he proved me that he eventually got his craft and could act with the best of them. Clare Danes was also super as his "pupil / replacement". Some have suggested that there was too much unnecessary violence, but I don't see it. Nothing I've seen has detracted from the power of this movie. I was really shocked. I didn't hear it being released in the theaters and instead came to Blockbuster. Really an exceptional movie with just the right blend of action, excitement, excitement and social awareness. As good as 7? Well, maybe. And you'd better see from scene than someone ever got from Pitt.
