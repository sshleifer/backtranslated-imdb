Critics need to revise their class as a quality film. I think the critics have seen too many feature films and have succumbed to the Matrix style of movies. Europe is a fresh air, a film with so many layers that viewing is not enough to understand or appreciate this outstanding film. Lars von Trier shows that old films can make wonderful cinema and build drama and tension. The back projection effect he uses during the movie awakens the characters and raises the focus of the conversation they have. Other effects he uses like the color and black and white in one scene, such as Hitchcock and the girl with the red dress, grab the attention and increase the drama and meaning of the scene. The commentary is wonderful and has a hypnotic effect, and again focuses on the central characters in the scene and there acts. <br /> <br /> I could talk about the effects more, but I think everyone will agree that they are pushing it into a category of its own, and really raising the drama of the movie. A movie to buy if you don't already have one and one to see if you don't have it. <br /> <br /> 10/10 Don't miss this artistic noir movie from one of the great movie directors.
