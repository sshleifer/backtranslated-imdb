Have you ever, or do you have a pet that has been thick and thin to you with whom you are lost and who you love, no matter what? Betcha never thought they were feeling the same way about you! <br /> <br /> Wonderful, wonderful family movie. If you have a soft place for animals, it is guaranteed to make you cry regardless of your age. I always watched this movie when I was a little kid, and I find it now, at the age of sixteen, I am as sweet as I am. I could never decide on a favorite character, and I still don't think I can! I love all three animals. The dialogue looks very real and comfortable, like a loving but feasting family. I like Chance, and in the end he says he eventually has a family. Cheesy, yes, but one must remember that this is a family movie, and it fulfills the role perfectly. Sassy has just the perfect dose of sassiness and Shadow is the perfect leader / role model for the young, adventurous chance. <br /> <br /> The animals relieve the people, but of course most of the slow moments are during an interaction with them (ie, to save Molly and the end). Not to mention the incredible soundtrack that gives even more emotion every moment, and a concomitant heart-feeling. I give it 9/10. To be compared to (and even better than Cats and Dogs and Babe).
