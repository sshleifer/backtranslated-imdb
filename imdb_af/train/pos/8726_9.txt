Now that's what a family movie should be! There are some recent films that have been targeted at families or children who are really worthy of their public opinion. but this is one of them. My whole family got away from the movie, awake, entertained, blinded and happy. We still mention small anecdotes here and there. The kids loved it and so we (hubbie and I are 36 and 32 respectively)! <br /> <br /> Apart from its beautiful and striking animation, the characters (small as they may be, and imaginative) are very well developed. There is not one with whom you cannot empathize. The personalities that bring these little creatures to life are well-cast voice talents, combined with the skill and artwork of some of Disney's best animators. This is a film worthy of Walt Disney himself. I think Mr. Disney will warmly approve this new movie ... Flick, Dot and their little heroes group can be as popular as Mickey and Minnie in our time. <br /> <br /> It's one of the family lets the theater see again .. and buy to own on video or DVD. I'm eager to see it again. To pick up what I missed for the first time. (I have never seen my children so quickly and previously identified with characters and embracing characters. My daughter is still talking about little "Dot".) <br /> <br /> This movie is funny, heart-warming, smart and wonderful . fun for the whole family!
