Domini Enfilren (Marlene Dietrich) cared for her father most of her life. Now that he's dead, she's free - but doesn't know what she wants. Boris Androvsky (Charles Boyer) is a monk who has fled a monastery to taste more of life. They accidentally meet in Algiers, fall in love and marry. But he can't leave his past and she can't live without him. <br /> <br /> DISCOVER overstated romance full of hysterical bad dialogue and situations. Dietrich and Boyer are doing their best to deliver good results, but NO can get away with some of their lines! Still, in a way, it's a classic. It's shot in beautiful Technicolor (try to watch it on DVD), where every frame is breathtakingly beautiful. Dietrich is always dressed in the 9s (even in the middle of the desert) and finds hysterical attitudes to point out the clothes and her body. Boyer just walked around and watched (no shock). Yet I was never bored. It was great to watch and the blunt dialogue kept me in stitches. The end almost dropped me off my chair because I laughed so hard! Now I love corny romances and give them plenty of space, but really --- it's incredible! It also runs a very short 80 minutes. <br /> <br /> As a camp classic, I give it a 8. As a serious movie - a 1.
