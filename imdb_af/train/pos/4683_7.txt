(Question) What do you call 100 film critics who buried their necks in sand? (Answer) A good start. Well, I don't know Peter Mattei of Adam, but if he is the emerging author, suggests his filmography: "Love in the Time of Money" is a good start. A classic shoot with whimsical music boxing music. This movie looks at a chain of turbulent relationships as it moves from person A to person B to person C ... etc ... and back with people A & B in carousel mode. The film explores the unfortunate circumstances of nine people with delicately shaded shadow starting and ending with a street corner and her client. The disadvantage of this movie is the lack of a story that has something to do with the many critical slams it has received. I watched last night's angry "Angels in America" ​​and was bored in the end as this little fusion of character studies kept me bound. Be careful. I may be the only person who really liked this movie.
