I watched the first series all the time, but wondered if I would go back to a long break. However, I agreed to episode one of series 2 and was totally addicted. It's really excellent telly; Pioneering things like Mission: Impossible back in the 1960s. The characters are well rounded and elaborate as the series is underway. They change as they adapt - more readily than others - to their new environment, but they stay smart in character and yet it is more than possible to have sympathy for someone you would not have thought you might ever feel sorry for something happen to them. I hope there will be many years of 'lost' looking out - and I don't think so much when I never get answers to all the mysteries!
