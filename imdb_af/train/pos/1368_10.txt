Okay. It was a favorite since I was 14. Admittedly, I no longer look at more than a year, but ... It's not a movie for an older generation who wants a deeper meaning or a brilliant message. This movie is FUN. It's pretty dated, almost over, but Parker Posey is so brilliant that it's incredible. If you want to enjoy a 90's Breakfast at Tiffany's, attended 90's raves, or love Parker, this movie is for you. Otherwise, don't bother.
