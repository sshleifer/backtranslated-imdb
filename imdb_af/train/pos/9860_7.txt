This movie had no hilarious parts, mostly just average funny units, but it didn't have any really bad parts either. The worst part was Sid's voice. His sloppy slur was just too much for me. By about 5 minutes I was sick to hear that he was talking. Apart from the annoying lazy voice, the movie was good. There were many jokes that, if you caught them, made the movie much better. It's a great movie for kids. It has enough to keep adults happy and enough to entertain children. This one is definitely worth renting if you have kids and want to watch a movie with them.
