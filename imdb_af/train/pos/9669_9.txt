After reading the original play, I thought it would be much harder to adapt to the screen than it seems to be. Donal McCann sits in a once-off show as Public Gar, the suppressed antagonist openly revealed by his extraordinary (but invisible) altar-private Gar. Eamonn Kelly also plays excellent "screw balls" whose inability to communicate his feelings only compares to Gar. <br /> <br /> Decided to rent out if you can find it. (Probably not available outside Ireland and the UK)
