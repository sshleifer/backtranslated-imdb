When I saw it as a child, it answered all my questions and drove any fears or misconceptions I had. It's easy to watch, because it's animated, making it untouchable. It has no moral prejudice or "preachy" aspects, so no one should object to it. It's a pleasant movie that just gives the facts of menstruation in a reassuring, 'matter-of-fact' way. I hope to show it to my daughter.
