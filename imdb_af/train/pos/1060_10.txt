Dark Angel is a cross between Huxley's Brave New World and Percy's Love in the Ruins - depicting the distant future as a disturbing mix of chaos and order, both in the worst sense of the word. Once one takes the premise that all modern technologies can be brought to a halt by the "Pulse", it provides an entertaining landscape for exploring the personalities and relationships between the two primary characters - Max (the Dark Angel / Bicycle Messenger) and Logan (the rich rebel). It seems uneven, perhaps a result of a variety of writers, but is held together by the energetic, beautiful and beautiful Jessica Alba, who appears to be both strong and chewy vulnerable and sensitive. I think Fox did it again.
