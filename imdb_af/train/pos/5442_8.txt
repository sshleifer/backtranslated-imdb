It's a good movie. In the same genre of "Memphis Belle". Seen it about 10 years ago. And want to see it again. There is a link with the history of the heroic angels !! How the pilot crew fights the Germans in WW2. And most changes form pilots to Harley motorcycle rs. The movie is somehow really happening. See the movie!
