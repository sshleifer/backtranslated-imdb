The plot: Kurt Harris (Jeff Wincott), a bitter, ex-cop, is covered in the "Peace Fighters" after his friend was murdered by their leader. While discovering that the woman wants to run mayor, he will do anything to achieve this goal, even murder. The role is good (Jeff Wincott is a good martial artist and good actor) ... Brigitte Nielsen plays a sexy antagonist together another bad guy plays Matthias Hues also good martial artist.The direction is good (the battle scenes also). The rest is okay, with Tony Burton playing a friend of Kurt playing Nilsen, and Cyndi Pass playing a bad girl. Producers of another action / fighting film (Bounty Tracker with Lorenzo Lamas) a good action movie. The best movie of the Martial Law series.
