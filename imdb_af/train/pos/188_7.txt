I'm a big classic movie buff, but I just come in quiet movies. Many silent movies don't pay attention, but Show People is a notable exception. <br /> <br /> Marion Davies and William Haines are simply in this picture. Davies, in particular, shows a wide variety like she's from a giggling little town girl to an asterisk that takes herself a little too seriously. <br /> <br /> Show People is a fast-paced movie with a fantastic variety of cameos by some of the greatest stars of the quiet era. The movie caught my attention right away and I actually forgot that it was a silent movie. (I know it doesn't make much sense, but that's what happened.) The actors are so skilled in their craft that little dialogue cards are needed. <br /> <br /> Show People is a perfect introduction to silent movies. It's a fast-paced, interesting movie with two of the silent stars' best stars. Add in the satire of Hollywood and Show People should be on the 'must see' list for all classic movie buffs.
