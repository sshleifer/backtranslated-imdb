Certainly, one of the French films of the decade so far, a tough atmospheric thriller that makes full use of the main characters who have been unable to use sound in a way that is rarely seen in cinema. Emannuelle Devos gives a truly beautiful, multicolored display, sometimes apostate and manipulative, at other times open and vulnerable. Another reason why those who appreciate quality cinema should keep their eyes on offers from France.
