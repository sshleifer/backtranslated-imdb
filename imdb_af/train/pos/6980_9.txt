I have to admit that I was one of the skeptics who judged this performance well in advance of releasing any information about it. I found that it would be a cheap spin-off led by Ronald D. Moore carrying the retcon stick. <br /> <br /> I was wrong! <br /> <br /> The pilot leaves an excellent impression on the viewers. Accessibility is wonderful! Of course, seasoned SCR veterans will immerse themselves in the plot, focused on the development of the Cylons before the first war. (58 years before the events of the SCR pilot). The pilot also caters for newcomers, who clearly suggest his plot and ideas in the first part of the episode. <br /> <br /> Don't be mistaken: "Caprica" ​​is not SCR. We are presented with an invasive, cerebral drama dotted with provocative, daring and controversial ideas. <br /> <br /> The casting keeps BSG standards; Stoltz and Morales are simply amazing. Morales's portrayal of Joseph Adama, inspired by Olmos's depiction of William, gives a wonderful look to William's heroic father. Stoltz's portrayal of dr. Graystone causes many thoughts and questions. <br /> <br /> If the quality of the pilot is any indication of what is to come yet, RDM and the creative team will be BSG's legacy of first program television programming with another master-like television masterpiece.
