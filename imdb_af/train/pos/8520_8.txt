I thought the movie was pretty good. I enjoyed the acting and it went well. The director really really understands the story he's been trying to tell. I have to see the big budget that comes out today, of course, they had a lot more money to throw at it, but were very viewable. If you see a movie like this for a small budget, you should take it into account when viewing it. There were a few things that could be better, but most were budget-related. The acting was pretty good, the F / X and stunts were well done. A few standouts were the man who played the camera. and the boy the child played. These kind of movies kept LA and that's OK.
