Yeah, Keaton looks like he really enjoyed making this movie. With a ship in his step in his customized strip packs, he reminds you of Jimmy Cagney! Johnny (Keaton) is the young jacket that does just to pay for his mother's cheap medical bills and to send his younger brother (Griffin Dunne) to the law school. Nobody knows Johnny Kelly Johnny dangerously until later in the movie. Joe Piscopo is Vermin and doesn't like Johnny one bit (and I don't like Vermin). Marilu Henner has a nice song / dance routine, while Johnny comes up. I love the part when they are in the ever-changing breakaway car! The policeman calling on all cars is the Skipper of Gilligan's Island! See this one for 1930's gangster laugh! The gags in this movie are hilarious, but you have to catch them or you'll miss them! Look in the background of each scene.
