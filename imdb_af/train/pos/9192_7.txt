Let's start this review on a positive note. I'm delighted that they didn't decide to shake Tony and do a retrospective season as some people reported. In fact, creator and author of this episode, David Chase, did the opposite. We don't really know if Tony will live or die. He is in a coma and his chances of recovery are very slim. This episode seems to be moving very slowly, and the coma brought dream. Tony was in the fact that he had the wrong identity. She absolutely chose Asian sleepers who were out of sleep. After 45 minutes, I got a little sick of all those sad, but it shouldn't be a reason to stifle this episode. It was a strange and unpredictable episode, but it was still well written and intense. In this episode, Edie Falco gave an amazing career definition, as the confronted woman with her husband's demise must face. I also found it interesting. AJ dropped out of school and swore a vendetta against Junior, which AJ probably wouldn't pull the balls. Silvio is now acting boss who in many episodes causes numerous doors for trouble. There were also very good quips in this episode, and I think Vito Pole Smoker Spadafore can meet his downfall if he's still a greedy SOB. <br /> <br /> It wasn't a good episode and disappointed just because Tony even kills people, we as an audience worship him and feel he is our hero of the show. It was an essential episode for the series, although it was a little snoring that resulted. Kudos to Edie Falco's performance, and David Chase and the authors to create this completely original and unpredictable plot twist. It's the only season of 'The Sopranos' where I don't have a finesse where it's going. I can't wait for next week's episode. My rating: 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> Best rule of the episode: (Paulie to AJ): "Let's go, Van Helsing!"
