Anyone who has never seen anything like the scenes in The Matrix has never seen this movie. The battle scenes were choreographed by action scene psychopath Yuen Woo Ping, who also did the battles in The Matrix. And the battle scenes are like. <br /> <br /> Li plays a supersoldier who feels no pain, now living a pacifist librarian (you have me) When other evil super soldiers begin to force drug dealers from the local drug to take over the drug trade, Li boasts with his policeman to help stop them. <br /> <br /> There are some crazy things going on in this movie (one bad army gets its arm off with a glass panel and scarce notice). The battles are filled with flying kicks and bumps; The body number is up there. Li is rarely better, and he has surrounded himself with a lot of beautiful female costumes (Yip kicks a serious ass as a co-super soldier). Anthony Wong even makes a cameo as a drug master (no surprises there; he makes a cameo in every HK movie). It's a pity they don't make action movies like this in the US; I will not have to sit through all this terrible double work to see that action that I so much desire. Recommended.
