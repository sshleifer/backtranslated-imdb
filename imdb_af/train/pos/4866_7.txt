First, in defense of JOAN FONTAINE, it should be said that Ginger Rogers would have been terribly mistaken for Alyce, the young British woman who has the title role. Fontaine makes a picture as the heroine here, but her acting inexperience shows badly and her dance is better unchanged. Fortunately, she went further. <br /> <br /> But here is FRED ASTAIRE, GEORGE BURNS and GRACIE ALLEN getting the best bill - and that's great. Fans of Burns & Allen will be amazed at how easily they fit into Astaire's dance routines. Particularly interesting is the great fun home routine that choreographer Hermes Pans won an Oscar. They join Astaire in what the movie's most resourceful highlight should be. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, not much can be said for the slow pace of the story - neither of the obsolete situations calling for much patience from the viewer. It should be said that some of the humor falls flat and the usual romantic misconceptions that occur in any Fred Astaire movie of this period are given conventional treatment. Only the musical interludes give the story the lift it needs. <br /> <br /> Some nice Gershwin tunes appear once in a while, but not everyone gets the treatment they deserve. The nice supporting film includes Reginald Gardiner, at best in a sophisticated comic performance as a friend, Constance Collier and Montagu Love (as Joan's father and gardener of Astaire has been neglected). <br /> <br /> It's a light skirt when Burns & Allen is around to remind us how funny they were in their radio and television days. Both are surprisingly suited to keeping up with Astaire's footwork. <br /> <br /> Director George Stevens makes sure Joan Fontaine's hush dance number is filmed with Fred at a strategic distance, but smart camera work can't hide the fact that she's out of her element as Astaire's dance partner, something she is painfully aware.
