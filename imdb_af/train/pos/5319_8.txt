Remember that this is a "B" movie. Remember that it is outdated in many ways. Instead, writer director Ida Lupino gives credit to a topic that was taboo in Hollywood (1950). To my knowledge, this was the first film to address the subject of rape and the emotional and spiritual impact that that crime had on its victims. <br /> <br /> Although many of the role-players are indeed pedestrians, Mala Powers, who was eighteen or nineteen at that time, performed excellently as the traumatized young woman, Ann, trying to run away from her "shame". Based on her work in this film, I was surprised she didn't have a more successful play. Tod Andrews also has fine moments when the minister reaches out to help her. <br /> <br /> Me Lupino, of course working on a limited budget, could still create memorable scenes like the pursuit of the streets and streets that led to the rape, and the police follow-up. And she created a bittersweet end that made me wonder if Ann really could ever have a normal life again.
