See this movie at the Rotterdam IFF. You may doubt some of the author's decisions - such as choosing a mock-documented form for such a sensitive and horrible topic - but this movie makes sure you get into the stomach. Especially the last scenes were almost painful to watch. Hope it gets the spread it deserves.
