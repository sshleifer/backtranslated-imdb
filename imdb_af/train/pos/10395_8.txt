A fantastic Arabian adventure. A former king, Ahmad, and his best friend, the thief Abu (played by Sabu or Black Narcissus), are looking for Ahmad's love interest, stolen by the new king, Jaffar (Conrad Veidt). There is hardly a downward moment here. It's always finding out new adventures for heroes. Personally, I found Ahmad and his princess a bit boring (it's not necessary to ask why John Justin, who plays Ahmad, is named fourth in the credits). Conrad Veidt, always a fun actor, makes a big villain, and Sabu is very fun as the prince of thieves, who at one point gets a genius in a bottle. I also loved Miles Malleson many as the Sultan of Basra, the father of the princess. He collects amazing toys from around the world. Jaffar embraces him for his daughter's hand with a mechanical flying horse. It will probably count as one of the great children's films of all time, but the special effects are extremely dated nowadays. Children will definitely take the remaining images when Abu and the genius appear together. And the scene with the giant spider looks particularly awful. Although most of the younger generation probably think King Kong looks bad at this time, Willis O'Brien's stop-motion animation is a thousand times better than a puppet on a rope that doesn't even look like a spin no. 8/10.
