I'm in front of the TV, see Casomai. It's changing, developing, or better ... changing. It starts with a courius wedding of the two main players where their love story is reported. Then everything changes, a child is born, and the rest usually happens in a few. It's not a special movie, because it's about a normal couple, and normality is the centerpiece of this movie. It doesn't want to show us anything special, there's nothing new, it's just an ordinary love story, a few's story, and normally it's different from the rest. It's also a flashy movie, everything is short, every scene is just a few seconds long. It's a storytelling story, many things are known because friends and parents talk about it and their opinion is central, opinions create the story and destroy it. This is a simple story of a couple as I said, but it is not boring, it just shows a few, everything must be known, that is, but I'm sure every one of you wants to know what's happening, So don't forget to watch the end!
