Extremely tense vibrant in the urban chaos of São Paulo, the biggest and ugliest third nightmare in Brazilian urbania. To make it easy for anyone curious about this intriguing and truly well-crafted movie, it has the grandeur of Mexican character Amores Perros with a character not too far from Max Cady, from both Cape Fears, though not, anyway, a movie about a psychopath. Two partners (Alexandre Borges and Marco Ricca) pay in a construction company, Hitman Anisio (Miklos), their third partner (and majority stakeholder) in construction equipment. The murder is blamed on the city, but things start to look very funny when the spiritual and charismatic nightmare goes on. Anisio decides he wants to be the ever so nervous partners in crime, not just offenses, but more importantly the deconstruction of the strict social codes that make up the Brazilian society. Anisio changes poverty into an attitude and he wants to enter. The look is almost completely handmade, grainy, the performances outstanding, especially as the first time actor (and member of the classic Brazilian pop band 'Titãs'), Paulo Miklos, dazzles and baffles the viewer with his beautiful, funny social terror . <br /> <br /> I saw the movie at the Brasília Film Festival in November 2001. It has done very well since then in Sundance and Berlin. Kleber Mendonça Filho
