Wow. Uh ... well ... wow! I think I'll start with the plot. An engaged woman (Lucy) arrives at her home, will be a man (Mathurin) in France, waiting for the arrival of the bishop or cardinal or someone in the Catholic Church to marry them (to satisfy a will.) Wait, young Lucy learns about a legend of an animal that has captured the grounds for centuries before. At night she began to fantasize with the early lady of the house about the Beast and his rape. That's where it gets interesting! The plot is really pretty thin (and it looks quite a while in the middle of the movie), but the filmmaker rewards (?) Those who stick it out with a shocking and hilarious final. <br /> <br /> This movie is not for everyone. If you're looking for a big movie, look elsewhere. If you are looking for a film about bestiality (which is almost a sympathetic look on the subject), this movie is for you! (If you have a weak stomach, don't be afraid of this one. Besides some horse-riding action at the beginning, the 'action' is pretty cartoon, IMO)
