The first and only time I saw the woman in black was the only time I knew. It was back on TV in 1989. It was Christmas Eve and my dad and I looked into the lounge shortly before we all went. a midnight service in the village church. I was quite young at the time, but I'm not sure who was more afraid to walk through the church to the church's entrance that had me or my father's night. <br /> <br /> There are many factors about this. film that makes it so creepy but I think one of them is the fact that there is not much in the way of a soundtrack that plays in the background of almost every Hollywood movie. Every scratch, dip, and pounding gets stronger in your head because there is no distraction. Another factor that makes it different from other ghost stories is that there is no jumping factor like stuff that caches, it does not necessarily make you see, but what you hear and what you think is going on. It's a clever medium, since nothing scares you more than your own thoughts, and it's around the corner or behind the door! <br /> <br /> An excellent ghost story, I've never seen anything that can match it and With all the dross being repeated over and over on TV I can't believe the BBC has removed it (to my knowledge ) just one show!
