Man, if you expect a big zombie movie after reading the title, then you are a retard and you deserve disappointment. As for myself, I expected a low budgeted Cheeseball zombie movie - and that's exactly what I got. I was not disappointed at all. I thought it was a cool little movie. The zombies were exactly like they were, because all the zombies were just turned around, so they were fresh pure zombies. Obviously they did this because it would have been pretty expensive if they did full-blown FX. I understood the whole thing, I have no idea how anyone can seriously destroy this movie. This is known as "HOOD OF THE LIVING DEAD" for the love of God! Want to watch "Redneck Zombies" and ANY YOUR Boll movie and actually expect it to be good? Of course not! So why are there some morons on IMDb that look like schoolgirls about this movie, I never understand. Oh yes and yes, there are worse movies out there, so stop saying it was the worst thing you've ever seen, because you know you're full of it! You ever look at "ZOMBIEZ" ???? Or "Feardotcom" ????? Or "House of Death" ???? THIS is the worst I have ever seen. If you can't see that it's just a low-budgeted zombie movie made by zombie film fans, then there's something wrong with you. I just had fun with it. Thumbs up from me and I also want to see a sequel.
