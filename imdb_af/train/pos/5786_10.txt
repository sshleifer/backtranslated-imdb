Simple story ... why say more? It nails it's premise. War 3 of the world war kills everyone or most of humanity and we see 2 of the survivors. The message is that the 2 opposing sides were not at stake. Polluted to representatives from each side, we see that they have everything to get together for: <br /> <br /> Security ...

Simple story, expressed in the limited budget of the early 60s television landscape. We see it as a little old in 2009 and maybe predictable. In the early 60's no one saw such things ... I give it a 10 ...
