NYC, 2022: The greenhouse effect, oceans disappear, unemployment is shattering and scarcity of water, power and food. And New York's population has increased 40 million. It's a little gem of a picture, not least, because a resource-depleted future is a reality for our 21st-century citizens. <br /> <br /> The low-budget opening titles of this movie are great: put on music, a low-tech 'tape-slide' series made entirely of archival styles from the beginning of photography until 1973 An untouched American pastoral who develops in a polluted and overcrowded hell within less than 2 minutes. Successful and unambiguous, it is truly memorable. Budget constraints are also behind quite unimaginable cinematography and other limitations, contrary to the brilliant premise of the story. The police station sequences are like an episode of about 70's TV detectors, and the other sets look basically basic. The budget has probably all attempted to make the Soylent CEO's 'Chelsea West' apartment futuristic, with the latest costumes, which means the other costumes are perfunctories. Some shots are bizarre undercrowded and the daytime suddenly appears through a smoke filter. <br /> <br /> The memorable scene where Sol and Thorn (Charlton Heston) shares a meal of expensive and rare food, summarizes their society: They enjoy real bourbon, lettuce, celery, tomato, apple and beef. , and we really feel their lips-smacking appreciation of someone else's wealthy privileges. <br /> <br /> Robinson's centerpiece dies scene, in which his character is willingly exacerbated at a place called 'Home', showing him immersed in images of the world's once-off beautiful flora and fauna, as he remembered them, unlike the mysterious Thorn's uprooted, the future went bankrupt, including horrors. <br /> <br /> It's a clever movie, and its core message is as pertinent today as it was in the early 70's. Yes, I do not know we do not yet eat death, but with our resource sawness, rising poverty gap, corporate global capitalism and unprecedented habitat destruction leading to climate change, the lasting 'Soylent Green' prediction can happen.
