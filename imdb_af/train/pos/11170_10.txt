There is something about Pet Sematary that I never felt elsewhere. Perhaps the fact that I was a child when I first looked at it made this experience so memorable. But as I constantly consider it, it never gets old and I never get bored. From the opening credits with that creepy opening song to the very chaotic end, there is at the same time something insane, sad and scary, and it holds your head: sometimes death is better! <br /> <br /> I don't think it would be useful to relate the whole story again. All you need to know is starting from point A (the most perfect situation for a happy American family) and dropping step by step to point B (who believes me, the end of all joy). The music is perfect, the story makes sense, the special effects are cool, and the Pet Sematarium is the last place on earth to be. As I said, sometimes death is better!
