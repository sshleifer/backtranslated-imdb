Sister in law released in the theater on March 24. A great opportunity for our Nordic friends to discover this original and thoughtful documentary. It was shown in Gothenburg along with a retrospective dedicated to Kim Longinotto, "director in focus" of the festival. She gave a master's class much appreciated for her method as a documentary filmmaker and told the audience about the special circumstances that led her to shoot two mother-in-law twice: the first version was lost well, so a second shooting was organized and the film was different at the end. A difficult problem in this case happened to create the possibility of a very strong movie.
