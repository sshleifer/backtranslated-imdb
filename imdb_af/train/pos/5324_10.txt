After seeing this movie again from a 1998 that showed VH-1, I just had to comment. <br /> <br /> The first time I saw this movie on TV, it was about 1981, and I remember remembering to tap it off my mother's betamax. For some reason it tied in black and white, which gave it a period of time that I grew. <br /> <br /> I clearly remember the movie that started with the song, My Bonnie, as the camera placed over a Liverpool scene. I also remember the opening scene where Paul bore some girls and said, "Watch talent!" It was with great annoyance that I appeared in my 1998-loaded version and "remember" that the film opens with "She Loves You" instead of "My Bonnie". If you see how slowly the camera pans the speed of the music, you can see that "she loves you" just does not fit. Also in this "later" version when Paul sees the girls, he says, "Look, GIRLS!". And somehow I remembered the previous version. THIS word didn't look right either. Why they felt they had to Americanize this movie for American audiences is beyond me. Personally, if I are going to watch a film about a British group, I want all the British colloquialisms and such that share their speech, ways, etc. Be. <br /> <br /> Another irritation was how "handsome" was editing for television. Just after Stu was beaten, the film cuts to a commercial break. Yes, I know it depends on the network, but it destroys the effect of a movie to cut it apart, as we all know. What some people can find as unimportant in terms of dialogue (and therefore good to edit) can actually be the way to explain a specific action or scene that follows. <br /> <br /> My point is the "best" version of this movie was probably the previous version I made from 1981, which just happened to the "Shake, Rattle & Roll" scene that made me 1998 does not include, include. I began to suspect that there were two different versions for television, and a look at the "alternative versions" link to this movie proved right to me. The fact that the American version had some shorter / cut / different scenes and / or dialogue is a huge disappointment to me and something that makes it worthwhile if you care about such things. Imo, the best bet is to try and keep the European version of this movie, if possible, and (probably even less possible), an unedited version. Unfortunately I had to discard my old Betamax European version because I didn't know how to convert it. <br /> <br /> Aside from that, I found that this movie might be one of the best movies about the story behind the "birth of the Beatles". Be aware that artistic and creative licenses are often used in movies and TV when events in history are portrayed, and I have not dropped my deviations from my enjoyment of the movie. Sure, you see the Beatles playing songs at the Cavern that made me wonder: "Did they even write it, then? I don't think so," but I thought it was a wonderful movie and the performances, wonderful. <br /> <br /> The real outlook for me was actually the actor John, Stephen MacKenna, played. I almost fell in love with him. His appearance, manners, personality and speech were striking. He looked enough like a young John to take me to the end of the movie if you see the Beatles for the first time on Ed Sullivan. I actually questioned myself if it was actually Beatle recording, until I saw the other actors in the scene. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a dead, accurate history of the Beatles 'life and beginnings, you can't get better than the "The Beatles' Anthology" as it was written by the sons. However, if you are looking for a fun snapshot of their pre-Beatlemania days ahead of them arriving in America and leaving your anal critical assaults at the door, you can't go wrong with the "Birth of the Beatles" - you MUST any "real" or accidental Beatle fan.
