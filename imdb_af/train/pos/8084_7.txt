<br /> <br /> I bought this movie on DVD and watched it for the first time the other night. I've been a fan of Tolkien's work for four years since I came from high school. I didn't grow up on this movie. Maybe my mom kept me away. This is definitely not for children. Not that it's bad in a graphic sense, but that the themes go right over most 10-year-old heads. Generally, the animation was excellent as it was made in 1978/1979. I thought the story follows the book pretty well in a loose sense. But I was bothered by Bashki not only adding another 40 minutes and also the return of the King parts. That would make it the ultimate movie. I was saved because it suddenly ended, and when I heard the return of the king, I was even more worried. It wasn't really one big animation movie. It might have been a higher voice for me. I give it a 7. I can only hope that Peter Jackson will do the books justice with the new live action LOTR.
