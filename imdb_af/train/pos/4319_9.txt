At the second show of this movie, I keep it even more than the first time. It is full of nuances and a perception of life as fairly ordinary and often terrifying, but raising this film to a height that is rarely realized is the focus on the small appearance in our lives that we usually only give the shortest attention . Here the movie turns into the celebration of these incidents, the meeting of a trailer driver and client, the jogger hears a baby's crying from the bushes. The dialogue, play, casting and direction are wonderful. No two at four, no great revelations. What I observed was how the characters were to their basic nature and how their lives improved when it was celebrated. Kudos for everyone involved, we need more "Grand Canyons" in our lives. 9 out of 10.
