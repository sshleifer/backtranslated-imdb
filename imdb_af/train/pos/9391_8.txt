Dennis Hopper and JT Walsh steal the show here. Cage and Boyle are good, but what gives the neo-noir its juice is Hopper's creepy, violent character and JT Walsh's assassination. <br /> <br /> A hit is wrong for a hit, and try to make some dough out of it, but get over his head. <br /> <br /> I found a strange parallel in the opening scene of this movie, when Cage in Wyoming went to a trailer to get drilling, with the help of his partner ... and the opening scene Brokeback Mountain, when the character does the same thing! But that's another story. <br /> <br /> Dennis Hopper is at his best here ... scruffy, one-step-by-villain, sick and explosively violent. JT Walsh (RIP) is also wonderful as the man with a dark past, and tries to live lawfully. Well, almost. There are only 4 real characters here, except the hard-working deputy in the town of Red Rock, Wyoming. The first turn up early, and from there it is a nice neo-noir adventure in a sleepy little town. Satisfactory. 8 pts.
