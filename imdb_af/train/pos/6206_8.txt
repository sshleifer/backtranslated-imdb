I'm a fan of Hal Hartley's films, especially 1997's "Henry Fool." "Fay Grim" is a sequel to the movie, and has a similar style and sense of humor. However, the plot is completely different. Fay Grim (played brilliantly by the iconic Parker Posey) tries to find her missing man's notebooks, and finds herself in the midst of conspiracy and espionage. The supporting film (most of the first film, Jeff Goldblum, Saffron Burrows, and a very popular return of 90-year-old Elina Lowensohn) is excellent and the film has many surprises. The director claims it is part of a Star Wars-like trilogy that serves as the "Empire Strikes Back" of the series. If that's true, I can't wait to see the third installment! I just hope I have to wait another 10 years for that.
