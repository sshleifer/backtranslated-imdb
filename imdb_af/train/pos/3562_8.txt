Nathan Detroit (Frank Sinatra) is the manager of New York's longest-established swing craps game, and he needs $ 1000 to secure a new place. He is confident in the foremost role of the city, Sky Masterson (Marlon Brando), that he cannot get the missionary Sarah Brown (Jean Simmons). 'Guys and Dolls (1955)' is such a great musical, because it mixes the contrasting styles of film and enhances thoroughly. During a dazzling opening sequence, crowds move pedestrians in rhythm, stop and start as if they are responding to backstage directions. Even the walking movements themselves are quiet and angular, halfway between a walk and a dance. Mankiewicz's New York City is a glittering wave of art deco color and movement, a fantasy world that is completely removed from reality, even though the underground gambling and criminal drug business seem perfect. <br /> <br /> While writing this review, I only received a word that Jean Simmons died, 80 years old. It was amazing the first time I saw her in a movie, but she blew me from the beginning. Her idealistic and sexually repressed Sara came out of her watch for a drink in Havana, released with a playful playful version of "As IA Bell." Although both Simmons and Brando were non-singers, producer Sam Goldwyn decided not to double their choir. They said, "Maybe you don't sound that good, but at least it's you." Despite Goldwyn's self-confidence, the two both did well to carry all the music numbers themselves. Simmons suggests the same childish lifestyle that Audrey Hepburn may have abandoned. Brando gives such self-assurance and charisma that it doesn't matter that his singing voice isn't quite there.
