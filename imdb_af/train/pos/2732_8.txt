Clutter, wife Bonnie, and their teenage children, Kenyon and Nancy were very fond of and respected in their small town of Holcomb, Kansas - but in the early hours of November 14, 1959, four were brutally murdered. On the contrary, the crime made an impression on the author Truman Capote, who rushed to the scene and followed the course of the case to his conclusion. The result was the book IN COLD BLOOD. Controversially, shockingly and extremely well written, it has become an international bestseller, and it remains a touch for crime writers today. <br /> <br /> The 1967 movie version of Capote's work is almost as remarkable as the book itself. Filmed in black and white in many real places, it has a slightly documentary quality, freezing and detached - and the overall cast is exceptional. It is the movie on which Robert Blake's reputation as an actor rests and deserves it. As murderer Perry Smith, Blake captures you between a deep deviation and the shock of unexpected sympathy; This is a masterful performance from beginning to end. Like Richard Hickock, Scott Wilson is no less good. <br /> <br /> Like Capote's book, the film opens with Smith and Hickock as they travel to Kansas and bring them to the Clutter House - just to pass the crime suddenly to describe the investigation that ultimately arrest and conviction. The centerpiece of the movie has always been the moment we finally see what happened in the Clutter House; actually filmed in the Clutter house itself, it's a backbone sequence, awful and deeply disturbing. <br /> <br /> Director and writer Richard Brooks leads the film with a very powerful sense of deliberation, just in the sense that he can be slightly preachy to the movie. However, given the overall power of the movie, it becomes a trivial annoyance. Strong stuff - and recommended. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Reviewer
