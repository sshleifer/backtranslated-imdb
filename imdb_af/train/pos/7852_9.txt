Ladislas Starewicz's curiosity with insects and cinema reports in a short film about a love triangle between Mr. Beetle, an artistic grasshopper, and Mrs. Beetle. The rather simple story of an adulterous beetle pair seeking both stimulation outside their marriage is similar to a Biography or Vitagraf shortly. Starewicz's turn on the story is to use balanced beetles with threads that straighten the legs in frame-by-frame animation. The story builds like Mr. Beetle is caught unaware of a jealous locust on the camera with a dragonfly from the local nightclub. When Mr. Beetle coming home to find his wife in the arms of her artistic friend, she pursued her fiercely, but eventually forgive her and take her out to see a movie. Mrs. But Beetle soon learns about her husband's infidelity, because the movie they see is the jealous locust's footage of Mr. Beetle and the dragons together. Mrs. Beetle throws Mr. Beetle with her umbrella, Mr. Beetle jumps through the screen, and they both end up in jail after the projector has set them on fire. The insects are placed in man-made institutions, such as a home or a nightclub, and are given human traits of jealousy, anger, lust and revenge. The insect characters carry briefcase, drive motor vehicles, and even wear shoes, but they also pull out their antennas and open and close their mandibles as true insects. The novelty of the story does not convey itself, even after multiple views, but as fluid as the movements, the film moves slowly. Action happens with complicated details, but the speed and speed of filming are lost in the process. Despite his pace, the film is an excellent example of Starewicz's early puppet show and is highly recommended.
