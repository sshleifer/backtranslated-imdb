It may not have been for academy awards and well, it's pretty cute, but it's just so good! Nothing makes me smile like Bill and Ted. Lovely, optimistic and hilarious, Bill and Ted are a great way to relax. <br /> <br /> Although I love Excellent Adventure, Bogus Journey is cleaner for me. Death is hilarious and Bill and Ted are even more encouraging. People are saddened by the love of this movie, but only really pretentious filmmakers will say it's not even a little fun. If you like this, you'll probably be a fan of Wayne's World, Dude Where's My Car, and Dumb and Dumber. Give it a go, fool, they grin you and turn your tickle box over. So they just look for kicks and giggles!
