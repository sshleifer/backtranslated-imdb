The often misunderstood Zabriskie point is Antonioni's political film, Antonioni's American film. Stylistically, it follows 'Blow-Up', which means that the pace is faster than previous epics, but certainly not less idiosyncratic. <br /> <br /> Basically, the general mistake is that the film glorifies the hippie generation. Not so. <br /> <br /> The two main players come from many different environments. Mark out the "rebel" youths, Daria of a real estate agency. But in true Antonioni fashion, they are both alienated and they try to escape their environment. Mark leaves a meeting of rebel students and black panties who are disappointed with the hidden empty rhetoric, while Daria is uncomfortable with her car. <br /> <br /> The master director of Antionioni portrayed the rebellious youth as confused. and level, then move to the city. An environment saturated with corporatism, billboard advertising, meaninglessness, must continue to expand to accommodate the same population expansion and profit. It is this environment from which the two main players escape, although it seems to be mostly coincidental. <br /> <br /> Indeed, when Daria stops at a small town on the outskirts of the desert, the environment is just as annoying, and people just like lost cases, the best example of an old boxing champion. now to a shadow of himself, drink and smoke and talk nonsense. A beautiful melancholy ride has made even more powerful with the inclusion of half wild children living around, brought in by a "benefactor" but "destroying a real piece of American history". In a not-so-dark symbolism, there is Antonioni's opinion on the hippies. Just a half-positive look in the canvas of human alienation. <br /> <br /> Then there is the desert, the landscape has used devastating effects, by turns pure and frightening, jungle, game and death. The sequence in which the two protagonists make love is reflected in fantasy by the "flower" generation, the similar order in the Red Desert, where Giuliana tells her son a story. It's a colorful break in a colorless landscape. A lively half-fantasy in a suffocating reality. <br /> <br /> The end is probably due to the pantheon of great ends in the movie, Western Civilization. A catharsis, an exorcism. <br /> <br /> Antionioni's two "international" films (the British "Blow-Up" and the US "Zabriskie Point") are less effort than previous masterpieces, but this is mainly due to the faster pace and the inevitably faced institutions (floating London, flower power America). But when it comes to it, it's clear he hasn't lost the rand.
