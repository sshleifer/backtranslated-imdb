The novel is better and the best parts of the film are direct translations of what Greene wrote; for example, the silent but funny humor that breaks into the scenes with Boyer and Lorre, or the obsession that is being killed, taking over the plot. Where the film deviates from the novel, it tends to be insulted. <br /> <br /> But I don't suggest that the movie be bad in any way. It always looks the part and the story stays in the mind like a good 'un'. Some of the minor characters were stock items that could change their hand to anything. <br /> <br /> It's a terrible shame that the movie isn't available on DVD.
