I had the opportunity to watch various movies in BluRay and HD DVD. This movie stays for this wonderful action and a good story. Although if you're looking for a movie with a great photo, it's not one. If you didn't have this movie on DVD, it made the purchase easier. I always enjoy the intense action and the excellent acting that doesn't always go along. Overall this is what makes it a great fun movie to watch. Now on the Blu Ray scale. In many Blu Ray movies you also get two things. A photo that is almost crystal clear without twisting or a movie with grainy HD photo. I was disappointed when I made this my first blu ray movie. I almost thought it was a blu ray standard. Although I watched other movies, I know better. I do not believe they have spent as much time as they had to transfer this movie to hd. This is usually the problem with some movies. And for the price of Blu Ray players and the Blue Ray chips, you just need the best photo. So I only consider it a valuable investment for people who have never seen the movie or the DVD version.
