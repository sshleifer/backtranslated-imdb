It's great to see Jorja Fox in a role where she gets a lot of smile. Also loved to hear her singing. Nice change to see her from her CSI / West Wing / ER roles. The movie itself was entertaining, but it seems to be some explanations in many parts. Several characters were once miserable and fortunately the following and it was up to you to find out why. However, each character was peculiar and in some cases I couldn't wait to see what they would do next or what they would hear next. This movie wasn't full of wheezing, but rather complicated realistic people who could make mistakes, feel bad about them and then find a way to fix it.
