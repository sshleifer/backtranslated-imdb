ZP is deeply related to the youth dream represented by the hippie movement. The college debate at the beginning of the movie explains the cultural situation that causes the movement. The explosion proposed by Daria represents the fall of all social structures and thus the development of all the great transformation that society is suffering and ultimately Mark's death expects the end that A sees for the movement itself. The movie will be more easily understood if we go back to that time in life. During the 60's and 70's, young people were the driving force for profound explorations for change. One of the more significant changes was meant to bring sexuality out of the closet and I think the scenes in the desert do not represent an orgy, but the sexual relationship that men and women in absolute freedom would perform in the hypothetical situation where there would be be no one to hide. I looked at the scene where the couples would throw sand together and appreciate the wonderful way A depicts the impossibility of concealing this basic human instinct. At the time, oppression was the way to control social outbursts and at that time the police applied to stop the students. This society suffers from hypocrisy, and it becomes clear when students gain access to weapons that overshadow all false controls. The dialogue between the policeman and the university professor, kept for no reason, shows part of society that is interested in this youthful feeling and sharing completely uninteresting. As the fly represents the more accurate symbol of freedom, the stealing of the plane represents Mark's inner desire for it, but his return or return (segun) shows the difficulty of getting rid of these ties and like I said, A portray the death of the dream through these difficulties to win the game. In my view, a movie to remember.
