Vampires, sexy guys, guns and some blood. Who can ask more? Moon Child delivers everything in a beautifully packed movie! Gackt is the innocent Sho, befriended by a Vampire Kei (HYDE), their relationship grows in time, but as Sho ages, Kei's immortality breaks his heart. It doesn't help that they both fall in love with the same woman. The special effects are pretty good considering the small budget. It is a pleasant story ripe with human emotions. You will laugh, cry, laugh and then cry again. Even if you're not a fan of their music, watch this movie. It works well as a single Vampire movie. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10
