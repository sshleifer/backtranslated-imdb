It's hard to tell you more about this movie without spoiling it. I enjoyed it because I didn't expect what I saw, but an ordinary sex drama so .... It is a pscyho sexual thriller in which nothing looks like it looks. It contains Emmanuelle Seigner, no stranger to the genre (and nudity) in which her husband, Polanski, directed her. And a terrible performance (I said, creepy / yes CREEPY) by Toreton (Bernard Tavernier's actor). It seems a Pascal Bruckner meets Roman Polanski (better than Bitter Moon), like a Chabrol stray or Clouzot thriller (I saw someone called Les Diaboliques), but closer to Georges Franju's Les Yeux sans Visage (eyes without face, the godfather of Dr Phibes and more). A gem! I'm just scared they'll blow it into a Hollywood remake as they did with Nighwatch and The Vanishing.
