The play is pretty cheesy, but for the people in this area in the 80's and is now Detroit area engineers, it's a good movie. I even work with a Japanese supplier, which makes this movie even more funny. <br /> <br /> Last night, Jay Leno showed his age on The Tonight Show! He looks pretty young here ... 17 years ago. The opening scene, with the truss on Woodward Ave, was great. <br /> <br /> Leno also owns bad ** cars now, it will be a wonderful memory with its modern collection. I'm sure the blown fats in the opening scene were his own car. <br /> <br /> Typical 80's movie. Watch it and enjoy. No computer generated crap!
