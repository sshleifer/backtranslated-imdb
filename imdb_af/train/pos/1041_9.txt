Watch On The Rhine started out as a Broadway game by Lillian Hellman who wrote the movie and saw it on Broadway at a time when the Soviet Union was signed in August 1939 to Nazi Germany by the notorious. aggression pact signed in August 1939. because the fact that Hellman was just the Communist party line did not change the line until a few months later. Lillian was actually months before her time with this work. <br /> <br /> The play Watch On The Rhine ran for 378 appearances from April 1941 to February 1942 and five players came from Broadway to repeat their roles. Frank Wilson as butler, Eric Roberts as the youngest son, Lucile Watson as the family matriarch and the main villain George Coulouris and Paul Lukas. <br /> <br /> In 1943 Lukas won an Oscar, a Golden Globe and an Oscar, and New York film critics for Best Actor. Probably if the Tony awards existed, he would also have won it. The Oscar is even more remarkable when you look at who he was against, Humphrey Bogart for Casablanca, Gary Cooper in For whom the Bell Tolls, Mickey Rooney in The Human Comedy, and Walter Pidgeon for Madame Curie. Each of its competitors was a bigger movie office name than it was. Lukas's nomination is usually the kind the Academy gives to round out a field. <br /> <br /> Jack Warner knew that why Mady Christians did not repeat her Broadway part and the role of Luke's wife was given to Bette Davis. Davis did not take the part because it was a particularly fine role for her, but because she believed in the picture and only wanted to be associated with it. That's the same reason she did the evening having a dinner, a much lighter game than that. <br /> <br /> Davis is the daughter of a late US High Court judge married to a German man in the Weimar days. . After many years of vagabonding in mainland Europe, Davis Lukas and their three children come to America that has not yet entered into the European War. They are welcomed by Lucile Watson who is of course excited to eventually meet her grandchildren. <br /> <br /> The fly in this ointment is other house guests, a friend of Davis's passing days, Geraldine Fitzgerald and her husband who are also of Europe, a Romanian diplomat and aristocrat George Coulouris. Coulouris is a debris and exhausted and he smells of a double trade opportunity if he suspects Lusas's antifasist background. <br /> <br /> His suspicions are fairly correct, which is why the family is the vagabond they have become. Lukas fought in Spain on the Republican side and was wounded there. His health has not been the same since then. His family loyally supports him in whatever decision he makes. Those decisions have all the other members of the cast. <br /> <br /> It was quite a bit more at the Broadway game, including some beautiful fascist creatures. Dashiell Hammett was Lillian Hellman's important other. Coulouris playing cards at the German Embassy were a Hammett creation with such ominous kinds as Henry Daniell, Kurt Katch, Clyde Fillmore, Erwin Kalser and Rudolph Anders. <br /> <br /> Coulouris is truly one of the most despicable characters ever brought. to screen as the no account Runmanian count. He was a metaphor for his own country that embraced the Nazis with gusto and then rejected them simultaneously without losing a step to Stalingrad. <br /> <br /> In 1943 Lucile Watson was the best supporting actress, but lost to Katina Paxinou for whom the toll. Dashiell Hammett was nominated for the best custom screenplay and lost the film for the best picture to the other anti-fascist classic Casablanca. <br /> <br /> Although it is an item planted firmly in those specific times, Watch On The Rhine tackles yet another rigorous anti-fascist message that repeatedly repeats.
