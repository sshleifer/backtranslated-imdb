You can do a lot with a little cash. Blair Witch proved it. This movie supports it. It is no more than a sitcom in length and complexity. But because it has John Cleese as Sherlock Holmes, it manages to be hilarious, even on a budget that can't afford a shoe. The highlight of this film is Arthur Lowe as the sincere, clumsy Watson, his darkness and inertia fulfill Cleese's quick white. If you ever walk across the movie, watch it for a strange laugh or two.
