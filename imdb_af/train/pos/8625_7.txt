Jörg Buttgereit sometimes goes too far with his movies and themes, even for my taste, but his movies are always something special and difficult to classify. They are made artistic, with often deeper meaning to the themes. This movie is a perfect example of his work. <br /> <br /> It is also very difficult to label this movie. It's not really a movie with a story about it, in the sense that it has a beginning, middle and end in it. It also does not have a main character, but focuses on 7 different suicides and murders on 7 different days. <br /> <br /> All different stories are told with many classes, although some of them are natural. more 'interesting' and realistic than the other. They are not necessarily connected, yet they still tell a story. The movie does not feel quite at all. All the different stories have a different feel and Buttgereit tells the story without using any words (also typical of its style), but lets the images and obviously sensible emotions of the characters tell the whole story. It helps to make this movie an effective one. <br /> <br /> Again, the production values ​​are not too high and it can be something that can scare some people off. However, it helps this particular movie to set the right tone and atmosphere for the entire film and its dark, disturbing and depressing themes. <br /> <br /> A Butt-eat movie I enjoyed. <br /> 7/10
