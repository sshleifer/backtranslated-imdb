This film is the most cult film on metal there. Premise: A child gets the last recording of his favorite artist, Sammy Curr, who recently died in a hotel fire. He plays it backwards and sues him back from the dead to take revenge in the name of heavy metal on the colliding jocks that are tormenting him. Any fan of real metal will enjoy this movie, and if you are a metal head tormented by jocks, a Sammy Curr album will play back ....... no wait he is fictitious, keep this movie good and watch it with your fist in the air, knock your head and the volume at 11!
