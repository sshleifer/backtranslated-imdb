"Insignificance" is far from big film, from a stage play led by Nic Roeg. In the scheme of Roeg's films, it is above the level of most of his post-do not look now work, characterized by the discerning use of Theresa Russell as main actress. She is really good here, and far from the problem in other Roeg films such as "Bad Timing" and "Cold Heaven". As the "actress", who is Marilyn Monroe, Russell is very effective, depicting her as a thorough depressing but lovely siren. She plays well with Michael Emil as Einstein, which is great to say the least. He sees the part wonderfully, and while Theresa Russell does not look exactly like Monroe, she is definitely attractive enough to make it part. Other players are adequate if it is not quite as arrest as Emil and Russell. A fairly workable, intelligent font is well-targeted by Roeg, but certainly not brilliant, such as "Walkabout" or "Performance". As in other later Roeg films, he tends to rely too much on vague, insignificant flashbacks, which add little to the film. In many ways, the movie would have worked better than a shorter (say 60 minutes), more modest piece. Still, a fairly acceptable, sensible movie. At times quite excellent but overall shortcoming. Rating: - *** 1/2 / *****
