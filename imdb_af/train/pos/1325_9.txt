I watched this film at the Adelaide Film Festival '07 and thoroughly thoroughly for 106 minutes. I like documentaries but often find them about 25 minutes to go. Forbidden Lie $ is denied, but never loses interest. <br /> <br /> The film's subject is Norma Khoury, a Jordanian woman who found fame and fortune in 2001 with the publication of her book Forbidden Love, a biographical story of a Muslim friend of her murdered by her family because they had a relationship with a Christian man. However, a few years later, some journalists put holes in the story, which led the public to believe it was fraud. The film covers it quickly, but thoroughly in the beginning. From there we spend most of our time in the company of Norma, as she tries to convince us that her novel is more than fiction. <br /> <br /> Director Anna Broinowski found a really fascinating woman to study, and she interviews Khoury endlessly as she seeks the truth. As always in life, the truth is not so easy to find. Norma fears her life, worried about the violent setback over the unbiased portrait of her new acquisition of Jordanian Muslims. She refuses to return to Jordan and shows us the facts. However, Broinowski is not deterred and slowly puts the pieces in front of us. <br /> <br /> The result is an incredible look in the minds of an artist. Of course, what we find there makes little sense and is extremely difficult to follow, and ultimately we do not know whether we should believe Norma or not. She is either a pretty unfair woman trying to survive or a fantastic spider. The web of lies, truths, and half-truths she spins through the movie is brilliant. <br /> <br /> The film uses a lot of interviewing as well as dramatization to tell the story, and Broinowski uses these dramatizations to show us. why people like Norma can exist: we want to get hurt. We go to the cinema every day and allow ourselves to believe what happens on the screen. It may just be that I read a little too much in things, but it didn't come up in the Q&A with Brionowski to the movie, but that's what I took away from it. <br /> <br /> It's a great Australian movie, and should receive an international release, and a weakness of awards if you ask me. Definitely the best movie I've seen at AFF07. <br /> <br /> See if you get the chance.
