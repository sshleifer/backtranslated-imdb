"Burger X" tells the story of "The Butcher of Rostov", nicknamed a horrific and perverse Russian serial killer who claimed 52 lives in 1978-92. The film focuses on the novice detective (Rea) who pursued the killer against all chances of an unoperative bureaucracy in self-service and convenient denial. An HBO product for tv, the movie offers solid throws, good performances, saves the audience a lot of the creepy details, but plays like a docudrama indicating the style of a similar Hollywood prize. An equally and straightforward dramatization of a serious and relatively little-known story, more interesting than "Jack the Ripper". (B)
