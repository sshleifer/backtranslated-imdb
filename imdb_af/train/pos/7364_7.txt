It is not always easy to explain how a movie is, but this time I think I found it. It reminded me of two movies: Trainspotting (small criminals kicking drugs and doing some stupid things in Scotland) and The Blair Witch Project (due to the style of filming). <br /> <br /> It's about loyalty between two friends, one of them comes from jail, the other is not yet captured. With a stolen vehicle they drive through the Scottish countryside, but do not run out of gasoline. As they try to find fuel, they find a farm in the middle of nowhere. The farmer thinks they want to rob him and show a gun to one of them. Then everything goes wrong. One of the friends accidentally shoots the farmer's daughter and they have to run. After this a man follows the field and forest of Scotland. The two friends should literally run for their lives. <br /> <br /> Apparently, this movie was shot in just 12 days. OK, it's not really incredible, because most of it is always in the same place: the Scottish countryside, but I find it quite incredible. Especially because it's not really a bad movie. It may not be the biggest movie ever, but they can still be proud of what they have achieved. I had a nice time watching it and overall I enjoyed the movie. I give it a 7/10.
