Looked at both parts twice. Enjoy the story and enjoy seeing an older Patrick Swayze as the hero. He was very credible as hunter Alan Quartermaine and definitely spent the performance of Richard Chamberlain. I admit I chose to see someone other than the "Lady in Distress". Alison Doody should like modern and not periods. She did not have the appearance of the woman of the 1800s. The rest of the cast was great and followed the plotlines very well. I'm glad to see that this generation's actors are not afraid to try different characters and are not afraid to be seen as they age. Age is inevitable, but let's not hide. A 50+ man can be much more sexy (and Patrick is really sexy) then a green youth, no matter how beautiful. Hoorah for character lines to go with a big smile.
