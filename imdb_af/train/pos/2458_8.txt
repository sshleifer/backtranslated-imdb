When I sat down in the theater, I was in a cool mood and I didn't plan to change it. But this movie is a dramatic power station. I was all in sweat and then needed a shower. So what do we have? Theoretically an upcoming story of a teenage Turkish girl living in Copenhagen, Denmark. I soon realized that the plot was pretty much borrowed from "Bend it Like Beckham", where we had an Indian girl playing soccer and spoiling her sister's wedding. Here we transferred it to a Turkish girl who spoiled her brother's wedding by doing Kung Fu. And of course we also have a love story and a competition. After accepting it, it really became a gripping, emotional drama and it turns out a beautiful Kung Fu (I'm not an expert, though). The main actress Semra Turan is not only Denmark's female champion, but she also performs excellently, so it can be safe to assume that we have quite a few autobiographical impressions here, considering that this is her first movie and that she does not educate as an actress. The rest of the supporting role is okay, camera good, Kung Fu intense. Sidoteer: - The male Turkish audience showed respect so they did something right. - The audience sounded when our heroine finally fought back and attacked the boys who had severely defeated her brother. - Xian Gao, a Chinese Kung Fu instructor / actor (Hidden Tiger, Crouching Dragon) plays the lead role <br /> <br /> If you get the chance to see it in the theater, it will probably have a good and intense experience and I don't know if it works on a small screen
