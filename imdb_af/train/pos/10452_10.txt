I want CÃ©line and Jessie to go further in their relationship, I want to tell them that they are made for each other, that in a very moment we want the film to die for each other. Their story is what we ever wanted and most of us probably never reached. It's about love, but not stupid things like in "hills" or the kind of movie. It's life and I believed in them, I thought they were falling ... It was so smart and touching. I just got to see it a moment ago and I'm still there ... I want to go to Vienna. I want to see them again as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> Now I have to say that I have become misanthropic now and feel like love was just a false concept, but with this movie I realized that maybe somewhere, somehow and some when , something can really happen. <br /> <br /> I'm French and didn't know very well Julie Delpy despite Kieslowski "three colors: white" ... Now I have to see her others work because she looks like an angel and perfect scene. <br /> <br /> A few days before a sunset, I saw 'before sunset' and it doesn't matter. They are both masterpieces. prove that you should not impress the eyes with technology to get pure feelings. I'm sorry for my English that I try best. <br /> <br /> Franck in France
