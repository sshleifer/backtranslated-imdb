"High Slaughter" is a completely ridiculous victim of a high school Nerd, who is always picked by some pranksters. The prank goes wrong and he ends up running burned. Five years later, his tormentors live a reunion - just the ten of them, of course, and low and low, Marty kills them one by one. The critical actress Caroline Munro ("Maniac") leads the role of the heroine (which in any case dies!). The acting is quite terrible, there is no tension either. Very grotesque death tones to satisfy the gore freaks: a man's stomach explodes, another female victim literally gets a bath of acid, a few who get sex in bed, explode, a man becomes a tractor broken. One girl is drowned, and a doctor gets a hyperdermic needle in the eye. The murderer is wearing a decent and rather nasty mask and the setting (a beautiful old English castle) is really beautiful. But the dream finale is completely pathetic. Even though it is true that the "blow high" is a piece of garbage, but I enjoy it. Just for fans of really bad shooters.
