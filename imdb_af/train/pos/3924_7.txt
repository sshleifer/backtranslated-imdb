This 1939 film by director John Ford and author Lamar Trotti tells a fictional story of young lawyer Abraham Lincoln, his tests (literally) and his tribulations. It's a sentimental movie, pretty well made but hardly breathtaking. Henry Fonda's decision as Lincoln seems to be a mistake, because while the actor had the right dead qualities for the part, even with a few thumbs-up and a false nose, he is very good at honest Abe what was famous. This is a good attempt from Fonda, which is nothing if it is not sincere, but its miscasting throws the whole movie down. However, the supporting role is excellent and includes Alice Brady, Ward Bond and Donald Meek. But Ford is to be honored in his treatment of Lincoln, who is only ashamed of a saint, and in the final scene, the movie goes above.
