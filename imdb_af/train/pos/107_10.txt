Lars Von Triers Europe is a very good movie. How is this? Von Trier has a very stylized way of telling a story, at least he had with Europe. For me, the whole movie was like an experience, even though I saw it on a small television screen. Even with all the tricks, according to me, this movie is the most complete, real and moving piece of cinema, then most of the movies are on the top 250 list. I also think this is perhaps the scariest, the most gothic and complete film around. Well, there are other good things too, but this one is my favorite. The final scene is one of the most shocking scenes ever.
