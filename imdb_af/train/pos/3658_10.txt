This film is like an allegory of the gospel. It has such a direct honesty and innocence, you can't possibly believe it was made after World War II when Italy was destroyed and destroyed and filled with a huge homeless, poor population. It is a monument to the best features of the human spirit, as well as the endless creative resources of that country of inspiration. <br /> <br /> Toto is a character like Doest Fisherman's "Idiot", a modern Christ that finds its way into a big city. He is strengthened by kindness and purity, and his deeds change the people he meets as much as the miracle-working pigeon. The story is told in a natural and simple style, but still with a magic that is almost a premonition of Fellini's surreal fantasies. It is one of the most inspiring, uplifting films ever made.
