Well, the story is a bit difficult to follow for the first time, but it is only because of all the bald-brown 70s-dyed vampire / witches dancing to the bongo drums. Of course, this is interrupted by a few vampire orgies. And there are some very interesting candles and uses for them. And for girl on girl action, vampiric or not ... this movie just rock!
