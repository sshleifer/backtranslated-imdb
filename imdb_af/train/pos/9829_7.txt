This movie is fantastic on many levels ... and none of them is the level at which it was meant to be wonderful. <br /> <br /> Just remember: If you're Shaun of the Dead and other recent zombie movies ... it's good or bad ... that's the formula they use. THIS is what makes the zombie movies so good. <br /> <br /> What makes it better than the big one is the story behind the movie. A simple web search will provide you with everything you need to know. <br /> <br /> All in all, it doesn't matter. There is never a point where you think of yourself, "come on, keep it up ..." it moves fast and angles beautiful. This is the sporty, small Italian number of zombie flicks. <br /> <br /> So terrible, it's great! If your tongue spends enough time in your cheek, rent it, buy it, like it. <br /> <br /> As a good trivia note: If you watch it on DVD, you'll notice there are sound effects during the menu screen, below the musical score ... Well ... that's because that lifted music straight from the trailer ... which is probably the only working pressure of that music that still exists, which is long enough to walk.
