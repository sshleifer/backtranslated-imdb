It's rare nowadays to find a romantic comedy that isn't incredibly disgusting in the whole movie (eg Big Fat Greek wedding, Me, Myself & Irene). There were only a few unnecessary dementia jokes in this movie, nothing inexorably profaned. All around, it was a cute movie with similar characters. I thought the end was a bit sudden. It felt like they had to end it at the World Series for a real touch. The play left a bit to be desired, but was made up of the pace of the story. If I knew it was a Farrelly brother movie, I would have assumed that it was a stomach that twisted a piece of garbage and didn't look it, but it seems even they are able to accidentally good movie. Good for them, I hope they pull their heads out of the way and start making good movies consistently.
