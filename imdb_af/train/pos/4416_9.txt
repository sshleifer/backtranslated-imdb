Harvey Keital's best performance so far the new century. Very beautifully photographed, a beautiful snap-shot of pre-Castro Cuba. The story revolves around the cousin of a local minor crime boss who develops a friendship with an American with Hollywood connections. It's really about the moment a boy wakes up to the fact that the small circle of people he knows is actually living in a much larger, much more complex world he doesn't understand yet. The writing is strong and full of humor, the direction is sharp. All in all, a very professional work that fits the tradition of the Latin American cinema. The one weakness is the decision to shoot in sync audio English rather than Spanish - probably to improve sales in the US. Unfortunately, it just makes the movie a little less convincing. But if you can see outside, you will find a hearty trip to another world. Recommended.
