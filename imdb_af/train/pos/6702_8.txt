Although there are no new episodes, it is seldom shown. I loved the magic of Sabrina and the teenage witch. I never got the last episodes, but I want to know what happened to Miles, or Josh? And why did the aunts disappear from the show for good? I'm sure the end has become perfect. But there are many questions unanswered. And I want to see the last episode of S.T.W. Because I heard his decision between Erin and Harvey on her wedding day! I really hope she picks Harvey! And may I say Nate Richart is HOTT !! Too bad, but too old for me. Melissa Joan Hart has her own sense of gift that she adds to the show, but there are very little "stupid" things for the show like how well-known bands come from nowhere and play songs and listen to all the role-players, its kind of stupid. Plus, the cat is getting really crippled, as the performance continued, the jokes just got stupid, and the things the sound-controlled "audience" would laugh at, I would think it was so paralyzed. Don't get me wrong, on some parts it was funny, but I think the show just lost its "magic" just a few times to speak like the show. I give kudos to all the role-players to try, although the Soleil Moon Frye girl had no taste, and she was a terrible actress. I wonder what Melissa or any of the role players are doing, now the show is over.
