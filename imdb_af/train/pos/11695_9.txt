It's such a great movie! Remember the low rating here. I really have no idea where it came from, they have to discuss another movie. Because I absolutely loved it and found it a little hidden treasure. <br /> <br /> This is the story that was so original and charming. I really can't think of anything bad about me. Maybe it should be "" your kind of thing, "but I saw it with my sister and mother, and we were all taken for it. <br /> <br /> The play was also very good, and it's hard to do in a movie like this. But I found all the characters very intriguing and sympathetic. <br /> <br /> I've always loved Dougray Scott and find his new "dark" role very interesting. It's really hard to make me feel like a bad man, but I had absolutely no problem with it. Even more, I worshiped him. <br /> <br /> Anyone who loves a good thriller / drama that also has a good dose of love and tragedy should definitely see this movie, no doubt about it! Anyone who wants to see a movie with 80% bloodshed should rent something else. But I think the title already gives it away. This is a love story, not Saw 3. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 4 out of 5 stars !!! Good work !!! <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
