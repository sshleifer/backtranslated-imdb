This is one of my favorite movies of all time and I would recommend it to anyone. My favorite movie list (spiritual list, mind) is the only one in the same way, like movies like The Lord of the Rings, Spirited Away and Fly Away Home. <br /> <br /> I really can with the main character Jess. At the start of the movie she is a shy girl with a slightly strange background with many more friends who are boys as girls. She really sucks you in her life. Of course, I can't blame any of the lead actors, or anyone else in the movie. <br /> <br /> Watching football was interesting even for someone like me who has no idea of ​​the rules. The movie is never boring. The romance is really cute and didn't let me blush! One thing that really made it was the Indian factor. Jess's parents are Indian and there are many colorful Indian conventions throughout the film that offer a very interesting cultural insight as well as all the others. The Indian people are also hilarious! In essence, this is an upcoming movie about choosing the path you want and fighting for. <br /> <br /> Feel good comedies become my favorite movie genre thanks to this movie. They are funny, they are refreshing and they make you feel good! ^ _ ~
