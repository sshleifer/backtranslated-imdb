This movie has a very simple but clever point of departure - an unemployed man who tries to steal from a convenience store, and the shopkeeper raises him in the act. The thief walks straight to the shop clerk. All the time, the shop clerk is in trouble with a low-rank Yakuza chinpira (gangster). Along with the hunt for the thief, they get the eye of the Yakuza who is looking for the convenience store clerk. The story then moves in high gear in the form of a Tom & Jerry (cat and mouse), but is added with the dog that is chasing the cat. The entire 2nd act of D.A.N.G.A.N. Runner (can be translated into English as "PINBALL RUNNERS"), and the chase continues and at the point that the bum at the end of the 2nd act forgets why he runs away and the Yakuza Don doesn't remember which 2 guys he didn't chase, nor did he remember why they were running away from him. <br /> <br /> Similar to SABU's later film, POSTMAN BLUE, most of the movie is just a rush and action, with lots of physical comedy and dark humor being injected to keep the audience engaged. What falls short is the end, after which the chase stops when the three men run out of steam and in one of the most chaotic Mexican shows you see on film that almost seems to Sabu to Tony Scott WHERE ROMANS (written by Quentin Tarantino).
