This move actually jumped me out of my chair in anticipation of what the actors were going to do! The acting was the best, Farrah had to get an Oscar because she was fantastic. James Russo was so good I hated him he was the villain and played it great. There are not many movies that have cut me than this one. The movie was big, Alfie looked shocked with those big eyes. Farrah looked like a victim and you revived her horror as she went through it. Farrah made you feel like you were there and with the same anger you wanted her to hurt him, but you also knew it was wrong to do so. The movie had you on a roller coaster ride and you went up and down with every scene.
