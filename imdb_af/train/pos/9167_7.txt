It is, in my opinion, much better than any of the 2 1990s, but is not as good yet. It feels dated, probably because it is, but it rises well compared to other periods of the 1980s such as Mansfield Park and Northanger Abbey. <br /> <br /> The length of this adjustment makes it possible for a much better adaptation of The Book as one of the 2 90's and St. John Rivers is at least covered, though not very good. Timothy Dalton is very good at Rochester, but the actress Jane plays is too old. There is definitely room for a TV adaptation of this length that has spent more than a tooth on it.
