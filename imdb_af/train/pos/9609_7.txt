It was a good movie, I liked it. I thought it was a nice, accurate look at bulimia and how it wasn't about diet, it's about the pain so deep that it has to find a way to handle it and they choose it. Beth was a very accurate character and in the scene she confronts her mother about eating disorder, you can see the pain in her and hear it in her voice and you know how deep the pain is that she feels. I also think one of the best lines in the movie is where Beth shouts the words: "It's not about you." to her mother. The words were so true and added so much to the scene in the movie. I think the scene was definitely the most important scene in that movie.
