"The first war was 100% outsourced." Dan Ackroyd's line says it all. It's a tough movie to describe; comedy, satire, action, screw ball. It reminds dr. Strangelove, especially in the scenes with Ben Kingsley (who did a remarkable job I think). I didn't have any specific expectations of this movie, although I'm a big John Cusack fan, so I'm just the movie. And as a result, I was quite entertained. The political satire is painfully accurate and reasonably damaging to the US military business complex. The subplots were somewhat predictable, but the final development of story lines made them all worthwhile. I can understand why this movie wasn't very popular in the US, but for the rest of the world it's a timely story.
