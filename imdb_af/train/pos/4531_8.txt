It is a split film with love over the centuries. The film consists of Keaton looking for a lady love in the stone age, in ancient Rome and in the present (1920s). In all three cases he is the ordinary Wimpy Buster and he fights Wallace Beery for his lady love. Of the three periods, I think, I liked the Roman one the best, although I admit it might also be the cutest. I really liked the scenes with the lion that was obviously a man in a costume, as well as the strange car race in the snow - but what I enjoy most was seeing all of Keaton's incredible acrobatics. However, all three periods were good old-fashioned fun and the film, while not the best, is still an exceptional and enjoyable movie. Look at it!
