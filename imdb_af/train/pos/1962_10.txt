What a thrill ride! Turned and thought challenging. Again, Sharon Stone immaculates her deadly, spellbinding character of author Catherine Tramell. The original Basic Instinct takes place in San Francisco. The successor takes place in London, where Catherine has moved now. Both vibrant cities are known for excitement, haute couture ~ and an ideal place for someone like Catherine Trammel to live. David Morrisey ("Derailed") plays the smooth role of psychiatrist Dr. Michael Glass. The character David Thewlis plays as Roy Washburn with Scotland Yard, a refreshing departure from his role as Lupine in the Harry Potter series. Flashing cars, designer clothes, sex, drama, humor, excitement - all the "basic instincts." Mind bends through. Great script. From the climatic opening scene to the surprise ending, this movie is nothing but sowing! Everyone in the theater is glued to the screen.
