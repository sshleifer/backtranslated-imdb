Robert Duvall is a direct descendant of Confederal General Robert E. Lee, according to the IMDb.com movie database. After watching this movie, you can think Duvall's appearance is reincarnation at its best. One of my favorite movies. I wish the composer, Peter Rodgers Melnick, had a CD or there was a soundtrack available. Wonderful scenery and music and "all-true-to-life", especially for those of us who live or moved in South Africa. It's a "real time in time." Life is moving slowly, but "strangers do not stay with us."
