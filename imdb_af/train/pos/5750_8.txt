But the rest of us, who love a good sentimental and emotional story that is a lock to make you cry .. enjoy! <br /> <br /> Tom Hulce is wonderful like Dominick, a sensible slow trashman who loves professional wrestling and his brother, Eugene, played by Ray Liotta, who is a doctor and works long hours. <br /> <br /> Due to Eugene's work schedule, Dominick is much of the time alone and tends to make urgent judgment calls. He really wants to be a good boy, do the right thing and make his brother proud of him. He stops in the church to pray at one point and express his emotions so openly and so well that the character cries you before the damn movie even really starts. <br /> <br /> Not to give away anything here, but the movie is extremely involved and sad and sad. Those who are not afraid of these things will have a field day with this beautiful story, its loving characters and a good song I can't quote here. It has nothing to do with the movie, but is strangely applicable. But you hear it in a bar. <br /> <br /> I thought Tom Hulce would be nominated for this movie, as he was for 'Amadeus', I thought it could give him the inside to really win. No such luck. Liotta is just as good, but has less emotional impact, but then he does later. All I can say about Jamie Lee Curtis is that she did not share much here, but it was nice to give her a little drama made in Pittsburgh about two brothers you will never forget.
