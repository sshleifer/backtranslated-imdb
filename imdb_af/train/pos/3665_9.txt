They did it. And, son, they did it great or what! The BBC eventually brought the doctor back to our screens on a Saturday night where he belonged! And they did it with style! <br /> <br /> EPISODE ONE: "Rose" - One of the highlights of the new series is Russel T Davies as writer and executive producer. He is a fan of the show and knows what the other fans want, but is also an experienced writer in his own right, so know what other people want. Another strength, such as perfect here in this first episode, is Billie Piper and her character from Rose Tyler. Eventually, the doctor's companion gets a credible story and a strong character. It's also nice to see the Outons return. There is a nice nod for the Classic series. <br /> <br /> EPISODE TWO: "The End of the World" - In the beginning of this dual bill, the TARDIS 'Strength, we end up in a story where special effects are all! They now have the technology to create true, credible environments and monsters - no more rubber suits! Also the tips at the end of this episode about the new doctor's past - very intriguing to kill all the Time Lords and make him the only one. <br /> <br /> EPISODE THREE: "The Unquiet Dead" - We 've had the future, now we can have the past. The first non-Davies-written episode is somewhat flat in some places, but it is erected by Simon Callow's Charles Dickens and the sudden turn in the plot when it is revealed is not the pitiful Gelf ... <br /> <br /> EPISODE FOUR: "Aliens Of London" - The effects of the Doctor's actions are fully explored in this series, especially the effects of Rose running down with him. Also, we have our first stone hanger; not the best of the people. The Slitheen is an interesting villain, although they can see CGI for their own good. <br /> <br /> EPISODE FIVE: "World War Three" - The second part of this story about the Slitheen is mainly from the same problems. of the first. Also, the cuts of the next episode that appear at the end of the current episode are annoying and spoiled for people. <br /> <br /> EPISODE SIX: "Dalek" - Yes! We had the future, the past and the present, but now we come to the good things - the return of the doctor's archipelago. Here I think we can supplement Christopher Ecclestone - he was brilliant as the Doctor, and no more so than in this episode, where we see the pain on his face as he remembers the time war and the strange nature of him as he almost changes in a Dalek itself. <br /> <br /> EPISODE SEVEN: "The Long Game" - really just a story to act as a prologue for the series final. Saved by Simon Pegg as the smarmy editor and Tamsin Grieg in an amusing cameo. The media controls us - it has never been done before, it has ... <br /> <br /> EPISODE EIGHT: "Father's Day" - this is a great episode. Full of human emotion and sadness for Rose, and the true consequences of what happens when you really get history. Full points for Billie Piper here. <br /> <br /> EPISODE NINE: "The Empty Child" - I don't find this kid very scary. Sorry, but I don't. It's a good episode though, but the stone hanger could have been even better - it's those "Next Time" bits that spoil them. John Barrowman is presented here as Captain Jack, the staggering man - he is a good actor who has been around for a while, but it just seems to be on the lookout. <br /> <br /> EPISODE TEN: "The Doctor Dances" - Part two of this WO2 story - made very well in historical context terms. A fun finite end, though a little confusing to younger viewers when the Mummy is revealed? <br /> <br /> EPISODE ELEVEN: "Boom Town" - probably the worst of the series, but that doesn't mean it's bad. A good return for the Slitheen and also an interesting character study by the Doctor and Rose. <br /> <br /> EPISODE TWELVE: "Bad Wolf" - it starts out pretty silly, with some good heart and humor. at popular TV shows about her in Blighty. However, things get deadly seriously fast, and the revelation at the end is the best stone hanger in the series! <br /> <br /> EPISODE THRITEEN: "Parting Of The Ways" - Goodbye Christopher Ecclestone. A great doctor in so many ways, David Tennant really has to work his socks to be as good as he is. The regeneration scene at the end is played well. Oh, and the Daleks are back - in the extreme! God bless CGI, because they will never be able to pull it normally! <br /> <br /> Overall - brilliant! 9/10
