I love the series! Many of the stereotypes that salt herons portray as hicks are very clear, but such people already exist too often. The portrayal of the southern government is also true, but the sympathetic characters also remind one of the great things about the South. Some things never change, and we see the "good old boys" every day! There is a Lucas Buck in every southern town that just needs to make a call to make things happen, and the storybook "po" white trash "is too familiar. Apart from the supernatural elements, everything in the modern South can happen! I think somehow Trinity, SC had to have been in Barnwell County!
