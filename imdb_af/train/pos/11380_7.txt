Although the word megalmania is widely used to describe Gene Kelly, and sometimes his dance is too stiff, you must admit that the guy knows how to present a show. In American in Paris, he choreographed some outstanding numbers, some plotting the plot, but incredible to watch. (Check out Gene Kelly's "Out of Bed Routine" for starters). Gene Kelly stars as a CI based in Paris stayed there to paint. He is soon a rich woman's gigolo, but he really loves someone else! Hoary story sure, but the music numbers save the show here! I really loved Georges Guitar's voice work in this one. His 'Stairway to Paradise' and his duet with Le Gene on 'Wonderful' are wonderful. Oscar Levant and Leslie Caron I can take or leave. All in all, a nice good but not dynamic movie.
