Bad writing, bad direction, about the best performances, overwhelming dialogue. What else can you ask for? For laughter it just doesn't get any better than that. Zadora's overworking combined with the split scenes, she finds herself making a hilarious parody of the "Hollywood" machine. Almost as funny as "Spinal Tap", though clearly not meant as such. Don't miss Ray Liotta's debut movie, "Looks like a penis."
