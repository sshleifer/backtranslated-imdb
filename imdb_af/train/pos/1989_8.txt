I admit I don't love Oliver! As a young child - it's long, and the story is a bit slow because of all the musical numbers. As a teenager I discovered that the fun of this movie is the experience itself. Rather than think of it as an adaptation of Oliver Twist, it is a celebration of the classic story. The adjustment is at its best, but if you watch a musical, you're not there for the story. <br /> <br /> The music is at the heart of this movie and an overwhelming majority of them are stars and very catchy. Most or all of the role-players were involved in the stage version of the musical, and this shows in their performances - and I consider this a plus. The performances are all in a more "stagey" style of acting typical of many older movies, and they are very entertaining. The exception is the child Oliver plays, whose work seemed to look cute and stay away from the right artists. <br /> <br /> Fagin and the Dodger are the real stars of this movie. Oliver Reed also does a fantastic job retaining an intimidating screen presence, like the threatening Bill Sykes. Even Sykes's dog, Bullseye, offers a good performance. <br /> <br /> This movie is not for everyone. People who hate music will despise it, as well as those who take music seriously. Nitpicking about erroneous historical details or erroneous exaggerated stage type acting for bad acting will ruin anyone's enjoyment. Just sit back and enjoy the entertainment - it's much better if you remember that, as a musical, it's a fantasy that is nicely organized around the book, not a tight fit.
