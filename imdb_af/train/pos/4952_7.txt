On Sept. 12, 2006 2 screening at the Paramount 1 Theater during the Toronto International Film Festival. The film had the day before at the Elgin Theater VISA Screening Room. <br /> <br /> The basic plot involves Morgan Freeman who once plays popular actor who is on the downward slope of his career and who is undergoing roles that may be underneath him but what he still holds with do a positive attitude, knowing that he must pay the rent, etc. The downward slope is indicated by being a long time between roles with previous movies in bargain DVDs and his manager. by a not sure of himself production assistant who scoops off on a local community market where he is going to investigate a role as a supermarket manager. He soon discovers the real market is being led by an iron-wild "10 Items of Less" control line clerk played by Paz Vega. When Freeman's ride never returns and Vega needs help for an interview, the circumstances cause them to merge in a ride across town to get Freeman back and get Vega a job that makes her more upward. mobile career. <br /> <br /> While the movie was nice, it felt like it was still a sketch or work. There were two extensive musical sequences (One with Vega & Freeman teaching children's songs in the car, one that literally plays like a Paul Simon music video) that felt it was going up the road and even then the movie was just about 80 minutes long. <br /> <br /> That's a good thing. Morgan Freeman is as good as he is, because without him it would have been too little. Sure, it was funny in parts and Paz Vega is also a pleasure, but there wasn't enough here to say it was a complete movie. <br /> <br /> They lost me when Morgan Freeman started talking to stop the car Asking for directions and Paz Vega said she never did. Who has ever heard of a man who wants to ask for directions and the woman says no! In the real world this is exactly the opposite. <br /> <br /> Make sure you stay for the issues in the credits. The little bit with a target store salesman learning Morgan Freeman, how to sell, is just hilarious! An early bit where Freeman's driver insists is Freeman's voice on a "Books on tape" reading book was also pretty funny. <br /> <br /> Director / writer Brad Silberling and actress Paz Vega were there for a short Q&A after the selection. Silberling answered one question saying that the writing was not specifically written for Morgan Freeman and that Freeman took the role when he actually changed very little of what was there. A great compliment to both Silberling's writing and also how Freeman can only roll and make it feel like he's born to play it.
