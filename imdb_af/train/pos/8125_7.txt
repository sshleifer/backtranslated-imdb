Things to come are the rarity of rarity, a film about ideas. Many films provide a vision of the future, but little effort to show us how that future originated. The first part of the movie, when war comes at Everytown, is short but powerful. (Ironically, in his release year, film audiences laughed at reports that enemy planes attacked England - the prediction was at its height. Wells's prediction has been carried out too soon.) Assembling endless war following, while working through sub-model , is the most effective. The explanatory titles are strongly reminiscent of the German expressionist graphic design. The art director was the great William Cameron Menzies, and his seat of the ruins of Everytown is under his best work. Margaretta Scott is very tempting than the chief's mistress. The Everytown of the 21st Century is an equally striking design. The play in the 21st century story is not compelling. Perhaps it was a wrong attempt to contrast the technological rationality of this time with the barbarism of 1970. Unfortunately, the modeling that pours out huge crowds could have been done much better, even with 30s technology. This is especially minor because the screens of the giant aircraft are very convincing. It is redeemed by Raymond Massey's beautiful speech that closes the movie - rarely is the ideal of scientific advancement so well spoken. Massey's final question is now more relevant than ever, in an era of severely disabled manned spaceflight. The scene is helped by Sir Arthur Bliss's rousing music, whose name I proudly share. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the VHS versions of this movie are absolutely horrible, with serious technical issues. Most versions worked out a fairly interesting montage of futuristic workers and machines that took us from 1970 to 2038. I hope there is a good DVD of the whole movie.
