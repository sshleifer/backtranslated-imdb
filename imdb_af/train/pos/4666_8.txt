It's very clever for all 60's watching the movie. The humor is rather soft, but it has grown much more to me than I expected. The movie is first class and they seem to have a wonderful time. Ustinov wanders through the film that kills some funny things under his breath, and all this is very unimportant; I'll buy the movie as soon as it comes to DVD. The plot is that Ustinov is released as an eclipse from the prison sent by a computer and blackmail from an American company with a London office. Maggie Smith is his secretary for a while, and watching her get rid of many different jobs is part of the fun. Bob Newhart is his regular yolk himself, and Karl Malden is delighted as the thin and sloppy CEO who manages the London office. The end is funny and pretty cynical.
