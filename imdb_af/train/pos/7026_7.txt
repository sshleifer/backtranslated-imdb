When I was 17, my high school Bye Bye Birdie performed - this is not a big surprise, as it is perfectly high school material and is allegedly the most advanced musical in the world. <br /> <br /> I was a music student and kept strong memories of the production and his songs, as well as a long-standing disobedience to the Dick Van Dyke movie version that concealed the Elvis references (deliberately) and for a swaying 60-year-old audience. <br /> <br /> So, when the 1995 version hit Jason Alexander with my cable TV screen, I was delighted with what I saw. Alexander turns into an exceptional performance as Albert, a show in stark contrast to his better-known persona from a certain TV show. The rest of the film is entertaining and convincing in their roles (Chynna Phillips may be the only one who doesn't see her part, presumably a naive and innocent schoolgirl). <br /> <br /> But best of all, the musical numbers known from the stage show are all kept in this movie and performed as theatrical music songs (so the absence of a stage is possible). <br /> <br /> So, if you know the musical (and don't do much), watch this telemovie. It shows the increase in justice in a way that is unlikely to be improved, which is good enough for me. What is better than faithfully delivering a writer's work with color and style?
