Wow, praise IMDb and Google, because I've been trying to remember the name of this fantastic movie for over 15 years. Hit high, man! Hells yeah! <br /> <br /> I'm not going to drill you with a plot summary, and actors, and yadda yadda yadda, because you all know what's up. That's why you're here anyway. But what I will do is remind me of the 80-year-old D-Movie slasher. In 1987, when I was about 7, I always hired mines. These horror movies. Would he mind his children watching them with him? No. At that young age I saw Slaughter High. What I saw in that movie was holding on to my big time. I didn't see it, but I still remember most of the ridiculous death in the movie. For example, the post-sex scene (why is there a metal bed in a school?) Is electrocute. Or the man is drowned in a cess pool. Come on! My personal favorite, though ... the explosive stomach of the infected beer. Amazing! How can you honestly hate a movie where one of the characters finds a beer in an abandoned school, like 10 or 15 years later and thinks it would be a good idea to drink it? Then does his stomach explode? What !? And that big line: Let's take my car ... it always starts. Classic crap all the way. <br /> <br /> I mean, I look back now, almost 20 years later, and laugh at it. But when I was 7, I was scared. It's a naked hat (or was it a mask?) That the killer stole, provoked me the f * ck! <br /> <br /> All in all, yes, a crappy movie. But for nostalgia and for humor factor, this movie gets a 9 out of 10 of me. Either late or late every night, hoping to catch it on the same late-night movie program, or pick up a VHS copy and dust off your video recorder.
