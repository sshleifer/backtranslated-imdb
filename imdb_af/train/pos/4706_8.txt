Certainly, it may not be a classic, but it is one full of classic lines. One of the few movies my friends and I have been fifteen years old. (Maybe it was once at Cinemax!) Michael Keaton is actually the worst actor in this movie - he doesn't seem to find out how to play it - but he's surrounded by a fantastic role exactly knowing how to play this spoof . Looking for a movie to encourage you? That's it but rent it with friends - it will make it even better.
