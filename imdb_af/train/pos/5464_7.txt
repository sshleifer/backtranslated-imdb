Babyface - Notorious Barbara Stanwyck flick where she is told by the local professor type that she has power. He tries to get her to read Niezche. She says books never did her well. Sun, we find out her dad is basically pimping her to a local politics and others. Finally she had enough and moved to the big city. We follow her husband's successful learning in an international bank. The dialogue is rather boring because it is time and it was one of the last movies to come out before the self-dedicated Hollywood production code. Look for a comedy by a young John Wayne as one of Stanwyck's willing victims. A further Hollywood collection - I watched the extended version - the DVD has both versions plus Redhead wife and Waterloo bridge. An interesting movie and shadow for future femme-deadly roles that Stanwyck would play in the era of film noir. B +
