I first saw the Ice Age in the Subiaco Cinemas when it came out, back in '02. At that time I was only 13, but even then I liked it. It had some kind of warmth. <br /> <br /> We've had it on the video for a number of years and no matter how many times you see it, it never gets boring. This is because of the one element that makes it different from all the other 3D animations made at that time. The characters have no specific 'home' they leave. They are nomads, and it is really refreshing and uplifting to watch. <br /> <br /> Also, each individual character on the surface just seems to be on top of each other, but it's really good friends. Also, all the characters have their own charm (even the bad guys). Sid the sloth is charming in his annoying, exaggerated and naive kind of way. Manny is spectacular in his depressing, exclusive character, and so on. <br /> <br /> Another wonderful point about the movie is the beauty of the animation. All the environments and characters were originally modeled by clay, giving the film an artistic edge. <br /> <br /> Another aspect that adds to the feel of the movie is that gender means very little. There are hardly any female characters, but you don't really realize it until you watch it a few times and even this has little effect on the way you watch the movie. As a result, there is also no mention of a nuclear family that would be really pathetic in an environment such as the ice age. <br /> <br /> All in all, Ice Age is a great movie and is proof of how much effort 3D animations have put before Shrek 2 and The Incredibles came out.
