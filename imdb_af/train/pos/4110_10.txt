These, and 'Hidden Fortress' are the Kurosawa's which are my best. I don't give 10's like candy, but it definitely does, if anything. Although it is quite long (as all Kurosawa's are reasonable), it is in line with the problem that comes with most of his films. the storyline is often too loose and slow developing, with scenes unnecessary or extended for too long without any real purpose with the storyline or character description. Death Suicide gave me the same experience as, for example, 'Hidden Fortress'; in spite of its length, there was not a single minute I would cut out. <br /> <br /> It is also a very unusual Kurosawa movie in a way, it has no storyline, but very small independent stories based more on character description as storyline, unlike any other Kurosawa -film I've seen so far. It also lends a lot to the dialogue he uses brilliantly (especially in the story between the father and the boy planning their "new home"). <br /> <br /> The thing this one makes a masterpiece is how the subject is as tragic as it is. It is managed to describe such humanity and sympathy without pointing anyone at any point. From the beginning to the end it delivers the whole emotional scale of laughter to tears in perfect balance.
