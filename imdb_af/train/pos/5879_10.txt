One of the more sensible comedies to hit the Hindi movie screens. A remake of Priyadarshans 80s Malayalam hit Boeing Boeing, who in turn was a remake of the 60s Hollywoon hit of the same name. Garam Masala raises the standard of comedy in Hindi Cinema. <br /> <br /> Again, Akshay Kumar proved she is one of the best superstars in the Hindi theater that can do comedy. He combined well with the new hunger John Abraham. However, John remains in Akshays' shadows and fails to rise to the event. <br /> <br /> The new gals are cute and do justice to their roles. <br /> <br /> Look at a comedy. Leave your brain away and laugh for 2 hours !! After all, laughing is the best medicine! Ask Priyadarshan and Akshay Kumar !!!!!
