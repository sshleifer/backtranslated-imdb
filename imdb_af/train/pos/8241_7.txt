Fidois is a very strange movie. And in many ways, a very good one. <br /> <br /> My first thought after looking at was how the hell are they going to market this thing? If Shaun of the Dead is a romantic comedy with zombies, Fido is a boy and his daughter story is mixed with fifties nostalgia comedy with zombies. Do not get completely off the tongue. <br /> <br /> Fido has a bit of Shaun's bloodbath, gore and stomach. This is another animal altogether (forgive the pun). <br /> <br /> Fido kicks off with a black-and-white information film explaining the back story - man has won a war against zombies by developing a control collar that suppresses the meat eaters in dull servants. <br /> <br /> Initially, I thought we were for a fifties cold war paranoia parody, a la Matinee, but soon we were thrown into a world of bright primary colors and fifties-class nostalgia. <br /> <br /> Young Timmy Robinon is a lonely child who doesn't fit at school. His mother is a social climber, and his father is nervous and detached. <br /> <br /> Looking for the Joneses, Mom (Carry-Anne Moss), got a zombie. Jimmy is initially unreliable, but 'Fido' (Billy Conelley) soon proves to be a good partner for Jimmy. Until his collar pops up ... <br /> <br /> Fido is NOT a horror movie, but my problem with the movie is exactly what it is. <br /> <br /> Much of the humor is of the light family variety, and sometimes the plot line is too heavily dependent on the boy and his dog / family moments. <br /> <br /> Yet, the film is shot with wonderful dark, really funny moments, which welcome, will ensure an R rating for what has long been a family comedy. <br /> <br /> The movie looks beautiful and is done wonderfully by everyone involved. <br /> <br /> Despite its difficult tonal problems, I hope this movie will be a niche, as it is quite a small gem in this year's movie movie.
