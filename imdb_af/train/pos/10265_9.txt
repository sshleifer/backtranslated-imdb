Unique film about confused woman (Lindsay Crouse) who gets involved in sharp men. Joe Mantegna gives an Oscar-caliber performance as the slimmest of the group. Absolutely mesmerizing first hour, as Mantegna shows Crouse "the ropes" of his games. Story Line uprooted a little later, but still stands as a unique portrayal of an innocent who is trapped in a dark world. Definitely worth it.
