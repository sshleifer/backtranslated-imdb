Chris Gerolmo not only gave us a kind of Jack-the-stripper list of murdered people: he buried the psychological characterization with compelling results. Perhaps mainly because of Stephen Rea's excellent performance against Donald Sutherland with good empathy by both. It was playing these two parts ?? above all ?? that made the film something more than just a bad version of the history of the butcher of Rostov. Supporting actors, especially Max von Sydow, really performed their parts well. Good direction. That photography was also good. Needless to say, the fact that the film was shot in Hungary had to cause some deviations, but frankly, given the depth of storytelling and interpretations, we can completely forget this trivialia. <br /> <br /> For a time, a movie made for HBO TV movie trumps. Recommended, especially if you typically want to analyze and forget some of the morbid scenes? What I hurry to add is never exaggerated.
