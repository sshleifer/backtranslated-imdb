Yes, it is a chick flag and it moves a little slow, but it is pretty good - and I consider myself a male. You must love Judy Davis, no matter what she is, and the girl playing her daughter gives a natural, convincing performance. <br /> <br /> The landscape of the small, coastal summer spot is beautiful and plays well with the main theme of the movie. The unknown (at least unknown to me) actors and actresses lend a realism to the movie that draws you and keeps your attention. Overall, I give it an 8/10. Go see it.
