The alternative title of Ecstasy is Symphony of Love; a title that describes the sphere and feel of the film appropriately. Ecstasy is an early talkie, and could well have been a classic movie, if released during the silent movie era. This film is a visual surprise, and has been deliberately played so that the viewer can enjoy his sensual lyrics quality, presented in an artistic low key way. The director's style is unique in Europe. The subject and approach to sexuality was far more sophisticated than was previously produced in Hollywood. Consider the censorship code in the US, during the 30's, making it pretty much sums up. Hedy Lamarr, one of the great beauty of all time, was a perfect choice for this "Symphony of Love."
