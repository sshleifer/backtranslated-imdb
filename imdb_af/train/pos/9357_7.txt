In New York, dentist Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle), his former roommate and friend Charlie Fineman (Adam Sandler) meet on the street by chance. Charlie became a lonely and stray man after his wife and three daughters were lost in the tragic September 11, while Alan had trouble discussing his inner feelings with his wife. Alan recovers his friendship with Charlie and they get close to each other. Alan tries to fix Charlie's life, and sends him to psychologist Angela Oakhurst (Liv Tyler), but Charlie has an aggressive response to the treatment. He is sent to court. <br /> <br /> "Reign Over Me" is a great drama about loss, friendship, family and loneliness. September 11 is irrelevant to the plot; It could be a car accident, a fire or any other tragedy, as well as the sexual harassment of Donna Remar, played by the beautiful Saffron Burrows, to Alan. But the family drama works, backed by the great performances of Adam Sandler and Don Cheadle. Liv Tyler is pretty impossible to be recognized, I don't know if she uses excessive makeup to look older, but her face is strange. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Reine Sobre Mim" ("Reign Over Me")
