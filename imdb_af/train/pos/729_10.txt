I love this movie very much, I never get sick to see it. The only line I really can't get together is when Riff calls herself a teen lobotomy, but otherwise, everything is perfect. I have never been a fan of PJ Soles and it didn't help to hear that she didn't even know who the Ramones were before filming this movie, but I can ignore her little face for the most part. Most people who watch it over and over are fans of the Ramones and really .. that's the only reason I love it so much. I never get tired of seeing DeeDee drop his Pizza lines or Joey spills the teacher's name over and over again, haha. One of the best parts of the movie is seeing them singing, wanting to dance, down the halls of high school. I love it. The special edition DVD has a good retrospective, surprisingly PJ Soles is not on it. Maybe she's been working on another project. * Leak * Anyway, good movie, even better if you're a Ramones fan.
