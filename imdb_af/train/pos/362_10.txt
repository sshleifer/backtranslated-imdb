In the year 1985 (my year of birth), Steven Spielberg made an emotionally strong and memorable story of a young African American girl Celie (Debutrol for Whoopi Goldberg) whose life is followed by rough times. The story starts from the year 1909 when Celie is only 14 years old. She gave birth to two children for her father. Celie has a younger sister Nettie with whom she is inseparable. A widower put his eyes on Nettie, but their father gave Celie him. This is the beginning of an era of terrible abuse and constant control. Women are inferior to men and especially to an African American woman. Their rights are less than zero. Celie's story is a true survival story. <br /> <br /> "The Color Purple" is a masterpiece and understated film by Spielberg. He must make more drama, which is "The Purple Purple" and "Schindler's List". <br /> <br /> The cast is amazing. Whoopi Goldberg is better known as a great comedy, but the introduction of role as Celie is a remarkable word she can really draw from heavy drama. Danny Glover was surprisingly nasty "sir". I've never seen him like that before. The talk-show icon, Oprah Winfrey, is brilliant as a strong will Sofia. <br /> <br /> Warning! Prepare to have a number of fabrics with you when viewing this movie. You can really connect to the story of the strong sisterhood. Especially if you have such close relationships with your brothers and sisters as I do with my sister. <br /> <br /> Big thanks to Mr. Spielberg!
