I love this movie a lot. I rented it and expect something not bad to spend an evening. It was a particularly satisfying experience. Some scenes were hilarious and managed to be in a movie not meant to be just a dull slapstick comedy, but with some meaning and moral values. It manages on both counts. The lead is all good, but especially the man who stars also wrote and produced the film. I have never seen these actors, but they were nice and caring about what eventually happened to them. The writing is clever and engaging and has a refreshing feeling about it. . I think you won't be disappointed to see it.
