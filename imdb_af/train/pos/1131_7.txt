It's a very nice movie. One of those you can sit and watch unconsciously when the plot is more and more distorted; more and more funny. Sally Field, Teri Hatcher (in her hey day), Kevin Klein, Elisabeth Shue, Robert Downey, Jr. These are all these well-known, quality actors acting as if they were soap stars / producers. If you've ever watched a sea opera and thought, "How on earth did they achieve this idea?", You will love this movie. I've seen it several times; And every time I see it, the more I appreciate the humor, the more I realize just how good it really is. Don't expect Oscar quality. It's a fun movie to entertain, not an artificial attempt to find "man's inner man". Sit back, relax and laugh.
