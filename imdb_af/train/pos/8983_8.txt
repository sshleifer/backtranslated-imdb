In the car shot from the windshield, someone else plays their latest song, someone else did not respond, according to the voice over. I just wonder how it was made. There were too many scenes in this movie that I wondered about how a camera was. If the screens shot where the Warhols crashed on a BJM, it was true, then it was relentless exploitation to the maximum, if not, then it was a total manufacture, or it made me uncomfortable, if that was the purpose ? All the way through this movie I wondered how the footage happened. Taken on face value, a beautiful portrait of the (tortured) genius we all believe we should be.
