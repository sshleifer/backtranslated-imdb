The extraordinary Rosemary Forsyth is the main reason for seeing this movie. Why she never became a bigger store can never be known. But she is exceptional and steals every scene she is in. Garson Kanin made this piece fluff and the movie is the first time, with Robert Drivas and Brenda Vaccaro especially memorable. A "9" from "10."
