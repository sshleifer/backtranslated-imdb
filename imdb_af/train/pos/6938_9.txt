For that viewer, Winchester '73 'has something in common with' Casablanca '. As you look at it, you get the feeling that you are looking at a string of clips that so often occur in the genre; then you realize that the clichés first became clichés after they were copied from this particular movie and that they were copied so widely because this film was so big. In other words, it is a core work. <br /> <br /> "Winchester '73" is a joy to watch. The broad lines of the plot are somewhat predictable, but mostly because you have copied them so many times in later movies, yet it still has a number of twists that surprise you. The dialogue, the pacing and Mann's direction are excellent. Stewart shines especially, and if you're a fan, it's a must-see, but he's not just a good show. Strikingly, many of the most thoughtful and / or witty lines go to underage characters. Because it makes these characters (much) more than cardboard cuttings, it has added additional realism to the film. <br /> <br /> It's a remarkably understated movie, and it's worth keeping an eye on. The DVD also features an interview with Stewart, which provides some background on the movie.
