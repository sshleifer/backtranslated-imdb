Home Room deals with a Columbine-like high school shooting, but rather than struggling with the look itself, the film shows the aftermath and what happened to the survivors, their trauma, guilt and denial. <br /> <br /> * Spoilers * The shooting is treated as a preliminary conclusion, with no action image, except the reaction of an almost teen SWAT commando after shooting the high school killer. The film has three main characters; The detective investigates the crime of which no guilty parties are found guilty and two teenage girls survive the incident, played by a very young Erika Christensen and Busy Philipps. <br /> <br /> The two girls have nothing but the shootings being put together and the drama follows. <br /> <br /> Erika Christensen, although only 24 are so much around the block, is well-known to movie-makers with her solid and reliable style of acting. Busy Philipps, three years older than Christensen and completely unknown to me, blew me away with her overwhelmingly dramatic power and screen presence. This girl was the part. <br /> <br /> It's a good movie and it connects you with its intimate focus on the fragile but growing relationship between the two traumatized girls. Gus van Sant's Elephant (2003), though good, looks almost superficial and poor compared to Home Room when it comes to dramatic flair and acting. What I can see this movie has very little screen time and exposure - so much more a loss for an equally traumatized America. <br /> <br /> Ten out of ten
