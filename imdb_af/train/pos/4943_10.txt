It's the simplest and the best movie. <br /> <br /> I have my doubts, because even though Freeman is a good actor, he sometimes gets involved in bad projects. It's not one of those times. <br /> <br /> It is a small story that only runs over an hour and fifteen, at a time when we get used to the fact that movies become longer and longer, and not necessarily better, the director use the short time to his advantage, as the characters are as well defined from the start (great representations by freeman and Vega casually), that the little background information on their looks, Morgan himself, though his name is not mentioned, he has been a movie for several years because he was saturated with the business and developed a fear to commit to a screenplay and research for a character in an indie movie where he is a store / supermarket manager. The story begins by dropping him into a supermarket in a rough neighborhood where he meets the cashier of the 10 items or less (Vega), and has to make a trip with the reason that the production forgot him to put him on to count. br /> <br /> In many ways it is a road movie, Morgan gives the laugh and strives with his unbeatable smile and positive perspective on everything. He points to a perfect actor who has educated everyone to define what he sees In a character he can play, and Paz (incidentally, an extraordinarily beautiful woman, even more beautiful than Penelope Cruz) brings the vulnerability of A 25-year-old divorced woman who works harder than everyone else without getting credit in a dead end job at a crappy supermarket. <br /> <br /> It's a talkie, there is a lot of dialogue, but the balance between light and fun and serious and sad is well maintained. The characters immediately love so much that you spend the last 20 minutes begging for more screen time but the shortness is in the nature of the story, so it was a good call from the director not to submit.
