I watched this movie at Birmingham Southern College in 1975, when it was shown in conjunction with the Red Balloon. Both films are similar in their dream-like quality. The bulk of the movie involves a fish that happily swims in its bowl while its new owner, a little boy, is away at school. A cat comes into the room where the fish and his bowl come, and begins with a mess of his "prey". The boy starts walking home from school, and the viewer wonders if he will come in time to save his fish friend. The fish is excited by the cat's presence and finally jumps out of the bowl! The cat walks quickly to the fish, gently picks him up with his feet, and gives him back to his bowl. Fortunately, the boy returns to his fish, not the wiser. <br /> <br /> The ending is wonderful in both its irony and its technical complexity. It is difficult to imagine how the director could withdraw the technical performance in 1959. It looks like more than a trick for 2003. <br /> <br /> If you can find it, watch it - you won't be disappointed! And if you find * find it, let me know so I can get a copy too!
