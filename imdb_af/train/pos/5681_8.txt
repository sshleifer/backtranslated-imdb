I had no problem with the movie, which I thought was pretty good. This is the real LAPD crime scene video that disturbed me. I wonder if Lions gate really thought the general viewers would want people who were shot dead and blood all over the place to see. Sorry Lion's Gate, it was an indescribable BAD IDEA! <br /> <br /> Back to the movie: The movie was excellent, especially Val Kilmer as the late John Holmes. John Holmes was a sleaze, mistreating the women in his life (Lisa Kudrow as his wife, Kate Bosworth as his girlfriend) and he is hopelessly deep in drugs. His connection with Eddie Nash (Eric Bogosian) creates a spiral that led to the notorious Wonderland murders. Exactly how much was Holmes involved in the murders? We can never know the whole truth about the story (Nash still lives and a free man), but the film does a good job.
