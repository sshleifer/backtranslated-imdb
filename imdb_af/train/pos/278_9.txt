I have to say, Clive Barker's Undying is by far the best horror game ever made. I played Resident Evil, Silent Hill and the Evil Dead and Castlevania games, but no one caught the pure pleasure this game had taken on its terrible elements. Barker is good at what he does, attaching the horror to our world, and showing his hand everywhere in the game. Heck, even his voice is in the game as one of the main characters. Full of lush visions and plenty of atmosphere to shake a stick, Undying is the game to beat in my books the best horror title. I just wish it made it to a console system, but unfortunately, poor PC sales have cut one in the bud.
