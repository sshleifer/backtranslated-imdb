I must admit I was totally shocked at this movie. For one, I went to see it on a whim that expected something mediocre, but it was the most shocking thing about it in a populist American movie. It's British comedy at its best - dark, peculiar and funny in ways American movies are never again. However, I must briefly recommend recommending it to anyone; I saw it with several people, some English, some European and some American and while some of us love it (mainly from the first two groups), some hated it and found it worthless. If you think you are in this kind of thing, go. If not, don't do it. 10/10.
