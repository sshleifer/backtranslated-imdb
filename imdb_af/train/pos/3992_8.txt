While movie titles contain the word "Mother", the first thing that comes to mind will be a mother's love for her children. <br /> <br /> However, the Mother tells a different story. <br /> <br /> The mother does not discuss the love between a mother and her child or how she offers her for the benefit of her child. Here, the director of Notting Hill, Roger Michell, tells how a mother's love for a man about half her age does the people around her. <br /> <br /> Before playing Daniel Bond's role as Daniel Bond, he plays Darren, a man who helps refresh the mother's son's house, and also sleeps with her daughter. Anne Reid, who was a famous TV show, takes on the challenging role of May's main character. <br /> <br /> The story begins with May being the sudden loss of her husband, Toots, in a family visit to her son, Bobby. While friendly with Darren, a handful of refurbishers in Bobby's home, she was shocked to find out that her daughter, Paula, was sleeping with Darren. At the same time, May's death led to May's death. While fearing that Harry and Paula didn't want her, May got her life off track until she spent her afternoon with Darren. <br /> <br /> Darren was nice and friendly until May and could soon find some love. on drones Instead of treating him like a friend, she treated the man who was about half the age with the love of a couple. Later, May found Darren's sexual pleasure, where he gave her the pleasure she could never find on anyone else. And this is the start of the disaster that can lead to the breaking down of a family. <br /> <br /> The mother explores the inner world of a widow who wanted to try something she never had in her life, and comfort someone who is there for her to shoulder. It can be told from May to buy tea time for Darren to fulfill the sexual needs of a man younger than her, where she eventually negotiated more than she had. <br /> <br /> Anne Reid made a breakthrough for her role in May, as she was best known for her different role on TV series. Since she did not resume many movies in her career, The Mother put her on the critic's attention. Daniel Craig, on the other hand, had a similar role in his film, such as Sylvia (2003) and Enduring Love (2004). If James Bond's performance role fails, film judges should not forget that he performed better in his years of film career, and the Mother is one of them. <br /> <br /> The Mother may not be everyone's favorite, but it is definitely not your usual matinee show to go with tea and scones with butter and jam.
