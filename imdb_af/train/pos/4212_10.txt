Directed by Samuel Fuller, who also wrote the screenplay, Pickup on South Street is a tough, brutal, well-crafted film about a Richard Widmark, which is continuously gaining top secret microfilm and becoming a target for spy agents. Also involved is Jean Peters as a tough broad used as courier by her evil ex-lover Richard Kiley. It is film-noir at its best and although the performances are very good, his big-character actress Thelma Ritter is the movie stealer. Like Moe, a tired street selling neck straps (and also selling information), she is immensely in a role that brought her another Oscar nomination. It's amazing that Miss Ritter has been nominated for an Oscar award six times and she never won. It must have been the role it applied to her!
