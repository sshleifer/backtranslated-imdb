A Pentagon science team apparently perfected a serum that resulted in invisibility, but when the chief tried it on himself, he couldn't stop the process. Frustrated and drunk in power, he becomes psychotic in the classic HG Wells tradition. <br /> <br /> It's a terribly invisible man story that is delivered by the ever-tasteful Verhoeven and Spek as the genius-twisted-tune maniac. As with many of Verhoeven's work, it has a tremendous, unlimited sense of Boy's Own cartoon adventure (the secret underground lab where scientists work is just wonderful) combined with the most horrible and depraved visuals (women in their Underwear is seized and attacked By an invisible enemy animals are killed, literally liter of blood and wholesalers in the last two roles). While the story doesn't turn a new idea on an old idea, the CG special effects of Scott E. Anderson are obviously brilliant, seeing literally the veins and arteries, cardiovascular systems, muscles, tissues, bones and flesh. from nowhere. In particular, an order where the team bring a gorilla back from the invisible state and the scene where Bacon Devane drowns in a pool is absolutely breathtaking in detail and artistic invention of the effects. The movie also features a good soundtrack by Jerry Goldsmith and classic horror film photography by Jost Vacano. The young movie is pretty much overshadowed by the movie's technical pedigree, but both Shue and Dickens are impressive from their depths. It's a great fun nasty movie.
