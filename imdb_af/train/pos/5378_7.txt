It's an interesting movie made in 1967, with cool, jazz-like soundtrack music and a plot that makes you laugh ... OK, it's not really stupid, but it's fun. I have seen many similarities between this and 'Creature with the Blue Hand' (AKA The Bloody Dead) and they have the same director! Scotland Yard's best investigation is the murder of young ladies at a college. Looks like criminals are being released from a local prison to do the prayer of an evil person and then return when their work is done. There is a handy device that is placed inside a bible that acidic acid, and there is another device that is not nifty or clandestine. It looks like a large spray gun and the victim must be reasonably close before it expires. Joachim Fuchsberger plays an inspector and he mostly throws gums and looks down the distance. There is a "monk", and how someone identifies it as a "monk" is outside of me, it carries a whip and dresses in a red outfit with a red cap, more of a Klan member of a different color to a monk. There are all kinds of devices like a fireplace that go up and down to admit the monk, and it stretches across the fire without burning its robe, a good trick there. It's a weird combo of crime drama with goofy overtones, and while it's sometimes pretty stupid, it's nice to watch. 7 out of 10, not bad.
