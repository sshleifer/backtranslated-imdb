Why did I enjoy the last episode show? As a result of the true talent, Melissa Joan Hart and her supporting castor demonstrated that whites, comedy, light-hearted humor and deep thinking can actually exist. What I enjoyed most was the fact that I could come from a hard day's work and brush a smile ... I was inspired ... and why? It was an inspiration to watch as this magical person was so happy to help others. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Sabrina was a hero ... although she was vulnerable in ways not as different from our own ... to completely different; She had powers on her fingers, wishes and commands that can be used well or badly, which can only exist in many of our imaginations. Most everything we see, know, own or even desire ... can be used well or badly, and how we prefer to define it, defines the person we are. <br /> <br /> She has traveled the world and other worlds with these constant and unconscious ideas in mind ... to learn, to live, to laugh and to love. She always learned how to improve her skills for the benefit of all of them; She made mistakes while she was alive, went through the growth of different journeys, as she, her aunts, and Salem (the underrated but imperfect hero) proved to prove that even through mistakes, you are still noble, gifted and wonderful. <br /> <br /> She also demonstrated many selfless, learning and loving acts as she walked along her path. If it's not enough for 10 stars in this war-torn world where people are so hostile to each other, don't realize how differences are the spices of life, rather than a reason to kill ... then I don't know what is . This show was definitely a trip to a better world as well as an inspiration to be better and a gift meant to have a smile on our jaws ... I've heard from a doctor what I mentioned above. lead to a healthy "heart" ... and isn't that what we all need? :)
