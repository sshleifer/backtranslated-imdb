This police procedure is no worse than many others of his era, and better than quite a few. Obviously, it follows the steps of "Dragnet" and "Naked City", but appears as a pleasant programmer. The best thing about it is the unhardened look it offers in a long-gone world ... the lower class of New York from the late 40's / early 50's. Here it is in all its seedy glory, from the old school tattoo hall to the cheap hotels to the greasy spoons. These old police movies are like travel reports to a passing era and lots of bittersweet for anyone who doesn't like the purified, haphazard cityscape of today. <br /> <br /> Also interesting is the emphasis on the nuts and bolts' scientific aspect of the solution The Crime. In this case, the murder of a tattooed woman found in an abandoned car. Our main heroes, detectives Tobin and Corrigan, do the footwork, but without the laborious and painful efforts of the lab boys, they will get nowhere. Although the technology is not in the same league, police here use the dogged persistence of a C.S.I. investigator to find their husband. <br /> <br /> As some reviewers have written about this movie, you think it would be directed by Ed Wood and acted by extras from his movies. What a breeze! I enjoyed John Miles as the gang ex-Marine, Tobin. He has had a happy, easy-going approach to the role that is a welcome change from the regular stone-colored histrionics of most film-makers of the period. Patricia Barry is cute and beautiful as his beautiful friend who helps solve the crime. Walter Kinsella is stuffy and fond of the older detective Corrigan. I'd rather choose the chemistry of these two and it made something different than the kind of robot Dragnet approach. <br /> <br /> The riddle itself is not too deep and the final chase and shooting is definitely not going to be under the classic crime movie, but during its short time, "The Tattooed Stranger" more than my interest .
