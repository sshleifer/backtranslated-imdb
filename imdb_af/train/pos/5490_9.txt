It's really an amazing movie. It not only proves the eternal struggle of indigenous and awesome people to get their rightful voice, but it also shows the United States on its dishonesty, subterfuge and blatant disregard for human rights and self-determination. Chavez is shown as a very brave and charismatic leader who is struggling with what can only be described as a despicable elite without any sense of relationship or justice. These filmmakers recorded a coup as opposed to anything previously seen. <br /> <br /> And in the hair we see the US, pull the strings again and fade all reality. It is sad to see the initial stages of the uprising and to know that the subversion of the democracy we see is a tool that has long been used by successive US governments and their seemingly shining citizens. The footage makes it clear that it is not a manipulation of television or generic footage, but an active documentation of a people and its government is fighting for its future. Really a moving experience for anyone with a conscience. These Irish filmmakers deserve our gratitude. Long live Chavez. <br /> <br /> We need to ease the idea that every country should be allowed to choose its government and to develop in ways that the majority considers appropriate. The first phase of this process is the need to know what the realities of the situation are and this documentary work really does.
