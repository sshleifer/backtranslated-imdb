After the usual chase scene, Jerry accidentally winds into a bottle of invisible ink, which was part of a chemical set. He quickly discovers he is invisible ... so the predictable results take place, which means he uses his new hidden condition to torment Tom. Jerry often just defends himself, but often he has a sadistic streak in him that botheres the cat when possible even when it is not proven. <br /> <br /> Here he gives Tom the impression that his eyes are deceiving him when cheese disappears from a mousetrap in front of his eyes, or milk from a dish. Tom can't take it anymore, so he tries to sleep this nightmare, but Jerry puts fire on his leg! Man, I hope little kids didn't look at these 40's and 50's cartoons! I always found Jerry, the little mouse, more angry than cute. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, in cartoons, in general, what harm a person suffers is within seconds and he is usually back. <br /> <br /> The best part of this cartoon is about two-thirds of the way through when Tom figures out what Jerry's story is, and tries different methods to determine where the mouse is located (such as flour place on the floor to see his footprints).
