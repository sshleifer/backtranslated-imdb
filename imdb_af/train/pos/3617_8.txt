Girlfight follows a new New York high school girl from a sense of futility in the world of amateur boxing where she finds self-esteem, purpose, and more. Although the film is not about boxing, boxing is all about the movie. So much so you can almost smell the sweat. Technically and artistically a good shot with a sense of honesty and reality about it, "Girlfight" is no chick spot and no "Rocky". Rather, it is a very human drama that can even link viewers who do not know boxing.
