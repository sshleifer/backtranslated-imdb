There are too many subjects avoided in the theater and eating disorders is one of them. This movie shows it as it is. It is not glamorized for the viewers to enjoy, it is shown with the real truth that makes it increasingly powerful. I only saw it once and it was a few years ago, but I can still remember everything about it and how it made me feel. It is a very powerful film and is good support for anyone suffering from an eating disorder to give them the will. That's what movies are about. They have to be there to help people and not to envy things.
