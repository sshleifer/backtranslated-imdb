This long episode captures some surprises, tensions, mystery and concerns about Sherlock's battle against Charles Augustus Milverton, a master-extortionist. It's an excellent long time from the Jeremy Brett-Holmes series. In the film, ordinary Holmes's canon appears as Inspector Lestrade and Mrs. Hudson, though not Moriarty, but a biggest villain, Charles Augustus. <br /> <br /> It's a real rip with intrigue, excitement and excitement, including an exciting final twist. It's a specific Sherlock movie, but we find Holmes in love with a servant, kissing, crying, and even robbing. This time with the episode Â¨Scandal in Bohemia with Irene Adler, leads to the only one surprised Holmes. Top-notch Brett performance, alongside Peter Cushing is the best Sherlock TV, while Basil Rathbone is in the theater forever. Brett acts as a resolute, head-on, urgent being. Here, Dr. Watson is not a comic, botcher and clumsy pal that is personalized by Nigel Bruce, but is a clever and sly partner well-credited by Edward Hardwicke, a perfect Brett counterpoint. Casting is frankly beautiful, special mention to Robert Hardy as a nasty kid. Hardy, known today as Cornelius Fudge in Harry Potter, is a veteran actor with forty years of career and with various successes such as the 10th kingdom and Winston Churchill. Furthermore, secondary actors appear with great performances, including Nickolas Grace, Sophie Gordon, Serena Gordon. The film gets a colorful atmosphere, the London streets and 221 Baker Street's home are well designed. The film is well directed by Peter Hammond, director of several episodes. This is a must have for Arthur Conan Doyle fans.
