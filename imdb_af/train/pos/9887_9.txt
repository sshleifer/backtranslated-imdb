"Erendira" is a rare Mexican film from Mexico. The movie only exists in a low quality VHS format. It is a pity that this movie was not given a DVD edition. "Erendira" is wonderful and beautiful with its magic-realistic images. "Erendira" is based on a short story from the novel "100 Years of Solitude". Erendira is always daydreaming and accidentally burns her grandmother's home. Her evil grandmother, played by Irene Papas, forces her into prostitution to pay for the damage. The whole town gets a piece of Erendira, so to speak. Although the subject is suffering, the film does not use sexuality. It is done in an adult artistic way. The movie also has some amazing costumes. Some of the more surreal aspects of the movie that stand out most are the origami birds that come up in real birds and a golden orange with a diamond in the middle. Erendira is an amazing movie, which even manages to throw in humor. It's definitely a movie that deserves a special DVD edition. As they would say in Espanol, "Es muy muy bien !!!
