Excellent Warner Bros effort with Errol Flynn in one of his best screen performances. It's often quoted as its best, and I can't really judge fully until I've seen his "Dawn Patrol". But his work in "They killed with their boots" takes a little beating. I'm a big Flynn fan (he's my favorite actor after James Mason - it also helps him to be an Aussie) and I think he's just great, a big screen presence and also a good actor. He is the centerpiece of "Gentleman Jim" as the legendary boxer with the fine footwork, but he is also supported by a literate, warm and funny writing and Raoul Walsh's direction. Every Walsh movie I saw never lost a beat of his passport, he was really a born movie maker. Walsh nicely sets the ringtones, as he does with the lighter moments and the spicy, final scene between Ward Bord and Flynn. Add to that great production values ​​(the "Gay Nineties" never looked better!) And a beautiful supporting role-play and it's quite perfect entertainment. Alan Hale usually played Flynn's sidekick, but here's his dad, and it still works. Alexis Smith is Flynn's love interest. The couple are head over heels in love to fight each other.
