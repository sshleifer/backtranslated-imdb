This movie is SOOOO funny !!! The acting is wonderful, the Ramones are sexy, the jokes are subtle, and the plot is just what every high school dreams do to go to his school. I absolutely loved the soundtrack as well as the carefully placed cynicism. If you like monty python, you'll love this movie. This movie is a little bit "fat" esk (without all the annoying songs). The songs that are sung are nice; You can even find yourself singing these songs as soon as the movie is over. These musical ranks number two in musical for me (second next to the blues brothers). But please do not think of it as a musical; To see how the songs are so nice, it's hard to say that a carefully correlated scene is taking place. I think of this movie as more of a comedy with romance romance tones. You will be reminded of how it was to be a rebellious teenager; Needless to say, you will be reminded of your old high school days after watching this movie. Highly recommended for both the family (as it is a very youthful but also adult, as there are many jokes that are more fun with age and experience.
