I just caught an episode about Brad, the crack cocaine addict who turned to the streets after a drug addictive life after his cycling career went as fast as it began. I must say that the story about his bicycle career is more heartbreaking than his drug addiction. Here is this young man who wins the left and right bike games. He is invited to practice an Olympic training team for two weeks, and immediately upon arrival he insults Lance Armstrong, one of the greatest athletes ever to live, and is generally worthy of being unkind. to everyone in general. Understandably, he is promptly asked to leave. Most of the shows are about his struggle with addiction and how he got his life back, but what I wanted to know was what was wrong with him in the first place to make his act such an ass? <br /> <br /> Anyway, I was confused about how the show was composed because it shows Brad up to his addiction. We see footage of his pan-handling and sleeping in the gutters and ditches and even smoking crack cocaine. I didn't even know what was right to show, but why would a camera team just pursue and film it? Do they do it in the hope that this guy will turn his life around and give their material for a good TV episode? <br /> <br /> In any case, it's an enlightening show, as it shows the effects of various addictions and total control that can take over people's lives. Sometimes it's hard to watch because you really see how badly the families and friends are in the face of the addict's indifference, although I have to admit that it seems a bit too clean in the end. There are times during the episodes when terrible things happen and everything looks lost, but still, and maybe I should warn about spoilers here, everything has a little too much of a happy, eternal feeling to the end, and I have a Feeling This is a very unusual occurrence in real life. But still, it's a show about people trying to help other people, and you can't complain too much about something like that?
