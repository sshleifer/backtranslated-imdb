I see a lot of people on this site, because AG would come out on DVD. Well, I bought it on DVD. (Out of bounds, no less!) While it's great to have this fantastic show in a DVD form, I'm upset that they have very little in the way of extras (a director comment from Shaun Cassidy on the Pilot episode) and the episodes are shown in the same order as they were put on TV. The missing episodes that have never been shown before being performed on the Sci Fi channel are in the box, but are listed on the final DVD. If you buy the DVD series, get the actual order they need to be viewed and you will be happier. (You have to swap DVDs in and out of your player to see them in order, but you'll be glad you did.) <br /> <br /> S
