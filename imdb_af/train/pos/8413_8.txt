A stupid young man becomes obsessed with a woman - so obsessed with losing perspective and common sense. An evil wizard approaches him and notifies him that he can give him great wealth that he can use to win the woman's heart. He agrees to give him something he wants in the room. The stupid old man agrees and the wizard steals the man's reflection from the mirror - and bad things, of course, happen. <br /> <br /> If this movie was made just a decade later, I'm sure I wouldn't. It wasn't so much charity to review this movie. After all, the movie's plot is a bit vague in places and the acting is a bit silent. But if you think the movies were scarce in 1913 - and often just 20 to 30 minutes long! In addition, the whole idea of ​​a complex story as you get in this movie is very unusual - as stories acted very briefly and broadly. So, given the time constraints, this movie is pretty good and one of the previous horror movies is known.
