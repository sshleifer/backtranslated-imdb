Madhur from CHANDNI BAR started making realistic films, which some people called dry. <br /> <br /> He made SATTA, another realistic but cinematic movie, but a great movie. <br /> <br /> Men at work were <br /> <br /> <br /> A movie that is in the life of journalists drugs and it's a brilliant movie . <br /> <br /> <br /> The movie is well-spoken, although the half-baked romantic parts of Konkana can be avoided, but it is forgiven. <br /> <br /> The entire Upendra Limaye circuit is also great <br /> <br /> while the Atul Kulkarni course is also great <br /> <br /> The link between Manoj Joshi and his friends is initially funny but repeatedly <br /> <br /> The subplot of Bikram-Tara is brilliant and so is the whole hospital scene and also the final child abuse that shocks you. <br /> <br /> The movie has a open end that is properly handled. <br /> <br /> Madhur does a good job. Music is okay <br /> <br /> Konkana shines as crazy Havi, with her expressions to the best Tara Sharma, is decent, except her voice is Sandhya Mridul good as usual. Upendra Limaye excels in his role as the cop, one of the talented actors. Unfortunately, he is not being used well. Nowdays Atul Kulkarni is also good in his small part Boman Irani is stuck and offers excellent work rest
