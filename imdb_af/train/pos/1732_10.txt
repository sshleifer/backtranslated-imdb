"Sandra, Making a Woman" is a proponent of exploitation movies, and for two reasons: (1) an excellent, but effortless, performance by Monica Gayle, and (2) the fact that Gary Graver is on steering the project. These two talents, both of which are underestimated, make Sandra a movie to be seen. <br /> <br /> Another key element of the film's success is its realism - there's nothing fake or "Hollywood". about this set-in-California movie. It's really a part of life. The modest house in which Sandra lives at the beginning of the film, the simple dresses worn by the character, the scene where Sandra wakes up in the morning to find Uschi Digart who jumps at her front door and sits on the sofa without Sandra make up while Digart tries to sell her cosmetics. She really looks as if she just woke up (but still beautifully), the innocent treasure Sandra picks up who likes to love her while wearing a bra, the one bedroom apartment that Sandra moves - all these elements of the film looks really real and as such the viewer is drawn into Sandra's small world from the start and is immediately interested and wants her to succeed. Sandra also makes her case for free love with eloquence and dignity and she comes with a lot of class. <br /> <br /> This movie could easily fail in less skilled hands and could be in any of the usual sex exploitation directions, but the Garver / Gale team made sure that "Sandra" was not just making a woman but making an excellent movie.
