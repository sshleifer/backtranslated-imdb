Sudden Impact tends to be regarded as a good reputation as a director as Eastwood's artistic failure. The reason for this is actually not the movie itself, but the attitude it takes against vigilance it seems to support. In some places, it actually owes more to Death Wish than the original Dirty Harry movie. One can argue if that is so - at the end of the day, it is a film about debt, justice and retribution. For me, at the end of the day, it's more empathy than sympathy. However, given all these arguments, it is easily overlooked that sudden impact is a very well-made film. Forget the "Throw punk, make my day scene", it's iconic but not original. But watch the views of San Francisco being taken out of the sky and zooming in on the city. The first 15 or 20 minutes are quite spectacular. Or look at the brilliant scene where Sondra Locke's character visits her mentally ill sister in hospital. Eastwood makes great use of the opposition of faces. So in general, Sudden Impact is a very visual film that really shows how mature Eastwood is as director. And if I remember correctly, it was actually the first time Eastwood had put it on the screen, but in an action movie of debatable ideology. Also, I think this is the first good pace Eastwood directed. Although Eastwood has great talent as a director, dramaturgy has always been his weak point (see Play Misty for me, Breezy, etc.). The space of the story leads to the visual elements that are well integrated into the film and not distract from the story. The only thing that is really annoying is the dog.
