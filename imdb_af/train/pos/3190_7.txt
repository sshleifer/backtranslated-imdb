This is your standard 30's musical comedy, with a big plus that it has some well-known '30s actors in small fun cameos. <br /> <br /> There is not much in the story and basically the movie is all about its fun and "uneasy" overall kind of atmosphere, with a typical Hal Roach comedy. Appereantly, it's a 'Cinderella story', but I definitely didn't think so when I watched the movie. The story is much obscured in the storytelling. It features many different characters and also very small cameo appearances when the main characters hit the Hollywood studios. <br /> <br /> Of course, the highlight of the movie is when Laurel & Hardy make their appearance and show off their routines. It's like watching a movie and getting a Laurel & Hardy shortly before. Laurel & Hardy regular Walter Long also makes a appearance in the routine and James Finlayson (without a mustache this time) as the director of the card. <br /> <br /> It is certainly true that all the cameos and subplots derive from the main plot line and character, but in this case it is not a problem as it is much more fun and interesting to watch than the main plot line and the level typical main character. <br /> <br /> The movie is definitely not any worse than any of its other genre films of the same period, although the rating would otherwise suggest it. <br /> <br /> 7/10
