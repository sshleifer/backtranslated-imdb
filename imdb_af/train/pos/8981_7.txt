Dig! I will tell anyone, even if you don't like Metallica to see some kind of monster, it's a backbone tap-type documentary about one of the world's largest bands performing like spiritual children during a breakdown of all kinds. It's fun and fascinating. Along the same lines are digging! A movie about 'the Dandy Warhol's' and 'the Brian Jonestown massacre', two Portland bands starting a kind of music scene in the hometown, just because one of the groups grows and one along the way in musical history fall. books. From the beginning, the two tires pull in opposite directions only to their ability to make decisions, good or bad. Filmed over seven years and sometimes painful to see we see the dandy's meteoric rise to fame (thanks to the vodafone ad!) And the Jonestown seminars fall from the scene attacks to bite wannabes. As the tires become more dissociated, the friendships are tightened and fought on several points in arguments and even on stage. All these things are half funny and half tragic and believe it or not, it's perverse. As I said in the beginning, you can watch the Metallica movie, even if you have no interest in the band. Dig! on the other hand is slightly different and is nicer and much easier to see if you have a passing interest in any band. Another good movie and more a will not be in a bond than to encourage it as a career. Dig! Is a crazy ride on the dress and role of dragons and a good example of the pitfalls and enjoyment of being or wanting to be.
