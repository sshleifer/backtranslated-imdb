Girlfight uses a familiar formula as someone pointed out, but I saw a lot of movies not doing so well or not being credible. I believe it is ultimately easier for a woman to empathize with the character and thus feel more touched by the movie. <br /> <br /> The movie encourages both spiritually and physically, even if your life and environment are completely different. and I think the viewer can still get a lot by seeing it. Although it took me 5 years to start boxing and sports in general, it was the movie that sparked me. <br /> <br /> so the plot is known / common. actors are good. but the thoughts that can spark it are what makes it above average in my opinion. It made me a big impression and I know I'm not the only one.
