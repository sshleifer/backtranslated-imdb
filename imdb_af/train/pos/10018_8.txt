This night listener is better than people generally say. It has weak points, and there seems to be a genre identity crisis, no doubt, but I think its creepy atmosphere and intriguing performances make it this matter. The whole thing feels like one of the fires "it happened to a friend of a friend of mine" ghost stories. One major complaint about the movie is the pacing: but the slow and sometimes uncomfortable pacing is deliberate. Everything that unfolds in this movie is well kept in the realm of possibility, and real life just kind of plowing? No? So there are no flashy ends or landslide revelations, no "revelation" scenes. Thank you heaven. You need to enter the zone when you watch this movie, forget about your discussions and your expectations of what a (conventional) good movie is. Williams is not great, but he easily meets the needs of the story, plus his character is a bit generic ("Niemand"), as he is the Everyman, the avatar through which we ourselves enter the story. Toni Collette's performance must be nominated for an Oscar (even if she doesn't win it). Give it a shot. For quality and content alone, The Night Listener is surely in the top twenty percent of the movies coming out these days.
