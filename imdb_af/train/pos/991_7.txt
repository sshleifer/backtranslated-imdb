I'm really shocked to see the number of reviews that this film is lambing. This movie was not meant to be a "deep thought" movie, and that's what the vast majority of judges think it should be. In fact, any movie doesn't seem to deliver a life-changing insight, and a deep, twisted, sensible plot, they will rate it a 1 or 2. Don't keep a movie, because you don't like the genre, people. <br /> <br /> This movie was an Action / Comedy movie, and that's all it was meant to be. And for an action / comedy it was done very well. I was actually astonished that I enjoyed it as much as I did. I have never been a Jamie Foxx fan and have the overused plot it had. <br /> <br /> The plot was nothing spectacular. the typical criminal comes out of jail and is thrown into a bad man's plot while trying to clear his action (see Bloustreep, Hudson Hawk, 48 hours, etc. etc.) but it is heated with a bit of heat . a technological twist. Now the "bad guys" are actually the "good guys" and the real bad guy is a bad guy. <br /> <br /> Jamie Foxx actually plays a convincingly humorous, at the same time quite intelligent and serious character, and didn't try to overdo the humor of the movie. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a deep underlying plot such as "The Matrix" or a drama like "Of Mice and Men" then this movie is not for you. But if you enjoy the raw action, excellent quick filming, and an occasional twist of humor being thrown in, this movie won't disappoint you. I would normally rate it over an 8 (on the same level as the Die Hard Trilogy), but instead gave it a 10 to try and bring the score to what it should be. <br /> <br />
