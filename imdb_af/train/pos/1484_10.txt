"CASOMAI" was the last movie I saw before I was married last year. <br /> <br /> It was also the first movie I was looking for after I got married, because we promised to give a copy to our priest. <br /> <br /> Sometimes reality is not apart from fiction. To everyone who wrote those priests like "Don Camillo" does not exist in real life, I command them to visit my priest Pe. Nuno Westwood, in Estoril, Portugal :-) <br /> <br /> To all the others, I just recommend them to this movie before and after the "I do!" To see. day :-) <br /> <br /> Rodrigo Ribeiro Portugal
