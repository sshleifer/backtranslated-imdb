It's a very entertaining movie, considering the budget and its length. The storyline is hardly ever touched in the film world, and it has also brought a sense of novelty. The acting was great (P'z to Dom) and the movies were also very well done. I recommend this movie to anyone in the vibrator, it won't disappoint you!
