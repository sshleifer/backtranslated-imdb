This is the only movie I saw Prince, but it doesn't matter. And I thought he was just big with the singer, I was wrong. This is probably his best performance. The music is wonderful. That's why it won the Oscar in 1984 for the best music for a movie (or something). Now he has an Oscar and Grammies under his belt. Although the curse gets in the way with the movie (make sure there are no small children or in the room). There is not too much to say without revealing the plot. You really have to go out and get this movie, your collection is not complete unless you have this movie in it. What else can I say, except for this movie!
