Walter Matthau and George Burns were a well-known vaudeville comedy, Lewis and Clark, who didn't play more than 10 years. Burns retired and Matthau took it personally and has since had a grudge. So the premise of this hilarious Neil Simon play was made in a movie. Of course, what makes it so good is Matthau and Burns in their best, and the material is funny than you can find today. Richard Benjamin shines as Matthau's cousin and agent. There are even old tracks from real golden age stars to get you in the groove of the movie, and the character actor Fritz Feld starts with a "pop". Rosetta LaNoire, who started theater with Orson Welles in the thirties and later is Grandma on "Family Matters", is big in a small role. <br /> <br /> The only problem I had with it (and maybe I am too picky and / or serious) is the way Matthau treats Burns when they first meet. Admittedly, he has had a great deal of resentment these years, but some of the things he does are considered rude or just badly taken from context. Also, I'm used to seeing Matthau's act in other movies, but not George Burns. And, Matthau's beliefs tend to grow a bit old. <br /> <br /> All in all, if you need a consistent, funny movie to help and forget your problems, sit down "The Sunshine Boys." They will light your spirits and remind you of a simpler time and way of life. <br /> <br /> Benjamin: "You have to move it." <br /> <br /> Matthau: "Wait, wait. I think you should move it."
