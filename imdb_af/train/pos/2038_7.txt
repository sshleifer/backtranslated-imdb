This movie exceeded my expectations. I thought and heard that it would be rubbish, so I didn't expect much. However, I was pleasantly surprised. Initially I didn't go well to the head girl and she didn't really care if she had lived or died. After a while she definitely grew on me and became a nice character. It's not just a slasher movie where people die without reason. There is a background story that only takes a few seconds from the movie, but explains a lot. I would recommend this movie to everyone. If you are not sure, just watch an hour and a half of your life. You're going to live for 80 years anyway.
