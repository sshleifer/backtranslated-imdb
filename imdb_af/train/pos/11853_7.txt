Life Pod is one of those movies you just watch and try not to analyze too hard. The acting is at best amateurish. Of course, the special effects are low budget but not too bad. The story line is pretty stocky but with an interesting twist. Computer runs amok, but not a computer, and running amok is very understandable when the truth is revealed. Yet the movie has its moments and is very visible. For me, at least part of the appearance of this movie is the prominent role of Kristine DeBell. She may not be the biggest actress in the world, but was a former playmate of the month, she's cute enough. In all Life Pod, much like other low-budget Sci-Fi movies of the 1980s and somewhat predictable. <br /> <br /> The White Star Lines is cute, if it's totally inaccurate. The last of the White Star Lines Company stock was bought by the Cunard Lines in 1947 and the last ship under the White Star colors was the Britannic (not the sister of Titanic) sold for scrap in 1960.
