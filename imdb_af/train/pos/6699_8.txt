When Sabrina first came on our screens, I was about 12, so I spent my teens watching the teenage witch come in all sorts of strange preachers. <br /> <br /> It was always one of my favorite programs, the witty feel of the sixties sitcom 'Bewitched' but this time the character was cooler. I always liked Sabrina because she was smart. She was also friendly and easy, which made her enjoyable. The characters at the beginning were wonderful; Harvey, Jenny, Libby, the quiz master, Salem and Mr. Poole (my personal fave, shame he walked so early). Hilda and Zelda her aunts started, but then it became annoying. <br /> <br /> Kraft also, because he was always approaching that little bit to discover Sabrina's secret. What I loved from the first three series was the original ideas, the discovery of the family secret and the learning of new play, but as it went on, it became more predictable. Too many characters came and left, like Valerie, Dreama and Brad, and then they decided to do Sabrina at college that ruined me. <br /> <br /> Sabrina self-absorbed at college, there was less magic, no playbook, no tannies with her, and Roxie, Miles and Morgan were annoying. <br /> <br /> The last series was boring, and I just watched to see what finally happened. Not having Hilda and Zelda in one way or another seemed wrong and Miles was just like that. The last episode made me feel much better (SPOILER) landed Sabrina with Harvey on her wedding day to Darling. Aaron was wonderful! Overall a great program if you have forgotten the poor last two or three series, which reminds me of so many teenage programs. Magical.
