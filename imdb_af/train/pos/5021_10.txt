I rented this movie and watched it 20 times before taking it back to the store. Bill Paxton hired some talented talent to make a good excitement with some interesting twists. The story was original and well written. Forces Booth and Paxton both perform well. The story is told in an interesting way with both flashbacks 20 years back, then patches in the present, alternately back and forth. This style of storytelling allows for a good thriller that can't get boring. Bill Paxton, please make more horror movies, you have the talent for it!
