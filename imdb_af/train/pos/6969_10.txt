First, it's an excellent series, although we have some sort of a James Bond effect. What I mean is that while the new Casino Royale takes place in 2006, it is chronologically the first adventure of 007, dr. No (1962) the second. In Golden Eye, the first film with Pierce Brosnan, Judi Dench is referred to as being the new replacement for the male "M" so, how could she be in place in the beginning before Bond became a double 0, apart of the fact that she is of course 14 years older? It is more or less a "poetic" license for excitement. We need to turn our heads aside when we want to entertain. No, the new Star Trek movie has had none of the original series' primitive electronics nearly half a century ago. In the 1960s, communicators were fantasy. (now we call their phones) and there were sliders instead of buttons. OMG, do you think 400 years from now, would they have perfected Rogaine for Jean-Luc Picard? So, let's give the producers a little leeway. <br /> <br /> But to make things good, just think of the creation of Cylons just 60 years before the end of Battlestar Galactica. If so, where did all the Cylons that populated the original earth come from? We know that technology exists for spontaneous space leaps. Well, what happens if one of the Cyclon in the war with the Caprica fleet is set on fire, or there was a sunspot or whatever and one ship, loaded with human-looking cylinders, wound up to not just by space Don't jump, but over time, back a thousand or ten thousand years with a crippled ship near Earth One. They colonized it, found out that they could repopulate it and eventually destroyed themselves, but not before they even sent out a "ragtag" fleet to seek out the legendary Caprica, just to find a habitable but unpopulated planet they colonized to become human. , who eventually invented the Cylons. Time paradox? Of course. What came first, the chicken or the road? Who cares? It's fraking entertaining!
