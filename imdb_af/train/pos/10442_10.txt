It is truly one of the best movies about love I have ever seen. Carefully followed by no one other than "Before Sunset", which is technically no longer another movie, as it is about the same two people and the same romance. <br /> <br /> It's "love" in the real world. . Okay, it's just like most people are as intelligent and eloquent as the leaders in the movie. When I read the other reviews, it is my pleasure to know how many other people are crazy about dialogue-based movies. And that is what makes "For Sunrise" so good. The dialogue is perfect. It's so real, so engaging and funny. It's not surprising that Jesse and Celine fall in love, 'coz, you fall in love with them at the same time. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is the one in the coffee shop where they pretend to call. their best friends, with the other pretending to be the best friend. It's perfect. Bring back to the moment you fell in love with the first time in your life. <br /> <br /> I have to say that if you have a choice, check out "Before Sunrise" before you look. Before Sunset "If I watched, like you," Sunset "first, it's hard to shake the feeling of pity and sadness for the two young lovers throughout the show. <br /> <br /> Again, the greatest romantic movie in my books, wonderful acting, excellent writing and beautiful places, young love at its best.
