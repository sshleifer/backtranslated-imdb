It is really unfortunate that most people outside Canada think that the only things Canada produces are snow, bergies and hockey players. This film is the second superior Canadian movie I've seen in the past few weeks (the first being "The Red Violin"), much better than anything but the best Hollywood efforts. <br /> <br /> Noble is all but that; He is a middle-aged Parsi bank employee in Mumbai in the 1970s. This film sensitively examines different things that happened to him about his family, his friends, and his work, and its impact on him. At the same time, it's a fascinating, and I would accept, accurate, depiction of the middle class, urban life in India at the time. <br /> <br /> However, I was somewhat prepared for it because I read Rohinton Mistry's book a few years ago. The movie, as can be expected, cannot capture all the complexities of the book, but if you want to read a very good book and see a very good movie, read and see "So Long Travel".
