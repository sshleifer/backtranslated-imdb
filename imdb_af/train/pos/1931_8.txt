A community pool in Connecticut is the setting for this "under the radar" movie that is charming, funny, entertaining and attractive. Although it won prizes in big movie festivals, "The Big Bad Swim" was not released to hordes of theaters in America, but was distributed in DVD form and shown selectively in theaters. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that "The Big Bad Swim" has never had the marketing hype of a Hollywood release, taking into account how many sinkers Hollywood released this year, like "I Know Who Killed Me. " The big bad swim, a really good independent movie, should swim up on its own. <br /> <br /> However, in "The Big Bad Swim", actress Paget Brewster is engaging and credible like Amy, the math teacher who is not only dumped by her husband but also wants to lose her job, and finally play a new game. TV soap actor Jeff Branson - who is HOT - plays Noah, the serious, vulnerable swimming teacher who goes the extra pool length to help his students overcome their fears and discover that he can teach his students. Beautiful, sexy Jess Weixler (I only saw her in a commercial bank?) Play Jordaan Jordaan, the two-job swimmer, one as a pole dancer, the other as a blackjack dealer. Her character provides the catalyst for change among the ensemble, but is the least understandable of the characters, due to a lack of "story" or motivation why she does what she does. Jordan is young enough to stay home with a ubiquitous video camera toting younger brother spying on her. However, her parents are not shown to be involved with her life in any way, which seems strange. There is no drunken mother or abused father here to explain why an ordinary, attractive girl from a Connecticut suburb would choose to be a self-healing pole dancer who defeats herself for mere bachelor parties. <br /> <br /> Despite this doubt, the big bad swim largely succeeds because it's a happy, good movie. <br /> <br /> As one can expect, learn to swim. is the metaphor for life. In the end, it is better to jump in with both feet and go into the swim, rather than sitting on the deck, because life is going to happen to you anyway. <br /> <br /> The Great Bad Swimming is a good date movie, dorm movie, a great "I didn't see" movie, and men liked it as well as women.
