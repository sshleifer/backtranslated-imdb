There are very few movies that are so funny like this. I was fortunate to watch this movie at a theater "reserved" for movie buffs like me, so it was not so embarrassing that I laughed there until my jaw was completely sore and my shirt sleeves were wet to dry my eyes. . <br /> <br /> Sometimes the story was a bit slow, but maybe it's for the best - a little rest between the rolling under the paths (I almost fell out of the seat ...) was a lot welcome.
