It's not a movie for fans of the usual ominous Lynch stuff. On the contrary, it is for those who appreciate a good story or become tired of the turbulent things with overt sentimentalism and Oprah-ish. "It's such a wonderful movie! You have to see it!" - semantics (she's right, for once!). <br /> <br /> The story unfolds flawlessly, and we are taken on a journey that, in my opinion, will recognize most of us at once. A compassionate, existentialist journey where we reimburse our past if we approach our inevitable downfall. <br /> <br /> Acting without errors, cinematography also (sometimes pretty brilliant!), and dialogue just leaves enough for the viewer to understand the details of the story. <br /> <br /> A warm movie. Not excessively sentimental.
