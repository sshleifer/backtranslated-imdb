I only saw it once. It happened in 1952, I was seven, the movie 13. <br /> <br /> We were so young ... But I always thought of the strong moments of Gunga's sacrifice. <br /> <br /> At that time, I realized how much one could hardly submit and used by a foreign nation. Under these historical circumstances, in the film, the personal relationship of friendship, a kind of friendship that ignores him, is the one that arises between people who share everyday life, who see each other's faces, who know each other, but different worlds can only make appear. Then in the most critical moments comes a disturbing question: "Who are we in the first place to be faithful?", What people, family, motherland, the person you know near you? You don't have time to give a perfect answer, urgency is there, and it's for life or death. Gunga-Din answers with the sacrifice of himself. Somewhere, in a confusing way, a problem remains unresolved, the emotion grows with the rhythm of the movie until someone dies, just one life, nothing compared to so many other fictions or realities we can see today, because this death , this unique disappear the life I lived, I shared with my child unconditional friendship. It was lived by the spectator I was. That day I lost Gunga-Din forever. As I left behind, my beautiful childhood, when I walked from then on, had so many worlds in which I lived. I left everything well and these lines are a short visit today that I didn't expect this morning when I got up.
