I actually like this movie, though I don't like James Belushi much. In this movie you can actually see several big names, Linda Hamilton and Courteney Cox; Caine's was already great of course. The plot in this movie is simple; she's just like that sliding door movie. However, it is told in a light way and I like the comedy moments in it. It tried to revive my own important moments in life, for example, if I took that girl out for a movie and not the other one. It tells us that people around us could have different roles in our lives if some minute details were to change. It also reminds us to be careful about what we want. Life is not always as good on the other side as we think; Perhaps, what we have now, is best for us, all that is being considered.
