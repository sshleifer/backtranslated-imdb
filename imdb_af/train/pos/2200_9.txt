The 100 black and white half-hour episodes of the early-stage comedy "Mr. Peepers" were originally broadcast from 1952-55 on NBC. Like many baby boomers, this and "Ding Dong School" are my earliest memories of television. Since both were run later in syndication, it is difficult to tell how many of these memories are actually linked to the original broadcasts. <br /> <br /> "Mr Peepers" is worth looking for more than the nostalgia value. It represents a very different style of situation comedy than shows like "The Honeymooners" and "I Love Lucy". The genre could have gone in two different directions in those days and eventually took the hard scourge of the two shows; This is probably why they still look contemporary. <br /> <br /> By contrast, "Mr. Peepers", distinguished by its intelligent limited tone, can slowly and dull appear. But this is really a matter of adjusting to the different styles. Once you get into the characters, it will win most intelligent viewers. Credit should be given to show producer Fred Coe, an important figure in early television whose dramatic anthologies are also worth watching (Philco Television Playhouse, Lights Out, Playhouse 90, Producers Showcase, Playwrights 56 "," Fireside Theater, etc.) Even on Chinese headline. <br /> <br /> "Mr. Peepers "presented a much more gentle style with Wally Cox (to be the voice of" Underdog "a few years later) in the title role, Robinson Peepers, a moderate high school science teacher. His glasses were his trademark and" a symbolic link to his name and role as a passive observer. <br /> <br /> The series provides Cox with an excellent supporting role, with Tony Randall playing his best best friend, history teacher Harvey Weskit, Jack Warden the Frank Whip, the loud gym teacher, whose soft bully gave most of his conflict elements to the show. <br /> <br /> There is some love interest competition involving the school's nurse, Nancy Remington (Patricia Benoit). viewers who are quickly aligned with Peepers who look a lot better for soft Nancy. Their screen marriage near the end of 1953-54 season has national attention, an early version of "Who Shot JR? Madness. <br /> <br /> Then again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
