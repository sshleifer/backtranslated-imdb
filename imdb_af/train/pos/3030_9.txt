This film has plays that come back to me in the strangest times - that intense scene with Mr. Muckerji what Mrs. Melandez says that someone spoke to witnesses that the girl is being pushed out of the window by a woman who sees her description - one is rolling it - as she calls him in the Greek accent "Mr. Muckerji" - and then Boyer discovering that she had just taken poison and hit her one, she had beaten his head before. she dies --- it's a joy! "Fools - Fools - my whole life" ... etc etc - you get the point. I need to buy this one. I love Dan Seymour's play - he usually plays a plump foreign sultan or police chief and appears in Casablanca and very good photos.
