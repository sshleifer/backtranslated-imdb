This is cult goods. My friends and I come together once a year to enjoy this movie. It is very funny and very dry. I've seen this move dozens of times and haven't enjoyed it yet. The actors are funny and it gets better with every look! If you enjoy "Morons from out of space" you will like it. A great play about the World War. I love the Red-Neck rampage to find the strangers, the bug on the hood, the DOD, the Heat, Populous Annihilator, the Minefield, the Red Camo, the speed limit at 1800Mph! "I'll get the bucket!" Very funny. I would like it to come out on DVD! Forget about the negative reviews, see it for yourself!
