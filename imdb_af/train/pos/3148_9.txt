I love this show. Period. I didn't look very long, probably just about six months or so, actually, but it's now my favorite show and probably it will be quite long. I love all the characters, except I don't really care about Donna. I'm not quite sure why. I just find her funny, and I don't think Laura Prepon is a very good actress. Unlike her, I find the rest of the roll good. Kurtwood Smith and Debra Joe Rupp, who played Eric's parents, were extremely funny. Topher Grace is also a good actor. Unlike many fans, I didn't completely hate the 8th season. I still watch it, and it makes me laugh. But if you compare it to previous seasons, it's not good. Randy is horrible. The final was decent, nothing great, but good. =] I think it would have been better to cancel the show after Ashton and Topher decided to go, but oh well. I have the fourth season on DVD, and one day I hope to be on DVD for eight seasons. Some of his most hilarious episodes were according to my Dine & Dash, Ouma Dead, Red & Stacey and Streaking, but I love every episode I've seen so far, most of them is, I think. =] 9/10 stars, I would definitely recommend it. =]
