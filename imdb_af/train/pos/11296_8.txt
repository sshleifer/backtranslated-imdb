I had a personal interest in this movie. When I was 17 and just outside high school, I got 20th Century Fox as a member of the Laborers and Hod Carriers Union. At the end of my first day (dragging the deck of an air carrier), I brought the next morning with enough clothes, etc. for one or two weeks. When I arrived the next morning, a bus was waiting and about 20 of us headed south for San Diego. Right there we stopped at an army base called Camp Callan or Camp Hahn. Once we were bunked, we went a few miles north in Camp Pendleton, the Great Marine Base. There we started building on the beach which was supposed to be a Japanese Pacific island base. It took us about a week or ten days to complete the installation, which included a water tank, rifles, sand roofs and homes. All this was at a very high wage, sometimes "golden time", which was three times our regular hourly wage. Our food was also the first time = first rib at lunch, etc. - It was great because it was a lot of time to get very good meat at home. <br /> <br /> After finishing the job, I was eagerly waiting for the movie to come out, which was about eight or ten months later. Then I waited eagerly for two hours of the movie before finally making my craft on the screen. Then it was no more than three or four minutes (maybe less) of the movie's heroes who basically burn the base and blow it to smithereens. A little disappointing, but still fun. <br /> <br /> Despite the disappointment, I enjoyed the movie and didn't see it. I later learned that this movie was endorsed by the government and paid Fox on a cost-plus basis, which may be responsible for our excessive salary and lifestyle. Bob Weverka
