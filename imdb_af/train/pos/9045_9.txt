There is a bit of trivia to be pointed out about a scene early in the movie where Homer watched the attempt of December 6, 1957 (at least it was the video used on the TV he watched) that the Vangard attempted lead, which failed. <br /> <br /> Next time he is shown or read a letter to dr. Von Braun condone the failure. <br /> <br /> Von Braun was at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville. for the army. The Vanguard project was with the early Nasa team that has become Goddard Space Flight Center at the moment. <br /> <br /> The army rushed the Jupiter-C, which was essentially a V2 technology, but worked on a satellite in response to Russia's success with Sputnik. <br /> <br /> This mistake was made possible by Homer, due to Von Braun's fame, but his team failed their attempt. In fact, the underlying Redstone left at 52 and was the first American farmer to use Shepard's sub-orbital flight, as well as Grissom's. <br /> <br /> That's why this kind of movie is as good as it will hopefully inspire people to read and mock this little trivia and see what has been done and inspire to do more.
