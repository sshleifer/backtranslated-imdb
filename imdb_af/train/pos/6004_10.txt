The entire 10:15 minute presentation is done in a very non-threatening and non-medical way that even preteen children can easily understand. It spreads many of the myths around menstruation that went on in those days (1946). While sex is not explicitly mentioned, the section is about conception. It is also allegedly the first Hollywood production to ever use the word "vagina" in the dialogue. <br /> <br /> It's fun how the animated character topless is shown in a purely animated character way with no definition of features like the way of the day. Many of the Betty Boop cartoons showed her undies without revealing any definite features. Max Fleischer was a bit of a card and did so with many of the Betty Boop cartoons that required frame-by-frame viewing to find it. <br /> <br /> There is no mention at the beginning or end of the movie. about who the female narrator is. In fact, there are no credits whatsoever other than those mentioned by Kotex and Kimberly-Clark Corporation. <br /> <br /> This title is almost impossible to reach; but for those who are downloading Bittorrent, it can be found there in the ether. This is one of those "watchers" who will be increasingly difficult to find, as older short subjects are obscured.
