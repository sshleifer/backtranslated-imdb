This is what I call a growth crowd. Every character is different and better at the end - and that's all because one woman knows that the place they chose is a "car of love". Josie Lawrence, best known as a comedy, really shines as the woman who brings all these changes. Even the men in this movie go from self-centered to better men. The book was very true to the novel, which is a plus in my book, as I am a librarian. The breathtaking scenery and the message of love are really.
