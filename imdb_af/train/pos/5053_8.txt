Okay, I will admit that the casting in the movie is VERY strange - a part of it is due to the plot, but I still have a little trouble believing that Pierce Brosnan plays this lead (though he really is a done good work). <br /> <br /> It is based on a true story of an Englishman who lived with Canadian Indians in the early 20th century. He claims he is a mixed blood Indian. He was actually so successful and well thought that people came from all over to hear his lectures and take on his wilderness - even though he was not a mixed blood Indian and all his knowledge was of books or forged! The film focuses on this and what happened when the hoax was exposed. <br /> <br /> The acting and settings were wonderful and I loved the movie very much (once I suspended disbelief about Brosnan). It didn't get widespread distribution - probably because it was fairly cerebral - not a Bond movie or a romance - just a very funny film about a remarkable man.
