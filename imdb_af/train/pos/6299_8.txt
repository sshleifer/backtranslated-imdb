There are good ways to make a movie and bad ways, and that's the first. This short caper does nothing more than give it to the audience. It offers a simple story, said very clearly with enough wisecracks to keep you, just getting better and better. Clooney's cameo is funny and very welcome, but the leaders, including Sam Rockwell and Luiz Guzman, can easily make it on their own. Likeable and funny, hilarious so to the end, Welcome to Collinwood is a welcome addition to the heist genre.
