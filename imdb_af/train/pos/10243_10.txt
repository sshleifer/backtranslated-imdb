its great i loved it because i love dinosaurs, they are the biggest animals, but i love the show because it is not copied from another show and it was original. It has a good story and is ideal for small children. that is) i have a few downs too this is not all that big cause of the dinosaurs look a bit mutated so i had to have but a 7 but now a little late for that yay 4 more lines to go it is great for a fantasy show though warning it can spoil a part for you so if you do not want it to be spoiled read on plz near the end is kinda strange reason all they have to do is get dang i forgot what it if so guess it is not a spoiler so late, i loved it and this is my opinion and sorry for any missed spell check if any
