Hood of the Living Dead had a lot to live even before the opening credits started. First, a drama on "... of the living dead" calls on His Holiness, Mr Romero, and instantly sets a high standard that many films cannot afford to pursue. And secondly, my movie-watching companion, doubted that any urban horror movie would surpass the sensory Leprechaun In the Hood. Skeptical, we decided to look. <br /> <br /> We were rewarded with a surprisingly sincere and kind zombie movie. Oh, sure the budget is low, and of course the directors' amateur friends populate the role, but Hood of the Living Dead loves zombie cinema. Cheap? Yes. But when it's cheap, you can clearly see where LOVE holds it together. <br /> <br /> Ricky works in a laboratory during the day and as a surrogate parent to his younger brother at night. He dreams of moving out of Oakland. However, before this planned escape is planned, his brother is shot dead in a row door. Ricky's sharp scientific mind offers an option that is better than CPR or 911: injections of his laboratory's experimental regenerative formula. Unfortunately, a little brother wakes up in an ambulance as a bloodthirsty Oakland zombie! Chaos and chaos! I think it's more economical to eat your enemies than to take revenge in a row, but then I am a poor judge over the complexities of urban life. (How poor a judge? In response to a greedy scene involving four men, I saw "Ah-ha! White t-shirts on everyone, so the blood pops up. Economically! I used the same technique in my own low-budget horror movie. "Jordan replied:" No, it's a gang dress. White t-shirts have been banned from New Orleans for a while. "Oh. <br /> <br /> Lots of the movies are in someone's living room, so there is a lot of hanging and waiting for the zombies. But the characters are sympathetic and the film is sincere - it surpasses its budget in spirit. <br /> <br /> Zombie Explanation: When humans play God, zombies are emerging! Or, maybe: Follow FDA-approved test rules for human experiments! <br /> <br /> Contribution to the zombie cannon: This is the first zombie movie I saw with a row-by-shoot. As far as the real zombies go, infection is usually spread with a bite, but very unusual headaches do not work - these are heartbeats that kill. Zombies have pulses whose absence proves true death. And these zombies make nice cool jaguar-growl sounds. <br /> <br /> Gratuitous zombie movie in-joke: a mercenary named Romero. Sigh. <br /> <br /> Favorite Zombie: Jaguar noise little brother zombie, of course!
