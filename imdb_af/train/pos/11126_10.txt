The Sopranos are probably the biggest show in Dramatic Television history. <br /> <br /> It is hard to think of another series that boasts so much intelligence, sublime writing or first-class performances. <br /> <br /> Over its epic scope it creates fresh and iconic characters and a constant high quality level. Center around the life of one Tony Soprano, a man living in two families. One is the conventional woman and two kids' core family, the other a large New Jersey Mafia group, of which he is the boss. Played by James Gandolfini, of True Romance and the Mexican celebrity, Tony is a fascinating, frightening but also fun man. Full praise should be given to Gandolfini for making a feminine and horribly aggressive brute a truly identifiable and perfect front man. Contemporay American drama has never had such a persistent and iconic figure as Tony. <br /> <br /> The shooting of hundreds never boasts a flat display and such striking characters like Paulie Walnuts and Ralph Cifaretto will keep in your mind forever. <br /> <br /> However, the true genius of this story is the creator and writers of bravery and revolutionary take on a conventional drama series. Twenty minutes of dream sequence, powerful and original use of symbolism and metaphorical images and truly shocking scenes of violence. Yet all this style is met by really touching themes of love, honor and respect for family. The series never gets cold or free. <br /> <br /> With TV now competitive and often poor. The Sopranos are far beyond the rest of America's most original and compelling drama. Forget family verification. This is Television Redesign.
