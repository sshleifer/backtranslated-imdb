Sure, it's a 50's row-in-special, but don't be fooled. In my booklet there are a number of intelligent touches with unexpected pops humor. Catch the redoubtable Mrs Porter, who is supposed to keep an eye on the doctor's place. She not only steals the scene, but darn near the whole movie. And where the indie producers got the money in the movie, a wise decision, as the blob wouldn't look good in the b & w. Yes, the rash is torn around the edges as the number of goofs illustrates. But apart from several teenagers, the non-Hollywood role plays well. In addition, the byplay comes across hot-rodders and cops as lively and entertaining. It's a good thing for some directors to be more at home in a pulpit than on a healthy stage. Apparently, they wanted to portray teenagers in a positive light at a time when the screen was full of "youth criminals". Then again, 27-year-old McQueen qualifies hardly in the age department, but manages the hot-rod attitude anyway. The movie was a hit at the time, no doubt, helped by the catchy title that played a lot of radio. And besides the unfortunate final effects, the movie is still a lot of fun, enticing or no intervention. Meanwhile, on the return of the blob, I now wait for the polar cabin to come in, we will say, fridge water.
