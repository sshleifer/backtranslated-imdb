I loved this movie. You must respect what is similar to small Martians. Sure, the story was sometimes thin, but you can't take away the way it was done. I warned it over and over when I was 8. It's a children's movie, and besides, it has some of the biggest quotes ever. Blanzee's "Home on the Range" edition is wonderful. <br /> <br /> Well done if you ask me, 8 out of 10.
