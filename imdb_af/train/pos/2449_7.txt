when I saw ads for this, I thought, "NO WHAT NICK DOESN'T DO!" because it incorporates "fresh prince" slots. Well, I still love the fresh prince. but george lopez is a surprisingly good show. I love how non-stereotypical Benny is. Carmen is a pretty good character, it's really funny to see how stupid and over-emotional she can sometimes be. I feel bad for the guy who plays maximum, he looks much younger than he really is! but the maximum is a fun character and performed well. And yes, Angie is a bit stereotypical, but she has her funny moments. ha ha george has a big head! No, but he can be really good too. funny show! This should definitely be more frequent than home improvement.
