"Scarface" follows a great cult, even now, 22 years after its release. <br /> <br /> It's also widely criticized as being very sticky, untouched, over-the-top and blown up! These are people who compare Scarface to The Godfather movies. True, on the technical front, (movie, script, direction, etc.) Scarface is over. The Godfather. <br /> <br /> But it is also true that what Scarface has and another gangster movie is missing is the rawness, the sheer rough approach of the gangsters. The Latino gangsters in this movie look much more threatening and truly any of the polished Italian or Irish gangsters of other gangster classics such as 'The Godfather' or 'Goodfellas'. This is one of Scarface's key points of interest and I strongly believe this fact has been written off by most critics as "tackiness"! I saw the original 1932 Scarface, and I have to say that both these movies are too different from each other and should be seen as two different movies instead of the original about "remake"! <br /> <br /> Al Pacino has been criticized for being top of the line in this movie. But how do you think that's exactly the way the movie makers wanted Tony Montana's character! He is this angry young man who makes hasty decisions and throws tantrum every second moment! He's not the calm Michael Corleone here. He is Tony Montana, a very tough, uneducated person who doesn't really think much and still gets angry. <br /> <br /> There is definitely a very 80-year-old feeling for this movie. The soundtrack is all 80's! I love some of the songs, including 'Gina and Elvira's theme', 'Push it to the extreme' and the title track instrumental. <br /> <br /> There are a few memorable and beautifully shot rows, including the famous chain saw scene, the Rebenga hit, the first encounter with Sosa and Tony's visit to his mother. <br /> <br /> About the Performances: All Pacino is brilliant as the fierce Cuban refugee. He reported that he enjoyed Tony Montana the most in his entire career. And he seems to have enjoyed himself thoroughly in all his scenes! One wonders what "Scarface" would be without Pacino. I just couldn't predict anyone else portraying Tony Montana and in all likelihood the movie won't be as effective without him! <br /> <br /> Steven Bauer shines as Tony's friend Manny. <br /> <br /> Robert Loggia is great like Tony's boss, Lopez. Thus, F. Murray Abraham (as Omar) is in a small role. <br /> <br /> There are some sweets in the form of Elvira played by Michelle Pfeiffer. She looks beautiful and is sufficiently in her role. <br /> <br /> The director goes a little overboard during a particular part of the climax. Without revealing anything, I would just say it's the only small part that suffers from improper handling. <br /> <br /> "Scarface" is definitely one of the most entertaining and one of the best gangster movies ever to come out. Enjoy what it is: a raw portrayal of the Drug Lords and their gangland!
