This movie was pretty good. I'm not too big a fan of baseball, but it's a movie made for the meaning of love, determination, heart, etc. Understand. <br /> <br /> Danny Glover, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Brenda Fricker, Christopher Lloyd, Tony Danza and Milton Davis Jr. is introduced with a variety of talented actors and understanding of the sport. The plot was credible, and I love the message. William Dear and the guys made a good movie. <br /> <br /> Most sports films revolve around true stories or events, and they often don't work well. But this movie hits a 10 on the perfect scale, though there and there were some minor flaws. <br /> <br /> 10/10
