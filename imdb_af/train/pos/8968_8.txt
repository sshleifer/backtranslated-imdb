Kim Novak's performance as Gillian, the beautiful witch who wants to be human, is beautiful, her subtle facial expressions, her every move and gesture all create Gillian's unique and somewhat haunting character, she has let us hang on every word. I should not mention the notable performances of Ernie Kovacs and Elsa Lanchester, as the dish obsessed with the author of the world of magic (Kovacs) and the latter as the lovely aunt who can. prohibited. The romantic scenes between Stewart and Novak are beautifully done and the chemistry between them is wonderful, but again when is chemistry between Jimmy Stewart and any leading lady bad!
