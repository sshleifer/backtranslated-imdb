Claire Denis Chocolat is a beautiful but frustrating movie. The film offers a very interesting look at the household of a European colonial family living in Cameroon, giving the viewer an insightful perspective on the lives of many characters and their interaction. However, the development of these characters is often maddeningly inadequate. For example, a central theme in the story is the young France's inability to form strong relationships with others. Although this depiction is performed flawlessly, especially in the way Denis sets the story with scenes from France's return to her orphanage, the girl's intimacy with the other characters of the film makes it difficult for a viewer to gain much interest in her development. invest (or lack thereof) as a protagonist. The general stagnation of the film's character development makes it difficult to get involved in the loose organized plot. The film exerts great tensions between characters, especially between Aimee and the men in her life, but never addresses this social friction and leaves the viewer dissatisfied. The last few scenes are powerful but depressed. Denis's work is definitely interesting from an intellectual and historical point of view, but if you are looking for a movie with adventure or drama, Chocolat is definitely not the best choice.
