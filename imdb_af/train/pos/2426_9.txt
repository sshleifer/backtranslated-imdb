"Once in a lifetime" is a very good movie. However, this is not good for everyone, due to the extensive use of vulgar language and the violence of some of the situations. The film can represent the "life" in the NYC ward where drug problems are important in an anecdotal, credible way. This depiction, in turn, is used as the backdrop for a most thoughtful and exciting drama supported by powerful dialogues (but I have had difficulty understanding some of them because English is not my mother tongue. this OK). There is sometimes a little overplay, but I think it fits in well with the general orientation Fishburne gave to the movie. This gives rise to reflection, rather than just a good exercise, especially in time / action management. The characters, though not simple, are easy to relate and actors do a good job of personalizing them. By the way, I really enjoyed the soundtrack (B. Marsalis). If you are not preaching, you should see the movie once, twice, three times. I evaluated the movie 9/10.
