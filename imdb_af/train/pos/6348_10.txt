Jim Carrey is good as usual, and although there are quite a few Jim Carrey moments, it's definitely not a Jim Carrey movie. <br /> <br /> It's especially aimed at kids, and I've managed to enjoy it as such movie. It was promoted in Israel as another Jim Carrey movie, so those who were expecting a stranger about the top comedy were disappointed. <br /> <br /> The movie has nice moments and works well like a movie for kids. I can't say I loved this movie, but then I'm not his target audience!
