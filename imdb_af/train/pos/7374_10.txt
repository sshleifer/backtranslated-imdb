For his first debut, this film has a few sounding and cold moments. In the best horror movie fashion, the pit of your stomach gets caught every moment during this movie. The end is wonderful. The makers of Blaire Witch obviously looked at this movie that ended it. It was not an end, but a beginning of the end. A good movie and just a piece of Japan's great as far as scare factor a perfect score it makes you think and frighten out of your mind.
