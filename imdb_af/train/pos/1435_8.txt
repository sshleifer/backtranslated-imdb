I appreciate movies like this: smart and well-crafted, entertaining, absorbent, benevolent and well-directed. Nobody - even Pacino - chews the scenery *, trying to stick out; One of the movie's most effective moments (Aielo pulls over at his beloved exit) is precisely because of his self-control. It's not as good as, says QUIZ SHOW, CITY HALL is of a similar cloth: the mind as well as the eye, ear and heart. Why such benevolent entertainment flops at the box office is anyone's guess. <br /> <br /> * You know Pacino chews it in one particular scene, but exactly because it's needed. Great scene too.
