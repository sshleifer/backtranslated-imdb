I saw the movie "On Thin Ice" on television in India. I have to say the movie was really well done, and I really sent a chill down my spine. The basic story reminds me that certain addicts decide to move over where others are still addicted ... <br /> <br /> But I felt Diane Keaton was at her best ... the scene she wanted, and started her home for cocaine ... was the best ... the two boys are good, and Lynda Boyd also showed what a good actress she is. The writing is well done, such as cinematography and direction .. and casting <br /> <br /> A must have movie ..... watching everyone
