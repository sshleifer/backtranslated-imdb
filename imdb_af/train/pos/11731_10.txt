I think this movie is fun and horror. I love Elvira and I love this movie. It is a pity that the second part of this wonderful movie has not been successful, as it is very funny like a first part. I also regret having seen other films next to Cassandra Peterson. I think she is a wonderful actress with great potential. I hope I will see her in the third part of Elvira's adventures in the future. Cassandra Peterson is one of my favorite comedy actresses. Cassandra, if you read it, know you're the best and my heart will be with you. You can rely on me. What else can I add? It's a cool and classic movie!
