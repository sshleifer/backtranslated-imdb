I really enjoyed this movie. The actions of the adult actors were wonderful, although I found the main child a bit stiff. But he behaved himself very well because he was a new talent. The humor is very sublime and not in your face like most Hollywood comedies. That is, The Nutty Professor. If you have a short attention span and are accustomed to the typical Hollywood stuff, you probably won't like it because it's a bit slower. I chose it on Blu-ray and I have to say the picture quality is above all. Probably one of the better-looking Blu-rays I've seen so far. The extras were also cool. They have removed quite a bit, but it's probably a good thing, as most of the extracted scenes didn't really add anything.
