A strong pilot, this two-hour episode, offers an excellent job of compiling the characters and background for "Enterprise", the "prequel" for the original Star Trek series. It stumbles a few times in the "Trek" convention and clich√© - candy-colored space sharpeners never look out of style, and I can already predict sobering references to T'pol as "Seven of Vulcan" - but the ensemble looks strong, the characters are well drawn, and one can even see tips that this crew should be more inventive in different ways than those of earlier (later) series. Scott Bakula strikes the right note as a captain with Kirk's brashness and vigilance but without his smugness and swagger, and I look forward to the ways in which the series will include the engineer, gunsmith and communications officer (not just a glorified mobile operator! ) as supporting players. The authors seem to pick up on the one big mistake made in Star Trek: The Next Generation, Deep Space 9 and Voyager. Instead of starting with a large ensemble delivery and writing short characters, it starts with a smaller core of characters, which can add a bit more variety later - which I hope for, after about half a dozen episodes will variety needed.
