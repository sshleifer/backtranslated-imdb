If you delete the first twenty minutes of this movie, you'll be left with a fantastic comedy. As it is, I still found it to be a pretty good movie, not a little thing, considering the coma I put in the opening styles. To put it mildly, this film has an urgent start that wasn't even a bit funny or even optimistic. However, once things get worse, you are left with a comedy that stops well for more than three decades. Definitely worth checking out, especially if you're a younger fan of Lemmon and Matthau who wants to see their previous work.
