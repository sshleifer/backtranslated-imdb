I really liked this movie and went back to seeing it twice in two weeks. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Detmer nailed the show - she was like a hungry cat on the prowl, with her prey rope. She swallows in anger and lust, takes a "too young" lover and scratches hundreds of her terror's fianc√©'s mother's fine china pieces on the floor. <br /> <br /> The movie was full of beautiful touch. The Maserati, the wonderful wardrobe, the flower boxes along the roofs. I especially enjoyed the ancient Greek class and the recitation of 'Antigone'. <br /> <br /> It had a 'story of O' - that's where people get rid of the means of uncontrolled sexual adventure. As she walks around the fantastic apartment in the dull, she is comfortable - and why not, what is a devil in the flesh? "<br /> <br /> The whole movie is a real surprise!
