"Going Berserk" is actually one of the funniest Candy movies I've ever seen. Sure, it's a low budget, but it's a non-stop comic tour the power. There are many memorable quotes. For example, when his golden father-in-law asks him how much he earns, Candy says, "Oh, I'm not going anywhere between thirty and ... eleven thousand dollars a year, sir." Oh of course, it's Candy's delivery that sells it. Just classic stuff. Eugene Levy also turns into a hilarious performance as a messy movie maker. A stone from his terrible low-budget movie "Kung Fu U" will make you roll. <br /> <br /> So if you're a Candy fan and want to rediscover a forgotten gem, I can't recommend this movie enough.
