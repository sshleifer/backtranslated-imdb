I had no expectations; I've never heard of Jamie Foxx; All I knew was that the film had some strong character features in it. I thought it was very entertaining; it was fun. The plot was different and unpredictable enough to keep my interest. For me, Foxx is an original. David Morse is great (which is not his best role). I thought the cheeses and fireworks contributed to the movie and were well done. I didn't expect much and I was happily surprised.
