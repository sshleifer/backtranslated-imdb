I waited until July 4 to write it because. . . well. . . because it just feels right to do this on this day. <br /> <br /> In 1924, D.W. Griffith needed a hit, he didn't have a big one since ORPHANS OF THE STORM (1921). He has worked hard ever since, but his films were smaller in size and could not match the audience. He planned a movie about Patrick Henry when contacted by members of the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) who asked if he would expand his ideas to include more of the American Revolution. This movie is the result. By the time he was finished, he had a 14-line history lesson and there was no trace of Patrick Henry. <br /> <br /> We all know the story of the Revolutionary War, but Griffith has a love story with Patriot farmer Nathan (Neil Hamilton) in love with Tory aristocrat Nancy Montague (Carol Dempster, a leading wife for Griffith for many years). Complicating matters is the fact that Nancy hates father Nathan. . . Well, not just Nathan, he hates all rebels. It doesn't matter when a skirmish on the streets of Lexington emits someone. Nathan's arm allows him to defuse his gun and accidentally seize Nancy's father. <br /> <br /> Parallel to the love story is the (mostly truth, but partially decorated) story of Capt. Walter Butler (Lionel Barrymore) an apostate British official who feels he was not married to anyone. With thousands of Indians forming the Six Nations on his side, he hopes to crush the colonies and become monarch of his own. <br /> <br /> Equations with BIRTH OF A NATION (1915) are inevitable. The Montague family can only be the Cameron's of the previous movie, while Nathan can be part of the Stoneman family. The sequence of the Battle of Bunker Hill is very similar to a scene in BIRTH OF A NATION with the attacking army, in this case the Redcoats, who storm a ditch with Patriots. The only thing missing is that Henry Walthall is loading No Man's Land to tie a flag into the object of a cannon. Surprisingly, the struggle in America seems to lack the energy of battle scenes in BIRTH and fail to sign the audience. Something is clearly lacking. It's not scope, G.W. Billy Bitzer's camera work is pretty good. Maybe that's missing. . . dare I say so. . . truth? <br /> <br /> The brutality of Capt. Butler and his men are well underlined, though much of it happens in long shot or offscreen. Don't expect heads in the close-up as we saw in INTOLERANCE (1916). In one spot Butler's second in command, Hare (Louis Wolhiem) sneaks the eyes of a prisoner colonist. We only see the beginning of the action, for the rest the camera focuses on Hare's face, as it is of course a good time to do so. Lionel has been with Griffith since 1912. A story went that he was Griffith for work and D.W. approached the reputation of his famous family. to which Lionel replied: "And I am nothing of the kind, sir!" He makes a very good and fairly credible villain. Louis Wolhiem appeared three times with Lionel's older brother John; in SHERLOCK HOLMES and DR. REFRESH AN MR. HYDE (both 1920) and later in THE TEMPEST (1927). As Capt. Her hair notices his wild-staring eyes and hidden hair not only as a villain, but makes you think he is also very angry. <br /> <br /> Later, Neil Hamilton noted that America was his first horse and "I was afraid of death." He hides his displeasure very well and we can believe he was the riders when the shooting passed was. Mr. Griffith fell in love with Carol Dempster and asked her to marry him at one stage. She refused and soon left his stock company, after which her star status gradually declined. <br /> <br /> In the portrayal of Paul Revere's ride, talk of horses, an accidental amusing moment, was spoken. He drives his horse upright on the foyer of a family to announce "To arms! The Regulars come!" but if he tries to leave, the horse cannot negotiate the stairs back and stumble his rider on the ground! I'm surprised Griffith didn't do another job. <br /> <br /> So is America a classic? YES! Don't wait for July 4 to see it, it's always nice.
