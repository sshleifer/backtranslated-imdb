For me, this Christmas special is one that I remember very well. In 1989, I found the 2 CDs I found from the soundtrack recording, gave one to my sister and kept the others for myself. It's now part of my family's Christmas tradition, and I'd love to see the show again, rather than just remembering it as I listen. <br /> <br /> It was noted elsewhere that John Denver made a number of performances at the Muppet Show, and they did more than one special together. The good report between Denver and his fuzzy companions is clear here, in a beautiful and fun show that is good for all ages.
