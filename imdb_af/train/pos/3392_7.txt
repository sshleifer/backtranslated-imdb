It was a very moving film, especially for 1973. At that time it was a huge success in the box office. After the 1970s it seemed to be forgotten, but its central messages were too important to disappear altogether. It was actually at least fifteen years before his time. No one ever heard of the 'greenhouse effect' before 1985 and the controversial subject of euthanasia was rarely educated. <br /> <br /> The sets and special effects may look a bit outdated, but big money for sci-fi was a gambling in that period. If you look now, you'll see what usually makes sense. It's a messaging movie, not for dying fans who can't stimulate a minute of thought unless it contains a million dollars of explosions. <br /> <br /> It was also Horses' last good movie, the end of his famous Dystopic scientific trilogy. After that it was all the remaining disasters and great budgetary affairs that were enjoyable. It may not be the most entertaining two-hour movie ever made, and the end may be creepy and depressed, but finding a movie such as this is difficult for any film producer.
