A meteorite falls into the land of a small town and brings a jelly creature. An old farmer is attacked by the stranger in his hand, and youngsters Steve Andrews (Steve McQueen) and his girlfriend Jane Martin (Aneta Corsaut) take him to Dr. T. Hallen (Steven Chase). The local doctor treats the blister carefully, and asks Steve to investigate the place where they found the old man. When Steve returns, he sees the doctor killed. Steve and Jane are trying to warn the police and the residents, but no one believes in them, while the blob relieves many, bigger and bigger people. <br /> <br /> "The Blob" is a cult and classical science. It's a low budget movie, with lots of ham actors and actresses (with the exception of Steve McQueen), horrible effects, but also lovely and very, but very funny. This is the first time I have seen this classic (I saw the 1988 remake with Kevin Dillon), and I really recommend it to the fans of Steve McQueen and sci-fi B movies of the 50s. review number 1,400 could not be better. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Bolha" ("The Blob")
