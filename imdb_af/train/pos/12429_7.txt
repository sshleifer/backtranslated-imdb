David Duchovny starred in this film. Now many people find that fact, it won't even bother. Very unfair to say the least. David made his name on the x-files and is a decent actor. Dr Eugene Sands (Duchovny) is a drug addict doctor. He becomes a private doctor for criminal millionaire Raymond Blossom. But the FBI is interested in using Eugene to iron Blossom. Angelina Jolie is thrown into the supporting role of Clare the gangsters moll.She puts in a good performance. Timothy Hutton plays Blossom is wonderful and immerses him deeply in his character. Duchovny himself is not as bad as many people would think and eventually I will judge his performance with credibility. His familiar monotonous tone and straight face are present, but do not break too much of the film.
