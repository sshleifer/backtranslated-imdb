I didn't know when I heard it. I thought Disney was dumb. I was wrong. I found it to be very good. I mean it's not The Lion King, but it's cool to look from some point to another. It was very funny. It wasn't one of those horns that sucked the animation, it was just like The Lion King animation. The only thing that provoked me was the whole movie thing by the movie. To give nothing, but you will know what I'm talking about. I also enjoy having the most of the original movie to return to. It was a very good movie about everyone.
