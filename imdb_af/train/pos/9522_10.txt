This is the first Tom Hanks movie I have had the privilege of seeing in the theater, though he is my favorite. When I heard he was going to play a hit, I was a bit stupid, "can Mr Hanks pull this one off?" And he did a great deal. This 1930's depression era film is about loyalty, salvation, and a path you don't want your children to stumble upon. Tom Hanks is starring Michael Sullivan. To be the family man and the secret life of the contract killer for Oscar nominee Paul Newman. This movie, Tom Hanks, is more about reaction and rather than dialogue. He delivered a knockout show. <br /> <br /> On one night of one of his work, Michael's son Michael Jr., newcomer Tyler Hoechlin, witnesses of the hit. And Michael Sr. crime partner, co-stage actor Daniel Craig, can't get that information out. So he throws the son and wife of Michael Sr. from, except Michael Jr. So, the two go to Chicago to get Conner Rooney (son of Paul Newman's Rooney). <br /> <br /> The drama and intense plot really thickens them as a dad trying to fix things, even though the boy is together for the ride. While on this lethal journey, someone hired Michael Sr for a hit. The killer would be the photographer of the late Harlen Maguire, played by a spot-bound Jude Law. <br /> <br /> The movie will make you feel the old days. And with Thomas Newman's beautiful and haunting Oscar nominated score to go with, you can't appreciate this film by Oscar director Sam Mendes. So sit back and enjoy the game drive.
