Well, after a while I used to read comments on these movies that did not reflect my experience at all. For me, Amitabh was a better villain here than in some of his best-known films. He was a die-hard villain, an unlucky villain. To me it was a fresh air to see him in a role where his villain was not interrupted in any way. <br /> <br /> The child who played Aryan was probably over his head with this role. There I think maybe the director could do better. But honestly, the very best part of this movie was Shernaz Patel. She is an unsung heroine, a true veteran man who is overwhelmed by every role she is offered. But I have to say that I greatly appreciated her contribution as she played Virendra Sahi's wife. She may be given little, but she does everything with total conviction. I'm sure she heard right over the head of the audience. <br /> <br /> So if you're in the habit of settling for the Bollywood average, you won't get much of this movie. But if you are constantly looking for something more, then it may have given you some of what you lack.
