The film is on the side of the side, Eddie just seems to bring that uniqueness to the stage and makes the most basic thing funny to have an ice cream as a kid for the long-standing tradition of the family. The movie is scarce in this country, but uncertainty about availability in other countries, I have searched many sites and still has no luck, call rare video companies and there are annual waiting lists. SO HINTS IS VERY WELCOME. If anyone likes Eddie Murphy as a comedian, and watch the video get it, it's worth the money and can't go far wrong.
