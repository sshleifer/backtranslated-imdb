The Stock Market Crash of 1929 and the Depression that almost destroyed the American Musical Theater were actually the final killings for vaudeville. Those behind the curtains were beaten as badly as those before. <br /> <br /> In an effort to stimulate the show economy and its own personal economy, working theater director James Cagney emerges with a brilliant idea. Stage is living relevant prologues in the movies shown at the various movie theaters that come out of the old theaters overnight. Some other competitors get the wind and the competition is on. <br /> <br /> Footlight Parade is my favorite Busby Berkeley movie. This gives James Cagney a chance to show off his versatility as a dancer as well as a hard man. In his retirement, Cagney said that while watching his few and far between musical lots, he could hardly be bothered with some of his straight dramatic films. He wanted him to do some more music in his career and I wish he had. <br /> <br /> Of course, the logic and reason of the action of this Busby Berkeley is extravagance on the stage of a movie. But it's so creative and fun to watch. <br /> <br /> Dick Powell gets three songs in Footlight Parade, Ah the Moon is here, Honeymoon Hotel, and At a Waterfall, the last two with Ruby Keeler further cementing the screenplay. Ruby sings and dance with Powell in the last two and she is with James Cagney in my favorite song of Footlight Parade, Shanghai Lil. <br /> <br /> Joan Blondell is Cagney's no-nonsense girl at the theater on Friday. As in Blonde Crazy, she's the one with the right brain in the duo and it's her quick thinking that has helped him out of some household problems he has on top of his theater. One of Blondell's best screen roles. <br /> <br /> Look for Dorothy Lamour and Ann Sothern in the choir as on both IMDb pages. John Garfield is briefly seen in the Shanghai Lil number. And in a scene at the start of the film, producer Guy Kibbee takes Cagney to a movie theater where they show a B-western John Wayne. The duke's voice is unmistakable. But what's even more unusual is that the short clip shows him in a scene with Frank McHugh playing another Cagney assistant in Footlight Parade. I think the Warner brothers played a little joke there. I have to believe the clip was deliberate. <br /> <br /> Footlight Parade is Busby Berkeley at its surreal best.
