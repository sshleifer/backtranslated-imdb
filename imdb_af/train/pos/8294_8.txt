This movie has great battle scenes. Now it's true that the acting is a bit rough. But if I wanted to see a movie based on acting skills, I'd see a Cheesy movie Like American Beauty. But if you want to see a movie with real martial arts in it and with Amazing Stunts WITHOUT the use of wires and flies, the air has fluttered so many movies that now kill the matrix. Then look at it. Now that's where the two main stars in the show where the kid shows the power rangers and another role player of the show share a bit in this movie. But hey the battle scenes are enough to make Jet Li p ** s his pants. And the stunts are worthy enough for Jackie Chan to throw and admire.
