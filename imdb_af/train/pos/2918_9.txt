... I saw it on cable back in the late 1980s, since I was a great wrestler since 1986. I saw it on VHS in a 'buy' bin and bought it. <br /> <br /> In 1998, I started practicing Air Force as a wrestler and will always go back to see it seeing how it is a very accurate depiction of people involved in wrestling (families and friends we would not understand, the journey, the sadness, etc.). Henry Winkler is funny and sometimes sad to watch, because no one else can understand what a genius he is creative about. A good way to separate himself The Fonz character he played on Happy Days. Also look at the cast ... William Daniels (Knight Rider), Polly Holiday (Alice), and wrestlers Roddy Piper and Chavo Guerrero Sr. If you get a chance, watch it.
