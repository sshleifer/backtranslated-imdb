This movie is actually relevant even today to the threat of bio-terrorism, and the threats of superbugs, West Nile Virus and SARS. As voltage, the voltage is quite intense. Richard Widmark and Paul Douglas are more than serviceable in their roles. The local plays between Widmark and his wife offer a great interlude to the main character. The actor in this movie who left most of his brand is Jack Palance. Its sharply defined features and seemingly mitigating exterior always disappear the harmful and cruel man beneath the surface. The chasing scene by the packing food is still impressive today. Recommended, 7/10.
