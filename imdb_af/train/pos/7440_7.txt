Just watched the movie, and the frightening thing, the people talking during the movie just sounded like the actors. The movie had its moments, but also slept and was rather sick. It was all meant to be a farce, but once you see the pathetic lives of the people in the movie, you think of yourself: "People like this are all around us." All attempts to get the audience's sympathy are being pushed as the actors do one stupid thing to the other. On the positive side, there are some big (and funny) insults. I think I'll wait for video but it was a good laugh. WARNING Jerry takes off his shirt during the movie !! (not a pretty face!)
