The film is not visually stunning in the conventional sense. It does not offer a series of nice photos. Instead, it's a visually interesting movie. It forces the viewer to constantly process or imagine the context of the different shots. This kind of thing is easy to try, but difficult to pass. The movie refuses to use the crutch of a genre to help get the less-than-fully engaged viewer going. Instead, the movie touches and moves through a number of different genres. The trick to love the movie is to enjoy this playfulness. I suspect 99% of North American viewers won't. If you try to capture the narrative of this movie, or the philosophical message, or the symbolic structure, etc., you will waste your time. There is none of these. The movie only shows up on these genres and others. The only unifying power in the film is Claire Denis' own sense of what fits together. There are so few feature-length films that come close to satisfying Kant's description of what art is, namely the enjoyment of the power of judgment itself, rather than simply undermining concepts under concepts. Film usually takes the easy way out and chooses the simpler enjoyment to understand what's going on. Most film is not art. Most film does not come close to art. When a movie does, like this one, and is still enjoyable by a wide variety of viewers, it is something of a miracle. My negative comment is that sometimes I buy the movie too simplistically in the various narrative threads that go through it. The Tahiti's father's son's story, though not exactly conventional, ends up making things easy and easy. It dominates too much.
