I'm not a big fan of most anime, but Gundam Wing is really something else. Gundam wing lacks all the stereotypical melodramas you might think of if you think of anime, as the number of jokes made over 17 hours will only be in double digits, Gundam Wing gets straight to the business. <br /> <br /> Gundam Wing is as much of a political thriller as it is an action series. Large parts focus on the diplomatic handling of war, not just the fighting. Although the combat animation lacks extraordinary detail in cases where it would only be a pain to animate, individual twins between gundams are almost artworks in light of the animated use of complex mechanics and rapid movements. <br /> <br /> To my knowledge, this 49 episode plus one movie series was recorded in 2000 by the cartoon network, and then professionally purchased by them. the dubbing is simply flawless. Not only does every word say, but the voice uses make the characters much more credible. many believe it is best to watch anime with subs in English, but I just don't have the determination to do so. <br /> <br /> Not only are the voices good, but the score on the series is very impressive. I'll just say it left me to sand the net to find a soundtrack. <br /> <br /> The plot of this series is what really hookers will have, and no, you don't hook like a leading time drama like Lost just made to hook you. To explain the plot deeply, many spoilers will result, as many of the characters do not even have a few episodes in the series. The rough idea of ​​the series is that earth and its now independent space colonies have trouble preserving peace. Such a war has begun, leading to military coups and extensive diplomatic situations. I feel that any detail will give more information that is essential to the plot. <br /> <br /> I'll finish here and say this series is great for anyone who loves anime. Anyone who thinks ALL anime is stupid (they have good reason to think so), and anyone who wants an anime with a serious tone.
