It's probably the best documentary I've seen in a very long time. Jonny Kennedy was and still is a tragically beautiful inspiration. Not only was he a survivor of one of the painful diseases out there, but he used his beauty to show the world that life is after death and never give up to reach people and spread his love. Looking at minutes of his lifelong struggle was heartbreaking. Listen to his clever donkey remarks and see his worshiping gestures were heartwarming. And when he saw him, smiling was indescribable. I feel blessed to be touched by this little giant. Please, if you ever have a chance to watch this movie, consider yourself happy to meet Jonny Kennedy.
