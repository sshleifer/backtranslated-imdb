You can debate Prince's acting talent, or even his choice to parody his own life in this movie. There is no debate about his musical talent either. He looks twenty years later as a shadow, but the music remains relevant and fantastic. <br /> <br /> After helping the hype of this movie (graduate high school in '85), I can tell you that there was nothing left when the time came. Van Tipper Gore (Al's wife) tries to censor "Little Nikki" and every other thing under the sun via the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC) to every "Air Band" that was then Prince, and that was the absolute hottest thing out. For a few weeks, Prince was more than Madonna and Michael Jackson. <br /> <br /> We all waited for the movie and were so excited when it was premiered. It did not disappoint. Everyone was trapped. At the time I was an MTV junkie (they actually played music all the time). Prince played at least once or twice an hour. I must qualify this comment by saying that at that time my favorites were Billy Idol, Oingo Boingo, The Fixx, Herd Seagulls and others in the Punk / New Wave genre. The music of Prince at that time crossed all kinds and styles. . One of the reasons some of it looks so cute and turbulent is that it was SOOOOOOOO. All the things that remind you of the 80's were then iconic. It was mainstream and it now looks like a clich√©. It has become so popular that it has become ridiculous. It's like the rappin 'Grandma commercial for Wendy's Hamburgers. <br /> <br /> It looks dumb now that Everyone is trapped in it (unfortunately, like a bizarre press or something. Anyway, I hope it has given you some insight.
