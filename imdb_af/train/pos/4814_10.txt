I saw it on the big screen and encapsulated it. The period of Queen Victoria's younger years is a mystery and it is a perfect description of how a young girl was cast into one of the highest roles in the world. <br /> <br /> The writing is perfect, the play is incredible, history and attention to detail are beyond this world. Emily Blunt is perfect as Victoria. Funny how her mother is played by Elizabeth, the 1st and William IV is played by Prince Albert! (Think Blackadder). <br /> <br /> This show from Victoria shows that she was once a rebellious young woman. I'm sure she would have been on the Jeremey Kyle Show if it were: "My mom and her boyfriend are trying to steal my life." <br /> <br /> A perfect piece of much of British and Commonwealth history.
