Old movie buffs will know why I will call this one 'The Man in the Gray Flannel Robe'. Most Bible-based movies are basically shocking. What smiles and giggles smiles here is how Peck is trying to raise awareness of a variety of psychological and social problems with the spear carrying Neanderthals over him. As a Great Romance, it falls flat as unleavened bread. But there is something gripping about this movie. Of all the great Hollywood Bible pictures, it gives the most striking the ambivalent attitude of the average American versus faith in the biblical God. Billy Sunday's dissertation makes it clear with H.L Mencken's antithesis all in writing. Whoever gets the best in Heavenly Choir-backed synthesis depends on your point of view. In addition, D&B boasts good performances by Peck (especially in the last conversion scene) and by Jayne Meadows as his very first wife Michol, lively, moody atmosphere (good idea to put the most action in the morning or night) the exciting version of the Twelfth Third Psalm at the end.
