I saw this mini-series on British television a number of years ago and was instantly captivated by the story. It rather surprised me because I am not a big fan of 'Jane Eyre' or 'Wuthering Heights'; I consider the heroine of the former to be a self-righteous worship, and the latter work as a remaining step. <br /> <br /> "The Tenant of Wildfell Hall", like the mentioned works, is also somewhat depressed in parts. The darker parts of the film were, however, offset by the excitement of Helen's escape, the breathtaking wild and beautiful landscape of Yorkshire, and the sexual magnetism of Toby Stephens. <br /> <br /> This movie successfully illustrates the frustratingly limiting lifestyle. of all women of the time. At best, they suffered from a form of minor domestic tyranny, as portrayed by the treatment of women in the Markham household. On the other side of the scale, there are the unfortunate Helen who is married to a rich man of high estate, but is exposed to cruelty and humiliation with long periods of neglect. She walks away and experiences a short moment of freedom, but as a mysterious woman in a rural community, she inevitably becomes the subject of careless gossip and speculation. <br /> <br /> Tara Fitzgerald is excellent as the long-suffering Helen Markham. Not only unbelievably beautiful (despite the terribly budding hairstyle) with the most wonderful cheekbone, she is more than able to play the central role in the film. Tara is worthy and separate while showing that Helen is still dangerously vulnerable. Rupert Graves IS the depraved but curiously attractive Arthur Huntingdon - after I saw him, I could never imagine another actor playing that part. Pam Ferris deserves special mention for her role as Gilbert's indulgent mother, just like the actress who played his sister Rose, and Simon Carter, who is the uncharitable killer for the Good Things in Life. Lastly, I could see this movie alone for Toby Stephens. He is so cool, rough, sexy, sensitive (but not in a more sedentary way). I'm not even sure if he's a good actor, because my hormones prevent me from judging him objectively! <br /> <br /> If there is a mistake with the movie, it is the use of flashbacks that I both interfere with the flow of the story and make it slightly confusing. Other people who watched this movie also have problems with this, and I found that I had to explain to them that some scenes were actually retrospective. <br /> <br /> I am very grateful to the responsible people. for making this movie. Not only did I put the video (a scarce look), but it led me to buy Anne Bronte's brilliant novel. Of course, it was better than the movie, but with a narrow margin. I recommend that anyone interested should watch the movie and then read the book in that order. <br /> <br />
