I enjoyed this movie. Unlike some of the pumped-up, steroidal waste that is acted upon as action flicks, Playing God is simple and realistic, with characters that are credible, action that is not over and turned enough and turns around and turns you to the end of interest. to keep. . <br /> <br /> Well directed, well maintained and good story.
