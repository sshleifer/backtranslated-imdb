This made us have a few episodes to enter "Dark Angel" as a story and a series, as we transferred from the Sopranos, a completely different mentality framework. But when we got the series, we were very addicted. It is a pity that the series ended just as it just started to overtake in the excellent category: Dark Angelwas much more than your average TV series. It kicks ass and rocks as far as action goes, but the interactions of the characters and societal reactions to "mutants" remind us of the constant bias we face each day. That the story is set in the future keeps the taste surrealistic and prevents the anti-discrimination message from being thrown away in our faces (so do not ruin the "fun" for those who do not like being presented during entertainment ), but every event and human / community interaction remains relevant to the present. We all make judgments, face our own prejudices, but in the end, the question about you lies, you lie: Put your back on it, matter about it, or stand up and do something about it? For those who have no choice but to fight, for survival or justice, this series empowers them. For those who have never had to face the question, this message is entertained under the guise of pure action. It is much more well made and well written than most TV shows; I'm very disappointed, it ended before it really kicked in high gear.
