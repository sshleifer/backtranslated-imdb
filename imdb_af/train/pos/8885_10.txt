Sometimes you have to look back to move forward. The 60's did the same. We must remember the past. The past is part of the future. <br /> <br /> Big mix Gary J. Coppola. I see a good future. You deserve to be nominated and win, the 60's best mixer of the year. <br /> <br /> Best ever mini series. <br /> <br /> Thanks Ursula <br /> <br />
