My sister and I use it to rent it every time we get movies and our parents will be so angry (but they'll leave us anyway) and I love it. I can't find anyone living near me who knows what I'm talking about ... I'm happy to see that I'm not the only one who loved this movie. I wish I could find it on DVD somewhere !! I'd love to see it, just bc. I love it as a little child ... and I'm 15 now! I remember so much about it ... that's where I got the bunny fufu song and all my friends know the song but not the movie !! I think the little girl came there by moving the slide on her playground
