I watched it as an impulse when I was browsing the movie store and couldn't be more pleasantly surprised! My mom and I watched this movie and we thoroughly enjoyed it. It is not the typical "chick-flick" with a juicy love story and tears all over, but it definitely becomes a nerve in the end. This is an end where, though unexpectedly and tragically, the overall effect of the film is not compromised. I think Reese Witherspoon was a great actress, even in this movie, her debut, and it's definitely worth watching! I didn't recognize many supporting actors, but they all play their key supporting roles well. The man in the moon is such a credible story about a young teen who fell in love for the first time. Most women can certainly relate to everything - from Witherspoon's words, to her subtle tins, and to her not so subtle emotions (like the typical teenage girl). While confusing a character with love, she does not become so stupid and immature, much appreciated by many movies today.
