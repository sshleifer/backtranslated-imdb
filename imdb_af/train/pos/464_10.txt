I fell in love with Emily Watson in Breaking the Waves and then even more fascinated by her series and skill in Hilary and Jackie. Now comes this impressive portrayal of a rich girl who condemns breeding and convention in favor of the torture of the child's tortured soul of a man who clearly needs motherhood. Her eyes are the mirror for his soul - and what soft and beautiful eyes are they. <br /> <br /> Those who take literally things will find Marleen Gorris's poetic and allegorical direction very frustrating. Romanticism that is willing to deal with the wonderful kinetic energy, this filmed allegorical poem will be well rewarded.
