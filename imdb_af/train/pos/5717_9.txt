Omigosh, it's seriously the scariest movie I've ever seen. To say I love horror movies will be an understatement, and I have seen heaps (given the limited availability in New Zealand, it's quite a lot), but never had to sleep lightly until I seen The resentment. <br /> <br /> Some people may say it's a rip of The Ring (both based on Japanese horror movies), both similar (but different) story lines, but the grudge is its own as a scary movie I even screamed the cinema into the movie at some point. <br /> <br /> The play is wonderful, especially the supporting characters. KaDee Strickland is fantastic and steals the show, she is such an enthusiastic person. Jason Behr is a real hottie, and William Mapother looks like he's having fun. Although I'm usually a fan of Clea DuVall's, it doesn't really look like this movie. Some of the supporting characters probably found her in the depth and back story, but she didn't seem to be all there. Like Sarah Michelle Gellar, well, she's about the same through all her films and roles she's not? The ghost was really scary, the music and sound effects were chilling (especially the noise made when KaDee Strickland's character answered the phone in her apartment), the end was also cool. Highly recommended. 9/10
