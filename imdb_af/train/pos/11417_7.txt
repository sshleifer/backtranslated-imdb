This film struck me as a project that had many of the right ingredients, but somewhere along the road that they didn't quite meet. I don't know who made it, but it has a slight Disney feel. Although parts of it are unlikely (such as when a pre-teenager runs for a public office) and prevents the story from being taken seriously, there is a healthy dose normal (whatever) to keep things balanced and in perspective . The acting is good. Strangely, the relationship between Frankie and her grandmother is convincing, but the relationship between Hazel and Frankie is a bit ... off. It's interesting to see how she has to work hard to keep a balance between her best friend, her grandmother and her two passions: ballet and baseball. If I was a baseball player myself, it was very painful to watch Frankie try to keep her own on a team of boys, but it is a good job to show the fight she is facing. I read somewhere that she is not actually ballerina, but the editing in this film has done a good job not only to make her dance look natural but beautiful. Overall, this was a good film about honesty and ambition, but his star Mischa Barton did not have the level of realism we saw during her performances in Lawn Dogs, Lost and Delirious and the small but shocking performance against Haley Joel Osment in "The 6th Sense. "
