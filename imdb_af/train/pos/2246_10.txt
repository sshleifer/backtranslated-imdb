A wonderful surprise from the Spanish theater. I never thought Jordi Molla could be such a good director. I really don't care much about his choice in movies. However, this movie was absolutely fantastic and not at all predictable ... something I always enjoy! It didn't enjoy very good pressure and I really don't think it will ever be released in the US market. We will have to satisfy ourselves with the DVD or VHS if it even ... I don't want to say much about the story, because I don't want to spoil it for you, but basically the movie is about a homeless drunk what is the new messiah just for kicks and for getting money out there (like sooooooooooo many), before he knows it, he is in a life in the life he doesn't count on.
