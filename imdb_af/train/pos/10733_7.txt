To watch this movie again, really brought some great memories of children. I'm 34 now, haven't seen it since I was 12-14. I almost forgot about this movie, but when I watched it recently, some scenes literally brought a tear to my eye! The little robot "Jinx" (friends forever!). It was just like repeating my childhood. It was an absolutely wonderful experience for me. I will always cherish this movie. I hope some of your readers are related to my experience, not to this particular movie, but to any movie you haven't seen for a long time. Very nostalgic ... <br /> <br /> Thanks for reading
