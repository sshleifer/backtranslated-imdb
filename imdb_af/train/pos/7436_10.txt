This filmed presentation of "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner" is a most beautiful and interesting version of Coleridge's haunting. The striking cinematography, combined with a collection of two centuries of efforts to illustrate the epic poem of world-renowned artists of 1798, and Michael Redgrave's excellent narrative, is worth seeing this excellent visual work. <br /> <br /> In the age of television, such work as this is a valuable tool to explore young students as well as adults to explore and learn the value of great poetry. To my best knowledge this kind of work is indeed rare; That is a shame. As a student of world literature and as a former university professor and academic counselor, I feel that more great epic poems such as Coleridge's "Rime of the Ancient Mariner" should be "translated". Although I am not a film critic, but as an avid reader of classical literature, I am pleased to recommend this good production without any reservations.
