The only explanation I can make why this film is not widely distributed is because it affects people too close to home. This movie was a very happy surprise, the satire is genius. This film turns the lights on in the dark, which is organized religion and great media, and the fists scream for cover. Rent the DVD and watch it for yourself if you have not yet passed this movie, after which many people have failed (Dogma occurs) to make it nose under the tent, both by using humor and very clever analogies along with background and locations. Can't comment in depth without revealing any significant pampering. There are a few surprises in this movie that will even capture the seasoned movie buff.
