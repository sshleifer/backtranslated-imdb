Back in the day of the big studio system, the darndest decisions were made. Good old all American James Stewart appears as a Hungarian in the shop around the corner. If I were the movie, the part of Kralik would have been perfect for Charles Boyer. His accent mixed with all the other European accents would have been nothing. Stewart also had the same problem in Mortal Storm with Margaret Sullavan. <br /> <br /> Margaret Sullavan was his most prominent lady on the screen, doing four movies with her. But it is only this one where none of them die. Sullavan and her husband, Leland Heyward, knew Stewart again when he was a struggling player in New York. In fact, Sullavan's husband was Stewart's good friend, Henry Fonda. <br /> <br /> I just think Clark Gable was able to go down to being an American in a role of non-Americans in Mutiny on the Bounty. Stewart in The Mortal Storm was German, but all the other players were also Americans, so nothing stood out. <br /> <br /> But if you can accept Stewart, you'll see a fine movie by Ernest Lubitsch. The plot is pretty simple, a man and woman working in a department store in Budapest do not come together personally. But it seems that they have a correspondence with some anonymous admirers who appear to be one another. Also employee Frank Morgan suspects Stewart is mistaken for canoodling with his wife. <br /> <br /> Although the lead is good, and Frank Morgan leaves his usual busy self, the two best-performing players are Felix Bressart and Joseph Schildkraut. Bressart has my favorite moments in the movie as he rises after Morgan starts asking people for opinions. He makes himself very rare. <br /> <br /> And Josef Schildkraut, who is always good, is just as good as the angry little worm constantly kissing Frank Morgan. You hate so many people, I knew too much like Schildkraut in real life what is 24 hours a day in office politics. Sad that it pays a lot of time.
