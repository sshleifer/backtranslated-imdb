I laughed a lot while watching it. It's an amusing short with a fun musical act and lots of wackiness. The characters are simple, but their simplicity adds to the humor styling. The dialogue is funny and often unexpected, and from the first line to the last, everything looks wonderful. There is Max, who apparently had a terrible life. And there is Edward, who is not sure what life he wants to lead. My favorite character was Tom, Edward's insane boss. Tom has a short role but a memorable one. Highly recommended for anyone using stupid humor. And now you can find it online, which is a bonus! I'm a fan of all of Jason's cartoons and can't wait to see what he's doing next.
