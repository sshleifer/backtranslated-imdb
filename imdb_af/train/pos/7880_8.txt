The plot of this enjoyable MGM musical is confronted and only almost amusing, dealing with espionage and romance, but the focus of the film is well pointed out on the varied interludes that the hugely talented and athletic crane Eleanor Powell features, complemented by Tommy Dorsey and his band, with Ziggy Elman, Buddy Rich and Frank Sinatra. Red Skelton shares top account with Powell, and he and sidekick Bert Lahr get most of the comic minutes, although Skelton is more effective than he, if it is believed to act as Powell's love interest, with Virginia O'Brien actually most of the film's humor as the dancer's companion. The technical glamor of Powell is proven during an incredible scene in which Buddy Rich wears his dream skills, and it has to be watched several times to enable man's breathing to catch up with her precision. Director Edward Buzzell makes use of his big throw to move the action beautifully, despite the rather treacherous writing he has to deal with, and allows Powell's cotential impossibility to govern the case, as appropriate.
