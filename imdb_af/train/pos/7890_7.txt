Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare (1991) was the last film to host Freddy Krueger as a solo act (not as an entity or a co-star). The years of murder took a toll on the town of Springwood. It has come to the point that the small town has become a virtual ghost town. The parents who murdered Freddy Krueger so many years ago, all paid the ultimate price. Only the mad inhabitants of the village and the survivors are scattered everywhere. But it doesn't stop Freddy looking for his final revenge. No matter how they try to stop him, he always comes back for more. But this time he finds out a little more about his old life. Can the children finally stop Freddy? What is this secret that is buried in Freddy's twisted mind? To find out, you'll have to look at Freddy's Dead. The end was originally filmed in 3-D. <br /> <br /> An appropriate way to end the franchise. Freddy learns about himself and his twisted life and he goes out in a bang! Lisa Zane, Yaphet Kotto and Freddy Krueger star in this final installment. Rosanne, Tom Arnold and Johnny Depp make special appearances. Much better than the last one, but it's filled with a few dated jokes. If you enjoy the series, you don't want to miss this one. <br /> <br /> I should recommend this movie to Freddy fans.
