Hayao Miyazaki did not look like using hand-drawn animation as a form of storytelling, but is often compared to Walt Disney. It is just as unfair because it is evident from Miyazaki's films that he is the superior artist. He really has a gift to boast of both adults and children, and Laputa is indeed a fantastic ride. <br /> <br /> But where can I start to describe a movie as magical and breathtaking! Miyazaki's works never ceased to amaze me. Laputa is a large-scale adventure and I wonder how a movie can be so full of information and imagination. Ask yourself this question: if you are a child who dreams of an adventure so big and so magical, how would that be? The answer would be to tie yourself up in a seat and watch Laputa, because it is truly a fantasy of the youth. Every minute of the movie is rich and impressive ... from the train hunt to the incredible air-flying rows ... and the wonderful sight of the swinging castle itself. Not to mention the excellent score of Joe Hisaishi! Everything you ever want from an adventure movie is here.
