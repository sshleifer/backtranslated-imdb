Best of the Zorro series and one of my favorite magazines, period. This is a period series after the birth of Mexico. The new nation is counting on the gold made by this one town to keep the republic's solvent. But a golden god, Don del Oro, stirs up the Indians and steals the gold for himself. She Zorro and his bond of men to salvation. Reed Hadley is an award-winning Zorro and he cuts a dripping figure while getting into a variety of pieces (most of which are reused by later Zorro series as well as other series). The story is moving and it's not clear who is the real bad man? There's a reason I saw it most from any series I saw, it's just a good action adventure movie. The only thing I can compare it to is the Zorro Mark with Tyrone Power or one of the other swashbucklers of the time. Its super and highly recommended.
