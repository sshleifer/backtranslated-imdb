A LADY GOOD FILM! One that is seriously underestimated. The songs the children sing in the movie gave me a feeling of pain, but also their hope for the future. Whoopi Goldberg is here in a good performance, but the best performance throughout the movie is that of the actress playing the title character. I wish she was in more movies. <br /> <br /> This movie should have a higher rating. I give it a 10/10.
