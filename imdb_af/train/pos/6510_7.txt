I really love what I have seen of this cartoon so far. Certainly, the animation isn't the best, but frankly, I'd rather do this kind of more sophisticated style done quickly and cheaply than the old style that was done quickly and cheaply (which is increasingly happening - it's just a style that looks good when there is a lot of time and effort). There is nothing wrong with the diagonals and the little black tip eyes. In fact, I think it's really cute. As a child I never thought Scooby-Doo's design was exceptionally rich, but I think I might like to know it better. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Shaggy has always been my favorite character and believe it or not, but I think he has the greatest potential for depth. Certainly, the spectacle doesn't focus on the original "Mystery-solving" theme, but it was just a tired old formula anyway. Don't get me wrong - I'm sure there are writers out there who can make much more important to Mystery Inc. Its traditional pursuit (which was so late), but in the middle of this time display is a fun departure from the standard. Shaggy and Scooby are still funny, but no longer just comic relief. They are still cowardly, but eventually have the opportunity to use what appears to be (shock!) Intelligence. They are as old as they eat, but now it really seems to go with their lives with the help of Uncle Albert's heritage. <br /> <br /> I use most of the original Scooby-Doo jokes to be pure cheese and ceaselessly hilarious, but this show actually has a real humor capacity. Also, anyway, I never like Casey Kasem as Shaggy, so the new actor doesn't annoy me as much as he does others. (I still think Billy West was the best) <br /> <br /> Overall, while it's not a great cartoon in the scope of all cartoon history, it's still a performance among other Scooby incarnations.
