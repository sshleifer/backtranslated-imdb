I watch many movies, good, bad and careless; There is usually something important to determine, even if it is only designed, or the reliable work of a good character actor, or the coincidental laugh that comes from unceasing observation. <br /> <br /> But, I was quite pleasantly surprised by this movie, one I've never seen before. Graham Greene has often been translated into film, in such masterpieces as "Dun Man" and in fewer vehicles. "Confidential Agent" is one of the fewer vehicles, but it still drives me somewhere, despite the shining direction, the irregularity of Bacall and Boyer's portrayals as (respectively) British and Spanish, and the fact that there is no chemistry between the two lead. In some ways, this last "problem" really starts in the favor of the film, because how can love really flourish in the murderous atmosphere of fascism and capitalism that comes across one person's tragedy? The most compelling aspect of the film originates directly from Greene's complex and guilty psychology, which permeates the film. I know some see the deliberate pacing here so boring, and I can understand it. Yet I have found that plodding is focused rather than detracting from what is a claustrophobic world. I was obliged to watch, not by a big drama (although Boyer is wonderful as usual, succeeds in giving a rich mix of world power, tragedy, hope and zeal with his beautiful voice and longing eyes) speedy rush of one man's slender hope against a world of oppression and money. What is a thief? What good is love in the face of death? Where does the current gain and exploitation begin? The film does not rise to the level of art and therefore cannot hope to answer such questions, but it is far more than just entertainment and the murders and guilty feelings are very grim. The lack of brilliance, of 'bubble', of narrative 'bounce' helps make this movie worthwhile. <br /> <br /> There is no happy ending, because history has ended.
