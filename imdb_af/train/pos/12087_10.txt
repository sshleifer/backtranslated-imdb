I picked a chance at "Hardcastle and McCormick" by buying the first season's value (Canadian edition) from Amazon. When I got it, I started with the pilot, and I was immediately addicted. I rated it 5 stars on Amazon, and I classify it 10 stars here. It's just as well. What I liked was the opening and closing themes, and of course Stephen J. Cannell's logo at the end of each episode, but above all, the relationship between the Judge and Mark as they work together to crack each case. I was so addicted that I also bought the second season as a companion, and I also looked like it. If you do not have this excellent range on the disk, I believe you have to buy it and put it in your collection.
