Cinderella is one of Disney's greatest films, one of those movies I think you appreciate the older you get. Disney creates a magical adaptation of the classic fairy tale. I see the film as the biggest of his films at the time of his release. The characters have become more dimensional than earlier films, creating more depth to appreciate the characters more. Cinderella herself is, in my opinion, one of the greatest characters Disney ever created. With her kindness and streak of dry humor she is extremely enjoyable; However, it is the inspiration she offers that makes her unforgettable. Like many people, she is an endless dreamer, and she loves her dreams, never gives up. Even in the most negative situations, her dreams endure, and she will not allow anyone to take it away from her. Her example should serve as inspiration for everyone, and courage to never let go of your dreams.
