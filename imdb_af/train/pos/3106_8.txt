After I didn't see the movies (and Matt Damon couldn't stand it), I was reluctant to see the Bourne Ultimatum when we were asked to watch it for AS Film Study. <br /> <br /> However, I was pleasantly surprised that even a movie with Damon could be in it. <br /> <br /> Quick battle scenes, crazy motorcycle chases and BIG explosions were thrown out of your seat in TBU. The near misses between the CIA and Bourne kept you on your toes and entertained thoroughly. <br /> <br /> However, several things grated my cheese. <br /> <br /> First, the fact that the movie was just a series of Bourne, CIA, Bourne, CIA, Bourne, CIA. This sequence was repetitive and eventually boring. Although Damon entertained us and was always one step ahead of the CIA, I got a little irritated with Bourne's ongoing survival. He crashed a car and came out as if he had cut it or something! Very unrealistic. <br /> <br /> Secondly (inevitably) - the SHAKY CAMERA. It was so shaky, it was quite noticeable and made me and everyone see it in my class (even the tutors) seasick. We were told by the tutors that if we ever used it in a movie we made in class, it would be automatically wrong and we would be told to use a tripod. Good enough if Greengrass looks like we were there to watch Damon and Stiles hold a conversation, but we won't shake ourselves so much! <br /> <br /> Though TBU is a nice movie and worth a watch. But I didn't think it was the best movie of the year, though it's an entertaining piece of cinema. <br /> <br /> 8/10.
