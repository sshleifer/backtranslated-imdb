Lost likes something for everyone. You can say a lot about this series, and there are many said, so I won't be the one to spell it out for you again. Just read the people who loved it and you will know why you want to see it. The nice thing about this series is that it is completely new. There are not many movies, and even less series based on the theme of tension, but Lost is proud of the theme. It's all about the inexplicable and if you combine it with an exotic location, nice plot twists, an excellent role and a good format (present and past combined in a few episodes), you'll have a series in which every episode story is about his own but part of a bigger story. You want all the insights of the characters, you want to see the overall picture and you will want to know where the authors take you. The result is that it's a series that won't let you go. On a more skeptical note, the series had a bit in season 2, probably due to its own success. It is well known that Lost was only originally written for one season and when the overwhelming success followed, the authors were also overwhelmed. In my opinion, they made the mistake of adding more secrets and in a higher rate in season 2, then solving one or more of one season 1. At the end of season 2, you ended up with a big blow of secret, plot and inexplicable phenomena, but there is just as much a viewer can take. However, the difference between season 2 and 3 was great. Season 3 handed out many insights, to replace them partially with new questions. And that's exactly how they should write; you want to stumble from one plot to the next, not spread a tsunami of secrets over you and then pick up a few to explain the viewers. They have it in season 3 and bring us a promising series of future for the season 4. It's good to see that such a different format of a series can be so extremely popular.
