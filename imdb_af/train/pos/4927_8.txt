Just a comment on New Orleans accent ... <br /> <br /> A previous reviewer commented: "This movie can be shot in New York or another northern city because it offers us characters what is more like "broklynse" than maybe a southern accent that one can hear in that part of the country. "There was another comment about these lines of an English reviewer. <br /> <br /> Many people in New Orleans actually do sound "brocline". I've never found out why. (This is mentioned in "A Confederacy of Dunces" by John Kennedy Toole.) I always appreciate New Orleans movies, which include this detail, as this one did. Too often, it's just the Hollywood version of the standard Southern accent.
