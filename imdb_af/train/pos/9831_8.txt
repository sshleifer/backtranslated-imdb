We have high expectations with this one. . . because she is Zombi 3's official successor to Zombi 2 and directed by Lucio Fulci. . . However. . . It is co-directed by Bruno Mattei (of the Night of the Zombies) and not written by Dardino Sachetti, but by Claudio Fagrasso (Night of the Zombies) and his shot in the Phillimines like Night of the Zombies and looks like the Night of the Zombies (Hell of the Living Dead) a lot. as a result, it is more like a companion for the hell of the living dead than Zombi 2. Fabrazio DeAngelis who made Zombi 2, and his editor Tomassi (?) and Efx Gianetto De Rossi, gave Zombi 2 his magic. . . Zombi 3 is not magic. . . It is like a peanut butter and jelly roll without the peanut butter. But over the years I have grown to accept Zombi 3. I could swear I saw a version where a soldier was bitten on the arm and went to the hotel room. . . There was a senseless Fulci track and the Mattei / Fulci track was the one on DVD.
