As is well known, anthology films don't go very well with American audiences (I think they prefer one standard plot line). New York, I love you, is the second phase of a series of anthology love that deals with cities and the people who live and love them. The first was 'Paris, J'Taime', which I really enjoyed. The film consists of several segments, each written and / or directed by another director (most of whom were French, but a very funny segment directed by Joel and Ethan Coen). Like 'Paris', this one is also an anthology, led by various directors (Fatih Akin, Mira Nair, Natalie Portman, Shakher Kapur, etc.), and also like' Paris'deals with New Yorkers, and why they the stadium in which they live. It features a top-of-the-line performance, such as Natalie Portman, Shia LaBeouf, Christina Ricci, Orlando Bloom, Ethan Hawki. He also has seasoned veterans such as James Caan, Cloris Leachman, Eli Wallach and Julie Christie. Some of the stories really fly, and others don't (although I suppose it will depend on individual tastes - I won't ruin anyone else by revealing which one worked for me and what didn't). Word is that the next entry in Shanghai, China (Rome, Italy, Berlin, Germany or Athens, Greece will be out of the question)? Spoken mainly in English but has little Yiddish and Russian with English subtitles. Rated by the MPAA for strong language and sexual content
