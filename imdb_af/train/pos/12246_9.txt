The moment I started to look at it, I realized that I was watching a quality production so I wasn't surprised to find that the script was written by Andrew Davis. It was manufactured by Sue Birtwhistle. Both we have the excellent 1995 production of Pride and Prejudice! So my only gripe here is that Emma doesn't run to 3 or 4 or even six episodes like Pride and Prejudice. The play was excellent, I suspect Prunella scales are excellent as Miss Bates, but I loved Kate Beckinsale and Mark Strong just as much. The language is a pleasure to listen to, can you imagine having a right on someone's day and age without pronouncing a swear word? Samantha Morton was excellent as Miss. Smith, in fact, was the deciding place much like it was with Pride and Prejudice. I loved it so much that I watched it twice in two days !! Again, thank you BBC for another quality piece of television. I've seen the Paltrow version and it's good, but I think the BBC version is much better. An excellent production that I very much like to own on DVD !!!
