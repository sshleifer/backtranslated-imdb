A murder investigation goes back to the stage while The Vanities, on the opening night, plays to an ignorant audience. Odd combination of musical and murder mystery is a look at his role, his production numbers, and the sheer novelty of the film. A Blessed Michael has the prosperous role of a crazy actress who aims to stop marriage. between the shoulders stars, Kitty Carlisle and Carl Brisson, as well as the well-known "Sweet Marijuana" number (which was also on a 70-year-old Bette Midler album). So while the choir girls walk around, the girl, Mrs. Victor McLaglen caught the girls trying to solve the back killings of an unknown woman. We quickly learn that Brisson's girlfriend (Dorothy Stickney) loves far, that the wardrobe lady (Jessie Ralph) is Brisson's mother, and that the stage manager (Jack Oakie) bumps into everything. Many sites turn under the musical numbers. The show's best-known song is "Cocktails for Two." Kitty Carlisle also sings the ghostly "Where do they come from?" And there's a strange rhapsody out in a Harlem specialty number with Duke Ellington! Completely the movie. <br /> <br /> Very great acting here, especially Gertrude Michael and Dorothy Stickney. Kitty Carlisle is also very good. However, Brisson is a total zero. <br /> <br /> Charles Middleton plays Homer, Toby Wing plays Nancy, Donald Meek plays the doctor and see if Ann Sheridan and Lucille Ball can see among the show girls.
