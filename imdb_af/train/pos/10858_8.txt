Enjoy the movie and effective Confucian crime drama, the old order survives the threat posed by a bitterly young greedy man, who undoubtedly represents modern society. I thought the final scene was strange and could not understand if we had to believe that big D was punished for greedy or it was part of the plan for a long time. I loved the scene and for once in a Chinese movie the violence was not a choreographed martial arts festival. The thing that always encourages me about HK movies is that the biggest influence that the British has had is to suggest 'yes sir' and 'sorry' in the local language and it is amusing that we have long since gone , they're still there.
