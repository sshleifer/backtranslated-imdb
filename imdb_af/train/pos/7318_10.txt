John Carpenter's Halloween <br /> Is this the biggest horror movie of all time? no. Maybe not for everyone, but for me it is and will always be. The movie is pure genius and will always keep a very special place in my heart. <br /> <br /> It's a pity I didn't see this movie until twenty years after the release, but even twenty years later after so many treasure cats came, the movie still had the same impact as it should has. My dad suggested before I see the Halloween H20, which I delete and rent Halloween's 1 and 2 to get the full story. After watching Halloween, it was clear that it defined and set the Slasher genre. <br /> <br /> The movie's plot is simple. In 1963, Michael Audrey Myers killed his sister Judith in cold blood with a large butcher's knife. He was fifteen years old when he was dr. Sam Loomis treated, escaped and returned to his hometown Haddonfield where he started bumping three young girls: Laurie Strode, an innocent bookworm, Annie Brackett, a tough sarcastic talk and Lynda Van Der Klok a beautiful and sexually powerful young girl . Dr Loomis follows Michael here where he endorses the help of the city's Sheriff Leigh Brackett. He remains skeptical about his story about the psychotic killer. Michael looks at the girls mercilessly and starts knocking one by one until just sweet innocent Laurie is left, who is the first target on Michael's list. <br /> <br /> The decisive film was brilliant and all the actors and actresses also performed, Jamie Lee Curtis was stunning in her first film role as Laurie Strode and Donald Pleasance has an exciting show with his little role as Loomis gift. Nick Castle portraying Michael's excellent work as the rare and evil killer, and his walking and body movements were perfect. <br /> <br /> One of the highlights of this film is the chilling score John Carpenter himself did. which created one of the best known horror themes known today. The Blue Lighting was creepy and effective, and one of the great moments in this film is when young Laurie cherishes a wall after seeing her dead friends. In the shadow behind her, Michael's face is struck in front of him. Michael's mask was one of the things that most cold fever sent to my spine. The white, emotional face worked perfectly. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie so great is that it's not a stingy movie, unlike the cheese-like Friday. 13th movies, in fact, there is little blood in this film and it works rather on tension and tension. <br /> <br /> It has become so clear that Halloween movies grow like Friday. The 13th and characters like Jason Voorhees, which he is just a while from Michael Myers. <br /> <br /> To sum it up, I suggest you see this movie at least once in your life, as it is a popularity in filmmaking and without doubt the biggest one of the greatest horror movies of all times are.
