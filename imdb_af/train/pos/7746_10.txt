Those of you who know the group, know the lead singer Tom Barman. He directed this movie, as he created music, it's a mix of everything. It's a comedy, but mostly absurd and cynical, a drama. Not one of the main characters has a happy life to say the least, and it doesn't really have a purpose. <br /> <br /> The movie starts on a Friday morning in Antwerp, Belgium, with plays from several people, some of them having nothing in common, but they will come in contact with each other during the day and night. There are several main characters: a teacher writing books that nobody reads, a young researcher with a morbid taste of death and his sister, a gallery owner, two young men who are constantly in touch with the law, a man working in a kiosk and two young women. Throughout the film there is a man who has something to do with wind. All characters have their problems, with their family or friends or just with life itself. <br /> <br /> The movie is in Antwerp and shows several beautiful shots of the city and port. The events of the day are not easily explained, I recommend just watching the movie, there is too much to tell. But I can say, Barman has an excellent use of the camera and uses a lot of music (mostly dance music, not really rock) to set a mood, especially the party is full of excellent music. <br /> <br /> This movie is an experience in itself, it will not leave you wiser about life, perhaps just that you have to live it and not waste it, or have any false moral truths. <br /> <br /> In short, see it, it's definitely worth it!
