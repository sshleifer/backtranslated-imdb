* Firstly, although many say it's the worst of the series, I don't think that's true, as this one ideally reflects the 21st teenage mentality. It offers perfect opportunities to make you laugh and remind you of the good teenage times when you would like to have the same fun as the characters do. <br /> <br /> * I agree that it's a teenage movie, but comedy movies these days aren't supposed to be for teenagers? ... theaters are usually the place for teens to hang out; Plus, to see such a movie during a sleep, or something like that, is great for a great time. <br /> <br /> * Many comments on the amount of nudity in this movie. Well ... let's really be ... doesn't it reflect the thoughts of teens like that of the movie? what do you want to see ... smart books, romantic things? it is not what will be in those teenagers' minds. <br /> <br /> * Finally, I think if you are a teenager, you should definitely see the movie, and even if you are a real big man or woman, you should see it if you have another teenager thought or you often think about how it was a teenager or things like that. Thanks for reading!
