Jimmy Cagney constantly runs through your eyes in this story of a stage producer who fights hard against the upcoming "talk" movies. <br /> <br /> This story of love, deception, women and dance is in such a way that you, as a viewer, can never be treated in a dull moment. The direction of the mass scenes in the rehearsal rooms was done very well. The story was never really lost. <br /> <br /> Some parts of the material presented here have become somewhat dated, but it doesn't matter because if you look at it in a 1933 time frame, it's great to see it along a bunch of other movies released during that time. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Cagney is a sight of sore eyes in this movie, never losing his serenity as the everlasting producer of movie theaters as intros. In this way he tried to save his ass, go out, he was a broadway producer before he started it. Joan Blondell is fantastic as the neglected love affair, Nan, she gives such an enthusiastic performance so unusual for movies of that time, so cool to see a woman portrayed as a strong woman for a change. <br /> <br /> The only problem I had with the movie was the huge productions at the end. It was beautiful in itself, well choreographed and wonderfully produced, but it doesn't seem to fit into the story. The only link they have on the main story is that Cagney had to place 3 previews in 3 days to get a contract and that's what he did. I had a hard time believing it was the girls' rehearsal throughout the movie and that these sets fit into a cinema. In this way, the "Sit on a backyard fence" was much more suited to the story. <br /> <br /> The productions at the end were fun to stop this devastating story and it wasn't a good thing. I was tired after seeing the first music series and then I realized there were two more. These sequences also helped a lot from the audience. <br /> <br /> All in all, a good movie with an acid ending. <br /> <br /> 9/10
