Why this movie has disappeared in the dark is an absolute crime. "Conan" may be the only sword and magic movie better. The brutal violence, cool character designs and good pacing make this one of the best fantasies. It's definitely the biggest animated movie aimed at a more mature audience I've ever seen. It is not similar to Bakshi's usual frenetic style. This is quite a departure for Bakshi, and I think his best work is. I hope this movie gets the recognition it deserves.
