Yes ... I'm going with the 1-0 on this and here's why. In the past few years I have watched quite a few comedies and just left with a few light laughs and a few video rental fees because the movies were so easy to forget. Then I stumble on nothing. It looks interesting but doesn't expect much. I was wrong. It was probably one of the funniest movies I've ever had the chance to watch. Dave and Andrew make a big comic couple and the humor is packed enough to remember, but not too complex to miss the joke. I don't want to notice any of the real scenes, because I feel it is once a movie worth seeing. With more and more useless movies coming in movies (such as deadly military jets and a fresh remake that destroys old classics), this movie will make you happy to say it's good to laugh nothing.
