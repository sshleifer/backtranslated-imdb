It's a little easy. It's about it. <br /> <br /> The graphics are clean and realistic, except that some of the fences are 2d, but comparable. The rest of the graphics are cleaner than GoldenEye and many other N64 games. The sounds are wonderful. Everything from talking to the SFX is pleasant and realistic. <br /> <br /> The camera angle is sometimes frustrating, but it's the same for every platform game, such as Banjo-Kazooie and Donkey Kong 64. <br /> <br /> I donated this game as a Christmas in 1997 , and since then I have been conscientiously receiving 120 stars over 10 times.
