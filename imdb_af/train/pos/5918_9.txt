One of the most interesting movies classified as "blaxploitation", Bakshi's "Coonskin" is a rich text full of wonderful insight. He wrote it in collaboration with Scat Man Crothers and Barry White, who also appeared in the film. The racist images can often be disturbing, but the message of the movie was so powerful that the NAAKP gave it an endorsement (but unwillingly). <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone interested in investigating the staggering atmosphere of racism that Bakshi is trying to deconstruct. Wonderful things.
