Heartland was in production for about the same time as Michael Cimino's Heaven's Gate - Heartland had a break, but is 10 times the film. <br /> <br /> Heaven's Gate was "the biggest and most expensive ($ 40 million in 1980!) Hollywood flops of all time, its failure led to the sale of the United Artists studio to MGM" imdb entry <br /> <br /> Heartland costs a few hundred thousand dollars and benefits from great writing, direction, photography and acting. It easily pulls you into the beauty, joys, hardships, and grief of pioneering life. <br /> <br /> It's sad that Hollywood sometimes throws millions in turkeys (based on a director's single big hit) and neglects such a wonderful story. .
