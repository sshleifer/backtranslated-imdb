ANCHORS AWEIGH is an entertaining MGM musical that fans of the genre will enjoy, but I won't rate it with classics like SINGIN IN THE RAIN or THE BAND WAGON. It was the first of three musicals that Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra appeared in each other. Kelly and Sinatra play Joe Brady and Clarence Doolittle, two sailors in Los Angeles, who are with a young boy (Dean Stockwell), who introduces them to his handsome aunt (Kathryn Grayson), a struggling actress acting as an extra work at MGM. Although both guys are initially attracted to Grayson, she eventually has a preference for Joe, but Clarence later arrives with a waitress (Pamela Britton), whom he learns from his hometown Brooklyn. The paper thin plot leaves room for several great musical numbers such as "We Hate to Leave", Joe and Clarence's Sadness for their fellow sailors as they leave the ship; Grayson's fiery version of "Jalousie"; Sinatra's dreamy version of "I'm in love too easily" (a number unfortunately removed from some prints of this movie), and "The Worry Song", a fantasy dance that Kelly with animated Jerry the Tom and Jerry Mouse do fame. . Kelly also does some sort of Bandit fantasy ballet that opposes his Pirate's Ballet in the later THE PIRATE. Kelly is in peak shape here, in a robust and energetic performance that earned him, his only Oscar nomination for best actor and Sinatra's impressive shy character here undoubtedly sexy. An entertaining distraction for fans of the MGM music factory.
