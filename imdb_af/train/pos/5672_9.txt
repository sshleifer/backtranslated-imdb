In this episode of the series, Edmund Blackadder is stuck in the Regency period in Britain (during the later part of George III's rule). This time, Blackadder's prospects are much poorer - as a royalties he is a servant of the very, very thick George IV (the prize-winner). Unlike the historical accounts of George IV, this one is as bright as a tomato, and as a result, Blackadder can benefit from him and schemes to his heart's content. The only big difference in style between this one and earlier is that the series ends on a very, very, very different note - you just have to see it to believe it. Other than that, all the usual story elements are there and the show is hilarious. The only discussion I have (as always) is that this show is not suitable for the children because of the rough language and adult situations.
