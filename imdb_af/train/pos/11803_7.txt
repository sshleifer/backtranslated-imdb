"Sasquatch Hunters" wasn't really as bad as I thought. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Traveling in the Forest, Park Rangers Charles Landon, (Kevin O'Connor) Roger Gordon, (Matt Latimore) Brian Stratton (David Zelina) Spencer Combs, (Rick Holland) and his sister Janet, (Stacey Branscombe) escort dr. Helen Gilbert (Amy Shelton-White) her boss Dr. Ethan Edwards, Gary Sturm) and assistant Louise Keaton, (Juliana Dever) to find the site of a number of alleged bones in the area. When they camp, the team discovers a huge cemetery and more strange bones that litter the area. When members of the group begin to disappear, they start wandering through the forest to safety. It has been discovered that a Sasquatch is behind the killings, and the team is together to survive. <br /> <br /> The Good News: It wasn't as bad as I thought. The movie really starts steaming to pick up half the point when the creature attacks. This is a masterful series of scenes, as the whole group is subject to creature attacks, and the tension in the whole play is extremely high. The wooded area is best smashed in these areas, which increase the tension and wonder if a single person wandering in the woods will get their arrival. Also, fairly liberal spreads throughout the film is the effective use of off-screen growls and roar that is truly worldly. They really add a lot to making this part so eager as well as the rough screaming the other time. It is reasonably efficient and works well. It is pretty good that the later part of the movie picks up the pace, as it comes out very well on a high note of action. A special scene, especially what I feel, should point out that it is a special scene during the first viewing. As a man runs through the forest through the creatures, he mocks the expedition that was looking for. Raising his hands to help them get help, the second he announces to his presence, was attacked from nowhere and killed pretty soon. It surprised me and actually jumped at the first show. <br /> <br /> The Bad News: There were just a few things to complain about and one is a common complaint. The creature here is mostly delivered by terrible CGI, which made him ridiculous and destroyed any credibility it could have. The air of the thrown up by the opening of the film is almost shot out of the window when the creature appears on the screen. It is so distracting that it is a pity that a little more work has not been put into it. I have complained a lot about this one, and that is something that really needs to be completed as it does not seem realistic and is very false. Another big one is the off-screen death in it. Many times in the movie a person is grabbed and then chased away and then found the bloody body. It is quite aggravating when the shootout looks nice and juicy. Otherwise, I don't really have much of a problem with this one, since everything that is usually criticized for this criticism doesn't really bother me, but it is demanded for others than these things. <br /> <br /> The final verdict: I liked this one, but it's still not the best Sasquatch movie ever. It is not supposed to be taken seriously, and if so, it is really nice. Fans of these films should give this one a glimpse, and those who love the Sci-Fi Creature features can also find good things here. <br /> <br /> Rated R: Graphic Language, Violence and Some Graphic Carcasses
