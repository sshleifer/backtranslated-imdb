I will never forget when I saw this title back in the video store. I was always a great Weird Al fan and when I watched this video I rented it and watched it. I was too young to appreciate all the subtle humor and satire of Al, but I remember that much later when I was old enough to understand what I was watching. If you are an "All" fan, especially of his previous work, you will thoroughly enjoy this movie. This is done in the MTV-like "Rockumentary" style and tells a true (but sometimes exaggerated) story of how Al should be where he was in 1985. You will love it if you like its brand of humor and, more importantly, its music.
