The Russian emigrant director in Hollywood in 1928 (William Powell) makes his epic ruling on the Russian Revolution, and hires an old ex-general of the Tsarist regime (Emil Jannings) to play the general of the film and the two relive the drama and the memory of the woman they shared (Evelyn Brent), 11 years ago. <br /> <br /> Try as I please, I find it hard to warm up to "The Last Command" for all its virtues. "The Docks of New York" was undoubtedly a wonderful movie, and "Underworld" is a movie I have always wanted to see, but "The Last Command" is quite heavy. The point of departure is fascinating, but the treatment really makes the script alive, except in the sequels in Hollywood, which portray the breadth of workable extras and the operations of a great movie production with the latest technology. </ br /> <br /> Emil Jannings is predictably a wonderful Russian general, who distinguishes wonderfully between the traumatized and apostate old ex-general, in his misery, and the strong, affectionate officer of the world. <br /> <br /> The end is great and worth the wait, but to get there you have to be willing to be bored sometimes.
