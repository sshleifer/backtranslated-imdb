The team of Merian Cooper and Ernest Schoedsack made a documentary of 50,000 Bakhtiari people and their animals on summer migration to winter grazing. The basic value of this film today is as a time capsule of a "forgotten people" and how they lived during what we knew in the West as the "roaring twenties". A more drastic contrast could not be proposed. Raging river and barefoot mountain crossings are brutally realistic and the animals that disappear underwater actually die. To make sure the audience of the time believed that the story had taken place, a signed certificate of authenticity was presented at the end. The version I have seen has fascinating Iranian music that can stand alone and appreciated without the film. It all said, the movie is probably more valuable to the anthropologist than the casual viewer looking for a good night's entertainment. The crew barely had enough stock to take the shots they recorded and there is no fancy camera work that comes from multiple repetitions. The Western interstitutions detract from the experience, but are actually part of the record, as they demonstrate how Hollywood tried to turn their lives on the lives of indigenous people, so they are appreciated by the audience of the day. Recreation entertainment by the desert police becomes a "policeman's ball." The manufacturers made the document drama Chang (1927) and the completely commercial King Kong (1933). The migration theme is again used in People of the Wind (1976) and in the Himalayas (1999). Recommended for those who know in advance what they come in - and then highly recommend to them.
