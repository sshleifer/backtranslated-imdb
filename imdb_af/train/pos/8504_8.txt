You play as B.J. Blazkowicz, an American secret agent soldier's hard man who is sent to expose the Nazi secret and change the flood of World War II. This means everything from the outbreak of a Nazi dungeon to weaken Hitler's war machine and even the Fuhrer itself. <br /> <br /> This is probably the most influential game of his time. This is because it literally inspires obsession. Many games existed and do even more today, but every time you get a real grabber. This is one of them. Just like Tetris before and more recently GTA III in 2002. Yes, Doom is in almost every respect better, but the shots heard around the world have led to one of the biggest naval waves of the game, by B.J. Blazkowicz fired. Space Marine, Duke Nukem, Max Payne, Serious Sam, John Mullins, JC Denton, Agent 47, Gordon Freeman and legions of others owe them to the guys at ID. Whether it's directly or in most cases indirect, but they still do. <br /> <br /> Even with its old look, lots of older graphics, super simple gameplay (it's really a game, games now border on the "experience level") and highly rectangular levels, the range of all six episodes fun. Especially the secrets with treasures and a chaingun discovered in them. <br /> <br /> Also: "Stop!" * Bang! Bang! Bang! * "AARRRGH !!!" never get old. --- 8/10 <br /> Voluntarily valued PC-13 for "profound carnage." However, it is particularly tame compared to what games have today.
