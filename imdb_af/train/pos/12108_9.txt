Yakitate! Ja-pan (translated as Fresh-baked Japanese Bread) is the story of a young man named Azuma Kazuma and his journey to make the perfect Japanese Bread or Ya-pan for Japan, and for the Japanese, the whole world. <br /> <br /> Of course it's just on the outside. In fact, Yakitate! Yes-pan is not really about bread, but the reaction that comes after the bread is eaten, and the pun that comes with the reaction. The series loves these words. From popular anime titles such as Naruto, Detective Conan, and Dragon Ball, to enhance movies like The Matrix and Lord of the Rings. That's all there. <br /> <br /> So what makes this title different from other titles of the same genre like Cooking Master Boy or Mr. Ajikko? Well, unlike the others who cook for world domination, Yakitate! Yes-pan is pure comedy. Certainly, there are times when the story changes drama, or even murder, but the comic atmosphere makes you laugh. You will laugh at their own view of heaven. Just look at it. <br /> <br /> Just remember that it is also fiction, although some of the bread made here is based on real bread, eating home-made Japan. # 2 will not take you to a Super Saiyan or turn your body to rubber.
