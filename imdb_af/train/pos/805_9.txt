"Returning the Jedi" is often remembered for what it did wrong rather than doing it right, and it is a pity, because the last chronological installment in the Star Wars saga is a shining example of epic storytelling. It manages all the story lines of the previous movies in one big finale, and it does so convincingly. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are Ewoks - cute and cuddly stuff that probably served the Star Wars demographic widening - and in the middle the movie tends to slow down. But the last hour is probably the best part of the whole saga, where Luke finally comes face to face with Darth Vader, the most recognizable villain in the film history. <br /> <br /> Returning the Jedi made so many things right that people are inclined to look: it made an incredible conclusion to the Darth Vader story (which came a bit undeniably in "Empire Strikes Back" has to be very convincing here), an exciting opening at Jabba's Palace, a masterful performance by Ian McDiarmid as Emperor, Luke finally comes in his own, the resolution of Solo and Leia's romance, and the extremely powerful final moments on the Endor Moon. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are slight annoyances. But they are the annoyances of a generation of movie players who had time to cut every single scene. It's still a magical and moving piece of cinema that also serves as a great final chapter. It's not a 'good' movie - it's fantastic!
