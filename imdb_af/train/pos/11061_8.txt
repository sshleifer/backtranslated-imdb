I also went through very painful personal loss (Twice), and this movie shows the gut-wrenching reality of that experience very well, life out of balance, nothing makes sense, but meaningful relatives, etc. ... <br /> <br /> It was nice to see Ally again. She is one of my best film actors. <br /> <br /> I laughed and cried when the story unfolded. Great story and throw. Well done!
