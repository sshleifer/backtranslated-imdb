Someone has already said, "at the right time in the right place." It was so true for this documentary that I have doubts about the authenticity of the screens and thought it might have included some plays, but it is not. That's all really. The story is nothing new to the people of the developing and / or poor countries. It sheds light on the manipulation of people by corporate media, the wrong information, the artificial polarization of people by creating tension on the streets, sometimes to the point that the army, intelligence agency or even government (many believe, led by the US) use agents who "attack" any side to challenge the masses in violence and thus justify their coups. A naval officer in the movie also calls it. That they wanted people to confront the street. All these scenarios have been played in Turkey (the US pet dog in the Middle East) through history that has experienced 3 coups. Recently, secret plans made by the Turkish army have been ironically placed by a pro-government religious / conservative media opposed to the army's a-religious doctrines, in which a very important mosque is bombed by an army agent. to evoke the people, etc. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie unique is that they have filmed inside, perhaps by chance, when the events happened. It is clear that the directors are pro Chavez. I wouldn't know if it caused the directors to filter and manipulate the events and information. <br /> <br /> And whether Chavez will defend the people of Venezuela against the dictatorship of the US and the global economy without the oppression of any conflicting thought of violence and eventually become a self-indulgent tyrant, history will tell. <br /> <br /> But at least Chavez is hoping and I believe it's worth taking the chance.
