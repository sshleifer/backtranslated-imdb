"The Luzhin Defense" is a movie worthy of anyone's time. This is a brilliant, intense movie and has taken my attention. John Turturro is absolutely stunning in his portrayal of a gentle, eccentric chess master, and Emily Watson is spell-binding as the gentle but rebellious daughter of a highly respected Russian family. The chemistry between Watson and Turturro on the screen is evident from the moment their characters meet in the story. All in all, this movie is one of the best in depth look at the life of a chess grandmaster, and Turturro and Watson add a whole non-mainstream, non-clich√© feel to the movie. Most people will come out of the theater think, and feel slightly touched by this brilliant look at the most unlikely love stories.
