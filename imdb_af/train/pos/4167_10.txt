The Devil Dog: Hound of Hell is really good movie. It performed well by the cast including Richard Crenna and R.G. Armstrong. The music is ghostly and gives those devilish cold! I like the effects on the dog and I think the creature itself looks really cool with its horns, like a part on its neck, and really got dirty! If you like horror movies and haven't seen the devil's dog: hell of hell before and can find and buy this rare movie, do it because it's a good movie and I don't think you'll be disappointed!
