Pushing Daisies is truly a trademark in Television as an art form. Everything seems to be Amelie and Tim Burton, but in a world where fresh ideas are just as scarce, this performance will ensure that you don't mind whether it is fresh or not. It's just Brilliant. <br /> <br /> I was enchanted from the start, intelligent writing, directing to the background and dialogue making this show the most amazing masterpiece since The Shield and The Wire (ok, not really good comparisons, but The beauty of Pushing Daisies is that it has no comparisons on television.) <br /> <br /> Really addictive and absolute pleasure. Perhaps like one of the Piemakers pies mentioned in such indulgent ways.
