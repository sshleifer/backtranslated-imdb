It's hard for me to criticize what Mitzi Kapture does. She only puts beauty and grace on the screen and is a phenomenal actress. Nonetheless, yes, that plot was predictable. I think maybe if Jill slept HAD with Richard, it might have hurt him a bit more than he was, which would have added more to the stress. It would also have been nice to see Jill and her husband find out about Richard's little problem with his ex-wife, perhaps a little bit more. I was a little disappointed at the end of the movie. I would have liked to see more closure with Zack's death and possibly closure with her husband. I have to say, I will never be able to look at a flare gun and not see her standing there. It was a very appropriate ending for Richard. Of course, Mitzi ROCKED! I look forward to her future projects.
