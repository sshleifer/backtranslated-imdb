I first saw English April about five years ago. I loved it so much that my husband surprised me with a copy of the next Christmas. It's about two women who decide to rent a castle in Italy for April. They leave their humdrum behind them. They are very sad women at the start of the movie, and you can't help disrupting them, as they plan to get away with two other women inviting them to share the expenses. It may be the best movie I've ever seen. It is pure and simple, with no car hunt, no hostility and no death. It is made with care and in very good taste. You can't help but all the smiles are smiling - unless you cry happy tears!
