Kimi wa Petto is a cute story about a girl who one day finds a boy in a box outside her apartment. She decides to bring him in and fix his cuts. She then left a note for him to eat food she had made and then went home because she had to go to work. However, when she gets home, she finds that he is still there. He tells her that he wants to live with her like a brother or cousin. In despair to let him go, she told him that if he had become her pet, he could stay. And as a pet, she says he has no rights and whatever she has said does not. (not in that perverse way!) To her surprise, he agrees and from then on he is known as Momo, her pet.
