Many reviews here explain the story and characters of "Opening Night" in detail so I won't. I just want to add my comment that I believe the movie is a wonderful confirmation of life. <br /> <br /> At first, Myrtle Gordon remembered how easy it was to act when she was 17 when she had youth and energy and felt she knew the truth. Experience left her emotionally fragile, wondering what her life was and, if she could even continue to live. A tragic accident leads to a personal crisis that almost overwhelms her. <br /> <br /> Almost - but not quite. At the eleventh hour she reconsidered the power of her art and restored herself ("I'm going to bury that bastard," she says of fellow actor Maurice as she goes on stage). It seems almost sadistic when Myrtle's director prevents people from helping her when she's hopelessly drunk for her first show. However, he knows she must bother to make herself if she has to do it all. <br /> <br /> Some critics wonder if this victory is just a temporary break on Myrtle's downward road. I believe it's really her "opening night" - she opens up new possibilities of life and action like a flower, she sees a way forward. It is great moving. <br /> <br /> Gena Rowlands is great. The movie is wonderful. Thank you, Mr Cassavetes, wherever you are.
