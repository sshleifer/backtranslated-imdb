The movie has a great written genre story. It contains all the usual Columbo ingredients; The way Lt. Columbo approaches and attaches to his suspect, the way the mystery exacerbates him, Columbo's dog, the cat and mouse game, which is wonderful in this one and fortunately also a good enlightening humor, mostly involving the Columbo character. It's all written despite the fact that it doesn't even have a true original concept. Columbo hunting a detective / murder novel writer has been done in a Columbo movie more than once. <br /> <br /> It is also an extremely well-directed film by James Frawley, who subsequently recorded 5 more Columbo movies in the '70s and' 80s. He gave the movie with style and some real big and memorable rows. <br /> <br /> This is one of the slower moving Columbo movies, despite not being too long. This style and approach doesn't always work well for a Columbo movie, but in this movie, which may not be the least, thanks to the acting performances of the movie. <br /> <br /> Most Columbo movies either die from a big celebrity star or star of the early days of film-making, as the movie is its killer. This movie is the unknown 81-year-old Rut Gordon. She did not play in several movies during her career, but she is still known to some, mostly for her role in Rosemary's Baby, who also won her an Oscar. She had a realistic and somewhat unusual style of acting, which some people may not like. It earned her 4 Oscar nominations during her career before her "Rosemary's Baby" victory in 1969. She also has a great deal of interaction with Peter Falk in their successive mergers. <br /> <br /> The film also stares another young GD Spradlin. I say young because I first know of his latest productions from his career, despite having been 57 at the time of Columbo production. He still lives, but since 1999 he has retired from acting. <br /> <br /> A better than usual Columbo movie entry. <br /> <br /> 8/10
