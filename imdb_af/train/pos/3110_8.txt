The third and final part of the Bourne trilogy (duh) is not a bit in the story section, but covers it with extensive action scenes! Particularly twi take quite a few runs and make this movie better. <br /> <br /> The director and star (Damon) themselves agreed it was difficult to find a story for the last part, because the end of the second movie was quite ... advanced storyline. How did they get through it? The action scenes, for once, but they also did another thing, which I can't reveal, because it would be a spoiler. But if you watch the movie, you will see it! Funnily enough, I read that this adjustment of the Bourne books is the least accurate of all three films. If it means something to you: o)
