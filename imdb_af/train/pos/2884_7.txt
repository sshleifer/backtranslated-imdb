From all the Princess stories Disney put there, Cinderella probably has the most sustained appeal. I can't really say why, but for some reason, generation after generation pushes her to the top of their lists. As a little girl I wanted nothing more than Cinderella with her glass therapy. It was my absolute favorite costume. Honestly I don't think there is a story that desires the human heart as Cinderella. Who never wanted to run away from the printing business of everyday life and find someone who sees you as no one else has ever had? The story is older than the English language and somehow it is still true. <br /> <br /> As far as the characters are concerned, Disney can make a wonderful villain, but nothing else. Lady Tremaine is angry at the T, in a wonderful calculation, not openly physical way. Her tapestry and eyes do the work for her. She doesn't need salvation staff to strike fear in your heart. The animal friends tend to boast, especially the idiotic Gus. I would have rejoiced if he met his fate in Lucifer's jaws. Cinderella herself was not an attempt to make a few murky remarks. However, she just lacked the ride to make her completely sympathetic. Sure, she was beautiful and fed animals, but what kept her in that place? We never know. Even though she had just become a girl in another home, she was paid at least and received respect. It seems like the only reason why things finally work out, because Cindy is all in the lap. She never works for her dreams that she loves so much. <br /> <br /> What brings me to the music, which is nice, as always. Ilene Woods has a beautiful, rich voice, probably my favorite of any Disney heroine. Here are some great standards. A dream is a wish your heart makes, so it's love, Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo ... Cinderella is a wonderful heart story with lots of musical highlights. Although lacking in character development, it offers some classic villains and excellent voice work. If you feel sick, push it in - it will warm you up and make your humm. Mmm Mmm Good! <br /> <br /> Quote of the movie: <br /> <br /> -Surprise! Surprise! -You duh-happy birthday!
