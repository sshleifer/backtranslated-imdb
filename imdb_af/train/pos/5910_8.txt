OK, okay, don't get out of the way. I was a joke. <br /> <br /> "Bustin Out Out" is actually a better and more threatening title anyhoo. <br /> <br /> Racism and crime dramas get the satirical treat of our X-rated animator friend Ralphie son. And he does one of his better work here. <br /> <br /> On the crime front, it shows the truth. They build it, defend it, then boredom and stronger opponents may cause them to lose it. Look for yourself to see what goes down. <br /> <br /> Racist? I do not know. With Scatman (RIP) and the love riot (also RIP) which is black and the main point, I have seen it as an attack on racism mostly. The fact that Richard Pryor liked it, says so much. And the younger (former "Miami Vice"), Phil Mike Thomas, was a nice surprise. <br /> <br /> This is an animated "Blacksploitation" movie. That's a good thing. Well done and done well. It will make a little angry (like the lynching scene), but unfortunately it is based on the fact. <br /> <br /> But Ralphie really had to reconsider the title.
