Well, I'll be honest: it's not exactly a Sholay. But you can't get a Sholay every week. In fact, you can see clear signatures of "not without my daughter" (Sally Field, 1991) in this movie. But as most "inspired" movies go, this one was a well-inspired one, well handled and well done. Nana Patekar, as usual, tends to overdo his hysteria, but all the others are commendable. Special about Dipti Naval: she saw her for a long time, but she didn't lose her grace. In fact, she did much better when I last saw her. One of the Bollywood stars that looks more beautiful when they get older? <br /> <br /> All in all, a nice look.
