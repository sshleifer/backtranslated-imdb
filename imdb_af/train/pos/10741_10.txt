The French Naudet brothers did something that no one else did, they had a video camera on the day that this tragedy happened. They were in Building # 2, when you could see paper drifting, people hit the ground from such a height. <br /> <br /> I mean it goes as far as when both buildings collapse, they ran, they The camera was still going on, when the white fabric covered them, they found a shop door and inside come, but all this material is real and i think they did a fantastic job to fix it for us. Ten stars go to the Naudet brothers who filmed this extraordinary movie that I watch every 9/11, so I will never forget what this country has gone through. I believe if I remember correctly, it shows the first death of the priest of the firefighters while he is being carried to the church and his honorable funeral.
