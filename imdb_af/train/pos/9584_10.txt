Yes these movies are tops. Can't recommend it anymore. Homosexual or it's a big doco for everyone who loves film. Very funny, sad and interesting. Never sow. Great access. A movie made with passion and interest in the subject. Some of the performances and just amazing. If you just find this movie on VHS, it's still worth watching. Great. 10 out of 10. I saw some of these doctors about ten years ago and didn't understand what I was looking at. The interviews are very revealing about egos of the artists who are like heavyweight boxers trying to get their way out of the ghetto. The filmmaker was apparently a first timer, such a feat. Cool. Follow this off.
