In all honesty, this series is so much a classic (such as television) as the original poem is to the world's literature. Exploding them apart, it is a beautiful and respectful version of one of western culture's defining texts. <br /> <br /> I was moved by the fate of Odysseus and his followers; touched by the drama of the fall of Troy (felt but not seen); intrigued by the way the gods played with the fate of mortals. (It should be mentioned that the gods that appear here do not flash ridiculous CGI creatures on their single wings, or bad-fashion bikini models. Like Homer's work, they act through mortal agents or are rarely represented by classical sculpture). <br /> <br /> It is a pity that it is not available in DVD, especially considering the significantly inferior and cheesy adjustments of the Odyssey found in video stores.
