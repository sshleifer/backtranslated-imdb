This is a very well made movie. The acting, screenplay and camera work are all first-rate. The music is also good, although it is mostly early in the movie, when things are still relatively cheerful. There aren't really superstars in the role, though several faces will be known. The entire work is an excellent work with the script. <br /> <br /> But it's hard to look, because there's no good ending to a situation like the one being offered. It's now fashionable to blame the British for putting Hindus and Muslims together and then separating them in two countries. There is some merit in this view, but it is also true that no one has forced Hindus and Muslims into the region to abuse each other as they did at the time of division. The British seem more likely to have seen the tensions between the religions and were clever enough to exploit them for their own purposes. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of cruelty and inhumanity in the situation and it is very unpleasant to remember and to see on the screen. But it is never painted as a black and white case. There is basic and nobility on both sides and also the hope of change in the younger generation. <br /> <br /> There is some kind of salvation in the end when Puro has to make a difficult choice between a man who has ruined her life, but also loved her very much, and her family who renounced her came to her later. But at that stage she had no option for her without much pain. <br /> <br /> This movie tells us that both Muslims and Hindus have their serious mistakes, and that both can be dignified and caring. . The reality of partition makes that realization increasingly cruel, as there can never be real reconciliation on the border between India and Pakistan. In that sense, it is similar to "Mr & Mrs Iyer". <br /> <br /> Eventually we were happy to see the movie, although the resolution was sad. If the United Kingdom and the US could handle their own history of racism with this kind of openness, they would definitely be better off.
