Now I've always been a fan of Full Moon's puppet show. But I have to say that Robot Jox is one of the better projects. Yes, you heard me. The story works great, the atmosphere really works and the actors do a first class job. Gary Graham, who really makes his mark on TV in shows such as VESTER NATION THE SERIES and STAR DRAW ENTERPRISE, shows that he can be an action star kicking his ass and recording his name. The stop-motion effects could have been a little better. The color was wrong, they looked plastic to me instead of the metal they would be. But this is a small complaint compared to the whole of the Robot Jox, if you like Gary Graham or other Full Moon movies, then you will like this movie. 9 stars out of 10.
