* A little spoiled * <br /> <br /> I was pleasantly surprised to find the harsh criticism (acting, dated dialogue, unclear storyline) unfounded. Belafonte is big like a brandish, threatening, cursing spirit that has to earn its wings, but it is realistically poorly equipped from its previous life to do so. He teaches how empty his lively, materialistic life was without love. Mostel is just as big as a sad man with his dying wife Fanny. In spite of his prayers for a miracle, his bitterness prevents him from accepting (or believing) one. The two social worlds that represent the characters clash and complement the others, the result is hilarious and touchingly sad. <br /> <br /> The confusing end is actually quite in line with the rest of the movie. After looking at Belafonte everywhere, Mostel looked up to see a falling feather and he reached it frantically as if he were finally willing to believe in angels and miracles. But Belafonte couldn't finish his miracle (to restore Fanny's health or Mostel's faith) so he never had his wings. The feather drifts from Mostel's grip, a metaphor for both men's lives: it's too late and you don't get a second chance. Like "It's a wonderful life," this movie is magical, wonderful, funny but terribly tragic.
