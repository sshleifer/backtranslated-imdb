Set aside the UFO "thing". It was the best documentary I saw. Factual reporting by Neil and Buzz ... a must see. The interviews and reporting are a revelation, as most information was stamped in 1969 and released only in 2006. No documentary to date has the details or accuracy for such a short 47 minutes. The FACTS will blow you away and you will get rid of the risks taken to be the first on the moon. Neil and Buzz are probably the greatest hero of our time. Do you ever see a man saving his own life? Don't bet. Neil saved his life when only a million seconds had separated him from death. Great to watch. It's a travesty people didn't know all the details related to the landing on the moon and the courage that the men had when facing certain death, from a failed computer ... 10 stars!
