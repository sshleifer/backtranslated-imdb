"Roman Troy Moronie" is my commentary on the movie. What else to say? <br /> <br /> This character really brings out the moron in Moronie. A tough gangster with an inability to speak profane words, it seems to be frustrating to be tough and yet not express himself intelligently. <br /> <br /> In the annals of film history, Roman Moronie goes one of the greatest of all morons. <br /> <br /> Of course there is good comedy among the other characters. Michael Keaton is F.A.H. and so is Joe Piscipo. <br /> <br /> I just like the fact that Moronie kept the movie of an "R" rating because he couldn't speak profanity.
