but I want to say I can no longer agree with Moira. <br /> <br /> What a wonderful movie. <br /> <br /> I was just thinking about it this morning, giving some advice on some dull sweet that lost money on his debit card and wanted to say, "Keep your money in your pocket" and realize I as James Mason spoke. <br /> <br /> Even he didn't say those words. , I still think he will! I never forgot "Are you wearing it?" In his reconciliation with his son, Hywel Bennet: "Always keep money in your pocket!" Good advice. <br /> <br /> Not enough children have fathers with such unforgiving, but gentle attitudes. Or some father. <br /> <br /> It will be a good thing for us to restore 'you', 'you' and 'you' in our language to show that we care. It's just the same as 'tutoyer' in French or 'du' in German. <br /> <br /> Addendum: I just realized that many of my comments about James Mason in the Family Way were! <br /> <br /> I think that's because I mixed Susan George with Hayley Mills. Well, easy mistake. <br /> <br /> I stand by the comment tho. <br /> <br /> And Spring and Port Wine are so similar to The Family Way. <br /> <br /> At that time, if you took a girl to the pictures, you really had something to say and talk to, something that influenced your knowledge of the world and your personal development. <br /> <br /> Theater experiences are almost real, and they are important for growing young people. <br /> <br /> It doesn't happen now, I think, teens can just go to the photos as we did.
