In my opinion, this is a very good movie, especially for Michael Jackson lovers. It contains a message about drugs, beautiful special effects and an amazing music video. <br /> <br /> The main film is centered around the song and music video "Smooth Criminal." Unlike the four-minute music video, it's normal speed and I think it's much easier to watch. <br /> <br /> However, the plot is weird. Michael Jackson plays a magical "gangster" who, when he sees a shooter, turns into a piece of machinery. During the film he is transformed into a racing car, a giant robot and a spaceship. <br /> <br /> The robot scene in particular is a bit drawn out and strange. A kid is kidnapped, Michael is trying to save her, tortured and beaten, and suddenly it becomes a giant robot that blows up all the bad guys. A little weird? Yes. <br /> <br /> But besides the bizarre robot scene, it's a great movie, and any Michael Jackson fan will enjoy both the Smooth Criminal music video and the movie.
