In 1976 I moved to Ceylon. I was 23, and had been married for three years and started running out as a lesbian. I saw this movie on an old black and white TV, with terrible reception, alone and uninterrupted, in an awakening that looked like an echo of the story. I was in a small house in tucson arizona, and it was summer ... like everyone here, I never forgot the feelings the images of this story exhibited, and the remnant of fragile magic, and I have a hope that I will see it one day. I'll watch as well. I also wish someone would make a movie of Shirley Verel's 'the other side of Venus'. it also has some of the same delicacy and persistent poignancy ...
