White Fire went so much for it. With a draw, Larry Bird, Robert Ginty is furious with his fabulous hair and super macho mustache, the film above other low-budget action. The charisma he has in this, makes Tom Selleck look like a putz. With Ginty coming up, the movie just goes awesomeness when a story of diamond intrigue goes into the game. Then add Fred Williamson, some frontal bushes, chain saw attacks and some amazing weed seeds .... this movie ends on all cylinders. If you are looking for some fantastic B-action, this is where it is. Now, if I can just get my hands on that soundtrack.
