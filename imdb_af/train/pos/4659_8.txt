Without Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith it could easily have been a turkey. But they are brilliant. Ustinov is at its best, and for fans of Maggie, it's great to see her in her early days, which Ustinov matches every step of the way for timing and timing. For the Englishman in their fifties (and I'm in that bracket), it is always fun to see and hear glasses of the Swinging Sixties and although this movie spends a lot of time in offices, it has nostalgia for many sixties, including red buses, Carnaby Street, a song by Lulu and a lovely shot of a waitress's brand, as England has never seen in public places. As an I.T. engineer, I know computer hacking tricks are ridiculous, but they are not meant to be taken seriously. And also not the wonderful stereotypes of Italians, French and Germans.
