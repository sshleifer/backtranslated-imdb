A beautiful romantic comedy. The plot is a bit too complicated - I summed it up three times and I can't. Suffice to say it is worth seeing. The movie is funny, beautiful - the plot is completely unrealistic, but it works. Everyone in the movie is so nice and everything looks so good - it creates a lovely, romantic feeling throughout the film. <br /> <br /> The acting is wonderful - Robert Downey Jr. and Cybill Shepherd is in the best shape and enjoys every second of it. Ryan O'Neal and Mary Stuart Masterson are just OK but good. If you're a sucker for good, sweet sentimental movies (like me), take this one. Downey also looks good in his underwear! <br /> <br /> Extra bonuses - the title song sung by Johnny Mathis and another great song "After All" sung by Cher and Peter Cetera.
