"House of Games" is definitely not without its flaws, stiff acting, final scenes, but they do little to detract from the pleasure of watching a thrill that breaks with your head methods. "House of Games" makes almost everything a good thriller has to do. Of course, this is not a great achievement as we deal with the world of trust men and the disadvantages they do. That means we never really know what is going on, even though we think we are doing it. But this is what makes the movie worthwhile for those who are wild; a movie for which repeated views are needed instead. <br /> <br /> It has a definite Hitchcock slope over it. The film draws on some similar themes. His 1964 effort, Marnie, was seen as a rubbish when released, but is now considered one of the Master's more thoughts. One can see the idea of ​​Lindsay Crouse's character the same as Tippi Hedrin's ... ten years later. Both are strong residents, both with compulsive behavior, forcing them to walk near the shark pool. As Crouse's suppressed, stiff character says, "What is life without adventure?" Put your reality test on a low environment and enjoy swimming with the sharks!
