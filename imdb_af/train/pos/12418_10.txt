This film and his successor Barry Mckenzie is his own, the two biggest comedies ever to be produced. A great story travels a young Aussie bloc to England to claim its heritage and meet with his friends, who are just as sweet and innocent as he is. <br /> <br /> That's a block of big words, where else can you find someone who needs such a drink that he is so dry as a dead thing? great characters, top acting, and it has good sheilas and more. Improve consumption then any other three movies together. Top notch. <br /> <br /> And some of the funniest songs you'll ever hear, and it's full of great celebrities. Definitely my two favorite movies of all time, I watch them at least once every two weeks.
