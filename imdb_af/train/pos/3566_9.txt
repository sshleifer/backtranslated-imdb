In 1954, Marlon Brando was the hot actor after his performances in Streetcar Named Desire and On The Waterfront. Frank Sinatra had not yet found himself on the silver screen. But Sinatra's portrayal of the then Nathan Detroit helped restore Sinatra to its supporters. <br /> <br /> It's a big screen version of a great game and the choices of leaders and fans are great. Imagine a movie where Brando sings? It was his only singing role when he portrayed Sky Masterson. In addition, the woman, Jean Simmons and Vivian Blaine (play her stage role as Nathan's long-suffering girl Adelade). Special mention goes to the great Stubby Kaye (as pretty beautiful), and with all due respect to Eric Clapton no one's version of Rockin 'The Boat even comes close to Stubby's. Sheldon Leonard, who will be known as TV producer of such shows as The Danny Thomas Show and The Dick Van Dyke Show, "Harry The Horse" wonders, BSPulley is excellent as the hard, moderate and rough "Big Julie" And even Regis Toomey offers his excellence as "Brother Arvide". <br /> <br /> It's one of the fun music to watch, good comedy, and you get Sinatra and Brando. Soooooo "Luck Be Woman Tonight" and brother ... "it's your dice"
