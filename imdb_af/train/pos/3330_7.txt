Not only was I an extra in this movie, I found it in Boston after a sell-out theater. More than a thousand Boston Red Sox / Farrelly fans rushed into a movie near Boston Common to watch a comedy .... about them .... Red Sox fanatics! Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon star are this cute comedy about love and lust. The love is between the two young lovers. The desire is for the Red Sox to win the world. Although Fallon is not a good actor, he is the best actor for the role. He's funny enough and gets the most laugh. Barrymore on the other hand is the same old Barrymore. Sometimes I felt supportive actress. Ione Skye would have been a better actor for the role. All the Boston Red Sox fans will all love this movie. For the rest of the world, it's just a funny movie.
