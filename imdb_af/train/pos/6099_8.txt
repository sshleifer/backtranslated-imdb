I still get grainy, late night, no cable, cheap VHS dubs from this waaaaaayyyy show back when, late-night advertising and all, when I would stay until what strange hour they would hit this show - just so I could this place. <br /> <br /> The series wasn't really about Freddy Kreuger - only the first few episodes involved him as nothing but a Rod Serling esquire presenter. Instead, every episode was a clear nightmare, using the traditional horror themes of horrific childhood, dating, cannibalism, dating, money, death, dating, and ... hmm ... dating. <br /> <br /> From the episode where a teenage boy accidentally says, "I'll love you forever" to the wrong girl and stuck with her (literally, at least for a moment, they grow together. ..) to the one where a young flight attendant goes home with a strange man, just to find her in his cabin, where he has a trophy room full of other flight attendants, and one I just vaguely remember comparing blind dates with hockey (and the injuries and penalties associated with it) definitely has the scariest thing in the series. <br /> <br /> One episode featured Jeffrey Combs (Re-Animator, etc.) as a motivated pizza trader with a nice new secret ingredient. Not original, but still creepy and fun .... <br /> <br /> However, some of the episodes were huge. My personal favorite was "It is an unfortunate life" where a young man is trapped in his parents' civil welfare when he wants to go to college. He talked to himself and did little puppetry with old cheeseburgers - until one late night when a strange man came through the ride and suddenly his life wasn't the same. No, not Freddy, just a rifle with a gun - it seems the whole mind episode is just the same - the last thoughts that go through the child's head ... with a bullet. <br /> <br /> The second half of the same episode (many of Freddie's Nightmares episodes were essentially two vaguely linked short stories), followed by his girlfriend, who was also wounded but not killed in the queue and being taken to hospital - they bump into all the nicest hospital nightmares, and then some - of coincidentally closing your mouth - or waking up during surgery - trying to lure your dead boyfriend into the mortuary for a little hug. /> <br /> Again, this was my favorite. <br /> <br /> Some of the episodes were much more dumb, like almost everyone who made them available on video. They put out the crumbs as representatives of the series, and no one likes it, thinks the performance stinks, and then they no longer put on video. It's a miserable life that's only available on PAL DVD in England - but I'm still going to buy it.
