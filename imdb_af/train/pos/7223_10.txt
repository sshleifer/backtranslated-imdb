The comparison with Sleuth, the earlier play-turn film, is obvious. At my first show, I also thought Sleuth was better, but at least Deathtrap had many more repetitions in it than Sleuth. <Br /> <br /> I bought Deathrap in the bargain at Wal-Mart and found it had Caine and the underrated Reeve and was worth $ 6. It was one of the best DVD purchases I could pick up. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best kept secrets that movie buffs are always delighted to discover. And it's totally worth seeing again. <br /> <br /> Although Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine turned in Bravo performances in Sleuth, I was double-impressed with Christopher Reeve as Clifford Anderson. Reeve, who is rightly associated with his now legendary depiction of Superman, stole the show in what had to be an Oscar-worthy show. I've always felt Reeve was a popular actor who didn't have much of a chance to pour out of the Superman movies and some other flawed but entertaining movies like Somewhere in Time, but this movie shows she potential was real. typing and using, thank you. <br /> <br /> I absolutely blessed Michael Caine's performance. He was glib, nice and manipulative and sadistic. And watch him work with Reeve and Dyan Cannon was an absolute pleasure. In fact, it was thanks to this movie that I came into a Michael Caine phase and started renting as much of his stuff as humanly possible. <br /> <br /> As for Deathtrap, there is plenty of juicy dialogue to fill its "memorable quotes" section. (Unfortunately much of the dialogue will inherently spoil the amazingly entertaining plot.) <br /> <br /> Talking about the movie is really hard without spoiling important plot points that are infinitely more fun to discover. Needless to say, this is a must-see. But for me it was the biggest and most rewarding blind purchase of all time. <br /> <br /> Repeated views are a must. <br /> <br /> And it deserves to be put on your DVD shelf with Sleuth. <br /> <br /> I'll leave you with this nice written quote from the movie: "I wonder if it wouldn't be ... well ... just a little thing that dies with me, for such a enter into risky and exciting collaboration ... where I can in no sense count moral obligation.
