Very funny movie. Classic movie funny Eddie Murphy of the 80's. I saw when I was a kid and I have a good memory. Murphy's classic irony fails, the movie is funny, well done. In the 1980s, Murphy made many films of action that represent him a way of joking about everything that is dangerous. The result can only be appreciated by some, but the 1986 film has been changed so far. The atmosphere for a movie of that time is good and the special effects are good for a movie of the period. A nice movie to watch and enjoy the taste of ironic Murphy, an actor who recently disappeared. The last part is anthologic, the lovely actor who plays the part of the Tibetan Monk. That's it.
