No hidden agenda. Pure scifi. All the fun. <br /> <br /> I saw the original on TV and was pretty bad. I was a kid :) <br /> <br /> The original can be more appreciated compared to the new one I have seen and forgotten. The original, starring Steve McQueen (BULLET), is by far the better and only version that everyone should see. <br /> <br /> The movie production is dated, but the fx has made the Blob stalls. The test of time. I was convinced that the thing was on its own. 10/10 <br /> <br /> -Zafoid
