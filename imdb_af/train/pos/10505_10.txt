Yes, that's right. I firmly believe that the N64 and the strange search controller are both designed, just like this game can be made. It was amazing the first time I saw it, with its huge environments and colorful characters, and it's amazing now. The game control is perfect, the graphics are beautiful, and it has that Nintendo charm that is always so intangible, but unmistakably there. A must have for any N64 owner, and a reason to get a N64 for everyone else.
