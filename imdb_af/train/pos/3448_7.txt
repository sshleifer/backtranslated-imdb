A documentary without a loss for words ... ever ... <br /> Let's assume the narrative is more than a spoof, let's assume it's a comment on Japanese society. And as this film fits as fast as an absurd documentary pace, the constant wordplay, so fast it goes, and translates as poorly as it is - is still very pleasant in its current festival show version as tonight in Copenhagen Cinematek . <br /> <br /> But for the patient, and ONLY the really patient and sincere, I talk to Jim Jarmusch fans with ADD repetitions. I believe it's a movie for you. It's an intelligent movie if you allow it to win you. <br /> <br /> Fairly beautiful, and very kitsch, and quite Japanese subculture. And quite experimental. Static 2D in a 3D world. All in all, Fun for those who want to see a Japanese movie spoof Japanese food culture. An inch when you're in the mood for something completely different.
