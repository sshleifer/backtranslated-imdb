The movie starts with Vincent Price to start his performance as a wizard. But in the middle of the very successful performance, the police came to him. His old boss seems to have praised him from the tricks he created - even those he made at home. As a result, justice justifies the evil man. The problem is that while the viewer understands why Price was murdered and probably thought it was a good thing, because Price was a bit crazy, he just couldn't stop at one (like eating Lay's Potato Chips) . <br /> <br /> The film was full of creative and spectacular magic (including a large circular saw and a crematorium for performances), great plot moves and exciting action. One thing you can't say about this movie is that it's boring. While it's also far from subtle, it's fun throughout, though and worth it. <br /> <br /> If I had never seen Vincent Price's version of HOUSE OF WAX, I would probably have wanted MAG MAGICIAN much more. and got it 8 or 9. This is because the MAD MAGICIAN is a great movie, reminiscent of the movie it preceded (HOUSE OF WAX). The bottom line is that since HOUSE OF WAX was so successful, the formula is back in the sequel. Both are made in 3-D, both have a plot where Price has every justification to kill, but he can't stop as soon as he's committed and both are great to watch. The biggest difference, and there is little, is that HOUSE OF WAX was in color and was more of a horror movie and THE MAD MAGICIAN was definitely more of a mystery. <br /> <br /> My advice is to watch this movie AND HOUSE OF WAX (Price version only). They are both awesome 1950's horror movies.
