I followed the trip two years ago on the internet - now I've seen the movie !! What a ride! And what a journey to finally get to know Darius Weems! Such a courageous, wise, funny and talented spirit! And what a crew! To listen to Darius who didn't laugh at Panama by the water, to be too close to alligators in Louisiana, was the wonder in his eyes as he was riding in a hot air balloon, the excitement of rafting through some rapids, eating a spoonful of wasabi, and calling the phone, and as always, boys will be boys. This film must be seen by everyone - young and old. Darius and his mother are models of power and courage. And the Crew members are wills to the heart of the younger generation. They got Darius a new wheelchair; they have documented accessibility issues; they took Darius on the journey of his life; and they touched many, many lives. Increasing the awareness of DMD and encouraging research funding will help to achieve the ultimate goal of Darius Goes West - a drug for DMD.
