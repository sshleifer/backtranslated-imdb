The first time I had the opportunity to see all but forgotten classics was back in the early 1980s, at one of our art houses as a revival. As I watched this fever dream of a 1930 sexuality exercise, I thought YOWZA! They returned with murder in Europe back in the day. Unfortunately, this movie was cut much in the original American release by the blue nose Hayes Office (the State Government Stage, started by the "saint than you" Bible dumper, Will Hayes ... a former Post Office official if you can believe it) , due to the overall theme of human sexuality (the forbidden people of heaven actually had sex in the 1930s). The plot of Ecstasy relates to a young woman (played by Hedy Lamarr) who marries a lot of older men, and later regrets it. She (Lamarr) meets an attractive younger man and has a relationship with him, which causes a divorce from a previous man (another no no in Hollywood movies, then --- divorce!). In spite of the fact that the film was produced in 1933, it was probably the director's first time in the audio format (ie the film seems to have techniques mostly used in silent films, 1920's expressionism). It is still worth looking for a window in early European pictures, along with Luis Bunuels L'Age Dor (1930) and Karl Gustav Dryer's "Vampyre" (1931). Not evaluated, but contains the notorious naive swimming scene and some thinly veiled sexual references. According to today's standards, it would be little more than a PG-13 (but if the dreaded 'X', back in the 30's, could easily land if it existed then)
