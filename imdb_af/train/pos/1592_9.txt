"What I love you" is definitely a show I couldn't wait to see every day. Amanda Bynes is such an excellent actress and I grew up to watch her performance: "The Amanda Show." She is a very funny person and looks like it's on earth. "Holly" is such a similar person and has an "out-there" personality. I enjoyed how she always turned things around and upside down, so she sometimes turned up. But that's what made the show so good. <br /> <br /> I especially loved the show when the character "Vince" took it. Nick Zano is very hot and funny, as well as 'Gary', Wesley Jonathan. The whole role was great, each character had their own personality and charm. Jennie Garth, Allison Munn and Leslie Grossman were all very interesting. I especially loved 'Lauren'; she is the best! She helped make the show extra funny and you never know what she's going to do or say next! Overall, the show is really nice, but the reason I didn't give it was 10 because there were no more new episodes and the episodes could be longer and deeper.
