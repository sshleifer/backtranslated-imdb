I love the movie, it was a very interesting fantasy movie b / c of the real meaning of the family in it, the history of our country, the fun action shown in the movie. I look at the time @ the top about 4 X's a week and I love it! I wish a sequel to see more of Susan's father in the past and see how Susan shares her new baby sister and had no phone, computers, gameboys or anything from the 21st century. I hope everyone enjoyed the movie as much as I did. I think you can say I'm a time on the top fanatic and I don't care. The lil boy in the movie Robert Lincoln Walker was simply adaptable. I wonder who he is and how old he is today. Does anyone know if he is playing about movies or TV shows?
