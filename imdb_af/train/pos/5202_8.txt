I just watched this version of "Samhain" and although I still like it, it's nothing like the "rough cut" version I have. When you check the message board, you'll see an apology from the director for this cut-off version, 79 minutes. And he says he has nothing to do with this R-rated disapproved editing with a completely new screwed end. Christian does not have to remove him so much, because the basic gore elements are still rising, although they are highly cut off. It's a pity because it had the potential to be one of the most beautiful and best-looking movies in the year. It still has pornstars, and the intestines, and some of the extreme gores can be seen at least in part. I'm just glad I got that "rough cut," for me it's a gem for any gorhound library. Christian Viel certainly has the skill and vision to deliver the goods, and hopefully his next project will be produced better. The idiots had a close classic in their hands and screwed it to everyone. "Samhain" could be one of the most controversial and mishandled horror movies ever, and too bad ghore didn't understand what the director was planning. <br /> <br /> *********** ******************************* ** Just as you know what you missed, this is my review based on SAMHAIN's "print". <br /> <br /> The movie runs a little over 90 minutes and has no chapter stops. There is absolutely NO music soundtrack, and some of the screens have no sound on the dialogue, because I think they are meant later. However, most of the movies have sound effects, and when an effect or scene is missing, a message appears as a cue for insertion when the movie is completed. That's exactly what it says, a "Rough Cut" BUT the only unhealthy version of "Samhain" you'll ever see. Reason, because the gore is very graphical, will allow much more than just an NC-17. Yes, there are some pornstars, but they are just there for the murder and to add some sugar and spices. The story is fairly standard, American tourists on a vacation in Ireland and ending in a house in the middle of the forest. An area that is heavy on folklore, with the ancient Druids and the celebration of Samhain, or as we call it Halloween. (creepy) <br /> <br /> The movie starts with a BIG dose of gore, as a camper is attacked by one of the local intestinal mutants. It's a big gore scene, as the man hangs his girl on a cliff and cries with her for help. All he saw was her head, arms and shoulders hanging in front of him, and when he pulled her up, she was completely cut in two. That's what I would call EXTREME GORE, with guts, blood and cut limbs all over the place. We are here in Herschell Gordon Lewis area, but the effects look much more realistic. I'm just going to overshoot the story because it's your standard stem and kill plot. <br /> <br /> The next gore scene is something to watch as the boyfriend of the first murder was taken to a cave like place (TCM-2 stuff), and tied to a table. This geek then cuts off all its limbs (off the camera, with a sign to place a scene), and then we see its upper body on a braai, slowly turning over a fire and the upper body has a hard can believe it). Yes, very bad taste, rough, gruesome, you get the right word, and it will probably fit too. <br /> <br /> Jenna Jameson, her beautiful body and all, is then cut from neck to cross. All her bowels are drawn into graphic secret, and her blood drains into a pot. Yummy, a real twist on? <br /> <br /> But the best gore scene happens inside the house, and I have to admit it's one of the best gore scenes I've seen. This man (no matter who) is caught from behind a geek, and cuts open at the hole. The geek then puts his hands in and rips all the guys' intestines, intestines, and what ever hell is there, right from his asshole. It goes on, because the man shouts and more and more is pulled out over the bathroom floor. It's so extreme, so over, that I laughed at myself. Of course, you will never see this scene on a proper DVD, IMO, along with most of the other really extreme gore scenes. <br /> <br /> So what to think of all these things. Well, although I doubt whether this movie will ever be released in this totally rough presentation, it makes this "Rough Cut" a rare gem for ghore. Yes, it's only a little difficult, with no soundtrack, a few scenes that need to be built in, and credits that are missing all the names. But it makes it so unique, and I won't do it now for anything. Extreme gore, yes yes, extreme extreme gore. It lets "Haute Spanning" look like a Disney movie.
