It was by accident that I scanned the TV channels and found this wonderful movie about two beautiful people who were attracted to each other in a very innocent and virgin approach to each other. Ethan Hawke (Jesse) "Tape" '01 and Julie Delpy (Celine) 'ER' 94 TV series (Nicole). This gall and guy will warm your heart and soul and make you think deeply in your relationships and how you really wish you followed your heart strings with an old or a person who has loved and lost you deeply . Jesse and Celine have good conversation and deep eye contact with a great magnetic explosion between the two. Looking forward to the SEQUEL for this movie in 2004 and watching this movie, you will feel the same way.
