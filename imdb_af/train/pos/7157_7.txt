This film is an entertaining, fun and quality movie. The film strictly follows the guidelines as the book, and tries to stick to the exact lines. The actors are all fit and you will expect them to be part. They use some well-known actors that have a great effect on the film. The graphics are a bit dodgy in some parts, and there are quite a few bugs throughout the film. For example, there is no Yellow Spotted Lizard. The camp is not as horrible as explained in the book, and they tend not to show as much as the book in the camp. All his group is mentioned a lot in the book, but is not in the film. Overall, a great movie for a rainy afternoon
