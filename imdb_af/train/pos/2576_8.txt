I'm from Christopher Reeve Generation. It is fair to say he was the best actor to play Superman, but it does not stop me from enjoying other role-players, and George Reeves makes a good chance of knocking Chris off the top, even though he hardly touches . It doesn't like me to enjoy this movie, it's a lot of it. It has everything a movie needs, a plot with start, middle and end, and all parts are intelligently written. The film is both in acting and storyline, something a movie noir but with tights. The story is exciting and meaningful, it's a movie with a message that's not too precious. I'm still surprised that it was shot in 12 days, oh the glory days of Hollywood, when we didn't have to wait 5 years to see if the movie would be in hell. The film was polished and expertly directed by Lee "Roll'em" Sholem, best known for directing with both speed and efficiency. It never slows down the limitations of technology. In fact, there are creative things being done to create the effect of flight, including placing a camera at a speed on a truck and quickly shooting and traveling fast to make it look like we see it from Superman his point of view, including a few close-ups of George in process, and a long shot of an animated Superman. <br /> <br /> It is now available on DVD as an extra feature on the first season of the George Reeves Television series. A DVD worth owning, including the film as its original whole, is icing on the cake. <br /> <br /> Bless God Today!
