This movie is beautiful. It is real and to the heart, but at the same time completely crazy. The characters are easy to fall in love with, because they have so many different thoughts, but at least we can refer to each one. In Canada, we don't have many films from Eastern Europe, and for the few I've seen, Loners is one of the best. It's very funny and magic. If you want to see something new and refreshing, check out Loners.
