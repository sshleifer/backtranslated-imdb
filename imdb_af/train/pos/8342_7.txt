Fairly good romantic comedy in which I don't think I've ever looked at Meg. All the players did a good job of keeping it alive. Of course, in the real world no brilliant mathematician will even see a few vetapies, but that's why I love romantic comedies .... one can completely forget the reality and have a good time. Nice movie. Damn, Meg is a baby, among other things?
