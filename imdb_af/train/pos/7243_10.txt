A brilliant Russian emigrant invents the Stanislavsky system to win on contract bridge - making him and his beautiful wife the GREAT SLAM love of America. <br /> <br /> What could have been just another silly soap opera was elevated by good production values ​​and excellent in the status of a very pleasant little comedy. A few unexpected touches are thrown in to observe the viewer's attention - the way the principle is thrown is introduced as covers on deck cards; introducing a silly acrobat into the plot for no other reason than enjoying a little laziness; and the way in which a wide variety of different Americans are transferred by listening to the broadcast of the closing game. <br /> <br /> Paul Lukas & Loretta Young are doing very well like the Bridge Sweethearts - Lukas Suave & Sophisticated and Miss Young passionately loving and beautiful (even if the writing blows her too much on a cigarette). They are nice to watch, even when their behavior is not always the most credible or compelling. <br /> <br /> Frank McHugh gives another good performance as a relentless cheerful ghost writer who adores Miss Young. The beautiful Glenda Farrell avoids her usual wisecracking persona in a small role as McHugh's ditsy gal pal. Roscoe Karns handles the quick conversation as a brash radio provider. Diminutive Ferdinand Gottschalk is wonderful as a snobbish bridge expert. <br /> <br /> Movie mavens will recognize Dewey Robinson as a warlike nightclub patron. Emma Dunn as a sob sister reporter; Paul Porcasi as owner of Russian nightclub; Charles Lane as a Russian waiter; and Jimmy Conlin as a kibitzer at the final bridge game - all unreasonable. <br /> <br /> The film uses the jaw for contract bridge that has been floating across the country since the 1920s. It expects the viewer to have a basic knowledge of the intricacies of the game and not try to explain anything to the uninformed.
