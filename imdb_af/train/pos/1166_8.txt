The huge and deadly bait hit Tony Arzenta (a divine smooth and command by Alain Delon) wants to stop the sneaky business, but the dangerous men he works will not allow him. After his wife and child were murdered, Arzenta declared open season at all responsible for their death. Director Duccio Tessari connects the absorbing story at a constant, funny pace, keeps a pretty serious and notable tone of voice, moves the exciting shooting matches and exciting motoring years with a considerable rip-snoring brio and punctuates the story with bursts of explosive bloody violence . Delon's suave and charismatic presence adds extra class to the overall performance. This film also benefits from upward-roll sterling, with commendable contributions by Richard Conte as the wise Mafia king-pin Nick Gusto, Carla Gravini as Arzenta's supporting lady, friend Sandra, Marc Porel and Arzenta's faithful pal Domenico Maggio, Anton Diffring as ruthless, calculation of capo Grunwald, and Lino Troisi as the poisonous gangster Rocco Cutitta. Silvano Ippoliti's bright cinematography boasts several graceful pans. Gianni Ferrio's funky score hits the get-down groovy spot. Erika Blanc and Rosalba Neri appear briefly in fine pieces. Better yet, there is no filler to talk about and we even get a really nice delicacy female nudity. The exciting conclusion catches a moderate and dipping flip right to the stomach. A solid and satisfying winner.
