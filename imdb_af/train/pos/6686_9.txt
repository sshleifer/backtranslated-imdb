This movie was a brilliant concept. It was original, cleverly written and of high attraction to those of us who are not really "conformists". Don't misunderstand me - there are some good movies that have a wide appeal, but if you move in a movie based on "everyone sees it" - you know you're a tween or have really an opinion. It had a beautiful subtle humor - despite the fact that most people just look at the obvious. The actors portrayed their characters and I thought there was a lot more "personal" personality in this movie. Call on children as well as adults. ESP. nice to find a good movie that is not filled with sexual references and drugs inside! A good movie, not overlooked, based on public consumption. This one is a must buy.
