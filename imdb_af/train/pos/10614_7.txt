Three girls (a female media clerk, including cult actress Barbara Bach, no less) visit a small town to cover a festival, renting rooms in a house they had to avoid like the plague. Well-made little shocker, who suffers a bit from some excess dialogue screens and a fairly thin line (it doesn't do very well to hide his secrets). An underlying theme in particular is pretty disturbing (like in: vintage shocks), and it's basically what the movie thrives on. Performances and filmmaking are pretty much compared to many other late 70's / early 80's in the same action), but what I really recommend is the rather long climax in the basement setting. From the moment the Keller Junior character was introduced, his performance opened my jaw and it didn't close to the end of the movie. A very pleasant surprise to see the actor Sydney Lassick, who was in 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest', and now totally demented in 'The Unseen', is one of the leading roles.
