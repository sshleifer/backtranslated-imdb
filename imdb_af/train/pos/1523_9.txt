GBS wrote its own screen adaptation of this Nobel Prize winners game, but did not live to see it (he won an Oscar in 1938 for his brilliant adaptation of his 1914 game PYGMALION). When Otto Preminger produced and produced this production in 1957 (seven years after Shaw's death), he pointed out that British writer Graham Greene did the adjustment. It was a solid choice. <br /> <br /> Take a hint of Shaw's own script, use Greene's stage stage epilogue to create a framework for the two plays of the play (one early and one late in Joan's story) report a unified and satisfactory whole. Where on stage is the shift in tone buffered with a break, here it works just as well with a return to KING Charles Balois's bedroom (where the man Joan sits on the throne, dreaming of the events that are in his current situation led) more material from Shaw's Epilogue - the launch of the shades of John Gielgud's Warwick (the English "King Maker"). <br /> <br /> The majority of the language is solid GBS and the performances of stalwart Shauvians (such as Felix Aymler's Inquisitor or Harry Andrews' de Stogumber) to the relative newcomers (the movie established Jean Seberg's career) is the first time. It may look a bit, just known by Richard Widmark's many movie chats, to see him playing a shrewd and somewhat dull Dauphin, but the performance - oddly highly photographed - is professional, albeit unlikely to fail. <br /> <br /> symbolism of the opening credits and the directors' choice to use the visual vocabulary of black and white filming, all serve Shaw and the story well. Go expecting quality entertainment and you won't be disappointed.
