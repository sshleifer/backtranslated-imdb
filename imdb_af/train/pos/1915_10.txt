This show is wonderful. I thought the two episodes where Paul died were so sad; I actually called out. But the other shows were wonderful; Kerry was my favorite character because she was on the dark side. I also thought Bridget was funny because she was all busy. I also thought the man Kyle had played was really cute. I loved it when Kerry made sarcastic comments about everything. The man Rory played was cute, and Paul, played by John Ritter, was really funny. This whole TV program is funny, and I wish they'd still shown it on TV. When they showed it on TV, I watched it every time. The next time it shows, I'll see it over and over again.
