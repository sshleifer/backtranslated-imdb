As a biographical film, "The Lady With Red Hair" (the story of how director / producer / playwright David Belasco separates the infamous society, Leslie Carter in an international stage), is definitely not in a league with the Other Warner's Similar Harvest Biopics, "Yankee Doodle Dandy" (which is?), but "Lady" is a pleasant movie in its own right - and shares a number of features in common with the Cagney classic. <br /> <br /> Like "Yankee Doodle Dandy", "The Lady With Red Hair" brims over with the old-time show-business scent. (Both films include nice theater lodges, as well as the inevitable plays that take place in the background and in the theatrical driver's offices.) In the "Lady" and in the Cohan biopics, the supporting scroll also consists of familiar and beloved character. actors of the period, everyone who works the kind of top-notch we remember for them. <br /> <br /> Should I add it again, such as "Yankee Doodle Dandy", "The Lady With Red Hair" doesn't leave the truth in telling a good story? But, like "Dandy", "Lady" succeed - glorious! - to convey the essence of his show-giant hero's greater-than-life personality. Everybody knows that Cagney Cohan sounded forever in his brilliant and loving portrayal in "Yankee Doodle Dandy", but few role players realize that Claude Rains has done a similar service for David Belasco in "The Lady With Red Hair". . with a pan almost equal to Cagney's. <br /> <br /> Rains-as-Belasco absorbs the legendary showman's galvanic personality in all its vast glory. Rains gives an incredibly pleasant, beautifully observed, and remarkable real life as the man Broadway ever called 'The Wizard'. To watch Claude Rains in action (look in every shot as if he has a good time!) In "The Lady With Red Hair" is to see David Belasco's life on film as if he can't wait to shake things up back on the main voice. <br /> <br />
