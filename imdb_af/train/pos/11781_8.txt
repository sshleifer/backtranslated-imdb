The documentary presents an original theory on "Guns, Germs and Steel". The series presents graphic representations of several episodes that strongly support the theory and defend the theory against general criticism. <br /> <br /> I was deeply surprised to get user comments complaining about the lack of new information in this series. They say documentaries provide information presented in high school. Indeed, do this. In fact, I really enjoyed the original look at the information I've known since middle school and the unexpected analysis. <br /> <br /> So, if you like to know WHY things work, if you've put the phone apart, try to determine how it worked if you went to the farm to see how farm work and how cows are milked, you will enjoy this range. A special recommendation.
