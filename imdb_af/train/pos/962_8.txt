I just finished watching this movie and I have to say I was so impressed. Everything about it was wonderful. The acting characters, the story. A promising child who has become brave, always willing to help others. His mother must be proud. I couldn't miss my movie out of fear of anything. This is the prefect fable / story with moral, cute and scary sprites and 'monsters', but still heartwarming people. A child plucked at the school and plundered what became a hero. Chosen to be a rider at the local village festival and a trip to the Goblin Mountain, where he discovered the Yokai, which is wonderful creations that Brian Froud will be proud of. And the evil Kato and his side who definitely needed a hug. These evil people catch the Yokai and throw it into a red pit along with unwanted objects, such as motorcycles and other mechanical things, and it records in one terribly violent robot monster whose only work is dead. Takashi, a young boy, is the one who saves them, next to a red man / dragon, a tortoise and a river princess, as well as a cute little creature who, if America was, they could put it in a sold candy and sales. These are pretty good toy stores. The lines are good, especially the ones not trying at home and other jewelry that bring a smile to your lips. Bury faith and watch it with a child or alone and enjoy! Although I have to admit that the end was a little bit sad. And not necessarily so. Cheers Furdion
