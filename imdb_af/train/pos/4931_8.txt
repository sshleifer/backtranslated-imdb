When the plague breaks out in New Orleans, it is Richard Widmark's salvation of Panic in the Streets, one of the lesser-known films of the great Elijah Kazan. Kazan keeps the pace alive, and there are many wonderful touches. The scenes between Widmark and Barbara Bel Geddes, who play his wife and the scene in the police station, show the family life and work life and the relationships of average citizens who are in sharp contrast to the lives and relationships of the low life represented by a threatening Jack Palance, his poor yes man, Zero Mostel, Tommy Cook and Louis Charles. There are also interesting visuals. Palance has a few scenes with actors appearing on his knees in height. <br /> <br /> The play is wonderful and the dialogue sharp if the story is not quite up. towards the direction and performances. It has some dubious aspects that the viewer will see very easily. It is also worth watching. Kazan was a master director.
