The movie adaptation of James Joyce's Ulysses is excellent. The actors, the ballot box, the direction, everything captures the feel of the novel without sacrificing its own merit. Milo O'Shea does an excellent job as Leopold Bloom, the chosen man married to the silly Molly. I absolutely love this photo.
