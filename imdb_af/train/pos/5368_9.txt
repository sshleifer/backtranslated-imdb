This is a great action movie with a great one by Arnie! It's made stylish, with lots of tense action to keep one happy. The characters were wonderful, and Richard Dawson was very threatening as the chief villain. Yes, it has many plot holes, but it is very entertaining, with a good end too. It also had a wonderful story, and Arnie and Maria Conchita Alonso had great chemistry together. Character development was also pretty good, with some excellent performances. Directing is great! Paul Michael Glaser does a very good job here, with great use of colors, keeping it stylish throughout, fantastic camera angles, and overall keeping the movie at a very fast pace! good work. There is a little gore. We get some bloody gunshot wounds, explosive head, cleft palpitations, bloody chain saw discs, skinless bodies, blood and impulse. The Acting is wonderful! Arnold Schwarzenegger is AMAZING as always, he is excellent in the acting department, has many hilarious one liners, kicks the ass and, as always, is a great physical presence! And it was fun to watch! (Arnie Rules!). Maria Conchita Alonso does well here, she was really cute, and has good chemistry with Arnie!. Yaphet Kotto is decent here, with what he has to do, which is not much. Marvin J. McIntyre, is good like the geeky type guy, he was cool! Richard Dawson is wonderful as the chief villain, and was very threatening, and he was nice to watch. Jesse Ventura, Jim Brown, Erland of Lidth, Gus Rethwisch, and Professor Toru Tanaka, all do what they have to do very well than the stalkers. Overall a MUST see! **** 1/2 of 5
