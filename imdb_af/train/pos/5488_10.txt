A case to be in the right place at the right time. What a fascinating movie. It's easy to see why Chavez is so popular with his people. He gets things done. He is accessible. And it's also easy to see why the west hates so much. He has control over the resources of his country and returns the profits to the people. Mostly the poor. And it's easy to see how the TV stations can portray deceptive images to the cause. Just like the war in Iraq, or the war on terror. Or those who are missing WMD's. Or how about the ashes of evil. People need to wake up. And get different views. Stop the neo disadvantages that rule the world. Check out this movie with an open mind. And raise your own thoughts. Then I suggest you see Aaron Russo's: America: Freedom to Fascism. It's not the people of America who are the problem. This is the government.
