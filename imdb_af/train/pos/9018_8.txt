Despite the low key release in this country, and its apparent negligence in other countries (the R score in the states couldn't have helped - honestly, just because HBC is using the C word!), This is actually a fine work. The sentimentality sometimes threatens to choke it, but it is overcome by playing the two clues. <br /> <br /> Plaudits are easy to win just because you play a physical or mental cripple (Daniel Day-Lewis, Geoffrey Rush, Dustin Hoffman, etc.), and Helena Bonham-Carter can do the physical decline not really catching up with EMS, but her vocal stretch and relentless emotional ride totally compensate. In fact, almost all of her performance is performed by her eyes (and what eyes!). It's an intelligent turn of an actress who quickly removes her English Rose reputation, and emerging as a figure of some form. Branagh, one feel, has never given his best on film (except possibly "Hamlet," and his game is thinned by the big cast). Here, however, he bowls his other appearances, plays a self-giving, unstable, ultimately sweet man with a subtle that he has not always displayed, showing both intelligence and depth. In short, we believe him, as much as we could not believe him as Frankenstein as the priest in 'The Proposition', as the lawyer in 'The Gingerbread Man', like Andrew in 'Peter's Friends'. This is surely his best performance yet - so why couldn't he produce the goods much earlier? <br /> <br /> As a movie, it looks more like a television show, and without its stars it probably won't. But it was a pleasure to see that these guys finish their socks like this and I wait more from them (though not 'Love's Labor's Lost'). 8 out of 10, but Branagh and HBC get 10 out of 10.
