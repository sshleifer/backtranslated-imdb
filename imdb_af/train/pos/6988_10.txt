It's a movie that will take time to get out of your head once you've seen it. The dialogue is close to perfect, which can be expected as it is adapted from a play. The actors just give their best, the story is simple and attractive. 88 minutes of pure bliss! <br /> <br /> Yvan Attal is completely credible in his role, Sandrine Kiberlain is still the beautiful blonde (but not so stupid) that the ears, Jean-Paul Rouve offers an excellent approach to total jerk ( and proud to be so, and Marina Fois is the stupid friend who always blunder when you least expect. <br /> <br /> Thumbs up to Bernard Rapp and associates for customizing this great game, and all the best for future productions! <br /> <br /> I wish there was more of this in current production. If you like, you'll probably also enjoy: "Un air de famille" and "Cuisine et dependances". Both were written and played by the couple Bacri / Jaoui.
