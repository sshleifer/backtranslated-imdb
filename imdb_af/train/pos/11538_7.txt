Felix Unger (Jack Lemmon) has just been immersed by his wife because he is one of the worst neurotic people in the world. Suicide is his way out, but he can't do it, so he goes to his friend's house. Oscar Madison (Walther Matthau) has also recently been divorced and living in the undergraduate sky. Smoke, gambling, hitting chicks, eating out and never cleaning, is paradise for him. Well, with the suicide attempts Oscar decided to let Felix move. Initially it is a game made in heaven. Felix cooks and cleans, and helps Oscar pay his alimony in time, but soon Oscar women for women and Felix (who in the world would probably be gay today) are not ready to continue. They invite a few British birds and they find Felix so soft that they and Felix cry and talk about his family life and deny Oscar. That's it, he explodes and throws him out, but Felix isn't as helpless as it seems, and soon he'll be the one. My favorite quote "You leave my little ones on my pillow. I told you 158 times I can't put small notes on my pillow." We are all from cornflakes. FU "Took me three hours to find out F.U. was Felix Ungar!" Based on a Neil Simon play (which also wrote the screenplay), it felt a certain theater. Imagine the repartee and body feel very playful (for better or worse). Lemmon and Mathau have excellent comic chemistry and appeared in the Grumpier Old Men movies and Out to Sea, giving the same finicky / slob roles, but with different names (to avoid royalties, I'm sure). <br /> This movie is like strawberries dipped in chocolate. The chocolate is smooth, sweet and rich, the strawberry is tart, juicy and bright red (unless you get those nasty vegetables). They are almost polar opposites, but together the contrasts pull each other out and make a wonderful dessert. 7/10 <br /> <br /> http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies
