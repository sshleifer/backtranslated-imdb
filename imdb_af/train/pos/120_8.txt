It's not every movie's job to stimulate you superficially. I will hit an ambitious failure any mass market any day. Although it cannot really be described as a failure, the sum of its parts remains ambiguous. This unlimited quality allows me to watch it again and again. It's a challenging, challenging movie that isn't neatly decorated. The problem with the film is in its structure. The insoluble plot appears to be liquidation, just as a second termination is attempted. Though everything is technically brilliant, the film is exactly too long through that unit. The long delayed climax of Leo's awakening is about 20 minutes late. <br /> <br /> Large cinematography often comes at the expense of a decent screenplay, but here the innovative camera technique offers a multitude of visual ideas. The constituent artwork is challenging and attractive; A character is back projects, but its own hand is in the foreground. The world depicted is deliberate, treacherous and absurd. Keep your eyes peeled for an unforgettable, technically surprising assassination that drops your jaw. <br /> <br /> The compositions are beautiful. Whoever chose to release the (out of print) videotape in the pan & scan format should never have seen it. Where is the DVD? <br /> <br /> It is incomprehensible how someone can give such a badness a bad review. You should see it at least once. You get the feeling that von Trier is more bitter than he could chew, but this movie gets richer for it. I suspect he is familiar with Hitchcock's Foreign Correspondent, in which devastating Europeans also manipulate an American dude and several Welles movies that are as much as he likes in the technique. All von Trier films explore the fate of the naive amid unforgiving societies. After Zentropa, von Trier turned away from this kind of rushed technical experiment into urgent, overvalued, unseen juice such as Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark.
