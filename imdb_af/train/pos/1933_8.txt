This indie movie looks at the lives of a group of people taking an adult swimming class in Connecticut. The plot is pretty thin. What drives the movie are the characters that are played by well-known actors. Standouts in the movie are Brewster as a high school teacher experiencing marital problems and Weixler as a casino retailer who is moonlighting. The two actresses provide natural performances and work well together. This is an impressive film debut for writer Schechter and director Setton. The latter keeps the story moving against a quick clip. The movie title and poster suggest something racial, but it is a wonderful, small comedy drama.
