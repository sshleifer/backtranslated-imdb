I was very moved by the story and because I was going through something similar to my own parents, I really connected. It's so easy to forget that somebody whose body failed, was once lively and passionate. And then there are the mistakes they made and have to live with. I loved Ellen Burstyn's performance and who is Christine Horne? She is fantastic! A real find. There is probably the most erotic scene I've ever seen in a movie, but nothing has been shown. It's just as beautiful. Overall, the appearance of the movie was wonderful, a real emotional journey. Cole Hauser is very good at this picture, he humanizes a man moving downwards. I like the way the filmmaker approached this woman's life, never sentimental, never too much - just enough to catch up, but not enough to fall.
