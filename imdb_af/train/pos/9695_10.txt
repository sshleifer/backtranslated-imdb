Some people call Paulie a children's movie, but I want to claim that it is more than that. Probably more than anything else, this movie is successful in showing the fate of immigrants in the United States - actively given the recent debates. A parrot tells of a Russian immigrant writer (Tony Shalhoub) about how he sought America for his original owners, telling the movie several stories. There is the elderly woman (Gena Rowlands) with whom he is a friend, then a Mexican immigrant (Cheech Marin), and others. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a very good movie. I don't usually expect much of these movies, but this one is a surprise. I definitely recommend it. Also with Jay Mohr, Buddy Hackett, Bruce Davison, Hallie Eisenberg and Trini Alvarado.
