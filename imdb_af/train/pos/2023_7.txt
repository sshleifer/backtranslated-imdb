Spoilers ..... <br /> <br /> I actually watched the original on TV and remember this production as less gripping than most Beeb costume drama. I watched DVD this week and still have the same impression. It is a good story, but weakened when the heroine became so terribly brave and noble and returned to her very dirty man when he was sick and I was so irritated with her holiness. I think it was the "right thing to do" when the story was written, as well as a lot of anxiety, and it was difficult for a woman to be independent of her husband, as marriage no longer made her own not, let alone scandal with a lover, as I expect many of the modern audience would like to see. But it's hard to take santimoniousness today and especially when this heroine had a strong, brave admirer to defend her from anyone and everyone. So the story as in the movie is equivalent. This is well done according to the novel, but somewhat annoying as it was today's kind of life. <br /> <br /> Standing hero Gilbert was definitely a saint to engage in his feminine love's variable and often cryptic behavior and sustained self-denial and to be so consistently supportive. So I felt very sorry that when Helen was finally free to be with him, the writing didn't drop him more than one minute, so she could get a quick hug before the titles arrived. It was completely ridiculous when we had been waiting for all the drunken sentiment about the undeserved man for a decent bit of dialogue and a good embrace between hero and heroine. Instead, the end was as if the filmmakers walked out of time or finances or just couldn't be bothered. "Here you are - one minute, do what you can in that, then cut if the director wants to go home ..." I was completely dissatisfied. <br /> <br /> But very high praise for the play by Toby Stephens a perfect and very attractive hero, and Rupert Graves a very nasty and self-pitying villain. Tara Fitzgerald was satisfactory in the context of the script that forced her to be a depressing and rather holy victim so much of the time. <br /> <br /> It says I love these classic dramas and virtually everyone is a see better than many of the "modern" drama on TV these days. So 7 stars, because despite the irritations it is still a good look.
