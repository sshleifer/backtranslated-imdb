Each of the big studios pulled jazzy one reels throughout the thirties and forties (led by Universal). While most looked like cheap on the screen, Warner Bros (who suddenly stopped making them in 1946) underestimated themselves with alternating camera angles, mirrors and optical effects, thanks to some creative directors such as Jean Negulesco. It is fitting that the best of this genre comes from this studio. <br /> <br /> What sets Jammin 'The Blues' apart from the rest of the pack is that it looks closer to an avant-garde experiment than a Hollywood musical. Filmed in July 1944, it transforms an ordinary jam session into a "trippy" dream escape from war-time trouble, highlighted by the song "On The Sunny Side Of The Street". Gjon Mili and cameraman Robert Burkes (later with Hitchcock) allowed a lot of artistry, perhaps because Lester Young was not Glenn Miller and the studio could give less how he and his fellow musicians were presented. The optical printer is well used, with several images from the same exporter appearing simultaneously. (Norman McLaren milked this process two decades later in Pas De Deux, while Linwood Dunn's team achieved different effects in Citizen Kane.) The strong emphasis on silhouette and cigarette smoke was also ahead of his time; In some respects it preceded the psychedelic sixties, but with a distinct forty-film-noir style.
