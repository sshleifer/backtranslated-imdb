It was one of the best movies I saw. The film is about real life and how drugs can play a big role. Although this movie appears to be produced from a low budget, I found it exciting to watch. <br /> <br /> Some people do not like the story and say the script is missing direction. However, when a person gets such drugs as these characters, there is no direction life is. I feel this movie is an accurate representation of what can happen to a person if they are confronted with extreme temptations. <br /> <br /> Most of the role players are newcomers to the industry. But they all pulled it off very well. Everyone seemed to do their job well and get it appropriately in character. <br /> <br /> I think this movie can be a great tool to use when a person or loved one is involved in drugs and appears to be spirally out of control. This movie just scares them to change their ways.
