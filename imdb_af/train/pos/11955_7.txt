Allow yourself to transport to another, old school kind of storytelling. Scoop is the classic Woody Allen. <br /> <br /> Allen's latest muse, Scarlett Johansson (who also appeared in last year's Match Point, also by Allen), is surprisingly able to enforce her sultry sex kitten appeal and turn it into a an ordinary, kiss-type student using nerdish glasses and outfits, but still failing to make the audience believe how Hugh Jackman's lordly character can be beaten by her, given the royal background (don't worry, no spoilers here not). There are no major transformations for Johansson's character here, as she consistently plays the same character throughout the writing. You even forgive her character's apparent lack of logic and remain a relationship with an alleged serial killer, simply because he is his Royal Hotness Jackman, which is refreshing to see the Wolverine duds. <br /> <br /> If anything, consistency is what the 70-year-old Allen is about. He continues to tell his stories on celluloid, as he always has; as if he had never been exposed to the modern film, which would probably make his silent, simple films attractive. They never look to a specific market; as if Allen were making movies alone, or liked the public or not.
