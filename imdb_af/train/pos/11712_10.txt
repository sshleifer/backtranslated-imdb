It's such a wonderful movie "Call Me Anna", because it shows how you suffered so long without knowing what was wrong with her. For Patty Duke to come out in the public eye and tell her story is an inspiration to those who suffer from this disease. I have a lot of respect for her as a person. The only thing I don't like is that I can't get it on tape, I tried to find it, but with no success. Anyone know how to get it?
