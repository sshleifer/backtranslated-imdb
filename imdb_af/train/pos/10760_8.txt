"9/11," hosted by Robert DeNiro, presents video footage on September 11, 2001 and within the Twin Towers in New York. <br /> <br /> Never too creepy and stingy, but powerful and moving. "9/11" is a real surprise. Anyone who has not been moved by this television program is immune to anything. <br /> <br /> 5/5 stars - <br /> <br />
