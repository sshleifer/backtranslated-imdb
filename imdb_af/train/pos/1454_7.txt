I've been waiting from this movie for a long time since I saw the trailer, which made it look like a political drama, with three of my favorite actors. Al Pacino, John Cusack, and Bridget Fonda. And though it was directed by Harold Becker, who did uneven work, he and Pacino combined SEA OF LOVE, which falls under each of their best work. But interference at a certain level (to start, several of the screens in the original trailer do not appear in the movie) and the change of tone (resulting trailers make it like a thriller) make it while alert, nowhere near it could be. <br /> <br /> What is too bad, because I wanted this movie. There was great potential to be a movie about how government can still be worth it despite all the corruption, and to make a complex statement about corruption, not the usual good guys against bad guys. And there's a good thing here. Pacino and Cusack are both very good, and Danny Aiello gives one of the best shows of his career. But Fonda is wasted in her role, nothing to do, and while there is a merit in the central storyline, it is changing to a thrill. The movie is losing its way, recovering briefly in the last scene between Cusack and Pacino and then falling completely in the end. I wish I could do it more, but no.
