The only reason I knew about Midnight Cowboy was because it was in the AFI criticism's Top 100. For a top 100 it's not a very famous movie; Indeed, I had to look hard to get a copy, I got the DVD version for about half price. Surprisingly, it was just M15 + (the uncut version). <br /> <br /> I doubt that much of this review will take notice (more like commentary) so I will make it short. <br /> <br /> It may be one of the strangest movies I've seen, partly due to the use of montages, artistic filming (lots of art houses) and the unusual theme. There are many things in the movie that I have not yet understood (I have seen it twice), and it makes for an emotionally confusing film. <br /> <br /> The filming and acting was very good, and it's the bigger than life characters that make this movie unforgettable. The main character is Joe Buck, a Texas cowboy who moves to New York to become a male prostitute. He meets the lame Enrico 'Ratso' Rizzo and, of course, their friends get through the ordinary escapes. What makes the film interesting is that the two characters are so different. <br /> <br /> I felt the movie didn't develop the relationship between Buck and Enrico Rizzo, because the audience has a real emotional connection, though the end is definitely quite sad and tragic. You probably already know what happens by reading the reviews, but it is obviously from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Personally, I think the movie looks beautiful and strikingly about its main themes. The deprivation of mankind (shown by the darkness of the city streets, the breakdowns). Most characters in the movie are out of the law (a conman, giggolo.etc), but you can't help them. Joe Buck is engaging because he is so naive and optimistic while we later feel Ratso in the movie. <br /> <br /> I think the movie was so highly rated because it was definitely very groundbreaking for its period. At the moment (and even now) it was definitely not a typical movie (lots of art house). At a time when the cinema was dominated by tired Western, musical and dramas, a film with such an unusual theme as Midnight Cowboy appeared. <br /> <br /> On a personal level, I must say I liked the movie. The images conveyed a dreamy quality. I especially liked the scene at the party, the music, the images, etc. Keep in mind for a long time after looking. But as a movie for entertainment, it was a bit lacking (not really my style of movie) in excitement. It is a movie that is enjoyed and appreciated, rather than a cheap exciting action movie. <br /> <br /> Although I would hardly consider analyzing this movie, the characters and their motifs were very interesting. From what I understand from the flashbacks, Joe Buck is sexually abused as a child by his grandmother, although it still doesn't seem relevant to the story. He is a happy young stud suppressing his dark memories. The religious connotations in the film are also mysterious. Some suggested a homosexual connection between Buck and Ratso, although I didn't see where they got the idea. The theme of gay sexuality in general is more than touched in their conversation, and later in Joe Buck's encounter with a lonely old man, but it has little to do with the main story. Certainly, from a technical point of view, one of the best films of the decade (it has more than a 70s feel like a 60s feeling) and revolutionary for the time it touches on subjects that dare to have other films. While it has a simple, sentimental story (disguised by a hard edge), the beauty of the film is in the strange, often psychedelic, sequences.
