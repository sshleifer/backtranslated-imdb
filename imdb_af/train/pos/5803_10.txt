Wow, I forgot how good this movie was until I stumbled upon it as I looked through the garage. It's a kind of weird combination of a Michael Jackson bio, a collection of musical vignettes, and a story about a superhero fighting to save some little kids. The vignette is good (especially Speed ​​Demon), but the best part of this movie is the superhero segment, in which Michael Jackson gets into a car, a robot and finally a spaceship (and it's just as strange as it sounds ). Joe Pesci is hilarious and has plenty of cold images and good music to entertain all the time! <br /> <br /> The real jewel, however, is the amazing Smooth Criminal video, which makes the movie worth the possession of that part alone!
