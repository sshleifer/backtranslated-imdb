I enjoyed this movie so much that I watched it twice and it's something to say about a documentary. The musical score, cinematography and sound are absolutely stunning as you expect from an Imax production. Although it's shot for the big Imax theaters, it looks and looks great on my home system. In fact, it will make a perfect DVD to demo your system. <br /> <br /> The subject is so fascinating. It's about Mario Andretti and his son Michael. I was already a fan of Mario because he is the best racing car in history, as he is the only person to win the CART Championship, F1 Championship, The Daytona 500 and the Indianapolis 500. The script follows the path of two cars that are very important to the father and son. The first car is found in a chicken coop and seems to be the first star ever to drive Mario and we follow recovery after shining perfection. The other car is Michael's new racing car and we follow it to cut the shape through the cleaning season. Imax just lends the right magic to make motor construction entertaining and fascinating. <br /> <br /> Paul Newman, the team owner of Michael Amoretti when the film was made, tells the movie. His anecdotes and whitishism, which has been drawn as owner and manager for many years, gives much to production. <br /> <br /> The main feature is the screens. Turn on the volume here! There is something to drive along at over 200 mph and the musical score that puts you in the spotlight for an experience you won't forget. Wow! <br /> <br /> The final magic element is the humanity of the Andretti family. This god of the racing world, Mario Andretti, loves dad who is proud of his son's career. They work so well together that every father and son should see it. You can say they're a close family. I wish we could all have that experience.
