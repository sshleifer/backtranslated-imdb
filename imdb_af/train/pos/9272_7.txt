It was the first of Panahi's films I saw, I saw it at the Melbourne Film Festival. I am completely absorbed by the different characters he creates and how different they react and behave in comparison to Aussie children and on the same level. I think maybe if more people can see such movies, they can see people as individuals and avoid racism that can often be fueled by the fear of the unknown. There are clear political differences between the Oz culture and Iranian culture, but I have found the more subtle differences between the characters, that this film is so successful on the screen, extremely fascinating. There are envy in the characters that look to me, so unique. I found it made the characters compelling viewing.
