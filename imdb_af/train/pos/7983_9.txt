It's hard to top this movie in several ways. Everything works really well here; The casting, acting, mini-dissertation and filmmaking are all of the best quality. For the film maker, it is a moving, violent story of love and human salvation. For the film critic there are many sharp techniques and technical merit. There are a few tactical blunders, and as discussed on the boards, the end does not have realism if one has strictly formal with the CIA agent's practice angle. However, I ended up moving more because of the fact that, rather than pursuing the CIA agent's pragmatic approach, Creasy basically rates its soul at the Ultimate, without considering the consequences. Like Jesus himself, Creasion becomes superhuman by his sacrifice, or it actually makes pragmatic sense or not. In any case, I appreciate that Creasy gets rid of the conventional bourgeois morality and only the bad guys pick one by one in his methodical quest for justice, which actually leads to salvation for himself and the innocent. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this movie is well worth checking out if you are attracted to the genre. An excellent soundtrack, good writing, flawless casting and solid performances across the board make it a top-100 (or better) movie.
