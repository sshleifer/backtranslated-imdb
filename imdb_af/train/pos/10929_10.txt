One of the more enjoyable aspects of the Asian cinema (or, indeed, most things done outside of this saint than in the United States) are the emerging permutations. For example, in World War II, Japanese manga (comics) is a truly endless variety of subjects. Many are handled in a unique, imaginative way. The same thing also happens in genre file editing; Yet again I refer to movies made outside the U. (where we are just too "sophisticated" in our close minds to appreciate something that is not about or by the US). For example, would an American company not be one, but a series of movies with a masked professional wrestler (El Santo) or a werewolf (Paul Naschy) or a real martial artist (Bruce Lee) ...? As for television, forget about it. While I still love the KUNG FU series that the late David Carradine died, I have always felt that the American version of Asian martial arts was - how to make it friendly - a little lacking. To date, there was no pay-per-view channel to play Asian martial artists playing Asian martial artists in Asia. (There are many soft core pornographic shows, but the so-called Action Channel, for example, has not yet introduced a True Martial Arts teleseries.) a group of martial artists who were more or less involved in a murder mystery: THE 5 DEATH VENOME. In its own right, it is as fascinating as any other genre-based whodunit (western, police show, etc.). This martial arts masterpiece stands out as a really better piece of work. It's now available at Dragon Dynasty and the print is beautiful and the DVD commentary by Bey Logan is actually the kind of intelligent, thorough analysis that these gems really deserve. If you are a martial artist, you remain: one of the best movie genres of all time (specifically the martial arts movies of the 1970s and early 1980s) gets a long, very second life on DVD.
