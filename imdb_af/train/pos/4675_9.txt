I saw the "Brother's Shadow" at the Tribeca Film Festival and thought about it two days later. The story of a lost son (Scott Cohen), who returns to prison after returning to his family's personal furniture case, offers all the necessary features of a solid drama - memorable characters; sharp, striking dialogue; Sensitive use of the camera by a movie maker who thinks visually. <br /> <br /> But more than that offers something that is too much in multiplex: the uncompromising vision of a mature sensibility. The talent of director-writer Todd S. Yellin seems to be blown away, but we get the sense that he (like his protagonist) paid his contributions. He knows how true people in this world are struggling, and he knows how we want to see - or at least to be successful - success. Yet Yellin respects his audience too much to blow up happy smoke on our back points. Eventually we see that Jake's victory is not in commissions, or even in his family's reputation, but in the work he cannot do if he has tried. <br /> <br /> It is an essential theme in a world (and especially a film industry) that cannot rise above the bottom line. This movie deserves a wide audience.
