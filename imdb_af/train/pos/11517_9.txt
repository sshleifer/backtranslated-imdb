If you enjoy Cleese and all the British 'Pythonesque' humor of the time, then this jeweler is absolutely hilaries. <br /> <br /> Arthur Lowe is a real surprise! <br /> <br /> I saw it with friends on TV when it first came out, and its classic quotes have been part of our jokes for 30 years and will do forever! I have it on tape and it is constantly appreciated. <br /> <br /> Maybe some reviewers do it too seriously. <br /> <br /> I can't believe it's just available in the US (of course, NTSC), and not in the UK, where it must be an essential part of British humor history!
