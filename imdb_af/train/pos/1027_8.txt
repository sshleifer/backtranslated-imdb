I'm not great at writing reviews, so I'll just eject my opinions ... <br /> <br /> I loved this series initially. The adventure, the action, the comedy, the drama ... I thought it was all brilliant. Anderson, Tapping, Shanks, Judge, Davis ... I loved them all. Davis, it turns out, was the fifth most important person in the cast. Not a big problem. But when his character (General Hammond) left at the end of the seventh season, and Anderson's character (Colonel O'Neill) moved from the field to the office, the quality of the series suddenly fell off a cliff. I don't know if it was because Hammond was more important to me or what, but for some reason, after the seventh season, the series turned to ****. <br /> <br /> The first seven seasons, though, were awesome. The movie Stargate was mediocre the first time I saw it, but it was, even if it was not the original intent, a brilliant set-up for the series. I recommend watching the movie first, then watching the first season of the TV show and watching the movie again (you'll appreciate it the second time, believe me) and then watch the rest of the TV series . <br /> <br /> The last three seasons of the series aren't nearly as good as the first seven, but that doesn't mean they're not good. It just means they are a devastation if you have been devastated for the first seven seasons. <br /> <br /> After completing this series, watch the spin series, Stargate: Atlantis. It is a worthy successor to this brilliant series. <br /> <br /> EDIT on 7/18/08: I just noticed that Don S. Davis died a few weeks ago. It's a big loss.
