Gene Kelly performed with some great ideas for musical while he was with MGM. Here he is at the top of his creative forces working with the Arthur Freed music department. Hard to believe if you look at an American in Paris, the players never left their backs at MGM. <br /> <br /> The magic of an American in Paris is due to the creative editing led by Vincent Minnelli and the sets designed by MGM, blended with a backdrop that sets shots. The idea of ​​the film originated with Kelly who just wanted to make a film with a long ballet sequence that includes George Gershwin's poem poem An American in Paris. It was good for Arthur Freed, who approached Ira Gershwin who told him well as long as they used other Gershwin material. <br /> <br /> Gershwin got the kind of deal for Gershwin music that Irving Berlin normally has. Not a single note of non-Gershwin music is heard in An American in Paris. Listen to some of the background music and you'll hear things like Embraceable You and But Not For Me that aren't real musical numbers. <br /> <br /> Another guy who has a fair hand writing lyrics, Alan Jay Lerner, wrote the story which is a thin one. Everything about an ex-GI played by Gene Kelly who never left France after World War II, only settled in an apartment on the Left Bank and continued to become a hungry artist. He lives with eccentric composer Oscar Levant and it sounds like a redundant one. <br /> <br /> Two women are interested in him. Another expelled American played by Nina Foch who wants to sponsor him as a painter if he returns in other matters. But Kelly falls for a shop girl who is played by Leslie Caron in her film debut. Caron also interested in the musical comedy star Georges Guetary. <br /> <br /> Of course, the plot is just an excuse to sing and dance to the music of George Gershwin. An American in Paris is the first movie I have ever seen as a flight film on the first plane trip I have ever taken. I still remember returning from Phoenix Arizona to Kennedy Airport since Gene Kelly had my rhythm. My favorite song in the movie, however, is Tra-La-La, who sings Kelly and dance over the apartment with Oscar Levant playing the piano. At one point, Kelly dances on top of the baby piano. <br /> <br /> In a book about Arthur Freed I read a quote where he said in American in Paris, the ballet order had to be done with the backdrop of The French Impressionists that he felt the public would rather take a realistic setting on the streets or back. So it happened. Kelly did long ballet order in Words and Music, The Pirate and In The City. But this one covered them all. Still in my opinion this includes some of Gene Kelly's later films. <br /> <br /> In a surprise disorder at the Oscars, an American in Paris was chosen the best picture for 1951 and called the heavily favored A Streetcar. desire. I suspect that fantasy is trumpet realism that year. Big budgets also prevail in these things. <br /> <br /> Another American in Paris is one of the best movie musicals ever done and since the studios no longer have that creative talent under one roof, slightly less likely to be repeated.
