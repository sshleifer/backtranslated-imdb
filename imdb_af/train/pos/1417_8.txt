I saw this movie with my family and it was wonderful! This movie is more than just a documentary (no more than cold facts) with long mono-duologues and lots of maps ... The full "power" of this movie comes from the impressive pictures filmed underwater in the air or the Arctic. With this movie you can learn more about our planet than just reading a book, it shows that we are embedded in the cycle of life. This movie is not just for "environmental fanatics", although people who want to see a good movie with a message should see it. This movie taught me that we are not just living on the earth ... we live with and through the earth and all plants and animals grow and die with us.
