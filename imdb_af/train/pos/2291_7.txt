Probably the two most important meanings of "Elmer's Pet Rabbit" are that the wacky leprosy that appears in "A Wild Hare" now has a name, and that he announces his famous. "Of course you realize it means war!" for the first time. Mostly, the Termite Terrace crowd is still trying to find out exactly what this long-ear rascal is all about. This is definitely a must see for hard-core fans of this genre, but others will probably have little reason to take interest. <br /> <br /> But don't make a mistake, it's hilarious that Bugs Bunny does to the eternal bodies Elmer Fudd. Clear shades of things to come across the whole cartoon. I recommend it.
