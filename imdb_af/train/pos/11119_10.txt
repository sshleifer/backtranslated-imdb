There are so many reasons why I judge the soprano so high, one of his biggest triumphs is the role and character building. Each character unfolds more and more each series. Each series also has a variety of 'small time characters' as well as headers. A good example of a character (which was only in three episodes), for which you can feel, is David, the compulsive player, played brilliantly by Robert Patrick. Every little detail builds the perfect TV series. The show turns around, Mr. Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini), who tries to balance his life with crime with his role as father of two. The show is not afraid to be brave and powerful with its dialogue and images and it makes it so credible. While Tony does business with Capos Paulie (Tony Sirico) and Silvio (Steve Van Zant), his cousin Christopher (Michael Imperioli) is looking for a promotion. Every episode also has Tony's other family in one way or another, including his children and wife carmela soprano (Edie Falco). On top of these problems, his uncle Junior soprano (Dominic Chianese) is trying to get what he can from Tony's businesses, although he is under house arrest. All the plays are powerful and complex characters, but the two that stand out most are; James Gandolfini who is 'Tony Sopran'. Also, Michael Imperioli, who plays Christopher, represents the younger (20-30) generation in crime. If David Chase did not create this masterpiece, modern caliber TV dramas could not have existed, such as The Wire and Dexter. So Sopranos is definitely Godfather, Goodfellas and Pulp Fiction from TV
