I have zero interest rap and in the ghetto culture, I'm white and like classic rock, but it didn't stop me from appreciating this fantastic comedy. It's pretty much a sequel to this is spinal tap in the sense that it's the same movie, just about rap or rock. Yet it is hilarious. There are many funny jokes, but not without a few jokes just falling flat. The characters are all very funny and credible. I just looked at it because it made me laugh at 3:00 am, and any movie that can do that, at least needs a screen saver. One of the reasons this movie was so funny is that it makes another fun of rap. Rap today is worried about the wrong things and continues with studio noise and small talent. This movie comes from a time when rappers earned more credit. Overall, this is a funny movie with lots of jokes about racism, sex and music culture among the more obvious themes of humor. It is highly recommended for any fan of this spinal tap. They are essentially the same movie, just about different worlds, and yes, the same jokes work in both movies.
