Brokedown Palace is the story of two best friends, Alice and Darlene, who go to Thailand spontaneously and arrive in prison after being caught with planted drugs in their luggage. In this way, the film has the potential to become a serious and moving movie, such as "Back to Paradise", but instead the film chose to focus little on the girls' situation and more on their friendship. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale both turn in excellent performances, and the film is much more about the interaction between them - the suspicion, the jealousy, the questioning and testing of their friendship and ultimately the sacrifices in the name of friendship. . This movie prefers not to deepen in politics, or even in the trouble of prison life (which is a bit glamorous) and focuses more on these friendship issues. <br /> <br /> There were some plot holes here, and some parts just didn't seem credible or realistic. We didn't feel the real fear or hopelessness of their situation, as well as what we might have. And we get very little sense of life outside the prison walls, with Bill Pullman playing the so-called sloppy lawyer who actually seems to have a heart of gold. In short, all rights had to be a much darker movie than it was. <br /> <br /> Overall, I enjoyed it. The acting was good, the soundtrack was perfect, and the storyline had enough twists and turns to stay interesting. Worth to see.
