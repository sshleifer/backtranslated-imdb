Especially for a time when not much science fiction (1973) was filmed, it is a fantastic vision of a future where everything went wrong. Too many people, and nothing works. The only people who can live in comfort are the rich. It's in New York in 2022 (I think), and it reminds you of Calcutta's worst vision. <br /> <br /> I appreciated Charlton Heston's acting after seeing him in Orson Welles' Touch of Evil. He was (perhaps) able to portray a variety of heroic or semi-fortunate people. Here he is torn between a police spokesman who is just a bit corrupted (with rare food treats the rich), and is completely corrupt. <br /> <br /> The movie took place all night, and the sweat drowned all but in one of the rare air-conditioned apartments. Although I have not seen it before, I knew that the famous end (which will not be revealed here), but the end is certainly preview. <br /> <br /> Great scenes with Edward G. Robinson: go to the council (consisting of elderly Jews with heavy accents, so it seems), where the truth is revealed. And then you go to the Thanatopsis to go out. <br /> <br /> Gritty, pre-Star Wars dystopic science fiction.
