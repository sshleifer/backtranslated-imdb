Well, I'm delighted to hear a rumor that it can finally be released on DVD. When that happens, I don't know, but I'll grab it when it's released. <br /> <br /> In my humble opinion, this is Errol Flynn's most entertaining movie, especially when Mr. Jim Corbett's "ringmaker" starts in the movie. Then it goes from a good movie to a big one. <br /> <br /> Few people can play arrogant men and still come out like a good man, as well as Flynn, and this movie is a perfect example of this. According to reports, it was Flynn's favorite role and I believe it. You can only see how much fun he had here. Ward Bond also looks as if he really enjoys the role of well-known John L. Sullivan. Bond was never better either. <br /> <br /> There are just the right amount of action boxes here and they are pretty well done. Corbett's family is also nice to watch while they are in the stall during Jim's matches. From the arena, Corbett's family's constant arguments and screams can be a little too hard and annoying, but they set the stage for a proper conclusion. <br /> <br /> And as far as the conclusion is concerned, Sullivan's speech to Corbett after the big fight has been very touching and the highlight of the film. Some moderate critics (Variety, for example) did not like it, nor did the fact that much of the film was formalized, but - most movies were fictionalized, like that or not. And in this case, it made for a nice story and a fine ending. (In real life, Corbett was a very gentle gentleman, nothing like Flynn's portrayal, but Flynn still makes him a good guy.) <br /> <br /> This is one of the more entertaining classic movies what I've always watched and I'm eagerly waiting for the DVD.
