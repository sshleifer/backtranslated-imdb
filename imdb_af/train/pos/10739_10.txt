Wonderful documentary. It has been seen on the original airdate and on the DVD several times over the last few years. I was shocked that it was not even voted for a Best Documentary Oscar for 2002, the year in which it was released. No other documentary even comes close. <br /> <br /> It was recently on TV for the 5th anniversary, but I missed the end "where are they now", except I catch Tony working for the hazmat unit now. <br /> <br /> I have criticized documentary films from some on this list. I can't see how this could be done differently. They have less than 6 months to set it up and get it on the air. The DVD contains more material and background. <br /> <br /> I'm also surprised that, according to IMDb.com, the brother had no projects in the four years ago. What did they do?
