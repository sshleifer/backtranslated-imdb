Very nice done movie. It stays in your memory. Better invoiced as a romance than flying or war, although the flying parts are realistic and almost error free. Flying buffs like me will enjoy this movie, even if it is attracted by the aircraft, unless they have no sensitivity or have never been in love. <br /> <br /> Fun watch early Crowe. He is good and gives charm. His reading of "High Flight" is wonderful. <br /> <br /> Cheers, Tree
