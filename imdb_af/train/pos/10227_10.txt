Most yeti photos are severely undermined by a serious pause in energy and enthusiasm. Not so, this glamorous, bitter and berserk-over-the-top Italian-made-in-Canada kitsch-gut-buster: It's a very ripe and powerful moronic horrible wonder that reaches a beautiful apotheosis of righteousness . go on? "A freighter ship crew discovers the body of a 30-foot yeti that looks like a hirsute 70's disco stud (complete with jumbo rolling afro), perfectly preserved in a large piece of ice. They have the animal disrupted, chased him with electric charges, killed him seriously and kept the poor, hairy Goliath in an enormous glasshouse, before you could say, "Hey, the filmmakers are obviously ripped off" King Kong, "cutting our titanic horrible snowdrops off his loft, grabbed the first nice, nubile blonde Euro vixen (the beautiful Pheonix Grant) storms with his new lady love.The yeti is recovered and flown to Toronto to go to a gawking audience, of course he breaks free again nabs the vixen, and continues on the expected stomping around the city rim. <br /> <br /> The sublime stupid dialogue (example line: "Philosophy has no place in science, professor"), an exaggerated (distant) of) special effects (the terribly transparent blue screen and the rugged Tonka sp a miserable miniature is especially unwavering in their very jaw-dreaded horror), some (wrong) direction and a heavy-handed script that even tries a cunning sincere attempt "Is the daughter a man or an animal?" ethical debate everyone combines to to create one of the most beautiful ridiculous giant monster flicks to ever roar his absurd way over the big screen. Better yet, we also have some funky horrible touches to add extra tasty spices to the already juicy shocking movie roll: the vixen accidentally brushes against one of the stills of the yeti, making it a big, learning smile of approval of the lecherous behemoth (!); the vixen nursed the wounds' wounded hand as he threw her on the eye, the daughter smells with his feet windows as he climbed a tower office, and the hairy man even broke a man's neck with his toes (!!). Overall, this particular screw ball and scandalous unrepentant camp camp classic stands tall as a remarkable monolith of infectious asinine celluloid lunacy which is actually worthy of a substantial hardcore underground cult following.
