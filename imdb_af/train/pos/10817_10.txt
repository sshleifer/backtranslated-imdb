Well, this movie was probably one of the funniest and frightening movies I've ever seen. The effects are so bad, you just have to laugh, and the acting, well, she says, no mel gibson. But Gary Browning, who plays a police officer, is so sorry, he's getting well. I don't know how, but he himself makes this movie a 10. You should see it if you make the bloody and funny at the same time in the horror / slash movies. Killer movie.
