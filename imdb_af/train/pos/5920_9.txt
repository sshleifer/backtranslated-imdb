American icon Henry Fonda image "Elegant" John Howard, an aging trucker who had his beloved superintendent "Eleanor" after having had a long hospital stay, forced him to miss his payments. To decide that he just wants to make one perfect run, he breaks out of the hospital, pushes back Eleanor, and, with the old friend Penelope Pearson (Eileen Brennan), moves her prostitutes off prostitutes. /> <br /> Fondas' wonderful performance is a natural anchor for a movie pruning as fast as the heartbeat while tickling the funny leg in the more comical scene. An excellent role, including Robert Englund, as a reluctant young teammate, Susan Sarandon (who also gets co-producer credit), and Dub Taylor (a delicious ham, as always in the most blatant comic part of the picture), help unmistakably. br /> <br /> The ultimately life-satisfying nature of the picture and the poignancy of the journey carry incredible weight; This is a picture you have provided. You can remember long after it's over. <br /> <br /> The promise of the open road is clearly displayed here. the countryside looks beautiful. This is a remarkable picture in terms of aesthetics. It loses a little something in its final act (the characters John Byner and Austin Pendleton played are a bit more than invaders.) But it still retains its good vibes, thanks to the appeal of its central characters. <br /> <br /> Not quite the exploit / plug-in screen picture one expects of the title (especially its alternative title, "The Great Smokey Roadblock"), it's a rewarding movie experience I can recommend without qualifications . <br /> <br /> 9/10
