We still throw too little light on the term "superstar", but here is one man who really deserves it. <br /> <br /> I was attached to this set this whole show. The song selection was perfect - it just contained the songs I really wanted to hear and cut into documentary footage in the weaker new songs. I was loved that the group was just five players on stage in a very minimalist environment. (With songs of this strength you don't have to entertain a circus). <br /> <br /> The shots of the crowd were also wonderful. How many artists can influence the original Beatles fans (now in their 50s and ages), getting young kids to jump into the opening lines of "Can't Buy My Love" and influence everyone in between? <br /> <br /> As I watched, I also realized that in the aftermath of John Lennon's tragic death, Paul McCartney became an afterthought. Paul not only lost John and George (it's hard to lose someone with whom you changed the world), but he also lost his wife, Linda, and never got the recognition Lennon's murder received. I agree that Lennon's murder was terrible, but only now did I realize that Paul was in the wake of forgotten things. I was very happy to find love in Heather again. <br /> <br /> As for those complaining about the audio / video quality, I had no complaints; both were crystal clear on my set. I think the same people will complain about the quality of DVD when the following format comes out; they will never be satisfied. <br /> <br /> My only regret was not buying a ticket for this show when I had the chance. Thanks to this video, I enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> When people remember John Lennon, they first remember his murder and then his music. I now have a new appreciation for Paul McCartney, because if he is nothing else, he will be remembered for his music first. And let's hope another madman won't change it, because the McCartney catalog is pretty good.
