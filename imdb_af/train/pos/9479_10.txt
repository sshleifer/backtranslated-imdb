Tian's remake is not good at all. I just click on his remake documentary to see Wei Wei, the original actress back in the classic 1948 movie, say a few words to the crew. We will meet this Wei Wei this Sunday (28/3/2010) after the performance of Xiao Cheng Zhi Chun in the Hong Kong Film Archiev. Wei Wei is nearly 90 years old in silver hair, her cameo appearance in Hong Kong movies is always a surprise to her fans. In this year's Hong Kong film festival, a special program is dedicated to Fei Mu, director of this epic movie and Wei Wei's shot of the movie is seen all over Hong Kong. My son, who is 21 years old, is surprised. Wei Wei was so beautiful.
