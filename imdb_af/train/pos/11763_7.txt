I think everyone should come back at a certain time. And that's exactly what shameful Taft resident Jack Dundee (Robin Williams) plans to do in "The Best of Times". Yep, the man who all went with radio in "Good Morning, Vietnam", plays soccer. In this case, he tries to play a game that costs his high school as a sought-after title. But former teammate Reno Hightower (Kurt Russell) doesn't go along with that easily. <br /> <br /> Permitted, this is not the best movie for any man. But Williams and Russell are actually a good comedy team. And some of the names in this movie will probably give you the giggles (to say the least). Look at that.
