I have never seen Richard Thomas play a bad man. I wasn't sure I would have liked him so much. And I wasn't sure he could pull it off. But it amazed me. He lowered my spine and looked me up at street people. The movie is staggering and faster. Bruce Davison is convincing, but all he can really play is a good guy. The right talent here is Thomas. The end was a bit clumsy, but maybe that's the way real people would fight. If you are a Thomas fan, you should see him here if he is his best, bad!
