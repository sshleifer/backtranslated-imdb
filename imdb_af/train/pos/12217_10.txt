I saw Ashura as 2005 Fantasia Festival Kickoff. Man, this was a cool kick-off. The director had to be premiered in Montreal for the Canadian, but due to health reasons he is still in Japan. Oh, Lord, I hope he gets better and makes many other movies. <br /> <br /> The plot is pretty simple but somewhat original ... the demons row in Edo in Japan and swordsmen called "Demon Wardens" kill them and fear the rebirth of Ashura, the devil goddess who is sleeping and presumably a lot of kicking leg. /> <br /> This brings us to Izumo ... a kind of elite swordsman called "Demon Slayer" and his friend Jaku who is the typical violent jealous asshole ... <br /> <br /> Looks boring? Well, it thickens .... <br /> <br /> Izumo fired his retirement from the devil's death for killing a young child that he was the devil, he never knew, but he killed her. So Izumo continued his life and regained himself in Kabuki theater. In a boat on a nice night, Izumo sees a girl hiding on a bridge and it changes his life and begins to kill demons ... for the good cause, the cause of love ... and damn ... the guy knows how to handle a sword and draw an entertaining bloodbath. <br /> <br /> Izumo carries the movie as far as it goes ... he is the total package ... he knows how to fight (hell yes he knows), he's greasy, he's intelligent and he has that grit. You never have to shout: "NO IZUMO, THIS IS A TRAP" The man already knows it, he has that common sense. He really is the perfect hero. <br /> <br /> As far as treasure is concerned, the aesthetics are quite interesting. It's by far the movie that looks the most like a manga. It's creamed with special effects and nothing at all costs will prevent this movie from being realistic ... it's pretty amazing. Many colors are an "unreal" photograph, unlike that ... it's pretty straightforward ... but as I said, the main character is the movie. A must see, a story led by masterful hands.
