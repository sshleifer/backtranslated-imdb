"Pickup On South Street" is a high-speed drama about a small criminal who suddenly complicates himself in the activities of a group of communists. The action is presented in a very direct and dynamic style and the momentum is kept through some brilliant editing. Using a wide variety of different camera angles and effective close-ups also contributes to the overall impression of constant motion and vitality. Samuel Fuller's style of directing and cinematography by Joseph MacDonald is excellent and there are many scenes that, through their composition and lighting, create a strong sense of mood and atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Ace bag and repeat offender Skip McCoy (Richard Widmark) gets deep water when stealing a purse from a young woman named Candy (Jean Peters) on the New York subway. She was used by her former friend Joey (Richard Kiley) to deliver a delivery to one of her contacts in a communist organization and unknown to her. She recorded American secrets recorded on microfilm. Two FBI agents follow Candy and have seen the theft. One of the agents stays back to Joey's apartment and the other, Zara (Willis Bouchey), visits police chief Dan Tiger (Murvyn Vye). Zara explains that the FBI is following Candy for a few months as part of their pursuit of the forerunner of a communist group. <br /> <br /> To identify the bag, Tiger calls in a "stool" called Moe Thelma Ritter) who made a list of eight possible suspects after the exact description of the "gun's" approach. As soon as Tiger sees the name of Skip on the list, he is immediately convinced that he is the man they need to find and he sends two detectives to arrest him. When Skip is brought to Tiger's office, Zara tells him about the microfilm and offers Tiger to drop any costs if he cooperates with the investigation. Ship is freaky and arrogant. He does not trust Tiger clearly and denies all the knowledge of the theft on the subway. <br /> <br /> Joey spends Candy finding out who stole the microfilm and then pick it up. Candy pays Moe for Ship's address and when Skip returns to be questioned by Tiger, he finds Candy to his home and knocks her unconscious before stealing her money. When she recovers, Claim requires $ 25,000 for the microfilm. She tells Joey about Skip's question and Joey's boss gives him a gun and orders him to repair the microfilm by the next night. <br /> <br /> Skip and Candy are attracted to each other and that is because of their uncomfortable, evolving relationship that develops a way to turn police off. It soon becomes clear, however, that solving issues with the communist gang can only be achieved through more direct action. <br /> <br /> The portrayals of Skip, Candy and Moe as characters that are an ugly world in which they are. forced to face significant risks daily is powerful and compelling. <br /> <br /> Moe's work as a police informant is dependent on her knowledge of the people in her community, but also those people know what she is doing and any one of them can seek their revenge at any time. She looks cunning and street-wise, but has also described her vulnerable side as herself as an old clock running and saving money to get a decent funeral in an exclusive Long Island cemetery. Her belief that "each goat has its own meaning" leads her to sell any information, regardless of danger, friendships or principles and yet there is one opportunity she refuses and it is deadly. Thelma Ritter's achievement deserves the Oscar nomination she earned for her role. <br /> <br /> Skip is a violent criminal without caring for his victims and has been convicted three times in the past, living under the constant threat of being sentenced to life in prison if found guilty again. Nevertheless, he continues to pursue his criminal activities and is strange, only philosophical if Moe imagines his stay, and later he assures Moe of receiving the kind of funeral she so highly appreciated. Candy is an ex-hooker and someone whose activity always puts her at risk, but behind her hardened outside a warmer side gradually becomes clearer. Widmark and Peters are both perfect for their roles and as Ritter portrays the different facets of their personalities with great style and belief.
