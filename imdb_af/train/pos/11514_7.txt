Not the most successful television project John Cleese ever did, "Strange Case" has the feel of a first concept that has been rushed into production before any revisions can be made. There are a few foolish ideas throughout and even some smart ones, but the story as a whole doesn't add much. <br /> <br /> But Arthur Lowe is a bitch, like Dr. Watson, bionic bits and everything. "Good Lord."
