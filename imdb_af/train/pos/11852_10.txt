Spirit is a unique and original look at Western life from the point of view of a wild horse and native Americans. The film focuses on the friendships and dangers of a wild horse, Spirit in his life. <br /> <br /> Well done in the presentation, using the technology available today to deliver stunning visuals that are breathtaking in depth. and realism. <br /> <br /> The music is fantastic, with songs by Bryan Adams, and music by Hans Zimmer, who was also responsible for the extremely popular music of the 1994 hit, The Lion King. <br /> <br /> The story is not very deep, but the fact that it is not quite as deep as some movies do not, in my opinion, detract from the film as a whole. <br /> <br /> An excellent movie I really enjoyed, and that's great for the whole family. Not one to be missed. (10/10)
