I gave it a 10 out of 10 points. I love it so much. I am a child of the 80's and quite heavy metal for many years. These are the reasons why I enjoy this movie so much. It's so cool to see the posters in the bedroom of that boy (Judas Priest, Lizzy Borden, Raven, Twisted Sister ...) and his vinyl collection (revealing the bad by Exciter, Rise of the mutants by shock metal master Impaler and Murder are my business through Megadeth). Also the soundtrack by FASTWAY is absolutely incredible and fits very well with the plot. If you're in metal, TRICK OF TRIAL is your friend. Don't buy this movie for OZZY or GENE SIMMONS because it's for seconds in the movie, watch it because the soundtrack and the story that will bring you back to the glory 80s. You won't be the same person.
