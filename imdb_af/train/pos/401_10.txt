I just came back from Hong Kong on my summer vacation and saw the Legend of ZU. I thought it kicks a * s! It was so creative and unique. It's the Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon with much less drama. Even if some thought there was too much special FX (yes right!), You can't complain about the cast. Zhang Ziyi and Cecilia Cheung are so good !!! The Legend of ZU ..... kick a * s !!!!!!!!
