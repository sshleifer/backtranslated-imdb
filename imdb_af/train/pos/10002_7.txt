It's easily the most underrated movie in the Brooks cannon. Certainly this is incorrect. It does not give a realistic view of homelessness (as opposed to, for example, how Citizen Kane gave a realistic view of lounge singers, or Titanic gave a realistic view of Italians YOU IDIOTS). Many of the jokes fall flat. But still, this movie is very much in a way that many comedies are, and in a story about some of the most traditionally wasted members of society, it is truly impressive. It's not the Fisher King, but it's not a crap. My only complaint is that Brooks had to bring somebody else (I like Mel as a director and writer, not as much as a head start).
