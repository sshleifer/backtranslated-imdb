I've looked at a lot of episodes from Cold Case since its premiere (especially now that it immediately follows The Amazing Race, but it was one of the best cases of writing and acting I saw from Bruckheimer's home. The decisive, especially from the younger officers, was on the point, writing and editing, the soundtrack, and the play made this episode a tour d'force.If I was the manufacturers, I would consider this episode for Emmy. was made from Coop and Jimmy within the boundaries of the 48-minute episode, which many talented people do their best, and I hope there is a warning about when this episode is repeated, because I'm sure I'll get a lot of what I do first seen.
