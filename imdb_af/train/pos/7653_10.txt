Shot in the heart is wonderful. It brilliantly illustrates the fate of Gary Gimore, a convicted murder who has called for death. Shot in the heart shows the trial that Gilmore's family, through hatred, has gone through. This film is an amazing psychological study, and is wonderfully depressed and uplifting. 10/10
