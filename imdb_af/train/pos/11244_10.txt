One of my best movies ever, maybe because I was well into the punk scene in the late 70's and went to many Hazels concerts, but the movie was a good storyline and very good with hazel and an exciting Phil Daniels not. sure about his latest project Eastenders !! Excellent performance by many unknown actors. If you peel your eyes, they will see it in many of the British sails. Ultimately: Carver from the Bill, the more I see more of them I see, though if you haven't seen it spend another night with the video, don't forget to put out the safety pin for your nose and heavy black eyebrow. do not dig and shave your head mochanical style. Enjoy it.
