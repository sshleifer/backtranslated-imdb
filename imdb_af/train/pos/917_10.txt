I watched it in July and even with the Christmas theme it became and became sensitive. It is not for someone with a reality, because it is full of fantasy and beautiful moments that sometimes do not make sense. William Russ did a great job as Hank. I just saw him in the remake of The Long, Hot Summer, where he played a bad character. But in this one, the expression in his eyes has been wonderful and soft throughout, as Hank did. Valerie Bertinelli was excellent and beautiful as usual and very credible in this role. And Peter Falk as Max was beautiful and always brought a smile when he appeared in a number of important scenes. There were many special scenes, including the one where Hank realized who Max was really in his life. It's not for everyone, especially those who aren't in a good sense, and it's definitely one! If you want everything to be perfect and meaningful, avoid this one. But I think it's worth looking at again, and so I bound it. (Yes, some of us still have video recorders. :)
