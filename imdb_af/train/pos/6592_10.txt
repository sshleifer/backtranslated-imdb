I didn't see this movie, but I have to. After reading all three of Thor Heyerdahl's books (Kon Tiki, Ra and Aku Aku), I am actively looking for a copy of this movie. <br /> <br /> The thesis migrating Peruvian to Polynesia lives alive. Since this crew had no GPS, and just an old-fashioned valve (tube) radio with a 6 watt output, their journey was heroic to say the least. <br /> <br /> If you can tell me the location of a copy of this video, please reply to this message. <br /> <br /> I'd be interested to buy it.
