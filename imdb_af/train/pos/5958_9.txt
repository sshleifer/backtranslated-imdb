Unlike some comments, the mine is positive. This movie wraps around the table with a group of friends, some you want, some you don't. A few are related - mother, daughter, son. Their stories are not one at all, happy with everyone and everything, kind of life - much like real life. Some story lines don't develop, they just happen. But as true families and good friends, keep them together. The parents who buy a baby are such holes! You're happy for the end. Poor Delmar stuck between a rock and a stone that cares for herself, her mother, her son, and tries to keep all their lives together. It doesn't end with a sunset walk or home in the 'burbs' and everyone lives in a dream world, but is a very real portrayal of people living from day to month. Overall, this is a good story and a good movie !!
