I watched this show - it was the third and last episode, when it first watched - and was blown away by a social commentary not seen since the 'All in the Family'. <br /> <br /> It was very surprised. CBS will only do this in the first place. <br /> <br /> What's the last time CBS had a set - if you know what I mean - was back in the day of "All in the Family". The most controversial decision they want to make today is how much eye makeup Katie Couric has to apply. <br /> <br /> If you want to make a lot of people, really angry, leave them the truth about themselves. And if you want them to pull strings, make calls and get a piece of art removed - let them discover that truth by hearing their own words from their own mouths. <br /> <br /> The Aardman people have always been the road ahead of the curve. And this show is no different. Somehow it sniffed under the CBS corporate / social / political / censorship radar to get it on the schedule (perhaps the "big buyer" never really looked until it was finally broadcast?) Saw that themselves is - well, the farm cannot last that message, or the messenger. <br /> <br /> Now, if only the "missing episodes" can find their way on Usenet or bit-torrent ;-) <br /> <br /> Thanks BC Kelly Tallahassee Fla
