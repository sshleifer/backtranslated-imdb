This movie is a great fun. I recommend that you see it yourself and then look back with your friends. I did last night and it was fascinating how well Norma Khouri could draw everyone in her world! I felt a little strange watching my friends go through the same toboggan run as I did the first time. But they all thanked me and loved the movie. You know it's a great movie if you spend 2 hours after the movie is talking about the movie! <br /> <br /> Once I saw a man, almost to Norma Khouri's level, but not near the same size ring. He was very faithful and rich in my old Berkeley CA A.A. group where everyone trusts. He would only sponsor "people" who looked very good at doing so. Who knew he'd stolen more than 100k (in 1987 when it was really money) after being in the village for only 1 month. His victims were very fragile as they were in their first month or week to be sober. He was angry with a big laugh and a big smile on his face. <br /> <br /> The above crime is nothing compared to what Norma Khouri did to her old neighbor. But I don't want to give anything away. <br /> <br /> I only have this one night on a late night movie channel, "Showtim", I think. It's always a movie fan's greatest experience to completely deceive something to see and blow your mind. Just drag your friends to see it and don't tell them anything. It's a very entertaining movie, it moves fast and never prevents you. <br /> <br /> It should be an international classic for all time. I believe that all the big movies eventually come to the top. Time will be very good for this movie. I'm sorry, no one has heard it, in some ways that make the surprises even better. <br /> <br /> The director and editor were fantastic. They deserve to win the best documentaries. <br /> <br /> Just watch this movie!
