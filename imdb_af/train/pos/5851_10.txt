* SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> It's just the second pay-per-view I've given a perfect 10, the first being the 1991 Royal Rumble. It was full of exciting games that were not memorable, just throw away fun. And that's why I love it. <br /> <br /> The opening match between Razor and DiBiase, as well as Ludvig Borga against Marty Jannetty, were the only lows. They were OK matches, but DiBiase earned better in his final pay per view. Nowadays, a game like this one will have a bigger climax for Razor's first big baby boom. And Jannetty, fresh from an Intercontinental title, could have played better with Borga. But I don't think anyone really cares. They only needed a deposit-pay on television. <br /> <br /> IRS and The Kid were great, like Michaels and Perfect. I wish Perfect could have won, but Michaels is not for anyone. Notice how he immediately left the WWF so he doesn't have to work at Razor. Bret Hart had two big brawls with Doink (note how everyone's best match is against the Hit man) and then Lawler. Their competition was a classic; That's why that year's Feod of the Year was a no-brainer. How often do you see two legends win Feud of the Year so late in their careers? <br /> <br /> The Steiners Heavenly Body game was one of the best of the year. Who knew the bodies could hold their own against one of the best teams ever? <br /> <br /> Many say the Undertaker-Giant Gonzalez game was a waste of time. But I loved it. Remember, what made the old WWF (as in, before-WWE) great was the mix of athletics and freak show. Is there a soul out there who didn't like Akeem? <br /> <br /> The main event wasn't bad, but nowhere near the game of the year. They put Lex Luger well, but made a wise choice to keep Yokozuna. He was the first heel since Superstar Graham to hold the band for more than two months. Nowadays heels are all champions. But from the start of the WWWF through the WWF of the 90s, if you have blinked, you've missed a chisel government. <br /> <br /> As an old schoolgirl fan, this one and SummerSlam'88 are my favorites.
