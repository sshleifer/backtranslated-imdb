Peter Jackson's version (s) are better than objective movies. That being said, they are not my favorite screen versions of Lord Of The Rings, and let me explain why. <br /> <br /> First, the screenplay's acting is just too ordinary and uninspiring with Jackson's LOTR. The whole casting is running from the mill. "Do you claim that those stupid cartoon characters of Ralph Bakshi version are better actors than real people?" one can ask. Well, they're not really stupid (except Hobbits, later on them) and they definitely pack more personality than Jackson's party - even with much more limited dialogue time. And this is due to superior _voice_ acting of the Bakshi's LOTR. Take, for example, Aragorn. In this version, his voice is deep and charismatic with full authority (Aragorn the Lord) and with a seasoned grater (Aragorn the Ranger). This is due to John Hurt's brilliant voice work. Compare this with Viggo Mortensen's very loud sound without any soul, and the duel is quickly uneven. Hurt hit Mortensen's hands. <br /> <br /> Then there's Gandalf. Probably the most dominant (and most popular) character in the whole saga. In this Bakshi version Gandalf (William Squire) is a true wizard. And with that I don't mean that he shoots bolts out of his fingertips (he doesn't), but his presence is just fascinating. He is a mystical, powerful and can easily change from a gentle old man to a scary person. Add to that its appearance: Long, old like the old oak beard, beard long like his body, sharp eyes, magical nose and of course the classic wizard hat. A perfect Gandalf, just like in the books. Ian McKellen's Gandalf, on the other hand, is simply too boring. He looks too human, sounds too human, does too humanly, and doesn't wear a hat or wear a sword. Yes, a sword. In this Bakshi version, Gandalf scores, kill some bloody orcs with his sword (as he did in the books). And this is stylish slow motion dead. Gandalf is not a force to be wasted. And it should be noted that while I'm sad to say that, the great Christopher Lee Saruman didn't bring it alive. Fraser Kerr in this movie did, even with very limited screen time and lines. <br /> <br /> Before moving completely into visual aspects of the movie, it should be mentioned that the voice-acting and general representation of the Orcs is also better than Jackson's former bad guys. Bakshi's orcs are constantly haunting their enemies with growls, screams and nasty language. They are more credible than monsters and are, in my opinion, more faithful to the book. And finally, the Black Riders - or the Nazgul. These ultimate bad guys are frightening ghosts in this one - not just some riders wear black. And they speak with haunting voice, which captivates their victim. My favorite scene in the movie is when Nazgul Frodo chases near the river. While Peter Jackson couldn't do anything but show the riders just chasing the party, Bakshi throws a nightmare dream with some cool slow motors and thundering air. <br /> <br /> But so much I like this movie more than Jackson's, the latter is, just technically, even better. And that's because of some key images. As you know Bakshi LOTR features a mix of animated characters (all hobbits and head cast) and real actors covered with paint. I don't really have a problem using real people in animation this way, but they don't fit well with traditional cartoon characters. This is especially true of people (Riders of Rohan, people of the tavern, etc.). Orcs are different things, as they look very different from other characters. Orcs, while being played by people with animation mixes, look much better than Jackson's version. They have brown-green skin, shiny red eyes, flat face and pointed teeth. <br /> <br /> The biggest screw in this movie visual, powerhouse, is the Hobbits. While I prefer almost every character in Bakshi version compared to Jackson, the latter has clearly superior Hobbits, in fact they are perfect. With Bakshi you get some annoying and rather poorly drawn humanoid Disney bamboo. And you're forced to spend a lot of time with them, so be warned. Again, the voice action is also good with them, but the actors' mouth can't save the "downfall" made by these little weasels. Well, I never really liked that half-way. <br /> <br /> General failures in the Bakshi script are known. Limited play time (with limited budget) and many missing scenes. So while this movie covers almost half of the story, it doesn't do much in detail compared to Jackson's version. <br /> <br /> In a summary, the Ralph Bakshi version of LOTR has a superior atmosphere (it feels more like the Middle Earth) - everywhere voice-acting music (I'm really digging the fantasy count by Kont & Rosenman) -Gandalf -Aragorn (One of the John Hurt's best roles) -Ken Theoden -Orcs -Black Riders -Errond (He's not a fairy hippie in this one!) <br /> <br /> While Jackson- version better: <br /> <br /> Covering the whole story - Overall visual and special effects -Gollum / Smeagol -Balrog -Hobbits <br /> <br /> Lord of the Rings at Ralph Bakshi, even with Its well-known shortcomings are one of the best animated films ever made and it takes the atmosphere of Tolkien's fantasy world very well, if not perfect. I'll give it a score of 8Â½ out of 10.
