what can i say? Erika Eleniak is my favorite blonde girl ever, and like an Italian American, fan number one of female beauty, I can't forget this movie. <br /> <br /> You know I'm really 'I remember a lot about the plot, or the situations or the other actors. I can only remember from drop dead beautiful Erika and that in this movie she looks better than ever, I really don't care if it's a bad movie or a good movie, I just give up the nice moments that I'm a teenager in Brooklyn. Just consider the beauty of Erika. <br /> <br /> Well, just to decide if you are an Erika Eleniak beauty clerk like me, this movie is definitely for you.
