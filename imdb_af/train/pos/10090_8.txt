I was prepared for a sought-after talkie soap opera cum travelogue, but was happy to find a quick screenplay, an underlying moral, excellent portrayal of all the actors, especially Peter Finch, wonderful special effects, excitement and beautiful cinematography. There is even a shot of the majestic stone buddha recently destroyed by the Taliban. Not to mention Elizabeth Taylor at her most gloriously beautiful and sympathetic, before surrendering to the ghost hysterical that later destroyed her work. All the supporting players turn it off, and I wonder what all the elephants have trained. <br /> <br /> If you talk about the stone Buddha sequence, you can really see it being Vivien Leigh in the long shots. Her shape and the way she moves is clearly Taylor's. The only thing that touches that order is the bad process shots, where the background moves too much for horses on a step. <br /> <br /> If you want a thought-provoking movie that is beautiful to watch and never boring, spend a few hours with Elephant Walk.
