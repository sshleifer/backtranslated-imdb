(The parents mostly loved it). "The Return of Chandu" was a 12 episode series featuring Chandu (Bela Lugosi), The Mysterious Mr. Wong, '34 a magician with super natural powers and travels to the island of Lemuria to rescue the kidnapped princess of Egypt, (Nadji) Maria Alba, "Dr. Terror's House of Horrors". Princess Nadji is held captive by the black magical cult of Ubasti, who believes she is a reincarnation of their long-dead goddess Ossana.
