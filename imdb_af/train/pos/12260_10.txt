It's a great start to Mickey Rooney's film career. His talents show that a long career lies ahead of him. The car and truck hunt is exciting for the 1937 era. This start of the Andy Hardy series is an American treasure in my book. The Spring Byington show is excellent as usual. Please, Mr. Rooney or movie rights owners take a chance and get it on DVD. I think it will be a winner.
