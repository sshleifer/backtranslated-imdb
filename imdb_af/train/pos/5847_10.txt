Although this series ran just a season, it has been with me for 20 years. It was by far my favorite cartoon ever. I'll give almost anything to get it on DVD or any format I can get. If you see any means to see this series, I suggest you take full advantage. This series was the first (in my opinion) that had a real coherent story that spread over several episodes. It also really cared for the characters and what happened to them. Heck the character Goose actually scared me. He was so strange at the time. Also the group leader reminds me of a combination of Clint Eastwood / Tommy Lee Jones. If anyone has any way to contact the creator / holder of the rights to the series and get them on DVD, you must do so!
