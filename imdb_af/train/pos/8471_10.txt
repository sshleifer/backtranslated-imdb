This is one of my favorite mr. Motos, and I saw them all. As usual, Lorre is his beautiful self as the debonair man. Moto. Lionel Atwill plays a beautiful zany museum curator, the usual comic relief is pretty funny here, and there are many suspects about who should throw an eye. It's fast and fun. <br /> <br /> The archaeologist doesn't have the same flair as Thomas Beck, the usual second lead in these programmers, but he's enough. Stepin Fetchit is on board, and while speaking stereotypes, his lines are funny, not detracting from his intelligence, and saving the day in his short time on the screen.
