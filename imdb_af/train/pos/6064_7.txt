I must first tell you how I got this movie. It was winter time in Alaska around the year 1990. A friend of mine from Australia stayed with me and my girlfriend in an apartment shoe. Winners in Alaska can be a bit brutal and most people stay indoors, drink heavily and watch anything that comes on television. I found this movie outside a spare room store in a snowboard and immediately it was a treasure. It's probably the best worst movie ever. We spent the next two weeks watching this movie and drinking like fish. We watched it so many times that we would sometimes turn the television on its side or upside down to get a more complete filling effect. It's a real gem. The laugh will come incessantly and the memories will last forever. If you are buying this movie for sale in a video store, steal it. You won't regret it!
