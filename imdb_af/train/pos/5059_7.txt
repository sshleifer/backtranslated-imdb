We watched the vr and found it to be fascinating. I didn't know anything about this true story. I thought, "Oh no, P.Brosnan as an American Indian ('Red' Indian in the movie), which is a bad choice" until I discovered the truth about Gray Owl. The film does a good job of demonstrating the dignity of these indigenous peoples and undermining the racist myths. And Annie Galipeau, WOW, who is a beauty, and very convincing as an Indian woman (I believe she is French Canadian; she definitely goes back to the renowned speech of such things). Despite Brosnan's freestanding grin style, he finally comes convincingly as a passionate, dedicated man. The plot is a little poor to demolish its conversion from hiker to animal food varnish. Good movie, highly recommended.
