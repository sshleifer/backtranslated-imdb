It's such a sequel to batman's animated and it's almost as good as it is and for the same reasons it has a lot of action in it. The storyline is good that the voice over actors is really good as Kevin Conroy as batman, Mark Hamil as the Joker, etc. The villains are really good like The Joker, Two-face, Catwoman, Clayface, etc. So I'm sure you won't be disappointed with the new adventures of Batman because it's great. So make sure you watch it on TV or buy or buy the collector's edition because it's really good. <br /> <br /> Overall rating: ********* from ****** **** <br /> <br /> **** from *****
