If I didn't know better, it almost seems to have been staged, but it wasn't. It's perfectly set up, and how they all have that material is great! The unfortunate events of September 11, 2001 are well compiled into this documentary version and the classic footage they made made it an unfortunate classic. Just the history in the footage alone should see it MUST be for any American or person affected by the September 11 tragedy.
