Look at seven pounds. I wasn't clear about what to think, because the previews opened too much to understand what the movie was about. So within the first 20 minutes or so you're completely lost in the plot, you have no idea what's going on and you think Tim, who claims to be Ben, is just a big asshole. All these things come to an end when the "twist" is, as it were, unraveled at the last moment of the movie. Basically, Tim (will Smith) was upset and chased by a major accident that caused him to end the lives of seven people. By doing so, he decides to use seven new people who need bad help who he gives his life in turn. <br /> <br /> The acting of this movie is great, because I feel will make smith, no matter what he seems to be impressed. Rosario Dawson, to me, this is one of her better movies, apart from eagle eye I think there is. She is in some bad things, but she delivers in this movie. Other actors, such as Woody Harrelson, have very small roles and not a big enough role to understand the character. Although the decisive film was still good. <br /> <br /> This movie was definitely not what I expected and definitely a slower pace in which I was hoping. However, the movie was pretty good. Nothing is revealed until the last 5 minutes of the movie and everything falls into place. Until then, it seems like a useless love story. Final thought seven pounds = seven stars.
