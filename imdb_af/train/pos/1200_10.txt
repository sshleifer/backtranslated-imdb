No illusions, it's a moral story. Granger is the troubled ex-buffalo hunter, once withdrawn to the plains by Taylor. Granger can see the end is near, and feel deeply at the cost of hunting the herds, the Indians and the country itself. Taylor, on the other hand, admits that buffaloes or Indians are being killed to be with a woman. "While Granger's role of the tortured hunter is excellent, it is Taylor who steals the performance as the demented, immoral" all-man "for the quick buck and the good time. There is not much fear here, but the story is moving fast, and we are treated with a fine character performance by Nolan. The theme of this story is as gripping today as in the 1800's man's relationship with the country and what about it and racism. Taking into account when it was made, the Censors had to wring their hooks in the bawdy house, Taylor's relationship with the squaw and much of the dialogue. Although downbeat, it's really a big western picture.
