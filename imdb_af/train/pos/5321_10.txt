This movie really surprised me. I had my first doubt about it, but the movie got better and better every minute. <br /> <br /> It may not be for the action-seeking audience, but for those who find an explicit portrait of a very strange criminal, man, lover and man. If you're not a fan of bad language or sexual content, it's really not for you. <br /> <br /> The storyline is somewhat difficult to follow sometimes, but in the end I find it all better. The end was unexpected, as you were almost dirty to think it would end otherwise. <br /> <br /> Regarding the acting, I think it was good. It won't be long for an Oscar award, but it caught my eye at least. Gil Bellows portrait of a prison man is not always perfect, but it is very entertaining. Shaun Parkes' portrait of Bellows Prison Clinique is huge and extremely powerful. I think I'll put Esai Morales's portrait of Markie on the back. <br /> <br /> Take my advice and look at this movie, or you will like or dislike it!
