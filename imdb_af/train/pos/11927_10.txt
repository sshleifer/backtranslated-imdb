Contrary to other baseball movies, this one particular movie has been featured due to great special effects and well-orchestrated soundtracks that were very interesting. Although I like this movie, it had some flaws, like some irrelevance (ie. At the end when Ray Mitchell hits a homer, he doesn't step on the board and it won't be a score. says I was really impressed with the film's presence and moral: Just believe, don't give up.
