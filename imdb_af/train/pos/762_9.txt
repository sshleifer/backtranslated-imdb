I enjoy watching people do it, especially if they do, as well as in the best scenes of this movie that brings you to a disco club called "Roxy". Especially at Christmas, because there is also a "MC Santa Claus". <br /> <br /> Even if it's an old movie, and even if I took it from TV, when Finland's state film archive showed it in the summer of 2004 on their own big screen, went there to check it out. It is much nicer on big screen than on TV. <br /> <br /> Even though many people here think it is on big screen, it's a waste of money for the ticket cost, I disagree with this and I think when I paid my ticket, I worth the money to see it as it is on a big screen, especially on the front row of the theater, an unforgettable experience, and much better than just video.
