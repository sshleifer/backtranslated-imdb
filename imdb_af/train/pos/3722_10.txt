First I saw this movie without knowing it and I just knew Joel Schumacher did it and it was enough for me. A friend and I saw it at a Danish film festival called the night film festival. There are many different movies that are shown after hours. The festival focuses heavily on showing movies that would not otherwise be shown in Danish theaters. / <br /> Anyway, my friend and I saw it and we were amazed at how really it looked and it really hit a chorus with our feelings. We really got caught up in the plot without finding out The film was recorded in a style reminiscent of the Danish initiative "dogma 95" which was started by 4 Danish directors, including Lars Von Trier (Dancer In the Dark) . <br /> <br /> Finally, the movie is really worth seeing that it gives a different perspective on how things go for the American GI Joe, who goes out of school, to fight their country in battle to serve, far from home. <br /> <br /> Also, Colin Farrell is exceptional in this movie. I haven't seen him before, but I can't wait to see. more of him. <br /> <br /> Lars P. Helvard
