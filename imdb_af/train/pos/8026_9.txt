Throughout this movie you can think this movie is just for kids. Well, it's mainly aimed at them, but it's also well-rounded with the jokes that are also shown to the adults in the audience. This time, the Muppet gang is trying to get Broadway, with urgent penalties to prevent them from producing it. But Kermit won't stop, and his determination keeps things moving until he gets the deal, he is hit by a car and sent in memory! <br /> <br /> It's a quote, partly, of those old 40-year-old drivers with musical, actually the subject of a musical. Only here are the usual lots of zaniness and wonderful moments that are thrown into a pot. From hysterical-funny moments (Lou-Zeeland's boomerang fish; Gonzo's water-stunt display, whispering campaign, among many others), but also with lots of hearts. The Muppet writers are not ashamed of the conventions, on the contrary, they embrace them to the point where it is almost refreshing to see such a show on a show story, where thick and think the characters will meet their dream . <br /> <br /> While not quite as original as the Muppet Movie, it has very catchy and memorable songs, great locations across Manhattan, and even some intonations of inter-species dating (and marriage)! Camos include Liza Minneli (a frog?), Elliot Gould (as policeman), Brooke Shields (depicted by a rat), Edward I. Koch, Gregory Hines and Joan Rivers. So be ready to sing along, or just a very big laugh and romantic (yes romantic) times with one of the best Muppet movies.
