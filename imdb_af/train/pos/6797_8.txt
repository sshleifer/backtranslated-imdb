A few bad reviews for this and I understand why, but treat it as a low-budget serial killer movie and you might get more of it than most. <br /> <br /> I thought it worked in a way, because I felt dirty and wanted to take a long shower, so some success is it? <br /> <br /> I'd say there's just the right level of sleaze here to get under your skin although the play might be a bit too uneven. David Hess is just in this brilliance, so don't get your hopes too much if you like Last House. <br /> <br /> Other than that - worth it.
