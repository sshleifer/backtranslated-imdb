My mom took me to see this movie when it came out around Christmas 1976. I loved it and I love it. I know everyone makes Barbra's hair in this one, but I think she looks and sounds good! ... And I seem to remember a number of women who copied what was currently accessible! Also the bathing place between Streisand and Kristoferson is just as sexy! The music is also good. These are the groovy 70's Babs at its best!
