Whatever you become in your life, never forget that you have roots. This is the story of true facts made in a beautiful and moving movie! I dare say that this movie is well underestimated. It shows us a reality of life. The more evil around you, the better you become. Trust your instincts and be aware that the ideal of life is to make it happy. ... without resentment, without living "under a rock". The movie concept is more interesting ... linking storytelling to real-life events. Keep us aware of everything. From facts to emotions! Bless these people and make everyone happy! See it, I recommend it to all young people. It's not about racism, it's about living your life!
