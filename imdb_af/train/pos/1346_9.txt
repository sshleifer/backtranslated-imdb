As a "rebuttal" of all sorts to the AFI's top 100 films, the British Film Institute worked out a documentary with Martin Scorsese. <br /> <br /> Now. I am a great film lover and proud of many, many movies. But I am now compared to my idol. In this fantastic (though long) documentary film Scorsese the viewer through various stages of American History on film. It is divided into several sections, including the Western, the Gangster movie and the Noir. Plenty of bouncy enthusiasm, Martin Scorsese is a great tour guide as well as a fantastic professor.
