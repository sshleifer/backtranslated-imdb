This was my favorite movie as a kid, and I was in stage production several times. It will always remain my favorite musk and I doubt anyone can ever repeat Oliver Twist's story on the screen, any better than this one. done. <br /> <br /> My all-time favorite 'bad guy' should be Oliver Reed as Bill Sikes. Not only did he frighten my life when I saw it as a 6-year-old, but now as a woman I can help more with Nancy's character, the bartender / prostitute, who helps Oliver to earn his living earned. <Br /> <br /> Jack Wilde, as the artistic dodger, was fantastic, and I don't think anyone can ever think of him as Fagin's street voter and best friend. The music is fantastic, especially Fagin's numbers, I am also very grateful that they did not give Bill Sikes a musical number, it would not have worked for him to be such a sinister character. <br /> <br /> I think Carol Reed made an excellent job of Nancy's tough end, and it held a G-rated movie by disguising her but giving enough away to Bill's violence to her to show. <br /> <br /> This movie is both charming and charismatic as a musical sing-along, as well as a moving drama that follows a young boy as he tries to find where he belongs in life.
