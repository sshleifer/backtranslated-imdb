These films do not make any pretentious effort to hide his true genre - a camping B movie. It will stand flat, tell you in the beginning the definition of camp. It also had to give the adjective meaning of cheese. But the two come together in this movie in ways that let you go, "Hmmmmm ... it's so stupid!" and then you laugh. For example, there is a scene back in the "16th century Japan", which shows some samurai walking in the foreground of a temple. In the background of the temple, there are several tourists who look in the distance in slippers and shorts. Hmmmm ... hahahah! I couldn't stop laughing. And the play goes from decent, to tolerable, to oh my lord, but it makes it funny. You will see some decent actors and then really find others terrible. I have to deviate somewhat because I have seen Stephanie Sanchez in various plays and she is wonderful. However, her airtime in the movie was pretty short. During my visits to Bryan Yamasaki I also saw several plays on the islands, and he is also better at the theater than in this movie. Anyway, it's an entertaining movie, if you can't do anything on a weekday evening.
