Two adventurous teenagers, best friends, take a trip to Thailand for one last experience before they turn off and go to college. It looks like a fun time to tour an exotic country until they meet an attractive stranger who seduces them to take a trip to Hong Kong and put drugs in their luggage. They are strangled by local police and find that justice in Asia is very different from justice in the US. <br /> <br /> This is the main story line for "Brokedown Palace" and it was a good one. The film does a decent job of portraying the arbitrary and corrupt legal system of third world nations. Actually, the depiction was slightly mild, as prison conditions were often worse than portrayed. It serves as a reminder that, no matter how bad we think our legal system is, it is unspoiled compared to the rest of the world. Unfortunately, there were too many confronted situations in the movie. that hampered the story. The whole escape attempt was false fantasy. To think that friends would be able to smuggle money for a gift in prison in a stuffed bra, and not discovered by the guards who systematically reviewed everything brought in by visitors, or the guards or the viewers completely blocked. <br /> <br /> The story also fails to bring closure to the following question how the drugs got in Alice's (Claire Danes) backpack. Did she actually agree to transport the drugs? We still have to guess. It was interesting to guess about the girls' innocence throughout the film, but we never really end up knowing whether one or both girls can be guilty. Except for this considerable error, the end was excellent and the results unexpected. <br /> <br /> The acting of Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale was very good and well done. Danes, who was over-sold and overheated, actually came as an actor in this film. Although her depiction was often immature (such as her character), she improved as the film progressed and the circumstances worsened. Beckinsale, in contrast, flew her whole short career under the radar and shone like the good-two-shoe that suddenly found her in jail. Her was the best performance in the film. <br /> <br /> Bill Pullman was mistaken for the lawyer. His crazy and diffident style is an asset in films like "While You Were Sleeping", but as a third-world lawyer on a crusade to free two innocent girls of injustice, he had the wrong personality. <br /> <br /> The tourist's look at Thailand was interesting, but it didn't let me go. <br /> <br /> Overall, an entertaining movie has undeniably been made in parts by adding some ridiculous scenes. I gave it a 7/10.
