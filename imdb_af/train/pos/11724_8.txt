Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) is hosting a cheap horror program. After finding out that her dead aunt had left her a few things, Elvira went to England to pick it up, hoping it would be money. But for her abomination Elvira finds out that all her aunt has left her, is her home, her dog and a cookbook. Elvira decides to settle in the house anyway, but with her striking darkness and her beautiful features she will not be able to live in peace. All the neighbors are now turning the whole town against her, and with Elvira's outrageous attitude and looks, everyone looks better, because Elvira is on fire! I really enjoyed this movie, it's really fun to get Elvira in all these adventures, she's just fantastic. The whole movie puts you in a Halloween mood, it's stupid and the jokes are cheap, but it's a pleasure to see it. I'll give Elvira, mistress of the dark 8/10
