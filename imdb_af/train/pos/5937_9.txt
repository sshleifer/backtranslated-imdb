Having seen the "Batman Dead End" short, I didn't know what to expect from World's Finest. Of course, Superman And Batman. All my world's finest comics have them as teamwork. <br /> <br /> Having seen this 3-and-a-half wicket, it has prevented me from becoming a serialized movie for World's Finest, or not a truly full movie. <br /> <br /> Sure, some of the Superman stuffs were cheesy, but movie theaters are always teasers, giving you only certain aspects of the whole product. It seems to need a complete product. <br /> <br /> Unlike director Sandy Collera's family member, who plays a painful arm Perry White, most of the actors were unknown. If a real movie is made, actors will be thrown to fit the bill for the movie, although I believe Nina Kaczorowski will make a good Lois Lane, especially if the dialogue is closer to the character. <br /> <br /> Good to see Clark Bartram wearing the Batman Costume of Dead Duck, but it needs to be a little more updated and not like the 40-year-old Batman with the 80s 90s cape and - cow not. His attitude is Batman-like, but I'm still wondering about the validity of white contact lenses instead of just showing his eyes through the mask. I believe the aim was to get it as close to the comic character as the movie person. <br /> <br /> Michael O'Hearn can't play Superman, the era. He looks at his face with a sturdy look, simply "slap me." And line delivery seems to be a problem with him. <br /> <br /> Overall, I'd like to see a full story and movie based on this ingenious piece of work. There was a rumor about a world's best movie, and with the right additions to the writing, it could be. Hope more like this is made.
