I just saw a press show of this movie and I was pleasantly surprised. Not often is it that I can see all my favorite actors in one movie at a time. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the squatter center and it was good to see Rachael Bilson and Hayden together again. I think their camera chemistry is a direct result of their time with the camera. My favorite scene was surprisingly so, Britt Ratner's piece ... Without giving away too much, I'll just say there's a surprise that makes you hang. <br /> <br /> The old couple were really good together and you really got the impression they were spending a lifetime together. <br /> <br /> Both the Chris Cooper and the Ethan Hawke segments packed a punch of surprises that look realistic and similar to the experiences I had in the big apple. All the movies are a great place to take a date ... especially if you already love the city. <br /> <br /> I can't wait for the next in the cities of love.
