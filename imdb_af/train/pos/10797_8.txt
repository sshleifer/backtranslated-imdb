Composed, elegant Carol (wonderfully played by beautiful Rebecca Brooke), her cute husband Eddie (like David Houseman), Carol's wacky, eats the best gallant Anna (beautifully set up with contagious comic zeal by beautiful Chris Jordan) and Anna hunky, amorous man Pete (a typical fine Eric Edwards) is a quartet of freed swingers who like to have regular group sex with each other. Their usual routine is disrupted when Carol's lonely, repressed but still attractive widow's mother, Jennifer (a beautiful show by beautiful Jennifer Welles) drops for a visit. Soon Jennifer gets rid of and becomes a willing participant in the swingers' blithely pleasurable and uninhibited carnal lifestyle, with everyone except Carol who wants to deceive her. Author / Director Joe Sarno emphasizes a sharp, intrusive and remarkable investigation of suburban anxiety and the limitations of the sexual revolution of the entire wild'asyasy 70's; Sarno turns traditional middle class mores on their heads and further decorates them with a bold and challenging mother / daughter-incest subplot. In addition, Sarno uniquely discovers first-class acting role players. Welles and Brooke are both exceptional, with excellent support from Edwards, Jordan, Houseman, Arlana Blue as the roaring New Age sex therapist Shandara, and Erica Eaton as a bitter neighbor. Mrs. . Fields. Better still, all the women are very hot and seductive; Welles in particular steam on the screen seriously with her beautiful, mature figure and smoldering erotic presence. The sex scenes are really sweet and fairly explicit, but never noisy or boring. Stephen Colwell's bright, polished cinematography and Jack Justis bouncy, melodic acoustic folk score are both on the money solid and effective. Recommended watch for Sarno fans.
