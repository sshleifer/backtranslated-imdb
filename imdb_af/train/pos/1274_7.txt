Notice that anyone who doesn't like this movie and enjoyed it, said it wasn't as good as the book or that it was different from the book. <br /> <br /> I don't understand this kind of criticism. Books and movies are different media. While books have hours and hours to develop characters and story lines, movies have about 120 minutes. Yet, the film has the advantage of stimulating various senses: visual, sound, as well as imagination. I don't care if a movie is as good as or actually has an agreement with the book on which it is based. Who cares? I rate it for what it is. <br /> <br /> This TV movie was charming. An old and often seen story, prone to clich√©, can easily embarrass it. Riffen and Reeves, however, pull it off. A reviewer found Reefs far to old. I would never guess she was 40 when she made this movie. It is to her credit as an actress that she played an incredible 23-24 year old. I also think it's about the best thing Reeves ever did. The story could have been stronger, and I agree that the screen game could have been "harder". Nonetheless, it's worth looking at; It is clearly not a powerful love story, but rather a beautiful romance that will convince you that love is a strong emotion and a good victory. And it's nice to see a "love story" without the mandatory f # $% word, bare buttocks, or hours of rushing kisses. <br /> <br /> Finally, the musical score is excellent.
