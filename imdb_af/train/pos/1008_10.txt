I came into this excellent program this season 4 and since then I have seen all the episodes have all the episodes on DVD and are getting better and better with the seasons of 9 and 10. It may not have Richard Dean Anderson, but the addition of Ben Browder and Claudie Black still gave the performance even more power and original, even after 10 seasons. Unfortunately, the sci-fi channel got rid of this incredible show with no hop-off for an 11-season, but made two directly on DVD movie and hopefully more. Atlantis is still strong at its 4th seasons. And there is a third spin in the works, the stargate franchise is nowhere near dead. This TV show is a must-have for all sci-fi fans and people of genres, as it has such a wide variety of things to address at all ages and all kinds of people. Look IT !!!!! 10/10
