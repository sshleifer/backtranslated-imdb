For my life, why did this movie receive an R rating? While it's about carnivorous zombies, believe it or not, it's actually a good family-friendly movie - at least if your kids are 10 and older. Unlike traditional zombie movies, this one has an excellent sense of humor as well as traditional values ​​- even if it's a little twisted! The language is not a serious problem, there is no nudity and the movie style is definitely aimed at children (much like the old TV show "Eerie, Indiana"). Another knuckle has slapped an R rating! Believe me, most children have experienced worse violence than that and it just seems silly to make audiences think it's an adult-only movie. <br /> <br /> The story is in a parallel-type world. While the fashions, cars and mores appeared in 1953, in this bizarro world there was a fierce, recent zombie plague that resulted in the "zombie war" and massive changes in everyday life. At school, children are trained in armed fighting and there is a cute scene in the movie where the father gives his son a handgun and says he should keep it in his backpack "just in case"! As far as life outside school is concerned, it is also weird because people have now learned that zombies are not such a bad thing! Heck, using shock collars and training, can be made into slaves who can do your homework, clean streets, milk or, in the case of a very sick guy, be your "special friend". <br /> <br /> This film deals with one particular family who eventually buy their first zombie slave (played by Billy Connally). Mom is excited and her son slowly becomes the zombie's friend. Dad, on the other hand, is not convinced - as he was forced to kill his own zombie father years ago and he is not over yet !! Funny, irreverent and unique - this film should be seen by a much larger audience.
