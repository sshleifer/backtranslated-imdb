"The Matador" stars Pierce Brosnan as a burnt out assassin. He went to James Bond to seed, in tar, colored clothes, gold chains and an ugly hairstyle. Our struggling killer, Julian Noble, is in Mexico, trying to regain his nerve. Staying at the same hotel is a beloved businessman Danny Wright (Greg Kinnear) who also tries to regain his balance. Danny is desperate to sign a deal and return to his good-natured wife, Denver (Hope Davis). <br /> <br /> Noble and Wright become unexpected friends. Wright convinces Noble to reveal certain techniques he demonstrates at a bullfight. Noble is eventually targeted by his employers and shows in Denver. <br /> <br /> Author and director Richard Shepard did the Q&A to this beautiful movie at the Austin Film Festival. Shepard was also on his luck. After losing his agent and rejecting recent scripts, he decided to write a story that no one would buy and create a character no one wants to play. Then Pierce Brosnan called. Brosnan regains its equilibrium in this movie. (There is life after Bond!) He has a wonderful flair for self-defeating comedy. Don't miss it. <br /> <br /> Stay for the closing credits to read what bullfighting filmmakers are saying. I'm looking forward to more of Richard Shepard's projects.
