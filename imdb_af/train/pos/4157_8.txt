This early Anime movie was a pretty good movie I once caught on the Science Fiction channel when Anime was really popular here in America and not the math rating that adult swimming claims it is on the cartoon network. I honestly think it has less to do with the fact that it is less popular, and more so because people buy CDs rather, look at the episodes that are uncut on the internet. This movie probably didn't have so many tracks and the voice work was okay for a baptized movie, although I'd rather see the original Japanese version. Americans tend to use some rather annoying voices for children in anything mentioned. This movie has a young boy driving a train called the Galaxy Express in the hope that he can make it to a planet that has the technology to make him into a robot. He wants to become a robot to avenge his mother, who has been brutally murdered in the hands of a robot hunting the people for the people. In the course of his adventures he becomes friends with the various workers aboard the train, as well as a woman who looks like his dead mother, a beautiful woman named Matel, who, as with most women in Anime movies, is a secret what can really be good for our young hero, or really bad. He goes from planet to planet too, because the train stops several stops and he runs into a space pirate called Captain Harlock, who apparently died in his own animated cartoon. So the Galaxy Express basically finds its place in the universe. All in all, a very good ride with a rather strange and unexpected end. There would be a sequel, but it wasn't quite as good as this one, but the end was a little more final than it was.
