A must-have for any punk rocker, this is the movie the Ramones made a household name in the early 1980s (when it first appeared on premium cable stations). It was one of the first and best of the American Punk Rock movies, with a cult classic status up there with The Rocky Horror Picture Show. Originally the producers wanted to have Cheap Trick as the stars, but the release of the album Live At Budakon just made them superstars and too much an item to be in a low-budget movie. Congratulations to the Ramones who wanted to break out of the underground punk rock world and into the mainstream market (which unfortunately never happened after the tires fell out). The group, Dee Dee, did not particularly like the movie over the years, but the fans always loved and could withdraw most of the movie while waiting to enter the Ramones exhibitions. This movie, like most classics, is silly fun with classic Ramones footage in their heights. Don't expect more, you won't find it. It's nice, enjoy it. Another Allan Arkush classic movie in a similar vein is Get Crazy, with Lee Ving of the legendary hardcore punk band Fear.
