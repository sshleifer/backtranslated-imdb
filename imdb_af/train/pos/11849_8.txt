If only ALL animation was this great. This film is classic because it is strong, are two simple aspects: Story and Character. The characters in this movie are beautifully personalized. I felt for all the characters, and the relationship between man and animal in the movie worked perfectly. The beautiful animation and 3-D computer animation didn't work better in any other movie. It's a great movie for kids, and for adults who want a classic hero's journey. 8 out of 10.
