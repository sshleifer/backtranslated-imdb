It is by far the funniest short of the two comic geniuses. From the time they walk, to the time Hardy just falls from the roof, it keeps me laughing hysterically. I strongly suggest that every fan of Laurel and Hardy should see it short. I also recommend all the Ghost Series. If you're looking for laughter, see this movie and you'll be happy.
