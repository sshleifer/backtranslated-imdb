The film is very enjoyable with a good role and an excellent direction by James Eves. The movie is entertained with a very charismatic performance by Stephanie Beecham and everybody is thrown perfectly. James Eves has a good eye for the casting and director like a conductor who knows exactly when the action should be, falls and then rises to a peak. He does this with an element of humor, many twists, excitement and blood. It's a return of the old vampire movie, with lots of gore, blood and screams. The movie works with great speed and the characters take you on a terrific adventure, but what makes it work is that the movie doesn't take him too seriously with a lot of tongue in the cheek. Great!
