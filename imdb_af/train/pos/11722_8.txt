To be honest, I watched this movie just because of my puberty needs. I mean, I couldn't get women at my age (I was 9 or 10), so I thought Elvira's fission was the dress for sex. <br /> <br /> I finally had a great time with this cult classic about horror comedy, Halloween parties, sassy humor, and some sexy evil shown by Elvira. <br /> <br /> They just don't make movies like this ... It has the feel of an amateur effort mixed with a host style for a late night cable show. <br /> <br /> The truth is that it has generated many fans because it has humor and the ability to do through Cassandra. <br /> <br /> It's classic that reminds me of the good days of the US all night.
