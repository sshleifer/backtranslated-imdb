Personally, I couldn't be in 'It's not a love song', it's a brilliant movie and there's a great story line. I just found that I checked the time on my phone every two minutes to see how much was left of the movie. <br /> <br /> I love the relationship between Spike and Heaton, close to being dependent on each other to come alive. At the same time, I wish the relationship was more than it is. Heaton is in love with spike, but Spike Ibsen is not in love with Heaton, or he doesn't know how to love him. The betrayal, on both parts, has a great influence on the two men. They were both devastated by the fact that the others ran away and left them, at a time when they really needed each other to survive.
