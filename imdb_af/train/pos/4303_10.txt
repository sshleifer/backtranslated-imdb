It's a great movie with a star cast and some good acting. I never get tired of seeing it. I especially love the scene where Danny Glover's character and Kevin Kline's character, Simon and Mack, go along. Kevin Kline is such a natural and it seems his ways are effortless and one that you will often experience. SO this is a very 'real' movie. <br /> <br /> However, one of the most powerful scenes in the movie is at the start of the movie when Simon arrives at the scene where Mack's car broke down. The movie also has a strong message and is in contrast to the stereotypical message that film carries, where one person preaches his guts to an audience. Instead, the actors' emotions and situations deliver an impactful message that does best without the use of words. And finally, Mary McDonell is brilliant as always.
