The most hilarious and funny Brooks movie I've ever seen. I can watch the band 100 times and watch it again. I laughed a ** and I cried for a few moments. It's really a good and funny movie, and if you like Brooks, it's a must! In short - Brooks (billionaire) gets homeless for 30 days to win the whole poor district of his rival. The reality bites, but in the end it is about the warm relationships between people ....
