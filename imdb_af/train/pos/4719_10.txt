This movie is why I found this site. I couldn't find this movie anywhere else! I'm so glad we found it here! We rather watched it on TV and desperately wanted to find and buy it and were interested in several friends to buy it. Another poster said it was boring, although I have to say it's NOT. Especially if you are a horse person, you will love this movie. The horses are wonderful, well trained and the movie is well done. This is definitely one we will buy for our home DVD library. We will recommend it to our friends. The band made between man and horse in this movie was so inspiring and made you spend more time with your horses. This is definitely a movie we will watch several times.
