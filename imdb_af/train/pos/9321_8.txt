As romantic comedies go, it was a cute and friendly one. I thought the writing might have been stronger to build the final connection a little better, but it's not a big exchange point. But Amanda Detmer and Scott Wolf give fun performances and are as charming as ever. These are two of my favorite actors, and I was just happy to see them throw as romantic guides. I hope they will be entering more projects soon. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie won't change your life, but it's sweet, hot and winning. Not a bad thing at all.
