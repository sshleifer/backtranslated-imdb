What could you say about a show of this magnitude? "The Sopranos" literally redefined the television as we know it. It broke all the rules and set new standards for television excellence. Everything is flawless, the writing, directing and for me, most of all, the acting. If you look at this view, you realize that these characters are NOT really. The play steps you to think there is a real Tony Soprano, or any character. This display is also very versatile. Some people do not look at the show, because it is violent. It's not just about violence, it's about business, family and much deeper things that all depend on what you see as a fan. For me, I don't like when people refer to the show, a show about the Mafia. For me, this is a show about family. A family separated from the gang by generations. Overall it is a masterpiece of a show. That's what television should be. Here. Complex characters of beautiful plays, wonderful story lines of brilliant writing, and what do you get when you mix these ingredients together? A show that determines excellence, and dares to be different.
