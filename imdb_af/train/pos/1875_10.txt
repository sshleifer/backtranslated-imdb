A beautiful high quality film. <br /> <br /> Apparently based on true events that, as said, have the clear ring of truth about it, this movie is highly emotional and deeply moving. <br /> <br /> An abused and neglected child often matures into adulthood, as it is one of life's failures, be it a gangster, a drug addict or a burden on society. <br /> <br /> Antwone Fisher as a young adult in the fleet is upset. He's on the verge of a loser. He is consulted by a psychiatrist in therapy and this is the relationship that occupies the center of the play. <br /> <br /> In flash-back and therapy, the source and remedies for Antwones anxiety are revealed. <br /> <br /> Outstanding performances of the whole role. The story is actually a family tragedy with emotional and physical torment. All the actors give full-blown performances with conviction and realism. <br /> <br /> One message from the movie is the importance of educating children properly. <br /> <br /> The real Antwone deserves success. To endure anger as a child, but to rise above it shows a beautiful character. <br /> <br /> And for all who were out there, such an affliction has endured, but to survive and succeed: you are all winners. 10 out of 10.
