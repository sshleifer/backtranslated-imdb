Pandro S. Berman was "In Charge of Production", but it made him the so-called Line Producer. But who made this epic, not filmed in Arizona, but in California's Mohave Desert where painters have completed all the remains of the "golden temple", the Thuggee huts, the British outpost in Muri, the town of Tantrapur, and so on. . Minor technical errors can and must be forgiven. What is unforgivable is the lack of an Oscar for the best music, although the Academy did not have such offers. A single theme was played in several temples, including waltz, mars and sweet, mood. Brilliant! One of the curious aspects of the production was the widow Kipling's claims. An actor playing Kipling appears shortly before and after the battle tones. In the initial release, his scenes were cut, according to Mrs. Kipling's claims. Later they were included and borrowed a "bond" from Kipling's immortal poem to Ben Hecht's script. Interestingly, this very typical and pro-British story was by a great screenwriter who had hated the British himself.
