In 1933, Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler sang and danced by three Warner Brother musicians who gave the depression-era audiences an instant distraction from their misery. Gold Diggers of 1933, 42th Street and Footlight Parade were all in the world of Broadway Theater with basically the same theme of the show should continue. In addition to Keeler and Powell, the films featured the kaleidoscopic choreography of Busby Berkeley, stopping songs and many of the same supporting players. <br /> <br /> Though they are probably classic of their genre, but I need a clear preference for Footlight because of the pace energy and lead James Cagney. Warren William in Gold Diggers and Warner Baxter in 42nd Street freed themselves as the show production heads - especially Baxter as the burned Julian Marsh looking for one last box smash. However, both lack the Cagney's contagious energy, which perfectly complements the awful pace of a Broadway musical. He is an absolute storm, as he deals with production numbers, unscrupulous partners and a gold digger. <br /> <br /> Of course, Cagney alone doesn't make Footlight the classic it is. The screenplay cracked with a few sharply double intruders delivered by a superlative supporting role player with Frank McHugh, Hugh Herbert, Guy Kibbee and especially Joan Blondell who cut to size. Busby Berkeley's dance numbers are surreal, suggestive and risqu√© and just before the advent of the Hollywood code in 34. Unfortunately, the thirties and a few times out there will never see such a rich musical instrument with the verve and sass or footlight. again. Honesty and morality ensured this.
