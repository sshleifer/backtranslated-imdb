I'm going to keep this review short and sweet. <br /> <br /> I saw the trailer for this and thought I'd give it 5 minutes in the house and my first thoughts were "what's the hell?" But after 10 minutes I was hooked and after 20 I picked up my jaw from the floor. This film is a good example of how different a movie can be, and furthermore it is French. This film is a high-art eye candy in a neat futuristic film noir package, the motion recording is very clever and the black and white animation style is not gray, although it did not initially do for me, I have me and the end of the movie and I found myself making every movie like this. I think my opinion was helped by the great dubbing, it would have been very easy to destroy it if they didn't land as many respected actors as many voting actors don't give characters to the characters (just look at a Hong Kong legend film in English for a perfect example) I gave it 9, although I gave it an extra 2 because of how fresh and new the whole thing feels ....
