Will Smith again in a movie about a man with the weight of the world on his shoulders and his crusade to rectify his injustices in a way that will even touch the hardest hearts !!! Author Grant Nieporte and Italian director Gabriele Muccino come together to create a masterpiece that I strongly recommend to buy and keep in your movie collection, as you will never get tired of watching or feeling this movie !!! I have the highest respect for Will Smith because he is not only a brilliant actor, but one can say he has a real love for people and life that undoubtedly made him perfect for the character (IRS Agent Ben Thomas) what he played in this movie. You will feel yourself pain and anger, the frustrations about his love for Emily, played by Rosario Dawson, who was fantastic at that time. I fell in love with the fact that their characters fell in love. Woody Harrelson also starred in this Top Notch movie. I find it very difficult to write this review without giving important plot points. All I can say is watch it and if you make sure you have nothing to interrupt, retrieve the phone, sit back and get ready to start trying the IRS Agent Ben's mysterious life and past Thomas to unravel ... Thank you Will Smith for another great movie !!!
