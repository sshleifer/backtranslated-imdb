I don't see how this show is like the OC. <br /> <br /> First, the OC centers around teenagers and their parents who are trying to get through life. North Shore is about a hotel staff trying to run the hotel while having a social life. Secondly, the OC takes place in California. North Shore takes place in Hawaii. <br /> <br /> And why would Fox make a show, just like one of his other shows on the same network? I think it's a good performance with good actors for the most part. It has a good story and plot. I like the events that happen and how people care for them and work them out. The most recent episode was surprising how the story worked out. It was not predictable as most stories at most shows. <br /> <br /> I hope Fox likes it on the air.
