I just watched Antwone Fisher on BRAVO. What a fantastic movie and amazing young man. This movie is a must see for anyone dealing with how to overcome child abuse and abandonment as an adult. Denzel Washington puts an excellent performance as well as the young man playing Antwone Fisher. Kleenex Warning - Feel Good and Tearful. The most sad moment is when he finally meets his mother, which he has taken away from 2 months. And one of the bravest was when he got up for his abused foster mother and sister. I saw this movie in Bravo in 2008 and just wish I knew about it many years ago. Definitely a movie to add to my DVD collection.
