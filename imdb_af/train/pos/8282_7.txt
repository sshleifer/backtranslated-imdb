** POSSIBLE SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Most of the movie not working is the Wendigo, and if your title character fails, your movie is usually not far behind it. The filmmakers' interpretation of the Wendigo's form is interesting and can be properly threatened when filmed correctly. For example, if the killer sees the Wendigo in his rearview mirror, and the tree shape is really good. However, as a sample character, it never really occurs. We don't get much of an explanation for his actions, and what we see from this doesn't coincide with the story told in the movie itself, or any Wendigo lore I've ever read. <br /> <br /> I think one of the main reasons why the monster fails is that it's not enough to do in the movie. If you cook this movie on the legs, it is a tension player with a bit of a supernatural element, rather than a movie about a monster. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is good, even though it's a little bit of Wink; The filmmakers use scenery, lighting and time of day to convey atmosphere and mood. Otis' character comes across as really dangerous and unpredictable, making him the right monster in the movie. It might have been more effective in explaining his behavior, as he was in possession of the hungry spirit of the Wendigo, which would be more accurate as well. <br /> <br /> I have heard unconfirmed reports (from a newsgroup) the reason why the Wendigo doesn't do much, that's when the monster pack is built, liquidated it so heavily and uncomfortably on imitated hooves, the artist had to walk on his toes that it was almost impossible to run, walk or otherwise do it. So the very flashes of the essence stand still, and the obviously jumped up footage thereof runs. I emphasize that these reports are unconfirmed.
