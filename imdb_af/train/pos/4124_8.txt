Lloyd Bridges as Mike Nelson and his boat were all the stars of this series. What made me so good when I watched it was the right feeling to go underwater. The display shows a youthful energy energy for the exploration underwater that is infected. <br /> <br /> The show was educational and also has the viewer's things about the dive of someone who seems to be a finished pro, Mike Nelson. There were excellent performances, and the program always seems to be well-produced. Admittedly, the drama in the scripts sometimes touches on the same notes in more than one episode, but each performance holds its own with any other performance produced during this era, the American television era.
