There were some great moments of reality depicting contemporary life (not just in Japan, but everywhere). It shows how kinkling cultures can be, and wants to break out of the shape it has created for you. <br /> <br /> The dance was just a vehicle to say "do what you love, even if it's against the norm". Rather Billy Elliot as I would say. I also enjoyed the movie. <br /> <br /> The humor was well-timed, and the touch moments felt like that, you could feel the discomfort between Sugiyama and his wife, the tantrums in the dance hall. I loved Aoki - he and that wig and his excess on the dance floor just cried me! <br /> <br /> The actors have all done a wonderful job, the story is well written. I watched it a second time and caught some small nuances I missed during the first show. Good entertainment!
