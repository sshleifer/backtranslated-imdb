This comedy with many underlying pain and sadness succeeds where most others fail. There are many movies of this genre with more notable actors trying to reach this elusive mix that did not come close to the depth and defect of this one. This is certainly because the exceptional film by Reg Rogers and Ally Sheedy seems so spontaneous that the reality of their characters grabs your interest and emotions quickly and keeps them throughout the film. Initially, the action looks rather out-of-the-wall and hardened, but one gradually learns that these two fairly pathetically damaged people are desperately and unwillingly trying to heal themselves, even if they are unwilling to do so. Rogers's heartbreaking facial expressions of numbness and Sheedy's angry outbursts are so eloquent that they feel like one of them is observing. You will care for these two nice but very suffering people and hope they will succeed, because it is in doubt and everything depends on a tough emotional thread. Hopefully audiences will see more of Reg Rogers and Ally Sheedy, as this film proves their merit as very perfect actors without a doubt.
