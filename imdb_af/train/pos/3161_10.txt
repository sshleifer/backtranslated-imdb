I didn't actually start looking at the show until it came to FX. I was bored and had nothing to look at and saw that the performance of the show was premier. I decided to see it. I was so upset that I didn't watch the show when it was first seen on tsv. was not broadcast. I loved the show so much! Finally a show for everyone to enjoy. I remember Full House and Family Matters and Step by Step and they were good but just not funny enough. They would make dumb jokes and sound about things that were just stupid, but didn't show those 70's. The 70s show was hilarious, clever and so real. I think it was the best show ever made and I'm very sorry it ended. Although I like this show, I think it should have ended on the seventh season when Eric and Kelso left. The previous season was just not right, Eric was the main character and the show had to end when his character left. I still love this show and I hope TV starts with more apps like this.
