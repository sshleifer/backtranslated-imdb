I had the opportunity to see this 1926 movie in a wonderfully restored theater that was once part of the extensive Paramount chain of Vaudeville homes. This Paramount has a Mighty Wurlitzer organ? We were also fortunate enough to play Dennis James, a key figure in the international revival of silent movies at the Mighty Wurlitzer. music and thematic compositions that match the action on the film. The print was an almost perfect digital copy of the fast-paced nitrate negative and the whole experience was a one-off opportunity to see a silent movie as it was meant to see. <br /> <br /> This was Greta Garbo's first American movie. She was only 20 years old, but already has 6 Swedish films in her repertoire. <br /> <br /> It is somewhat ironic that it is a silent film about an opera star; Although the Mighty Wurlitzer added incredibly to the mise-and-scene, it was necessary to imagine much. <br /> <br /> Modern audiences don't usually understand silent movies? Acting was different, with vast gestures and broad facial expressions. Why do audiences hear at inappropriate times? the play is seen as "hammy" and over-done ?? but it was simply the style of the era. <br /> <br /> Garbo, with all her subtlety, has done a lot to enter the new age of acting: she could say more with a half-closed eye and read volumes in a downward or simple shoulder. She illustrates the truism that a picture is a thousand words. <br /> <br /> Although it's Garbo's first American movie, it's pretty clear that the studio knew what they had on their hands. It was MGM filming at its best. The sets and costumes were wonderful. The special effects ?? which according to today's standards is pretty weak ?? was still electrifying and wonderful. <br /> <br /> The script by Vicente Blasco Ibanez (from the novel by Entre Naranjos) looks tailored to Garbo; it shows its strengths, enriches its assets and there is no difficult language problem to deal with: a Swedish actress can play a Spanish requester without any dissatisfaction on our part. <br /> <br /> Her co-star was MGM's answer to Rudolph Valentino: Ricardo Cortez. He does an admirable job and has done something that few romantic stars of the day would ever have done in a movie: let himself be fleeting, foolish and aging. <br /> <br /> There are fairly good character parts that are more than adequate? especially if you consider the power tree that Garbo is considering. Notable among them is Lucien Littlefield as 'Cupido' and Martha Mattox as 'Do√±a Bernarda Brull.' <br /> <br /> That's when the extraordinary film, William H. Daniels, met Garbo? they made 20 movies together. (He was the filmmaker of 157 movies and his career played five decades!) He was able to capture her ethereal beauty and it was his photography that was primarily responsible for the moniker with whom she became known: The Divine Garbo. Without his beautiful abilities, she wasn't the success she was. <br /> <br /> Seeing this movie is a rare event: if you ever have the chance, don't miss it.
