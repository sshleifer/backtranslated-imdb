I didn't see every one of Chan's movies, but it's definitely the best one I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The story in it itself is nothing special, so I did not go deeper into it. What makes it special is the stunts, the battles, the good acting, the warm sense of humor. The movie has a raging tempo already and you're just surprised to see it. All the cool stunts (of course made by Jackie himself) make you want to jump in the couch and scream. It's just fantastic! Even my mom was impressed with this cool movie when she saw it. <br /> <br /> I know this Police story can be a little difficult to hold, at least it's here in Sweden. But I can assure you, it's worth it.
