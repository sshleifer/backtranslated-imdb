Who doesn't know Largo Winch in the trio of France-Belgium-Luxembourg (the three countries where the French "BD" or "Bandes Dessinees" are published massively)? 18 years after the publication of the first comic book, which itself is a modification of a series of novels, it had to be adjusted on screens. After a first and unsuccessful attempt on a TV program, the right thing starts. <br /> <br /> First of all, and that's what most of the fans don't get, the purpose of this movie is not strict To adjust the comic book series. Some essential parts, characters and actions of the original are missing. The movie itself offers an alternative and more modern version of the series. As a 1st class fan of the comic book, I must admit I was pretty surprised. The actors are good, so is the scenario, although it may look too fast. So I recommend this movie to anyone interested in financial / political exciters, but this is clearly not an alternative to James Bond or Jason Bourne series as I could read on the internet.
