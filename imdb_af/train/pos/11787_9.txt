It's a short movie by David Lynch with just 8 minutes, but it has all the "Lynchian ingredients"! It is mysterious, dark, unbeatable, anxious and strange; And before the blonde girl starts talking, it's even a little scary! The soundtrack is exceptional to create this strange atmosphere because it's also sinister and mysterious? <br /> <br /> The environment itself does not have the "traditional" red curtains, but it has socks purple painted walls, which give it an equally honest effect. <br /> <br /> The plot is about a girl locked in a dark room and she is crying for help; then there is another girl who starts talking to her in a mysterious way and says she is there just because she owes it? We don't know what happened or what will happen next? it ended unresolved and mystery because a good Lynch movie must end! <br /> <br /> It's a big short, despite some amateur acting. The girls are professional actresses, but I think their actions could have been better in this brief.
