It's just the most amazing movie you'll ever see. I thought it's just another documentary, but it's really something else. It doesn't teach you anything, it shows you how life works in nature. <br /> <br /> I won't talk about the quality of the pictures, because of course you know of other comments, it's unmatched. <br /> <br /> The earth is funny, tense and sad. It can make you laugh, it can make you cry. Sometimes both at the same time. It's the first movie that made me cry, not because you feel sorry for the animals, but because you realize how fragile our planet is and what treasure we have blessed, but we don't appreciate it once. /> <br /> This movie must be displayed in schools compulsory. It's the most amazing movie you'll ever see, so watch it. Who knows, maybe this is the last time we can see our planet like this ... <br /> <br /> 10/10, but I'll make it easier if it was possible.
