I borrowed this movie from a friend to know nothing about it, and it seems to be an excellent documentary about a trip on an old boat across vast expanses. Thor Heyerdahl developed a theory that the old Incas in Peru managed to travel thousands of miles across the ocean to Polynesia, based on certain relics found in both places, certain types of ancient seagoing ships that we know were available, ocean and wind currents analysis, and the knowledge that the Incas has done, actually travel indefinitely at sea. <br /> <br /> In order to test his hypothesis, Heyerdahl and his crew construct a vessel as closely as possible to what the old Inca had available, using only balsa wood and other materials available at the time was, and from Lima, the capital of Peru, to reach the islands of Polynesia, about 5,000 miles away. <br /> <His theory, like so much about ancient history, is impossible to prove with 100% certainty, but the coverage of their journey strongly supports him. The movie is really little more than the storytelling of footage taken during the 100+ day expedition, but it is a very detailed description of what it was like and the trials and tribulations they faced. I often wish the Oscar-winning documentary documents were easier to find. This one over 50 years ago is still so interesting and informative, because I'm sure it was when it was first released.
