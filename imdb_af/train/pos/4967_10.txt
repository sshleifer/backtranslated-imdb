This movie is a must have for all people who enjoy football as art. The first time this movie is about a soccer world cup is how it is filmed. In addition to following the play as a TV broadcast, there is ample footage dedicated to following individual players in the games. It brings forth the emotions and situations these men go through when they try to reach glory. Today's TV broadcasting style, unlike that of 1986, is still inferior to this movie. <br /> <br /> The players are not the only stars. The audience, the referees, the journalists who cover the games and the environment themselves, all play a central role in developing what is history today. In this movie you can see how all these factors play in a very explicit way. In this respect, the television broadcasting style of today has not yet reached this level of quality, although it is now much closer than before. <br /> <br /> There are several highlighted players: Maradona (Argentina), Elkjaer and Laudrup (Denmark), Francescoli (Uruguay), Platini (France), Lineker (England), Rummenigge (Germany), Butrague # o ( Spain), Socrates (Brazil), and Sanchez (Mexico). <br /> <br /> This movie is not a collection of the best soccer movements of Mexico in 1986, although most of them are well covered. Over all the movies there is a tension to offer various aspects of the game and the competition itself based on the progress of these players and teams, even at the expense of transferring relevant games from the games themselves. This is what makes this film so interesting and unique. <br /> <br /> Because of Mexico's 1986 referees, much of the commentary on this movie and world cup is extremely Maradona biased. Many of these comments do not take into account that there is a referee and two regulators, that they are so human and players and that all of the above make some mistakes. Soccer rules do not allow referees to use TV-based replays to make decisions, so most referees must decide what they observe. As a result, referees play an active role in developing a game. Their influence can be seen in various parts of this movie. <br /> <br /> The sequel to the 1990 World Cup, compared to this one, is just a source of bitter disappointment. Many come from the fact that it has become too involved in the game, while this movie tells things from a distant, unbiased point of view.
