Across the country and especially in the political landscape, people with any political ambition should take time to watch this movie. The film is called 'City Hall', and with little imagination the synopsis can take place anywhere in America. It just happens to open in New York. Here we have the story of a popular politician named Mayor John Pappas (Al Pacino) with enough skill to manage a large metropolitan city with very little effort. His right hand is none other than deputy mayor Kevin Calhoun (John Cusack), an equally clear individual, whose ambitions are tied to his mentor and both look for higher office. Everything points in the direction until a police shoots an investigation fired by Marybeth Cogan (Bridget Fonda), who believes the debts to the city hall and the mayor. A six-year-old boy and a police officer are found guilty of a career criminal. His dubious freedom leads to apparent cover by political installments and city corruption involving union leaders, such as Danny Aiello, played by Frank Anselmo, corrupt judicial officials such as Judge. Walter Stern. (Martin Landau) and mafia bosses like Paul Zapatti (Anthony Franciosa) who are deeply involved. Also involved are some officials such as Larry Schwartz (Richard Schiff) who works for the New York trial office. But this is the link between the mayor and his deputy, tasked with the casual blast. A great vehicle for Cusack and a sure bet nominated to become a classic. ****
