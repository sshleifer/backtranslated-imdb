Those who have French and Germans have a long history of not keeping each other. It is interesting to note that Kamerdaschaft or Comradeship takes place in translation in 1931. Just a few years later, Hitler would invade Germany and his plans to take over the world, France is an accident of his ambitions. But these are times of serenity compared to the future. A group of miners at the border are trying to move to France to find work. They are sworn back and later at a nightclub by their French neighbors. Then there is a disaster in the mines of the French and a well-crafted and written scene, a group of German miners decide to come to the rescue. A simple story isn't it? Pabst was a poet of silent theater and I don't know if it's his first sound movie or not, but his poetry is there to be discovered. He is not picky, but brings a rough realism to the trial. It is even a glimpse into a World War II event that is the point of this story. Presumably based on a real event, the film does the events with pride and regency. Sometimes, that's what a movie should be.
