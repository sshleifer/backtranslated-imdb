Given the opposite circumstances of 2009 where the reality is, we do have a black president, but this movie has a rather powerful historical significance. For entertainment value, I found this movie to be both interesting and devious. Of course I was taken back by the blatant racism of the time, but also found the music and dance incredible. It is also very cool to see Sammy Davis Jr as a very young child actor. He plays Rufus Jones, a young boy comforted by his mother. He said, "Why can you be president one day?" It was so ridiculous in 1933 that it mocked and thought it was engaging, charming and funny. The bulk of the movie is a fantasy sequence of what government would be if it were run by a black man. They propose the seats of government as a revival baptism baptist church. <br /> <br /> One fact was when I stumbled upon this movie one day. It is really well done and very entertaining. I believe that if we can see racism, we can see this movie for everything it brings to us. Realizing that it's not just ridiculous to have a black president, but that's normal, makes this movie much more relevant. This clearly indicates a moment in time for our collective consciousness.
