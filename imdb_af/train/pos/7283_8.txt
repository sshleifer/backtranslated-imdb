I love buying those cheap, bad videos from Alpha Video. One day I bought this one. This is the perfect fool science fiction movie of the 50's, all slaughtered. Repeat with unscientific ALL, scarcely dressed girls and many melodramas, this is a pleasant movie, for those who appreciate these things. And if you can suspend enough enough, you can actually crawl - not just through the psychotic head or by beating the thing in the closet, but at the end, with the character of "the perfect body." This is so. . . . What is another word for understanding?
