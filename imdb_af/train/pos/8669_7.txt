If, unlike some of the commentators here, you do not have a class war and don't mind seeing the lives of other people who are reasonably successful, obliterated, bohemian, and not terribly English, then at a party there are no problems. as a result, it's not a bad movie, closer to the Euro theater rather than an imitation of the ordinary, slender American crap ... I believe the minimal sound design and cheap camera is a conscious decision rather than bad movie processing , I defend it, the movie isn't worse because of it, and it puts the spotlight on it, some of which are really good (Kate Hardie, thinks it's her name, as the sarcastic is drunk). One exception is David Baddiel, who should never be allowed to appear in serious things !! It's light, and we're not going for this kind of anatomy-of-relationship business in this country, but if you don't have real friends to go to a party than you can do worse than to sit in and watch this .
