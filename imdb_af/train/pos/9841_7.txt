I love cartoons. They can show things that movies with 'real' actors and scenery can't - although computer effects are changing. They can push the boundaries of satire ('The Simpsons'), good taste ('South Park'), spectacle ('Aladdin') or reality ('Toy Story'). There are a few good examples of this in the ice age, such as when we see a moderate herd of now-extinct mammals migrating across the countryside, like old friends. Such scenes are a pleasure to watch, as we get the feel of both the familiar and the alien at the same time, usually in a way that makes us laugh. While the ice age is not as good as the best animated movies of all time, it's a very funny movie. Sit back, enjoy the deliberate anachronisms, the beautiful backgrounds and the stomach. <br /> <br /> The story follows Manfred, the grumpy mammoth, Sid, an idiotic sloth, and Diego, a sabretooth tiger. human baby back to his tribe - for many different reasons. On the way, of course, they have many problems. Also throughout the journey, Scrat, the most unfortunate rodent of history, is desperately trying to bury an acorn for winter: in glaciers, on dead trees, in ice caves. His opening scene is a classic. <br /> <br /> It's a simple story with a very predictable ending and a means that is just a series of funny incidents with some character-building moments being thrown in, but some of the screens, like the cloth changing or the dodos, are hilarious, the animals are nice and it looks good. There is also a moment of sight, when cave paintings of mammoth come before Manfred's eyes. <br /> <br /> Not a must-see, but good for a fun hour or so. <br /> 7/10
