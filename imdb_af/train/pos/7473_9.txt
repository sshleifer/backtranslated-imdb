Oddly enough, this version of OPEN YOU eyes is more mature and more nuanced. With deterioration, Crowe's script is much stricter and more fleshed than Amenabar's original. The Spanish filmmaker needs to get credit first to think about the story, but there is no doubt that Crowe has improved on it - if only slightly. Note that you have no idea what the guidance in OPEN YOUR EYES has done, but you know almost everything about the lead in VANILLA SKY. That's what I mean by more "fleshed out."
