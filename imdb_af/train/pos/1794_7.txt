Halfway through Lajos Koltai's "night", a woman on her deathbed asks a figure that appears in her hallucination: "Can you tell me where my life went?" The line may be embarrassingly theater, but the woman who speaks it is Vanessa Redgrave, with the utmost simplicity, and the question breaks your heart. <br /> <br /> Again and again, the movie is based on Susan Minot's novel skirting sentimentality and ordinariness, keeping it up-to-date, offering admirable performances, and causing emotional involvement as few recent movies have. With just six months out of the year, there are now two memorable, meaningful, valuable movies in theaters, and the other is of course Sara Polley's "Away from her." Hollywood may have "Evening" turned into a smooth celebrity vehicle, with its two couples real-life mothers and daughters - Vanessa Redgrave and Natasha Richardson, and Meryl Streep and Mamie Gummer. Richardson is Redgrave's daughter in the movie (with a sister played by Tony Collette), and Gummer plays Stripe's younger self, while Redgrave's youthful incarnation is Claire Danes. <br /> <br /> Add Glenn Close, Eileen Atkins, Hugh Dancy, Patrick Wilson, and a great cast - yes, it could have turned into a multiple star platform. Koltai, the brilliant Hungarian filmmaker of Mephisto and director of Fateless, created a subtle ensemble work with a "Continental feel". The story takes place in a high community Newport environment, in the days that led to a difficult wedding. <br /> <br /> Missed connections, wrong choices, and conscientious social and family pressures provide quite a soap opera, but the quality of writing, Koltai's direction and self-serving acting. "Evening" path above the level, in the torn air of English, French (and some American) family stories from a century before its current environment. <br /> <br /> Complex relationships between mothers and daughters, between friends and enthusiasts, with the addition of a difficult triangle are all evident and understandable. Individual songs are woven into a symphony. <br /> <br /> And with all the emphasis on ensembles and selfless performances, the stars of "Evening" still remain by Redgrave, Richardson, Gummer (an exciting new discovery, vague looks like her mother, but '). a lot of other actress), Danes carries most of the cargo - until Streep appears in the last few moments and obviously steals the show. Dancy and Wilson are also worth the admission price. <br /> <br /> As with "Away from her", the evening stays with you long, reminiscent of his story and characters, Experience the emotions it causes. In two hours, the movie goes a bit long, but the way it stays with you is welcome among the many movies that go cold before your popcorn.
