Eventually I got the infamous "ice age". Aside from maybe not as silly funny as I had hoped after seeing the brilliant teaser, there's no bad word I can say about it. Certainly, it's not as glamorous as a Disney production. (It's also Fox's 1st attempt to make a full-fledged CG movie), but it has a tremendous heart and on some occasions (like the look in Manfred's eyes after we see the sad look of his past) I have myself on the verge of tears. But when they reunited the baby with his father, I couldn't hold them anymore. A movie that has no trouble walking on the thin line of juicy and clich√© and succeeds in bringing it more than its best; The end result is one of the most beautiful animated creations I've ever seen. Big funny characters that grow quickly on you (and also good voice talents) and many funny memorable scenes, especially of Scrat's name, make the movie more than enough reason to let it go. Plus the Dodo scene, which is my personal favorite 2002 funny scene. <br /> <br /> I don't get it honest, but for some reason it really looks like CG animation will prevail in the future. But if it just means there will be more movies like this one (and who can forget Pixar's creations), then I don't really think, at least for now. 9/10
