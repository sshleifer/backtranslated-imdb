I loved "Then in real life". A wonderful story story like you had a job or while sleeping, but not ridiculously full of sights and rough jokes, and not so romantic, it wakes you up. <br /> <br /> Dan Burns (Steven Carrell) is a popular advisory columnist who can't do things in his own life. Until a day, he meets at a family gathering and travels with Marie (the always beautiful Juliette Binoche) a radiant monster of a woman who seems to be touched in a lazy filter hearing, back to the stars of the classic theater. Chemistry happens over a cup of tea and muffin, but Marie must be down for a previous engagement and they must share ways. <br /> <br /> Later, we are treated to Dan's snatched, love-related family who not only have great breakfast, but also enjoy using the intelligent and fun-loving Dan as the bumps of many undergraduate jokes. What I liked so much was that although the family's characteristics may be considered unpleasant for some, I thought it was a good portrayal of a large family who didn't dare to parody or gross exaggeration. The Burns family is simply a close, loving group of people who are really interested in the best of Dan. There are wonderful uncomfortable family moments that are not unrealistic. The family is notion, but never intoxicated or shameless; strange, but never foreign. <br /> <br /> Then Dan falls in love with his brother's friend, he was brought to the family gathering. And so begins a rollercoaster of prolonged longing and funny love-budding. <br /> <br /> I can go on, but I thought it was just fantastic. It's not particularly hip or clever, never to say and obsessed with dry humor or bite, so many comedies are in the modern theater. There is a nice balance between storytellers and funny-but-real dialogue. In fact, early in the movie, the first spark of love begins with a whimsical discussion in a classic Hollywood-style conversation where the characters say what they think out loud. <br /> <br /> So I probably strangled and repeated myself, but I strongly recommend "Dan in Real Life". It's a good date movie, trust me, you'll laugh, and only if you're a neck like me, will get a little tearful eyes. Filled with fun and magical love, "Dan in Real Life" will not disappoint. <br /> <br /> ================= 3.5 out of 4 star grade: A
