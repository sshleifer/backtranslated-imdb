I thought this movie was fantastic. It was hilarious. Kinda reminded me of spinal tap. It's a must see for any fan of 70's rock. (I hope my friends and I are not so over twenty years old!) <br /> <br /> Bill Nighy gives an excellent performance as the off-kilter song singer trying to recover that old spirit, <br /> < Stephen Rea fits perfectly into the movie if the glue tries to keep the tape together but not successful. <br /> <br /> If you like music and are in a band, this movie is definitely for you. You won't regret seeing this movie. I know I don't. Even my family found it funny, and it says something.
