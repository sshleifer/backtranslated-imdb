A cricket head that accidentally kills, kills a murder suspect and then offends the crime, but has to deal with a guilty conscience while trying to resolve a murder case. Andrews and Tierney are reunited with director Preminger in a film noir that is as effective as "Laura," their previous collaboration. Andrews was perfectly thrown as the serious cop, a good man caught in unhappy circumstances. The acting is all around, including Malden as a tough police chief and Tully as Tierney's protective father. The script by Hecht, a large and resourceful screenwriter, is stiff and exciting, and Preminger creates a good atmosphere.
