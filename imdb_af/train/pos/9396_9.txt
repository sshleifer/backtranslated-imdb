In any number of movies, you can find Nicholas Cage as a strong, silent hero, Dennis Hopper, as a murderous mania, Lara Flynn Boyle, as a vamp / stump, and the late, J.T. Walsh as the heavy. These are the types of roles these four can play in their sleep, and they have done so often that they play the boundaries of the cliche again. What a relief, therefore, that John Dahl, a master to get a lot of action out of some action, fixed this nuanced noirish thriller. Hopper controls to keep off the top, Kage shows a little more depth than his usually superficial action heroes. Boyle is inexperienced, innocent and twilight, and one gets a sense of the hard iron of the soul that is central. after his character, Wayne. Dahl's direction gives a sense of the emptiness of the Big Sky country where the story takes place, while it is also intimate enough to show how a wrinkled forehead can radically change the plot in the store. The plot twists are, and one of the other big twists in this movie is that some of the supporting characters actually act as if they were brain. It is not often that underage characters such as deputy officials have more brain than their leading heads. But with a director as clever as Dahl, you shouldn't be surprised by the intelligence of anything related to this movie. An excellent movie.
