Usually in the 1940s, musical was a fixed formula - and if you study movies, you know what I'm talking about - a certain length, many "striking" appearances that were big on the surface but never in the right personality of the characters etc. <br /> <br /> THIS ONE IS DIFFERENT - and light years better and worth the nomination for the best picture of the year - 1945 (though it didn't have the chance to win the ultimate winner - Lost Weekend ). /> <br /> Gene Kelly was probably in the best shape of his career - yes I know about "American in Paris" and "Singing in the Rain". This one is different. He is really in his character of a "sea wave" (first) thinking that a girl goes up on leave "is nothing more than a lion. And if you had to make a "story" to get her - so be it - until. Kind of like the Music Man when he gets "caught his foot in the door". The ultimate dedication of the film comes mainly from his and his new peloton (Sinatra) 's attempt to make the "story" good to get the girl he really and unexpectedly in love with. You have to see the movie to see what I mean. <br /> <br /> In addition, there are so many other elements of big movie in this one, this is a classic buddy story, nostalgia until a time when World War II was almost over (the war ended about a month after the movie is released), a realization that a man who has always laughed at life can find out that he is really a good person, good songs and probably some other elements of classic filmmaking that I can't do now don't think. <br /> <br /> Why not a 10? Near the end - start feeling almost 2 1/2 hours a little long. There is a small ballet number that Gene Kelly does that should have been a sensation in 1945, but it seems dated and feels like it just adds minutes. But overall, this one is a definite winner on every level.
