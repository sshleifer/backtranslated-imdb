But today he seems to have established more in this kind of direct DVD / limited release roles and it looks like it is now more established in its forte. <br /> <br /> Here he has to raise a little issue about this. as hardened, cynical case lawyer Earl Babbage, one of the workers assigned to some hundred offenders in one area of ​​the US, who, along with his new protest, must take Allison Allthrop (Claire Danes) to his latest case, in the kidnapping of a young woman trying to forgive him for a cause he had failed years ago. <br /> <br /> It is a certain dive in the darker side of mankind, caught on material definitely not for the sick or those looking for light reading. And as such, it's a pretty strong, compelling movie, incomprehensible and not limited by it directly on DVD budget. The only thing that really pulls it back is the excessive use, fast cut-camera rows used in the more dramatic moments that seem a bit like it. But it's still some of the strongest material I've seen in Gere, becoming relentlessly darker and more over the edge as it goes. ***
