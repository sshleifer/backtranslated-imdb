My family goes back to New Orleans late 1600s early in the 1700s and in watching the movie I knew it was a story my grandparents never spoke about, but we knew it existed. Of course I have cousins ​​black aka African Americans and others who can "pass" and prefer to. It's a hard story to see when you realize it's your family they're talking about and that Cane River is all part of that history. It makes me want to cry and it kicks me the "ass" of my great grandparents who own those plantations and wonder how my grandmothers of African heritage lived under the oppressive and yet aristocratic existence. And at the same time I did not come from that history, I would probably not be the successful businesswoman that I live successfully in a fairly integrated world today. The acting was both excellent and fair, depending on the actor, but it is a movie needed to be made. Anne Rice is incredible and I ask myself why she is writing symbolically about my family and I am not. I recommend this movie to everyone. Leza
