The Fleischer Brothers, in an effort to find another "Warm Property" for adaptation, thought of their highly successful fortune in the world of the newspaper article with their 1933 production POPEYE THE SAILOR (Fleischer Studios / Paramount). Although it was part of the BETTY BOOP series, Miss. B. only briefly occurred; The rest is a pilot division for the possible emergence of a full blown series. <br /> <br /> As is now known, the gruff, scary, brawl sailor may have become the most successful comic strip ever; lending and literally living the Fleischers and their studio, which remains to this day. <br /> <br /> RETURN TO KING Characteristics for another, was undoubtedly the reason for the very popular HENRY Strip Strip character in a BETTY BOOP outing; Aim is the quest for another series. The reasoning was then certainly healthy. HENRY was a most popular feature in the Hearst Papers series; appears as a Daily and Sunday's Color Comics Supplement, PUCK, THE KOMICS WEEKLY. You know, "What fools are these deaths!" Do you remember one, Schultz? IN the cool, small, naked boy Comic Strip 'Hero' and his on-screen antics, both solo and tandem with me. Betty, to view; We were pleasantly surprised to see just how well the character was handled. The story and director Dave Fleischer both gave an abundance of comic strips and siggats that were most suitable for the character of little Henry. These mostly silent vignettes were very important to the animated film in the remaining faithful to the printed page; as the HENRY trait is mostly made in a kind of 4 color mime. <br /> <br /> In the cartoon, titled BETTY UPPER WITH HENRY: The FUNNIEST LIVING American (Fleischer Studios / Paramount Pictures Corporation, 1935), we see what is; basically be a one situational exercise; is played with the regular series Dave Fleischer's fast fire, machine-gun gags. In short, Henry sees a puppy in the window of Betty Boop's Pet Shop. This is a kind of love at first sight when Henry tries to buy the puppy with the only money he had, in coins in his pocket. He is in the form of Mrs Boop that it will be $ 2.00 in depression time to make the purchase. Tears appear as the baby leaves deceptively. <br /> <br /> But a delay is soon on the horizon, as Betty asks the boy to keep the store in mind as she goes on urgent matters. In return for his services, promise me. Betty gave him the little dog in return. Of course they have an agreement and Betty leaves. <br /> <br /> To get the job done of cleaning cages and feeding the livestock, the Fleischer Crew offers the opportunity to set up a whole new range of gags. This time with bird seed, Henry's bare path and shots. (But not everything, Schultz!). Henry's enthusiasm for the massive feeding of the store's bird population soon leads to the massive destruction of the birds; from the store to the open street in a massive jailbreak. <br /> <br /> BETTY returns to this face and expresses her disappointment and anger with Henry's temporary oversight. All the commitment was down, no doggie for Henry. He started to go away; discouraged; but soon convince the owner to give him another shot to fix things. His head is covered with bird seed, he manages to correlate all the small forty creatures; return them to their pet shop. Fortunately, the little leaves leave; but this time he has his own loving, small, face-leaning puppy. <br /> <br /> It was a winning combination indifferently. We have the carefree, energy-filled, free wheels of the boy, Betty's kindness and the emotions of the situation and the dubious outcome of the 'boy and his dog' situation. Max and Dave Fleischer gave us a kind of almost small mini-masterpiece of a surreal comedy card. <br /> <br /> We were quite surprised that no HENRY series followed. Judging from the fairly faithful treatment of the character, it could have been maintained for some time. Anyway, this teamwork was in many ways the best of Betty Boop's photos. Although the first, POPEYE THE SAILOR (Fleischer / Paramount, 1933) was the most successful (and hardly had a Betty Boop in it, except for a cameo as a carnival hula dancer); the HENRY card was much better than the two following King features, "tryouts", BETTY BOOP AND THE LITTLE KING and BETTY BOOP AND LITTLE JIMMY, both 1936. <br /> <br /> POODLE SCHNITZ !!
