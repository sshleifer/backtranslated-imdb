FUTZ is the only show preserved from the experimental theater movement in New York in the 1960s (the origin of Off Off Broadway). Although not for everyone, it is a truly brilliant, darkly funny, even more often deeply disturbing story of love, sex, personal freedom and revenge, a serious morality story, even more relevant at a time when Congress gay marriage bans by wasting our Constitution. The story is not about gay - it's about love and sex that doesn't meet social norms and therefore needs to be removed by violence and hatred. On the surface it tells the story of a man who falls in love with a pig, but like any good fable, it's not really about animals, it's about something bigger - the mitigation of harmony in America. <br /> <br /> The stage version has won international awards in its original production, it has toured the USA and Europe, and with others of its kind has almost affected the theater that followed. Fortunately, we kept the show properly, as it was originally designed, with original director Tom O'Horgan (who also directed HAIR and Jesus Christ Superstar on Broadway). <br /> <br /> This is not a mainstream, easy-to-use studio movie - it's an aggressive, disturbing, glorious, deeply emotional, wildly imaginative storyline that you'll never forget. And this can only change how you see the world ...
