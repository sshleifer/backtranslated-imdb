Personally, I think Sayonara was the biggest movie he ever made. It touches every emotion of anger to romance to complete tragedy. And Brando had to win for the best actor. Anyway, the movie is great, the man is attractive to both men and women and now you have no reason not to see it! Do it and fall in love.
