An end of an era was released here in the US in the spring of 2002 with "The Rookie", a Disney action movie that is "the best for the last !!!!!" was. It happened here in Texas! In fact, the story started in West Texas, as evidenced by an area code found on a board. It was about a high school coach who was so convinced by his high-class team that he decided to go professional !!!!! <br /> <br /> What I wanted from this movie: It was so nice !!! !! It was a very good movie, ala. "The Mighty Ducks" trilogy. It also took filmmakers across Texas, from somewhere between the Panhandle and El Paso to the Metroplex (where I live). I can tell it because I recognize that ballpark (was the Ballpark in Arlington; now it's "Amerique Field")! It was nice to see Disney's "Golden Age" end here in my area !! <br /> <br /> RIP <br /> <br /> Golden Era of Disney <br /> <br /> 1920s -Spring 2002 <br /> <br /> "It all started with a mouse ... and it ended with baseball. " (sobs) <br /> <br /> 10/10
