I have to say that the events of 9/11 didn't hit me before I saw this documentary. It took me a year to catch the devastation. I was the one who changed the station on the radio and channel on TV if there were any talks on the towers. I was heard about it. When it was broadcast a year and a day later on TV, I swallowed my eyes. It was the first time I had shouted since the attack. I recommend this documentary. I watch it now on TV, 5 years later, and I still cry about the tragedies. The fact that it is one of the only video shots of the first plane to hit the tower is incredible. It was an accident, and where it got them. These two brothers let me know I was there to help.
