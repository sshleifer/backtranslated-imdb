I only saw this movie as a pre-teenager, about the age when children began to think through their identity. I was greatly affected by the scene of the man and the children he founded as his own. The eldest boy was caught that his mother was a prostitute and none of his brothers and sisters had the same biological father (who made Kurosawa clear by having children who didn't look like each other). The man still persuades the boy that he is their father by the only definition that counts. The man is praised to be a father by all the children, but one who still prefers her brother. <br /> <br /> Each of the vignettes is also compelling for their own stories and conclusions. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie, even if it's not the biggest Kurosawa movie.
