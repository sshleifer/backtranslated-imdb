Emma is a terribly flawed film based on Jane Austen's classic novel. I didn't read the book, so I didn't know much about the plot, and yet I almost predicted the whole plot. There were also many scenes that frustrated me because of the bad writing or directing. However, for some reason the movie is very entertaining and I love it. Of course there were all the scenes I didn't like, but the majority were well behaved and funny. Gwyneth Paltrow gives one of her best performances as the heroine in Emma. The movie is also star Toni Collette (which is good but is much better) Ewan Mecgreger (who was also better but he is still very good here) Alan Cumming (Who I have never really impressed and almost the same here ) and Jeremy Northam (whose performance is rather wood at first but actually quite subtle, even if not necessary). There were much better adaptations of Jane Austen books, but this one is still very entertaining and worth watching.
