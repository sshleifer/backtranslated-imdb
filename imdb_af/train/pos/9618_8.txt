I recently bought this movie and I'm not sorry to say so. I'm a lot. Please add this movie to my collection. Film director Matt Manfredi and Phil Hay took less than a month to film and spent about 1 million euros to produce this wonderful movie. It proves that not only big productions make good movies. <br /> <br /> The title of this movie fits in perfectly. In computer language, BUG means program error that causes reactions in computer function. Our reactions can cause these negative side effects, but also good moments of beauty. The vertiginous events in this movie begin with the death of a BUG. A man testifies to the crime on the other side of the road. From there everything is complicated ... <br /> <br /> I point to John Carrol Lynch ("Fargo"), Wallece, the man who can't fix everything at all.
