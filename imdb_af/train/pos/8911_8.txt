I've seen The Blob several times and is one of the better low-budget alien invasive films of the 1950s. <br /> <br /> An alien meteor country just outside a small town and an elderly man is going to investigate it. A strange jelly like dust then attaches itself to one of his arms and a young couple who saw the meteoric land come in time and bring him to the local doctor, where the old man is completely absorbed by the mass. The doctor and his nurse are the next victims and the mass gets bigger. When these incidents are reported to the police, they do not believe the young couple and accuse them of making it all. They eventually believe them when the mass, now big, appears in the town's theater and everyone walks in the streets and screams. It then attaches itself to a dinner with the young couple and others inside. The blob is stopped by spraying a load of fire extinguishers on it and freezing, which is its weakness. This is then done by plane to the frozen waste from the Arctic transport and disposed of there. But it's just frozen, not dead ... <br /> <br /> This movie has a typical setting for its period: teenagers and a small town. The Blob has a good rock and roll theme song at the beginning and the film is atmospheric. <br /> <br /> The sequel, Beware! The Blob followed in 1972 and a remake came in 1988, but it is the best of The Blob movies. <br /> <br /> The movie is led by Steve McQueen (The Great Escape) and is the movie that made him star. and Aneta Corsaut plays his girlfriend. I'm not familiar with any of the other stars. <br /> <br /> The Blob is a must-have for all sci-fi fans. Fantastic. <br /> <br /> Rating: 4 stars out of 5.
