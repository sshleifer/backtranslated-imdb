For what it is, it's a good movie. I like both Johns-Stamos ("Full House") and Stockwell ("Christine", "Top Gun"). They both give strong performances. The love interest is OK, but it's more of a man's movie than a good date movie. I love Harleys, and I hated to see them paint over the "14 low rubbing lacquer" with good old Army Olive Kill. There is a small history lesson here that Harley-Davidson motorcycles played a key role in World War II. I don't know if the training was much like these clusters! The movie has gone through my interest throughout without getting anywhere slow, with good driving action ranges. I like to watch the demographics of the voting history - one 18-year-old gave the movie a 10 (true bike lover, I think). I won't give it a 10, but I gave it an 8. I don't weigh every movie with the same scale. There are big budget movies, with big actors, you expect to be good, so when they fail, they're not big. (Star Wars - Episode I is my best example) I loved the first three SW movies, but I thought Episode I was poorly compared. So it gets a lower rating of me than this movie. I expect more from George Lucas.
