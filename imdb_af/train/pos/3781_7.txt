I will not dare say this movie is better than the original, but it is very good in its own right. The comedy in this movie is just as good as the original, but there are so many scenes that make me laugh but just think of them. <br /> <br /> The story in this movie is even more bizarre than the original, but it does so well. Peter Hewitt does a good job of directing this film with a good role. The core of the original movie goes back to their characters in this movie and everyone does a fantastic job with their roles. I don't care what someone says, I think Keanu Reeves is a good actor! I really enjoyed his portrayal of Ted in both of these films as I did Alex Winter's Bill. I was delighted to see George Carlin returning to the role of Rufus, very cool! Hal London Jr., who plays the part of Ted Logan's dad, does a very good job. The scene where Ted owns his father's body and Hal London Jr. starts acting like Ted is a wonderful scene, and he impresses it well. I can't forget to call William Sadler as Death, he made the movie completely for me. The rest of the cast is also very good. <br /> <br /> If you liked the first installment of the Bill and Ted series, I'd hope you also want this movie. But, don't expect it to be as good as the original. I really hope you enjoy the movie, thank you for reading, <br /> <br /> -Chris
