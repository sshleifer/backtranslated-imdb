First, I want to explain that the average user's inability to appreciate imagination is frightening. What makes this display so unique is the hyper-reality it creates. You don't need to know why Ned can bring back people or why it can only be for a moment. Where did the prodigy of wonderful stories of childhood disappear, much like a wrinkle in time. <br /> <br /> I say it's refreshingly original because it's a polar opposite of the masses of leak-all-out television that doesn't leave imagination or wonder. <br /> <br /> It is nice to add some escape to the television experience. <br /> <br /> The hyper-reality is my favorite aspect of the show. The 1950s-like environment, the innocent and rare characters, and the scenery and scenery that should not be regarded as pure reality. <br /> <br /> This display masks the morbidity of death, while others embrace it. While entertaining, other television shows have taken a back shelf to this series. It really has a sense of curiosity, imagination and wonder on television recovery. <br /> <br /> Pushing Daisies quickly made it to the top of my list.
