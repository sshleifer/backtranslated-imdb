This is my FAVORITE ALL time movie. It was my Friday night movie with a pizza and bottle of wine when I was alone. I first saw this movie with my aunt Brend and sister Chasity. I was in 2nd grade. I fell with Travolta in LOVE and Sissy was my new best friend. I read a lot of comments about the fact that Bud Sissy left and how Sissy should be "learning to act". But let's go back and look at it for a second: SPOILER - My interpretation of the movie now, not when I was eight, is about Bud & Sissy's relationship, a turn for the worst because she's making a fool at Gilley's drive on the bull. They get a big fight. Bud tries to make Sissy jealous by asking Pam to dance. Sissy thinks then two wrong things will be right and West asks her if she needs help. They're all on the dance floor playing like fool when Bud asks Pam: "When are you going to take my house and rape me?" Pam replied, "If you're ever Cowboy." Bud then goes with her to her apartment in downtown Houston. Which Dad bought her with his oil money and "all that implies". Bud is the one who cheats on Sissy. Sissy is waiting for Bud when he comes home the next day. Sissy is the one who leaves Bud. Then it is up to Bud to prove Sissy that he is a true "cowboy" and wins her back. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is my interpretation. Everyone has them, I'm sure! I love this movie. <br /> <br /> Believe it or not, I have a REAL cowboy myself! I love him too! :)
