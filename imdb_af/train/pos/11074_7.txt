Neither the total disaster that British critics claimed, nor the misunderstood masterpiece that his few fanboys insist on, is that Revolver is at least an admirable attempt by Guy Ritchie to add a little thing to his manhood. But then nothing more despised than an ambitious movie that can bite more than almost, especially using the gangster / artist movie framework. As expected from Luc Besson's name on the credits as producer, there is a definite element of 'Cinema de look' about it: put in a kind of realistic fantasy world where America and Britain overlap, it looks good, has a beautiful exception edited action sequences and ooze style, all of which are remarkable as a disposable entertainment. But Ritchie clearly wants to do more than repeat his own movies for a quick buck, and he spent a lot of time thinking and reading about life, the universe and everything. If it is, it's trying to infuse too many influences (a bit of Machiavelli, a little Godard, lots of chess principles), motives and techniques, which rubbish the screen with the quotes: the movie was originally meant to end with Three minute epigrams about photos of victims' bodies, and sometimes he feels he never read a fortune cookie he didn't want to change into a movie. Rather than being a commercial for Kabbalism, it really is more of a mix of overlapping principles of commerce, chess and trust that make the most of the tricky trick to making the theosophy accessible while the film's central (somewhat metaphysical) hidden be. <br /> <br /> The last third is where most of the problems can be found, as Jason Statham enters the enemy (literally) with very ambitious but not always quite successful cross-work within the frame to make people's outside bravado with their inner fear and anger, but it is much the same. Not worth starting a new religion, but I'm surprised it doesn't get a US distributor. Maybe they found Ray Liotta's deliberately fake brown, just too scary?
