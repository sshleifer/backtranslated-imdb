When I first saw, I thought it looked interesting. I watched it, seeing how it turned around Sarah, as the character saw the world turn around her. I did, but didn't laugh a lot. <br /> <br /> Onstage and in her performance, she is racist, rugged, insensitive and extremely self-centered. I didn't even find her and took it all at face value. Then I got her movie, Jesus is Magic. I think it served me as a Sarah Silverman primer, and just explained what she was talking about. She is like Marilyn Manson, who works so hard to give us a face of terrible ideas and images, but you finally realize that it's not an assault, it's a statement. And as soon as you understand it, you'll find yourself glad that someone is giving it straight to you. <br /> <br /> I don't mean to just suggest that smart people will understand, or that this show is hate to prove your idiot. While I like lots of 'smart' shows, I still don't see the humor of Curb Your Enthusiasm. I get the impression that it is good, but I just don't get it. Many people will never get the Sarah Silverman program, but I'm glad I finally got there. <br /> <br /> The creators of this show work hard, each episode is not only loaded with dialogue and plot, but with songs, or dream series, production numbers. These people don't add anything to fill a time slot and please advertisers, they seem to be on a mission to make the best show they can put together. If I predicted the future of this performance, I'd say it's going the way of Arrested Development and Freaks & Geeks. It will be canceled before it's time to stay in the heart of the fans and on DVD. But heartily, SSP creators, your audience IS out there, and we'll look for as long as they let you see the show.
