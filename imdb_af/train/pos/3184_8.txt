This Hong Kong filmed pot boiler suits in more melodrama than week's worth of 'The Young & The Restless'. This one is more a setback to the original 'Emmanuelle' trilogy (especially 'Goodbye Emmanuelle') as an D'Amato sleaze. Chai Lee (Emy Wong) undergoes a beautiful transformation from a nurse to a proud street walker. Future Italian pornstar / politician, Illona Staller, who later goes on to name Ciccolina (and has sex with an HIV-positive John Holmes) plays Emy's competition. Exotic places and some decent softcore scenes around this one. Recommended for fans of the original 'Emmanuelle', of which I am one!
