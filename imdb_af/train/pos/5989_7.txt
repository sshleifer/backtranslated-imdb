The film starts with a lot of kids in the reform school and focuses on a child named 'Gabe', who apparently worked hard to earn his parole. Gabe and his sister move to a new environment to make a new start and soon meet Gabe the Dead End Kids. The children in this movie are small punks, but they are much less antisocial than they were in other previous films and deep, they are well-meaning punks. In this environment, however, there are also some criminals who enter insurance fraud through arson and see Gabe as a convenient scapegoat. After all, he would reform the school and no one would believe he was innocent after estimating. So, if Gabe is ready to return to "The Big House", it is up to the rest of the gang to save him and expose the right crooks. <br /> <br /> The "Dead End Kids" appear in several Warner Brothers movies in the late 1930s and the films were generally very good (especially ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES). However, after the boys' contracts expired, they went to Monogram Studios and the films, to make it purposeful, were very poor and formulated - with Huntz Hall and Leo Gorcey the whole show and the group being named The Bowery Boys "Because ANGELS were their facets, the excellent writing and production value EN Hall and Gorcey didn't continually hurt the camera, it's a good movie - and earned almost a score of 7 (it's REAL close) "In fact, while it's not a great movie, it's definitely a lot of fun to watch, so I'll give it a 7! Certainly, it was a little hokey at the end. Children take the law into their own hands and Reagan ignores the Bill of Rights - but it was also quite entertaining, the Dead End Kids doing their best performances and Ronald Reagan and Ann Sheridan provided excellent support, certainly this part of the movie was illogical and impossible, but somehow it was still s naked and rather charming - so if you can suspend unbelief, work well.
