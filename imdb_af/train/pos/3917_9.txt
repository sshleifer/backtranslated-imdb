I only saw the movie in 1984 when it was released in America in 1984. I've seen it many times. What touches me about the movie is the incorporation of the art of rehearsal into the lives of the characters and the reverse. Throughout the movie the two alternate and sometimes it is never certain whether one looks at the lives of the characters or a scene from a rehearsal. It remains the climax of the film. All these years, my friends and I still love to debate whether "Carmen" is really coming to an end. From the reactions of the other characters, to the stylized murder, it is open to debate. The passion of the dance, the quality of the acting, the love of art and the brilliance of the performances all combine to create a wonderful film that again combines life and art.
