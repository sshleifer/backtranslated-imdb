to regard it as a child. Although I will probably find it terribly terrible now, it was kind of ghostly stuff, because I was just seven or so. I also remember working on a Saturday afternoon puzzle while watching it. So I didn't pay much attention. However, the scene with the rolling stones has since been burned. I have asked many people whether they have seen this movie, but to no avail. 12 years ago one person mentioned that he might have seen it, but he thought it was just a dream; a fanciful piffel like wind. It's not a dream, my friend. No dream now. Again, I haven't seen it yet, but I can't wait to find a copy and put it in my video recorder. Anything that can be built into my mind for 23 years deserves a '10'.
