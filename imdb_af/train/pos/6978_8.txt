Well, I have to say I was waiting for it to come. <br /> <br /> I won't try to spoil it, and many people have spoken brilliantly of the pilot. On the other hand, I'm not quite sure to understand the opponents who claim they are SCR fans and not like the pilot. <br /> <br /> What did the frack expect? The background is 50 years before BSG. We were there at the birth of the Cylons. See the life of the Adama family (we already knew about SCR), get a deeper explanation of the Caprican population and its perception of the other colonies, and possibly the origin of God's faith of man and the unique faith of the Cylons. <br /> <br /> I don't expect the same abundance of special effect or space opera as in the previous series, but I make the difference between the two, although I know Caprica will boost BSG. <br /> <br /> It's 1h30 of promising start, I also believe it will put pressure on the scenarios to be as good as SCR. I expect a lot from the following, but I have no reason to doubt that we will learn much more. <br /> <br /> Watch the DVD's deleted scene, also give more material for your brain to chew. <br /> <br /> Looking forward to January 2010
