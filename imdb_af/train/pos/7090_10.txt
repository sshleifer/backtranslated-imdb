A linear journey within a non-linear structure. It's a fact that time in 12 monkeys flows into this come-and-go between present, future and past. However, the film's linearity cannot be avoided: it is the work of the projector, the unfolding of the narrative. <br /> <br /> What we can see under the temporal theme is a reflection on the inevitability of our actions. The world of this Terry Gilliam movie is a world with little room for free will. <br /> <br /> From the beginning we are informed about a schizophrenic prophecy, according to which a plague would rule the earth in 1997, <br /> <br /> Cole's (Willis) mission is clear: stop back to the mid 90's to any and everyone associated with the release of the virus. There is no way to change the past: everything that can be done is to help scientists of the present (who are our future viewers) find the healing. Not to change what happened (the past is inevitable), but make the gift better. <br /> <br /> In his "returns" in time, Cole comes closer to a striking dilemma: his past life is better than his life in the present. <br /> <br /> The latter is dark and dehumanizing, controlled by totalitarian scientists who choose "volunteers" (this word is ironic) to begin the journeys to the past. <br /> <br /> Scientists have not yet reached the highest level of performance in time travel, and Cole ends up on wrong dates - it will later work in the plot as evidence of his common sense to the psychiatrist Kathryn ( Stowe). <br /> <br /> We can see through the evolution of the story that linearity and non-linearity interfere with a circular temporality. <br /> <br /> There is more than one moment in which the scene that is the first and ending almost last - and definitely the climate - appears. It changes itself, according to the call of Cole's memories, that come into his dreams. <br /> <br /> In an airport, a man is shot dead while armed, against someone else. A blonde woman walks to the murdered one. <br /> <br /> This is the scene linking the past (in which Cole is a child visiting the airport with his parents), the present (the time of the story) and the future (adult Cole) Cole Throughout the narrative he felt that he had already lived the reality he is now experiencing. His prophetic dreams are proof that it is impossible to escape or to avoid what has happened. The agents who shoot him stop him killing the mad scientist, Doctor Peters (Morse), who is responsible for spreading the disease. <br /> <br /> What can't be changed. And in Cole's case, what was, is what will be. Eternally. <br /> <br /> A movie isn't very well understood. For me, nothing less than a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Other great films with similar themes: The Back to the Future Trilogy (which has a different angle to the "crazy scientific" character, and although it is the atmosphere of decay - especially in the second movie - it is much more optimistic than Gilliam's work, it's a strange Hollywood picture.) <br /> <br /> In another registry, there is "Wild strawberries", one of Bergman's masterpieces, This involves a striking and enlightening journey to the past through dreams and memories. <br /> <br /> I've never seen "La Jet√©e", but just because I can't find it.
