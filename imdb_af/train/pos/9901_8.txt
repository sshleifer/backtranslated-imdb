This movie looks like a classic in the cheesy 80s slasher genre, which is my favorite genre of them all, so when I saw it was free on demand, I had to see it! This is star Caroline Munro, of both dr. Phibes movies (she was his wife who is dead!), Dracula AD 1972, The Golden Voyage or Sinbad, Captain Kronos - Vampire Hunter, The Spy Who's My, Maniac and Faceless Love. /> <br /> Bringing people behind you. Don't open for Christmas and bits and pieces. Heres my thoughts on this. <br /> <br /> It opens on April Fools Day, where a lot of kids play an extensive prank on the school note and promise him sex in the shower, giving him public humiliation and a face in the toilet (though he is naked!). The coach stops it, but both parties swear revenge. But the cool kids end up burning the nerd alive. <br /> <br /> Cut to the future, and the high school reunion, or so do they think (bwahahha?). The only one with invitations was the gang that burned the child, and its April Fools Day (or really the day before April Fools, but the fun starts at midnight), but they fail to see the coincidence and before school until night. Then they finally go into school and it starts to storm. <br /> <br /> Inside, they find food / drink and a small shrine for each, each of their cupboards and belongings, along with Marty's (the nerds) dressing room and yearbook. They also find the old black guard / caretaker who spends his time and says, "Oooh Yesser! Yesser! I don't want problems, sir!" and then it is immediately killed. Pretty pointless character, but he's still my favorite. <br /> <br /> The movie takes a page from Alien's book in a great way you just have to see! That's when everyone realizes they're there to die, and they start off with a freaking out, except for Shirley, who decides it would be best to take a bath in the old school showers at a time like this. Of course it pours blood and acid and her face melts (very cool, think of you). The rest of the night, as usual, goes to sex, drugs and Marty kills everyone while wearing a mask. What is their plan? "All we have to do is stay awake and wait until noon. Marty won't kill us in the middle of the day!" Seriously, that's what he said. Apparently you can only kill at night. But will they survive through the night? Who will live and who will die? And why do all the bodies disappear? Rent, buy or steal this great movie to find out! The movie is really good, filled with clich√©s (car won't start, DAMMIT!) And just plain treasure games. Not to mention, everyone has names like Carol and Nany and Frank and Joe and Susan. I recommend it to all of you! And, not to mention, it has a Spin Off! 1989's cutting class is a spin-off of this slasher gem, and that movie begins the career of Brad Pitt and Roddy McDowell. <br /> <br /> Favorite scene: 2 people who have sex, want to finish the man, but do the girl. "Speak dirty to me, Frank !!" she shouts "Uh ... tits!" "Filler!" "Uh ... tits. F * ck. Tits. Boobs. F * ck." It looks like she's working for her and at her climax, the murderer both of them!
