This movie is nominated for the best photo but lost to Casablanca, but Paul Lukas knocks Humphrey Bogart out for the best actor. I don't see why Lucile Watson was nominated for the best supporting actor, I just don't think she did a very good job. Bette Davis and Paul Lukas and their three children leave Mexico and come to the United States in the first scene of the movie. They go by train to Davis's family home. Davis and Lukas were in the underground to stop the Nazis so they were very tired and calm. But when they get home, they are a Nazi resident there and they are not much of it. It seems the Nazi just cares for money and is prepared to make an agreement with Luke. They are more about the plot, but you can find it yourself.
