I saw "Fever Pitch" kind of accidentally; It was playing on the plane. It wasn't really bad. Ben (Jimmy Fallon) is the world's # 1 Red Sox fan, but his relationship with Lindsay Meeks (Drew Barrymore) can hamper it. The film is a fairly interesting look at how world events can affect people's relationships. It is especially eye-opening now that the Red Sox ended their 80-year-old lost line. I think these kinds of things always happen and we just tend not to see them. Not so bad. <br /> <br /> Another movie depicting an unusual relationship with baseball is 2000's "Frequency". They both go out.
