This was an excellent piece for the puppet show, as this film showed the whole range from one to seven. And it was about one woman trying to stop the new puppet master because I would never guess the dolls would be in pain. Plus it showed some of the puppet shows I didn't see and I saw it as bad as part two. It showed a look of torch that could change things and people, which was cool, and showed the return of the puppet master. It also showed little strangers from Part 4 who were also cool. It showed other people's episodes that might be good to them and that did. So thanks to this Puppet Master it will be a big hit.
