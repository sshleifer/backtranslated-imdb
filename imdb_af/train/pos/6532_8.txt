I think part of the reason this movie was made ... and is aimed at our gamers who are actually playing the Nancy Drew PC games. There are many movies recently based on video games, and I think of them in one of them. <br /> <br /> So this movie doesn't follow a book. But it follows parts of the games. I buy and play every Nancy Drew game as soon as it comes out. And the games are from Herinteractive and are for "girls who are not afraid of a mouse!" And some of these games actually won parents' Choice Gold Awards. Not only are they fun but you can actually learn a thing or two while playing. <br /> <br /> I took two of my stepchildren with me to see it and they loved it! The 10 yr. you started playing her first Nancy Drew game a day before I took her to see the movie. She had so much fun playing the game. I thought she would also enjoy the movie. And I was right ... she not only loved this movie but couldn't wait to come home to finish her first game and start another one. <br /> <br /> My other step daughter is just 7 and she also loved the movie, but she's still a little too young, playing the games, but she likes watching her sister play, but just to see what's going on. <br /> <br /> The games are based on children 10 years and older. . All the games usually get nice descent reviews and are classified as adventure games. For more information on the games, just look for reinterpreted Nancy Drew games. So personally I thought the movie was pretty good and I would buy it if it came out on DVD.
