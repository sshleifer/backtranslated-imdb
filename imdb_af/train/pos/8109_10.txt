HG Wells story made up of the upcoming stuff was made in a movie in 1935. Very well-made science fiction story about a war that has existed for decades. A major role play includes: Raymond Massey (arsenic and old) Sir Cedric Hardwick (Frankenstein's Ghost) Ralph Richardson (time bandit) and Margaretta Scott. Annual slides of helicopters, holograms, rocket ships and futuristic cities. This film was before his time led by William Cameron Menzies (Mars invaders). It is very enjoyable as the former film metropolis (1927), but avoids the so-called sequel to the form of things that came in 1979. This movie has nothing to do with the original. Wells like Jules Verne has a vision for the future with his stories.a classic science fiction movie.10 out of 10
