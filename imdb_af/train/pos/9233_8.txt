Flavia (Florinda Bolkan of "Do not Torture and Duckling" fame) is locked by her father in a monastery of carnal desires. Her whole sadness is raped by her (raping a young woman in a pig, sexual urge, horse castration) Flavia decides to leave the monastery with her Jewish friend from outside, Abraham. The two do not get very far before being captured and then brought back to be tortured and forced to repent. After punishment, they join a group of Muslims called the Tarantulas, who had previously invaded the monastery and led a crusade. It becomes nothing less than a bloody battle behind the monastery walls. "Flavia the Heretic" is a well-directed and fairly infamous piece of Italian nunsploitation. The movie is a bit horrible and messy. The acting is great and the characters are well developed. Generally, "Flavia the Heretic" is a truly moving and intelligent movie with lots of nudity and gore. You can't go wrong. with this8 out of 10.
