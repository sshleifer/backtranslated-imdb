Fido is a story about more well-mannered zombies trained to serve humanity. However, everyone falls apart when Timmy's zombie Fido eats the family neighbor. From then on, disasters arise (though, perhaps not a disaster, but to some extent chaos). Most people treat their zombies with fairness, and such a character sleeps with his zombie (very funny part of the movie, if not too disturbing). And we find the loving Fido whatever he can do. It's a very funny and unique movie, especially for the zombie genre. It is also probably one of the least violent of zombie films (no negativity in this statement). I highly recommend it to people looking for something funny and different. I rate this 8/10. Valued R for zombie-related violence
