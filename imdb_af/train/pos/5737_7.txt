I'm going to type the scales a bit here and say I enjoyed it. But the cartoon is only going to appeal to those who have many absurd trends. It is definitely something that most people will not get, just like the nature of absurdism. <br /> <br /> The animation is terrible, but yes, that's the point. The main character is dirty mouth, violent and stupid. no redeeming qualities whatsoever. His wife cries and knocks, apparently barely capable of the most basic communication skills. Most of these stories have no points at all. <br /> <br /> But again, this is the point;) <br /> <br /> If not successors, dirty language and complete and complete arbitrariness is your thing, you will love it. <br /> <br /> It's very short, so I'll probably rent instead of buying.
