This is one of the best 80's movies !!! It sticks out like a "bump in a punchbowl" !! I can't believe Mad Magazine condemned it or whatever. And yet they pride themselves on a performance with 'Stuart', 'I-speak-a-no-Chinese lady' and 'UPS man on speed'. How about this? And, I love Ron Leibman-hy's foxy !! Wonder why he removed his name from the credits? It was his funniest role I know. Of course he is not as foxy as he was in Norma Rae. But in my opinion, this movie is just there with National Lampoon's Vacation. If you like movies like Porky's, Fast Times, Last American Virgin, or any other 80-year-old teenager-focused movies, you'll love this one! Rent it and you'll see what I mean !!
