This is one of my favorite kung-fu movies and is considered one of the most popular Shaw Brothers of the late 70's. The plot is interesting and winding, the characters are cool each with their own style - frog, snake, lizard etc. The action is limited compared to other Chang Cheh / Venoms movies, but what's interesting with different kung-fu styles on display of the different characters. I recommend this movie to anyone who thinks that all Shaw Brothers especially Chang Cheh's films are the same. Most of his films usually focus on the ten tigers and Shaolin vs Manchu conflicts. This film is breath of fresh air in comparison.
