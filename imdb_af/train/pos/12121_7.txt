Somerset Maugham's characters are made alive in RKO's "Of Human Bondage"; but the movie is a skeletal version of the novel, with Bette Davis starring all the energy sucking. Otherwise, it is the story of Leslie Howard (like Philip Carey); He dreams of becoming a painter, but is said to have no talent for the arts. As the film progresses, Mr. Howard to become a doctor. His efforts seem to indicate some bad advice on the arts. Although successful in medicine, his art of painting seemed more straightforward - look at the symbolism of his disability, a "little" (explain in the film). <br /> <br /> On the go (immediately in this version), Howard is enchanted with waitress Davis (as Mildred Rogers). Davis' characterization of "Mildred" is extraordinary, resulting in a spectacular speech, when she tells Howard that she "MUST GO MY MOUTH!" after kissing him. Howard also plays well, but the story fails to explain his long-standing fascination and love for Davis; So, their performances are wasted. <br /> <br /> Another movie to watch the acting, including good supporting players.
