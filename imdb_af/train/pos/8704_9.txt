There is a lot of shit coming out of Hollywood recently. <br /> <br /> A friend, occasionally sends me movies, as a surprise, it's great. <br /> <br /> I turned it on and can't stop watching, it's a drama but with a strange twist. Imagine if Romeo, as in Shakepeare, had a super power. It is unfortunate and poetic at the same time. Hollywood must take note of the new Russian theater, they tell stories that are not about big explosions and cgi. It takes a simple basic point of departure and tells a story without a spectacle. It's much like an Asian movie with a dark Russian twist. Granted it's not perfect, but nothing is ever. You know what power is, but it is never explained, nor fully realized at the end. It becomes secondary to the emotion of the story. I don't want to see a remake, it's too cool as it is. The Hollywood system will upload it as usual. Acting is everywhere. Directing and camera work is far above most of the crap out there. Kudos to everyone involved, and I will turn many people into this independent epic. A +++++ <br /> <br /> If you can get it, watch it.
