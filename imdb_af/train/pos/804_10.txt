No, there is another! <br /> <br /> Because every Star Wars fan had an opinion about I, II and III and because the opinion was biased because we missed the atmosphere and characters of the original trilogy, I would like the good points of "The Return of the Jedi" and call some corresponding bad points of the prequel. Of course, I loved the music, the special effects, the two droids, but it was debated elsewhere. <br /> <br /> What we get in the original trilogy and in this particular movie: - Strong ecological concern - Anti-military positions - Fascinating insights on Jedi order and power - Fun creatures - Harrison Ford's smile - A killer scene: At the end, when the Father looks alternatively at his son and the emperor. The lightning of the deadly bolts reflected on his black helmet. And when he grabs his Master and betrays to save Luke and risk his own life! Oh, son! <br /> <br /> What's wrong in the prequel INMHO: - The whole "human factor" element that the original cast was able to push forward is somehow missing - The Force looks more about superpowers and somersaults, than about wisdom. Too much Jedis at one time and too many light bags on the screen. The lack of experience of some actors often threatens the summary of the plot <br /> <br /> By the way, if you enjoy the theory of the Force as explained by Obi Web (Obi Wen, I mean) and Yoda, Then read some books on Buddhism and the forms it read in Old Japan. <br /> <br /> The magic of Star Wars, IMHO lies mainly in the continuing spiritual heritage of a master to his disciple, from a father to his son, even though it is difficult. "The mon ame of tons" (from my soul to yours), as Bejard would write to late Zen master T. Deshimaru.
