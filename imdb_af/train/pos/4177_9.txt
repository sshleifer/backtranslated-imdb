A nice piece of bioset narrative in a simple but effective way. Cinema is still a visual media and Igor uses his full potential. A young, restless man drives a train with no destination in mind. In one of the compartments he meets with a girl. Words are not exchanged, but their laundry is and from there we are taken on a ride with other peculiar characters and situations. The two slides are perfectly thrown, as their unique features tell you a story that doesn't require words.
