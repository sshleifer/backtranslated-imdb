Based on a real mining disaster, these early German talks (with English subtitles) are still one of the most effective documentary dramas ever filmed. With many non-professional actors, Kameradschaft offers a cold picture of the friendship that the miners bind, regardless of which side of the French / German border they may be. A deadly accident brings out the very best in all, and the orders of any superior are destroyed. An emergency co-worker will receive the help of his comrades, even against the threat of great loss, including life. <br /> <br /> This film reminds of the self-sacrificing heroism shown by the NYFD following the 9/11 attacks. To dispel any formal rules and regulations, these men and women in uniform had only one cause: to save lives, and to find their fellow fighters. - More than 70 years later, Kameradschaft still has the strong and timeless message: A friend in need is a friend in action.
