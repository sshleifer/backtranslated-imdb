It has been so long ago that I saw this movie (at least 15 years) and yet it has given me a spectacular picture of the terrible consequences of the prisoners of war, despite the provisions of the Geneva Convention . <br /> <A unit of Australian underwater demolition experts is caught in an island near Japan and follows a successful mission to place mines in a Japanese port. <br /> <br /> Once in prison, these men expect the same treatment as any other POWs, but after their dismay, they soon learn from a friendly Japanese jailer that they are trying to be spies as they were out of uniform when they were caught is. The consequences of such an offense, according to the Japanese martial code, are the execution by remembering. <br /> <br /> Despite their pleas and pleas from the sympathetic prison guard, the day of reckoning is approached like a ticking time bomb. The tension is so high that you can actually hear the ticking, although it may just be your chest with the percussion of a march execution group. <br /> <br /> The end is actually too painful to re-write much less in my head. But I can promise you - you'll never forget it. Good luck finding the video in the US
