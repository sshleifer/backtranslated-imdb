Kurosawa, fresh in color, illuminates its usual truths and observations of reality and chooses a depressing attack on Tokyo's slums. Kurosawa stretches for a style that, in my opinion, was his antithesis - that is, I feel Kurosawa wanted to make an Ozu picture. Poorly paced, poorly conceived, this movie is a rare dud in this author's body of excellent work. While Ikiru, while being mundane and depressed, was still interesting and well-behaved, and while Stray Dog portrays Japan's slums and social poverty, without being too heavy or boring, it has all the gloom that one can do expect with its content, with none of the redeeming features of earlier Kurosawa photos. <br /> <br /> Be warned, Kurosawa is not a movie to be judged.
