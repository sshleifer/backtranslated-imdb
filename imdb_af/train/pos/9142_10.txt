Purple Rain ... What else can I say, the title speaks for itself. But I think all the actors are well chosen. The movie had a good story. I love it! Since I watched that movie, I've been holding in the eighties and I'm just 13! My favorite part of the movie was when his father died and he picked up all his music compositions. The Apollonia was on the step with his upper hand in her hand. Critics say it's a drama, but I think it's more of a romance. Murphy Brown also did a good job in the movie, he actually acted like himself. I'm so glad I saw this movie. The song Purple Rain, beautifully sung, was so cordial. I cried more than once.
