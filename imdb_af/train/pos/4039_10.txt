Most of the complaints I heard about this movie really come down to one thing: it's not Versus. Yes, the cast and crew are basically the same. Yes, Kitamura herhas a few shots in the battle scenes that come in the second half of the movie, but it's about where the deal ends. Versus is mostly out of place and shows Kitamura's ability to produce an interesting B-movie in natural places. For Alive, almost everything is inside. In small, concise spaces. Here the art design is printed in your face, and WHAT art design it is! We are treated to many very complicated and interesting spaces, and our characters are mostly limited to spaces. Another important difference is that we don't get much action here until the end of the movie. Versus was all about action and cool, here is a lot more emphasis on characters and situation and talked to your mind. As a result, Alive is a much more interesting film than Versus. You may not enter it and go to a random scene to watch five or ten minutes of cool zombie bloodshed, but you will be stuck on the screen for almost two hours to see the interaction of some really interesting characters . <br /> <br /> I'm now ecstatic that I ordered the DVD despite some naysay. You must too! But be sure to realize this is another animal of Versus - it is often slow, and requires a little thought to get the most out of it. I hope Media Blasters choose it for subtitled R1 DVD release!
