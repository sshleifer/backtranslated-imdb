I really like Miikes movies about Yakuza, this one I saw about 2 years ago and it really filled my head. Never had such a sick and distorted thing ever seen. The story is good and the actors do their thing very well. I didn't see the British or Japan version, but I have to say I believe the German DVD is a bit censored. If you haven't seen the movie and live in Germany, you can look better for a DVD from the Dutch or Austria. The I-ON DVD contains a lot of hard and nasty scenes, but at the show I felt something missing, about one or two very short scenes. <br /> <br /> All in all, a good twisted movie with crazy characters and a high level of violence, that's what I love Miike!
