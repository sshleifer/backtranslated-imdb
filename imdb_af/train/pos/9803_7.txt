This Batman movie isn't quite as good as Batman's The Phantasm and Batman and Mr. Mask. Freeze subzero. But it's still a good installment for Batman cartoons. I say it's just as good as Batman Beyond The Movie. This movie is good for the same reasons. The storyline is good, but not as good as the others, but still pretty good. It has a lot of action in it. The cartoon effects are good. The voice of actors is really good as Kevin Conroy as Batman. / Bruce Wayne, Tara Strong as Barbra Gordon, Efrem Zimbalist Jr., Eli Marienthal as Robin. The villains are good as Kyra Sedgwick as Batwoman, David Ogden Stiers as The Pequin, Hector Elizondo as Bane. So I'm sure you won't be disappointed with the Batman Mystery or The Batwomen. So make sure you rent or buy Batman Mystery or The Batwoman because it's really good. <br /> <br /> Overall rating: ******* from ********* * <br /> <br /> *** out *****
