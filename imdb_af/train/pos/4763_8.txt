Unlike other commentaries, I found this movie fascinating, even with all its mistakes and the zombie acting from the actors. <br /> <br /> As a technologist, I found the experiments interesting and the hardware realistic. While reading people's minds via the computer sounds great, experiments are now being performed to do just that. I would note that these experiments are in a very early stage, with the results so far not favorable. <br /> <br /> The characters in the movie are well thrown. The girl, although a little tolerant, looks pretty stupid. The truck driver is a call for real truck drivers. The minister gives first doubt. (The chief investigator tells the minister that he (the minister) is not sure if he believes God created man or that man created God.) But the moment the chips are down, he falls back his faith. PhD plays the zombie The secrets they harbor are suitable for their characters, and in the face of death they react like the real human will. <br /> <br /> The movie is a warning against the dangers of unlimited surveillance By the government, as a tension, the film does not have enough excitement, as scientific exercise with philosophical foundation makes it fascinating.
