I thought it was a great movie for kids aged 6-12. A bit juicy, but the story elevates a fresh one. This proves that the dreams of an adolescent truly come true. I think it is a wonderful story for any child who is feeling down, or feels too much among them trying to juggle. Very 'cute' movie. Bravo.
