Kurt Russell is at his best as the man who lives on his past glory, Reno Hightower. Robin Williams is his polar opposite in a rare low key performance than Jack Dundee. He released the Big Pass in more ways than one. <br /> <br /> You'll see some of the most poignant scenes ever put into one movie, as Jack is moving on a rock, Reno sets and the Caribou call goes out. <br /> <br /> Don't miss this classic, not afraid to show football in the mud as it should be played. (Note the NFL).
