I am currently working on A.S level film studies and "this is not a love song" is a movie we have watched and I think it is a movie with a very simple story but a complex story. If you scratch the surface, you'll find a frightening movie of two men running by farmers through the countryside, after having committed a murder: - "sounds very exciting". <br /> <br /> But you have to dig deeper to uncover the true feeling of the true genre. As suggested, it is a love story between two gay lovers, filled with trust, deception and betrayal. We are not directly told by the film about this "love", but the events that pass on, such as the way Heaton acts on Spike, scream almost this untouched love affair in our faces. Overall, this movie is a good example of why British movies should not be dismissed as "junk" just because it is being done on a low budget. <br /> <br /> A good movie with a complicated story line, but it's definitely an acquired taste. and may not be suitable for the average fan of Hollywood blockbusters.
