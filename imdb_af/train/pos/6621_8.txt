I just came back from a pre-release look of this excellent sci-fi movie noire. His style is definitely unique and very well made. It's filmed with real actors, but turned into a black and white cartoon style you've never seen before. It goes one step further than Sin City, and it does well. It is a successful combination of French comic and film cultures. The story and mood are reminiscent of Blade Runner, and if you like one you will surely have this one as well. The storyline is intelligent, never boring and has some fine twists. This movie is a must-see for any cinephile except maybe those who absolutely don't like sci-fi or b & w.
