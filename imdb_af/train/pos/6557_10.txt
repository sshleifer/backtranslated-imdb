I am a 53-year-old college professor. I went with my wife and 12-year-old daughter. We all enjoyed the movie. The film is original, witty, quick and completely charming. The plot was easy enough for a 10-year-old to follow, but contented enough to interest an adult. I thought Emma Roberts did an excellent job and the rest of the team was just fine. My only criticism is that the Los Angeles sets were not as interesting as they should have been. They were functional, but nothing stood out. On the other hand, makeup, costumes, lighting, cinematography, editing and directing were excellent. Altogether, I thought it was an enjoyable experience. I'm disappointed that the professional critics (almost all adult men) are attacking the movie. Apparently, they have something against films that depict strong, intelligent and independent young women. Their writings reveal more about their own sexist nature than anything about this wonderful family movie. I highly recommend it to every child and parent.
