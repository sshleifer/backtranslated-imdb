A voyage of discovery, this film follows the lives of one family living in a sleepy island town in British Columbia. Slim and dreamy, the residents are happy to allow life to come to a young teacher with fresh face. New ideas come and bring her life off the continent. Slowly, their indolent state wakes up, the father (and principal of the local school) looking for excitement, the mother of stability, the eldest daughter of love and the youngest for power. While it's not an incredible or ground-breaking piece of theater, the movie is quietly pleasing and good for a tired night when the wind blows. Unfortunately, I doubt anyone outside Canada will find it easily accessible.
