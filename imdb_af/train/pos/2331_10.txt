Initially, I was amazed that a TV show's main character could make the dead alive again, but then I thought I'd give it a chance. Guess what? I love "Pushing Daisies" and looking forward to Wednesday night just watching it, and the next week I see it on my DVR several times. The colorful characters, witty trigger, quick dialogue and new unique situations draw me in and captivate from start to finish. Ned's and Chuck Charles's relationship is interesting to look at as they do their romance around the fact that they can't have physical contact. Even Detective Emerson Cod's character continued to grow in complexity. And Olives Snook! Jiminy Crispies! She cracks me up! The narrator's voice is nice to listen to and the cinematography gives me the impression that I'm watching a movie instead of a TV show. I have recommended switching on my family and friends to "print daisies" and they are also hooking! The show is worth a week to wait for a new episode and if you're not "P.D." seen, I strongly recommend seeing it!
