It was a good movie with a good role, everyone who hit all cylinders. And if Dianne Keaton did her best, well, it just didn't get any better. But Tom Everett Scott, always underestimated, was even better. He must be a star. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is with one aspect of the script. None of the characters have ever admitted that the dead daughter was not always a good person. And neither was her mother played by Keaton. At one point she broke a promise she made to one character not to reveal that he had slept. <br /> <br /> One of the other commentators said the movie had a "political agenda". It's a baffling thing to say. There was no politics at all in this movie.
