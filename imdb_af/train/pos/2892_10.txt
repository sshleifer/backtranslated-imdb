Cinderella .... <br /> <br /> I haven't seen the movie for about five years. The magic remains. There is something that definitely contains what the storybook feels, entertaining the songs and the secondary character is everything. The villains in the form of step sisters are completely angry and dirty. Then there's the most magical of all Disney, the mice that make the dress and well, you know the rest. To summarize the four Disney princess films, everything is fine, but it is a beautiful magical experience, watch and enjoy. Oh, and of course, Cinderella is great as the main character in the movie. <br /> <br /> Thinking about it, Disney movies can really lose their charm. With Elene Wood and others, the movie has such a feel for it, you simply can't help but smile <br /> <br /> They say the moral of this story is that dreams come true. Of course, in the real world there are believers, others are more prosperous. In this movie it is even more magical when her rainbow comes smiling. <br /> <br /> And of course the rest ... Cinderella
