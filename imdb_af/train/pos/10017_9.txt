I absolutely loved this movie! I have no bearing on all the other comments I have read about it. I was delighted by every second! <br /> <br /> I grabbed the story, found the acting intense and the spotlight. I will literally jump every time the phone rings near the end of the movie. Although there was nothing "frightening" about the story itself, I was thoroughly through the whole movie and for the rest of my evening. <br /> <br /> I found so many perfect choices made ... the casting, the writing, the bits of humor sprinkled in it. There were so many points where the movie could have been for the cheap excitement, but it never did, and for me it has been the movie above so many of the mediocre thrillers who have come out lately ... and for the last number of years.
