I found this movie to be the usual French blow in America's face. The camera often focuses on fat people, on messy homes and on tough rural areas. While the narrative seems to sympathize with and admire the small town people introduced to the viewer, the cinematography exploits and demeans them. There were undoubtedly thin people who could be seen in Glencoe and neatly organized homes, but Malle chose us to show the worst of what had to be seen. <br /> <br /> I can only hope that some American filmmakers will go to France to reveal the worst elements to the American public. As a regular visitor to France, I can assure you that everything is not there. Foreign immigrants are not easily assimilated, thus creating serious social inequalities. But Americans are not keen on unmasking the French for their bias towards their own compatriots and their envy towards the US, so we will probably not see movies on the subject.
