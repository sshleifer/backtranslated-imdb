This movie is a great documentary. This follows the rap group, NWH, which consists of Ice Cold, Tasty Taste and Tone Def, through their unique path to gangster rap highlights, lows and back to highlights. Through trouble with women, egos, cops and whitey, this group comes to the top of the gangster rap world, as this movie goes to the top of the documents. I know everyone's favorite documentary is. That's Spinal Tap, for very good reasons, but I think if the right mood, this movie is just better. The laugh never ends, even for someone who is not in the rap culture. <br /> <br /> I am a white man who is not interested in rap music, culture or anything that goes with it, but I love this movie. . Rusty Cundeif, who wrote the screenplay, songs and stars in it, had great potential and it is a pity that I haven't seen him since the Fear of a Black Hat. However, I saw him once again as you have, and that is why I recommend the Fear of a Black Hat for quick laughs. <br /> <br /> Remember, "Don't shoot at you, see the whites! .... from their eyes? No, don't shoot at you. See the whites. <br /> <br /> FYM and enjoy the movie.
