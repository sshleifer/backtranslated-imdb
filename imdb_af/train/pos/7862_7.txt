Here's a proof of why Mary Pickford was America's Love. In this rather complex drama, Maria plays the young daughter of a sticker who dreams of dreaming of a relationship with the son of one of the "hill batsmen". The screens where they steal a kiss and otherwise fall in love are simply delightful. She is even prepared to take a bath. That Mary can draw this role at the age of 30 is simply incredible and somewhat due to her minimal form (5 '). <br /> <br /> Tess has to face many physical and emotional challenges. She does it with spunk that is not seen in many heroines of the time. Tess packs a wallet and is not ashamed to fight with anyone. Why she agrees to help the "Hill-topper" daughter is outside of me, but she offers her own happiness to keep a deep secret. Pickford's close ups are wonderful. <br /> <br /> Danish-born Jean Hersholt is simply wonderful as the villain. The scene in which he handles a small baby is enough to let you throw vegetables (or whatever) at the movie screen. If Forrest Robinson (who plays Daddy Skinner) wore a beard, would he have been a match for the model used in World War I to recruit Uncle Sam posters? Do you want to! <br /> <br /> Although the story is somewhat predictable and slow in the beginning, it's worth getting the investment in your time to see the piece "Americana". The film emphasizes choices that make us all available to make someone else happy and what it is to be a true Christian. Recommended.
