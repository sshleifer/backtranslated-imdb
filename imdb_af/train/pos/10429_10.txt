I'm usually not a fan of strictly romantic movies, but have heard it is good. I was amazed. Easily the most romantic thing I've ever seen in my life. Stunning. Brilliant, sweet, funny and full of heart. The chemistry is flawless like writing and directing. <br /> <br /> Ethan Hawke and Julie Delphy are so natural and sweet together, you really think they are a few. <br /> <br /> The movies immediately grab you and don't let go. You can't look away, and you can't stop listening. Even the small moments just melt your heart. <br /> <br /> It has jumped into the ranks of one of my favorites ever. N masterpiece.
