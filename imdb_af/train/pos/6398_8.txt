"Inspirational" stories of "triumph of the human spirit" are usually great kicks for me. The most surprising thing about PEOPLE OF HONOR is how much I enjoyed it despite myself. The movie is as predictable and clickable as it gets, but it works. Many credits go to the exciting performances of both. It is a perfect role for Cuba Gooding, Jr., who is being held here in a wonderful way. We expected a lot from De Niro, and he didn't disappoint. He creates a dark funny portrait. Director George Tillman, Jr. Made an old-style movie and won with a winner.
