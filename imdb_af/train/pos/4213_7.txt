Director Samuel Fuller generates a brilliant visual setup: a chick unknowingly pulls a microfilm from a woman's wallet; She seems to be a courier for the Communists, and now she and the grifter are being watched by the police. The Film Noir Formula is all its glory - before the ingredients become clich√©s - including waterfront spots, floozies, soundtrack saxophones and one climax hell hell. Performances by Richard Widmark and Jean Peters are right on the target, and the clever, sharp script is very colorful. Fabulous Thelma Ritter received an Oscar nomination for the knockout supporting role as a "professional stool". Exciting, atmospheric, tough like nails. *** of ****
