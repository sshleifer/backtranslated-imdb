Many people have noticed that this movie was not as good as the first. Well, maybe it's not for you. How does your child react to it? Well, mine loved it more than the first. <br /> <br /> Past Disney movies can sometimes be a little difficult for small children. (For example - Bambi's mother is shot.) This movie was really great for my sensitive girl who likes humor and happy ends. <br /> <br /> If you want to be snobby about what Disney's standards should be based on past - skip this movie. <br /> <br /> If you have a lovely little girl or gentle boy you really want, buy this movie and treat your little ones. This movie is great as a bedtime movie for happy dreams instead of nightmares. I'm happy with a movie that pleases my child and doesn't always have to impress the parents.
