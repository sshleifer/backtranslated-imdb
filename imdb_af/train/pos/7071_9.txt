Time parades are the devil's trap for underpaid thoughts. They are fun to consider in a "what if?" kind of way. Filmmakers and writers this time treated in a series of films and television, including 'Star Trek: First Contact', the 'Back to the Future' trilogy, 'Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure', 'Groundhog Day' and the Stargate SG1 homage , 'Window of Opportunity'. Heinlein's 'All You Zombies' was written decades ago and yet it will be for the first time people reading that short story. <br /> <br /> In the case of Terry Gilliam's outstanding movie, '12 Monkeys', it's hard to figure out what continuity problems are facing plural elements intended to remind us of our concept of the movie. Repeated views will lead us to different conclusions if we maintain an open mind. <br /> <br /> Some, watch the movie for the first time, consider Cole, played by Bruce Willis as schizophrenic. Most will see Cole as a man disturbed by what Adams describes as "the constant variation of experience" he has visited through time travel. <br /> <br /> Contrary to other times, '12 Monkeys' is unclear whether future history can be altered by manipulating past events. Cole told his psychiatrist, Railly (Madeleine Stowe), that time could not be changed, but a call he made from the airport was intercepted by scientists after being sent to his own personal timeline in 1996. <Br /> <br /> Even this can be seen as an event that took place in a single timeline universe to ensure that the timeline is not changed. Cole must die in the eyes of his younger self for the fate to be realized. If so, time is like a liquid, it always finds its own level or path, regardless of the external forces acting on it. This makes it difficult to use these kinds of things too much. <br /> <br /> If you can change future events that then lead the actions of those who have the power to return people in time, as we see on board, then the plane at the end of the movie, then does that mean that the future can be changed by manipulating past events ... or does it? The film has probably led to many drunken brawls at bars regularly offered by physicists and mathematicians. <br /> <br /> Bonus material on the DVD makes it very interesting to watch. Gilliam was under normal pressure to bring the film under the budget. This is no surprise after Munchausen's debut and in view of his later attempt to film Don Quixote. I would rate the 'making' documentary as one of the more interesting ones I saw. This is definitely no whitewash and observes the problems and sometimes conflict between the creative people involved. Gilliam's description of the film as his "7th" release, because the film was written by other writers than himself - and therefore not really "his" movie - does not make the film itself justice. <br /> <br /> Brad Pitt's portrayal of Goines is remarkably busy, though his character is not very sympathetic. Look for his slight wall eye in one of the asylum screens. This is disturbing and distracting. <br /> <br /> Probably a coincidence, the Louis Armstrong song 'What a Wonderful World' was used at the end of both '12 Monkeys 'and the last episode of the TV series' The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Milky Way '. Both the film and the TV series also had British actor Simon Jones. <br /> <br /> '12 Monkeys' is a science fiction story that will entertain the same way that can entertain the mental stimulation of a game of chess. It's not an unlimited recreation, it's for sure.
