This movie is really real and random. It's really hard to find movies like Hollywood movies now in Hollywood. I really enjoy watching this movie, I bought his DVD this week and I watched it for 4 times. I love Paz's Spanglish accent, it's just really cute as she is. And her play and Morgan's are so funny and natural. <br /> <br /> My movie taste may be quite different from others, but I have to say I really love this movie, the simple is the best! <br /> <I learned a little more about the life of this movie (or at least the US life). Life is actually random. Sometimes you meet someone, they go through your life and become your friends coincidentally, and you don't spend so much time with them, maybe just a while, but you enjoy it while you're with them, and then you'll and they never meet each other again, but the time you spend together is really memorable. Just keep those moments in mind as grateful and beautiful memories ... <br /> <br /> This movie can be cheap in price, but its meanings are not cheap at all. I can't learn anything from movies, but it's an exception.
