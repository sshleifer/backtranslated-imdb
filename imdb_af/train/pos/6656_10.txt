This movie is simply awesome. It was a very sensitive issue and the movie was excellent. This film didn't make a controversy in India (as far as I know) and its publicity was also kept low. Initially, I thought this movie would just be a waste of time since most Indian directors and producers used to change the theme although it is very sensitive and adds a love story to the original story and spoils the whole thing. Most Indian viewers will agree on this topic if they remember Ashoka, Mangal Pandey, LOC, and so on. <br /> <br /> There were so many movies in India that would have become milestone or mega-hits if the love story part were not added unnecessarily. <br /> <<br /> <br /> If that counts, I would like to thank Anil Kapoor (producer) and Firoz Abbas Khan (the director) for the film. make such a big movie ..
