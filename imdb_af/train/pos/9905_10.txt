I lost the score of how many reviews I wrote at the time. I read a lot of bad things and I will say this is a fantastic movie. For some time, Simon Scuddamore has revealed his famous suicide, and although it was his only film, he made the movie so good. At first I didn't know anything about Simon until I read a review of his suicide. Then I found out about the current website at www.IMDb.com, born in 1957, in Dayton, Ohio. Simon has played the most pathetic character that man knows, but his real life certainly has severe and weak points. He did a good acting job, which can't agree? I always wondered how he felt he was following himself in a movie. Must be rather embarrassed to say the least. I only saw the movie when I was 12 in the sixth grade. I agree with some tips that the girl wouldn't take a bath after someone was murdered and that high schools didn't have baths! I think Caroline Munro, who was 36 at the time, was the only other star to have a worthy acting talent. Unfortunately, he did not make any future films for Simon's death. The reason (s) for his suicide is a mystery, and hopefully it will be discovered in the near future. If he does the math on his website, he tells you he was 29 when he made Slaughter High. He looked like a teenager. I give this movie two thumbs, the best horror movie made. Probably because of their terrible acting, the other did not boast in the movie business. -Jacob Young
