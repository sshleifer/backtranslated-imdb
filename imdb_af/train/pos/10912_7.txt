"The former Bradford" (1936), the lead roles of William Powell, the Thin Man series, was released the same year as the second Thin Man movie, "After the Thin Man", coming very close to pleasure and Thin Man movie style, but it still does. Yet it is a wonderful, very entertaining murder mystery in the same comic year. <br /> <br /> Is Myrna Loy missed? Of course, let's not lie. , I would be hard to name a better substitute than Jean Arthur. And the chemistry between Arthur and co-star William Powell is actually and it's fun, romantic and involved. <br /> <br /> The story and script by Anthonyu Vieller and John Wyne's production partner, James Edward Grant ("The Angel & The Bad Man"), is close to being there with a Thin Man effort, but doesn't have a bit of real white and sizzle. <br /> <br /> While not in the stratosphere of The Thin Man movies (what is it yet?), the ex-mrs. Bradford is one of the most entertaining of the dozens and dozens of mystery comedy "what-to-do" of the 30's and 40's.
