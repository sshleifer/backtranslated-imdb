After seeing liberation, it looks like movies like Pulp Fiction aren't that extreme. Perhaps with today's blood and bullet standards it doesn't look so noble, but if you think it was 1972 and that the movie has a real sinister core, it will make you different. <br /> <br /> When I started watching this movie, nothing really was unusual before I came to the "Dueling Banjos" scene. In that scene, the brutality and edge of this movie is truly visible. When I watch Drew (Ronny Cox, Robocop) go with a seemingly retracted young boy, it really shows how edgy this movie can get. If you think the kid has a small banjo, which he probably made by hand, compared to Drew's pretty expensive guitar, you'll really find out how the four men from their area are from the area. <br /> <br /> As the plot goes, it's very credible and never stretches beyond its limits. But what really sets this film apart, about four businessmen who get more than they can on a canoe trip, is that director John Boorman (Excalibur) breaks all the characters of ordinary caricatures or stereotypes. So, as the movie goes into full horror and tension, I really care about all four men and what will happen to them. <br /> <br /> The play is universally excellent. With Jon Voight (Midnight Cowboy, Enemy of the State) and Burt Reynolds (Boogie Nights, Striptease), the big role leads. Jon Voight probably does the hardest thing about everyone in this movie and it makes his transformation of the family man very credible. Unlike Reynolds, whose character is a warrior from the beginning, Voight's character transforms over the course of the film. Ned Beatty (Life) is also well into an extremely difficult role, and is raped by a mountain car, while Ronny Cox changes into a credible performance. <br /> <br /> One thing that made these movies really powerful for me is that the villains were as scary as I have ever seen. Bill Mckinney and Herbert Cowboy Coward were excellent and extremely frightening than the mountain buggies. <br /> <br /> Overall Deliverance was excellent and I propose it to anyone except for those with poor stomachs and children. 10/10. See this movie.
