Another of the movies you hear from friends (... or read about IMDb). Not many false notes in this one. I could see that everything here actually happens to a young girl who flies from a dead-end hometown in Tennessee to Florida, with all her worldly possessions in an old-fashioned car. <br /> <br /> The heroine, Ruby, starts to fake, but learn from them. I wondered why she didn't lean on Mike's shoulder anymore, but ... she had her reasons, as it turned out. <br /> <br /> Just a fine movie. The only thing I don't like much about, I think, is the title.
