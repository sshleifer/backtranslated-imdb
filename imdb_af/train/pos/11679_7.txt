Clara Bow's beauty and wonderful appeal is the main reason for watching this movie. "Hula" is not quite up to date with Clara's best movies, but it's still nice. she dances, she drives her horse and strives for the man she loves. This movie is just over an hour long and is targeted by the future Oscar winner (away with the wind). The movie is moving fast and Clara Bow has a lot of screen time. If you like Clara, I would recommend "Hula".
