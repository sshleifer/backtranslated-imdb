I am a fan of TV movies in general and that was one of the good things. The games accomplished throughout were pretty solid and there were bends I didn't see before every commercial. For me it was kind of like Medium met CSI. <br /> <br /> Did anyone else think that the girl looks in some lights like a young Nicole Kidman? Are they related in any way? I will definitely see it or rent it if it ever comes to the video. <br /> <br /> Dedee was wonderful. I didn't see many things in her and she did her work very convincingly. <br /> <br /> If you are in TV mystery movies, watch this one if you have a chance.
