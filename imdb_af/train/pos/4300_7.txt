This film was one of the usual soapies related to the daily happenings of half a dozen families whose lives are intertwined. Broken relationships, building new friendships, street bashes, near accidents, hopes and dreams and even the discovery of a baby thrown under some bushes! What a mixture of events! <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the filmmaker goes beyond the daily events and questions, although there are no satisfactory answers. He asks? In this chaotic world things just happen, it's just luck when things look straight or a fatalistic view is a person predicted to be in a certain place at a certain time and thus get involved the opportunity and its future take on a new perspective? Most of us had this wonderful experience. <br /> <br /> Is it our super-ego that makes us believe we are so important? As one character says ?? He once sat on the edge looking out over the Grand Canyon and realized how infinitely small he was. <br /> <br /> It's not one of my favorite movies, but is a good study of human relationships. Danny Glover is outstanding in a sympathetic role.
