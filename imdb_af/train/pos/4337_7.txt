I am disappointed that Reiser (who wrote the film) had the need to use so much profanity for no reason whatsoever. Maybe it's his idea of ​​"adult" movies, very unpleasant words with bathroom humor being thrown in? I thought about him better and thought less about him for this movie. <br /> <br /> Falk's acting and a few moments of humor, as well as a few key themes, have given me such a high rating. <Br /> <br /> It may be a good movie for adult kids to watch and laugh about their own people and their foibles. But the lack of consideration for hearing families seriously impaired what could have been a family movie, but failed. Certainly not worth spending money, though it may be free on television.
