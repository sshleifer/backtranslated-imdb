I must say, when "Pushing Daisies" came out, I was immediately won by the fairy tale like the introduction of such a fury. The narrator made a cake from all the trials by making death look like routine, Well, Ned (Lee Pace). And it brings them back to life. Just as routine. <br /> <br /> The trio of Ned, Emerson Cod (Chi McBride) and Charlotte "Chuck" Charles (Anna Friel), plus sometimes sidekick Olive Snook (Kristin Chenoweth, who made the musical Wicked so delighted) made a great dialogue and silliness. It definitely deserves the title of a romantic comedy / drama. <br /> <br /> Ned and Chuck have made a shy and non-right-for-love couple still exploring their feelings, though they cannot touch - a barrier that really does not occur with Aids gloves, cellophane, and strange schedules around the apartment. But despite the inconvenience being offered because they work their feelings around a strange secret that only a few know, they can still show their on-screen chemistry in scenes such as Ned giving the beehives Chuck. However, Olive's presence makes some breakthroughs in the pie shop and unforeseen complications for the couple. <br /> <br /> Second season fell sharply, dampening a show with real potential. On some of the episodes, the plot line is rushing and uncomfortable, and you ask "what just happened?" in both the overall dead-person-of-the-week plot and in the dominant plot line. The addition of Chuck's father plus two half-brothers to Ned did not help, and at least one of the plot lines almost recovered (the episode "Comfort Food" did not feel like the episode "Bitter Sweets" in the fact that Die killing person of the week died in food?). A few moments (the beehives) happened to promote the relationship between Chuck and Ned, but each time they were close, the authors decided to throw a different key rather than having the relationship developed. (Oliver comes back from the monastery, Chuck's dead father comes back to life and doesn't go back, you get the picture.) <br /> <br /> Shame it didn't work out, but the concept was good and was in a good way surreal, just enough Pleasantvillesque color / happy smiley goes on and indescribable scenarios to remind you that it is not 'Dead As Me'. Then again, it's in the time of a Madeliefie hug, 'according to Creator Bryan Fuller, so it makes it plausible again. <br /> <br /> It should have been longer, but it's just filthy thinking at this point. Kudos to what new show attempts to replace these short-lived jewelry.
