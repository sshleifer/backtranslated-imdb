Cypher is a movie worth seeing because it's not the Sci-Fi movie. The artistic approach is painted with dark scenes and a kind of macro view of what's going on. The close-up camera sees how the director keeps the plot illusory. The sci-fi aspect of the movie is secondary to the plot of the movie. The technology used in the movie is not too impressive, but the director uses the props well. <br /> <br /> Character development is deliberately level. The main character, Jeremy Northam, decides to immerse himself in the world of espionage. It is up to the audience to find out its enigmatic character and that is the mystery that the audience is interested in at the end.
