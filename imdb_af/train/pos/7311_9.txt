Halloween is a movie I have to watch every time it's the day of the year. I even look at it when it's not the holiday! This movie is so big. Jamie Lee Curtis is an actress I can never stop loving. This movie may be old, but the story line just gets me there and the play was absolutely fantastic! Although I didn't see the remake, I feel it was totally unnecessary. I think Rob Zombie has never made such a classic repetition. However, what kills me is to know there are people there who have seen the remake without first hearing the original. I'm furious, just think about it !!!!!! This movie was great and it will always be remembered in history as a classic.
