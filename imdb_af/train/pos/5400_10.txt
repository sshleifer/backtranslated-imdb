This movie is a brilliant lesson on Japanese history that soon reached the end of the Tokugawa Shogunate before the Shogunate, a great battle against the loyalist, who wanted the emperor to rule Japan. Really, I had to read a lot of history to get the whole background. <br /> <br /> Shintaro Katsu (also known as the original Zatoichi) gives an excellent performance such as Izo Okada, one of the Bakumatsu's four Hitokiri (= Human Slayer). He is a simple samurai who loses all his wealth. In order to have a good life, he becomes a holder of Takechi Hanpei (played by Tatsuya Nakada = Ryonosuke from Sword of Doom). Hanpei is an ultra-nationalist politician who allows his band Hitokiri to kill very high-quality pro-western politicians to achieve his political goals. Izo Okada follows his leader without really questioning what they are doing. As long as he has money to go to drink and spend on his whore. Okada's murder is becoming more brutal during the film and he is proud to have a reputation based on fear wherever he goes. <br /> <br /> It's a beautiful portrait of the life of a simple samurai caught in political affairs and actually naive to realize what's happening. Only after he has been betrayed and tortured and always talking to Sakamoto (who is a samurai who rejects violence) does he change his ideas and views on life. But too late .... <br /> <br /> Watch the movie to see the end of Izo Okada ... <br /> <br /> Shintaro Katsu and the rest of the staff give a brilliant performance. Each actor achieves their role. The sword is fighting very unique and fast ... probably faster than several movies these days ... <br /> <br /> Check it out if you have the chance !!!
