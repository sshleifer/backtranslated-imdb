This movie is right, if you keep in mind, corny acting and a very small plot! The special effects are decent as this movie is from the director of "Event Horizon". The costumes are like something of a crazy maximum movie. None of the soldiers speak, so others tell them what to do. It eventually ends up as a big shoot-up movie with explosions all over the place. I personally liked Russell in "tango and cash" "escape from la / new york" and "executive decision". It should see this movie leaving your mind at the door for a non-brain action science fiction movie !!
