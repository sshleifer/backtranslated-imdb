It has to be one of the most sincere and enjoyable young people meeting movies ever made. While 'Rebel Without a Cause' and 'Say Anything' deliver beautiful portraits, these movies are in line with useless subplots and Hollywood differences. This film focuses purely on the emergence of a beautiful romance. You never doubt for a moment that the movie will lead to the romantic mating of these two people. You know almost the synergy and chemistry between Jesse and Celine, and it's just sheer joy to see if they find it. This movie is usually all dialogue-based. But every conversation between these is also very interesting. What makes this couple so romantic is how real it is. How in all the conversation, while often having nothing critical, you can experience the nuances as these two become more loving and trusting. That's exactly how you'd dream of meeting that special someone. And what makes it so true is that it's not even fantastic to believe. This could be what would have happened if you had enough confidence to make a conversation with that person somewhere you noticed randomly. And what the ornaments put on this film is the wonderful backdrop of Vienna in which this film takes place. It just adds to the feeling of romantic nirvana suggesting the movie. And no matter how many times I see this movie, I don't think I'll ever tire of it.
