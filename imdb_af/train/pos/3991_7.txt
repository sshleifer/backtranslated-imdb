"If I sit down, I'll never rise again, that's what the mother (the one of the title) says to his son if he gives her rest (she is only a widow). He means rest is what a woman of his age and in her situation must do: to rest in peace, to neglect herself. But she's not in the mood for 'rest' yet. She also has a daughter who blames her for every disaster in her life. Suddenly, the revelation comes: sex and passion in the figure of a muscle maker 30 years younger than her (Daniel Craig, the brand new James Bond) when she thought, no one will ever touch her again. This is a story that reminds you of many things, especially about what a woman needs to do with her life when his husband dies. We don't seem to have progressed like that in those aspects. I mean, no one was surprised when Sean Connery had a love affair in a movie with Catherine Zeta Jones ... but what would you think if it was different? An old woman, a young guy ... nah, you're not right for that, are you? <br /> <br /> The movie features intimate tones along its length, except for 2 or 3 series in which it breaks Tones and comes out with some explicit and dirty mouth talks. That vulgar touch and the way the boy and daughter find out their mother's love affair (pretty absurd - you know what I mean when you see it) are the only indiscriminate elements in "The Mother". <br /> <br /> * My rate: 7/10
