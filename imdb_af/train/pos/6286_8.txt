away in 60 sec. wherever i start, it keeps you in the movie with some good action and some cool cars. people say it's not a good movie, I disagree, it has some cute parts, but what action movie is not. I have given it an 8 out of 10 cause of the action and the comic relief if you like the Rock or Face Off if this movie is right on your pitch, do a good job with one of the most inferior actors in my mind .

Enjoy the movie and after words have asked yourself, they have reached what they show. which means if they were going for action it was action pact. if they are trying to make a movie to change how movies are made and try to win every award from their stuff, did they? I think they made the action movie they made, it made it a chance and you won't be sorry.
