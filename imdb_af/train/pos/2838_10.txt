New York I love you, I'm full of love and power. Not for everyone, but is a beautiful movie. <br /> <br /> It's like Shia LaBeouf (seen in Transformers, Disturbia, Charlies Angels, I Robot, Indiana Jones, and more), Maggie Q, Kevin Bacon, Blake Lively, Natalie Portman, and many more more. With a star-studded cast, this film is without a doubt brilliant. <br /> <br /> Many top directors around the world don't get fit. The diversity of one story to another is creative and unique. <br /> <br /> It is safe to say that New York I Love You is a popcorn movie, and should be watched on a big TV! This time, trust the IMDb rating, as it is an excellent movie. <br /> <br /> I hardly wait for Shanghai, I will keep you in 2010. <br /> <br /> See NY ILY, you won't be disappointed.
