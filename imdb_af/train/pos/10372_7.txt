ROLL is a wonderful little movie. Toby Malone plays an 18-year-old child (very well behaved, incidentally) who is a football player. Malone's cousin takes him the evening before his big game on an adventure with lots of twists, two tournaments, a drug lover, a few solid cyclists, a few policemen and some prostitutes ... and the movie keeps us in guessing which characters are on what side of the law, what is the content of gym bag, and even which gender is a key biker. Some of them reminded me of LOCK STOCK and TWO SMOKING barrels. <br /> <br /> For me, ROLL has reinforced three opinions I have previously held to see ROLL. The opinions are: 1. One day I want to visit Australia one day. The country and cities are beautiful and it looks like a cool holiday spot. <br /> <br /> 2. Best Australian filmmakers are. The films in ROLL were particularly impressive. I love the stylized colors and lighting in many of the screens. <br /> <br /> 3. Australian women are hot!
