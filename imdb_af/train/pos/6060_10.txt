This is a great documentary film. Any fan of motorsport must own a copy of this outstanding movie. Director "Stephen Low" did a good job as well as the main stars of the film, Father & Son, Mario & Michael Andretti. The DVD looks and sounds amazing. And best of all, it's IMAX! Large home screen test disk.
