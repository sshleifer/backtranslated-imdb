I have to admit I'm a big fan of South Park and expect basketball to be funny, but nowhere near as good as it seems to be! I think that's what happens when you mix David Zucker, Matt Stone, and Trey Parker. This movie has so much repetition value and does not need to take serious adversity. The slack stick style humor mixed with Stone and Parker just works flawlessly. The kind of humor that was present in Basketball was not popular at the time of its release. If it comes out, it will be a hit. Don't bother to be critical, just leave your brain at the door and expect endless laughter to come. Recommended to anyone with a good sense of humor.
