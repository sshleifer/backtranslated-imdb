I think I really love this movie. "Prix de Beaute" was originally a silent film, but later switched on in French in 1930. Despite having someone else's voice over her, it remains an incredible tournament for Louis Brooks. The fact that her singing voices are dubbed by legendary Edith Piaf helps us alleviate our purists about the double deception. <br /> <br /> This is the story of Lulu and we first see her at a resort with her macho boyfriend, Andre (Georges Charlia) and their friend Antonin (Augusto Bandini). Lulu enters the frame as a few legs: we see her inside the car that changes into her swimming costume. Lulu is very free to dismiss her body and it does not fit well with the annoying Andr√©. When Lulu is considering applying for the title "Miss Europe", we know that a happy ending will not end at Easy Street. <br /> <br /> The film is very much like men who focus on beautiful women. We see a lot of bathing beauty and the reactions of the men who look at them. But in the middle of it all is the beautiful Louise Brooks. <br /> <br /> If you don't mind watching movies of the passing periods, consider checking this one. Louise Brooks is not a name that most average movie buffers can easily know, but once you see her you will be fascinated and you will want to know more. Also check her in 'Pandora's Box' if you can find it. <br /> <br /> Be careful of the American Cinema DVD release. I don't know if their projection speed is correct. Many of the screens seem to be speeding fast. It might have been the way they were shot. I do not know. But since this is the only way to watch this movie, it's worth swallowing that one little bitter pill.
