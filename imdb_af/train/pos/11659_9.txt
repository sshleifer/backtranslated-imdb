This animated feature (a co-production between Ireland, Belgium and France) deals with what is surely one of the strangest subjects ever for a movie: the 9th century creation of a famous enlightened manuscript, the book of Kells. In this fantastic story of the story, a prepubescent boy named Brendan, who is ruled in a monastery by his uncle, must be a strict abbot worried about preparing the defense of the abbey from the threatening Vikings attack. forest to find the material that a master lighting called Aidan needs to complete the book. To perform this task, he unexpectedly finds the help of a friendly fairy Aisling. Yellow and delicate hand drawn (there are some computer animation in a few key ways) in a way such as medieval and traditional Celtic art, and with a very creative use of color and all kinds of geometric shapes, this film is inexorable strange, but it is a good feature, not of the varied variety, but of the eye opening. If one were nitpick - beyond some anachronisms, like an African monk in the 9th century of Ireland? One should say that the blend of Catholic mysticism with Celtic paganism in this movie never really fuses. And the comic relief is sometimes a bit too wide. Therefore, I cannot give them the highest position. But these are minor issues with an otherwise beautiful and wonderfully imaginative film.
