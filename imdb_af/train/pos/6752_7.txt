A detective (Dana Andrews) with a reputation for violence accidentally killed a suspect in a murder (Craig Stevens) and then tries to cover it. The Otto Preminger-directed movie has a lot of atmosphere, but the story is watered when the dead woman (Gene Tierney) falls for Andrews. He dug himself pretty well in and out of a big hole, but she was just too much light at the end of the tunnel for a noir movie. Gary Merrill is wonderful as Scalese, a crime boss Andrews is putting down. The tension between them gives the film its energy and drive, especially a scene in a bathhouse with Merrill, Andrews and Neville Brand, and the night time outside the Bellevue hospital establishes what the film's conclusion should be. High points for the atmosphere, Andrews, Merrill, etc ... And the general depiction of the underworld, although the love angle and the simplistic good cop do not help bad cop elements its cause.
