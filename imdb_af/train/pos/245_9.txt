The only reason I wanted to see it was because of Orlando Bloom. Simply put, the movie was spectacularly average. It's not bad, but it's really not very good. The editing is good; the movie is well played. The direction is competent and secure. The story is plodding. The film is performed by Ledger, Bloom, and the usually great Watts and Rush. The accents are impenetrable if you come from the US, just back and enjoy the scenery (or as I call it, Orlando Bloom). By the end of the film I was not bored or moved. Some people asked what happened to Ned Kelly at the end of the movie. I have to say, I didn't mind. <br /> <br /> Really, the only reason I can recommend it is that Orlando Bloom shows some sort of hints (although the often-featured "I'm beautiful and confused" look is prominent), so it can Worth appreciating the matinee price. Other than that, it just doesn't. It's not good enough or bad enough to be entertaining.
