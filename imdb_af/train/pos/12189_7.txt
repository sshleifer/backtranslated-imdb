Despite the loving Rita Hayworth, who intrigues the last few rows of the film and appreciates some of the more subtle "symbolic" aspects of cinematography, the Shanghai woman didn't really work for me. I had a problem with most representations, the script and the overall structure. And in a movie that mostly speaks to people in different situations, it's quite a problem. The Lady of Shanghai came at a very low "C" or a 7 for me. <br /> <br /> The Lady of Shanghai is really about the character of Orson Welles, Michael O'Hara. O'Hara sees Elsa "Rosalie" Bannister (Rita Hayworth) in Central Park on a ryrit and hits on her. Later he saved her from a cup and she shone at him. O'Hara is a sailor from Ireland and the globe rotting Elsa happens with a hunt with her husband, Arthur (Everett Sloane), a very famous and powerful California lawyer. They talk to O'Hara to work for them, despite his initial discussions - it seems to him and to the audience that Elsa is just looking for someone to have a relationship, and O'Hara doesn't want to get involved . . <br /> <br /> Shortly after they went on their yacht, a strange man, George Grisby (Glenn Anders), who says he was Arthur's partner, appeared on a lane of the track and started the trouble riot. Eventually, Grisby asks O'Hara to enter a very dubious and dangerous scheme. Foolish, O'Hara agrees. Of course, it gets him in some trouble, and eventually a number of mysteries are revealed. <br /> <br /> Perhaps my movie problems are in the fact that I have so far not exactly produced a great fan of Orson Welles, producing, writing, directing and consuming most of the screen time. I haven't seen near the majority of Welles' work yet, but I tended to make his later movies better when he became a little more champion and performance artist. For example, I love F for Fake (Veertes et mensonges, 1974), and I even like his performance in Casino Royale (1967), when he insisted on bizarre tricks on a baccarat table, but Citizen Kane ( 1941) never did much to me, although it gave 3 or 4 chances over the years (including about a year ago; my score was low 7 - the same as my current score for The Lady from Shanghai). <br /> <br /> Welles' performance and the dialogue he has written for himself come to me as touched and prosperous. He's a bit of a motormouth, a drill, and a bit monotonous. He tends to sound like he reads. His performance reminded me of what I saw of Welles' version of Moby Dick (listed on IMDb as 1999, but "completed" in 1971, which can also be seen in Orson Welles: The One Man Band (1995)), where he apparently just read to the camera and believes he is inherently sublime dramatic. I'm also someone who almost never complains about accents, but Welles manages to make his Irish accent sound that is also touched and pretentious to me. <br /> <br /> As for the other performances, I can only say I thought Hayworth did an excellent job. Of course she's beautiful, which doesn't hurt. Many eye cakes here. Like Welles, Sloane also touched me a little and pretentious. I have never bought his character, his disability and so on, and Anders is simply bizarre where bizarre looks. Welles often shoots him in close proximity and Anders almost always has exaggerated, manic expression on his sweat. <br /> <br /> Structurally, the Lady of Shanghai is very uneven. The first 50 minutes or so are extremely slim and soap operations, although the soap opera operations tend to be approached from a winding angle. As soon as Grisby launches his scheme, things get a little better and usually improve as we near the end. But by the time the Shanghai woman becomes a crime / mystery movie, it is too late, and it quickly becomes a courtroom drama before the sudden, exciting ending that is almost out of nowhere and too far for his family member Excellence. <br /> <br /> The end is more action-oriented, less-dialogue heavy, more varied and exotic in institutions, and sometimes, quite abstract. Welles handles that combination of materials skillfully as director. If The Lady of Shanghai was a big part of the crime / mystery and the arty ending, it could easily be a 9. The final scenes are easy 10s, as Welles moved from a Hitchcockian tense scene in a San Francisco Chinese opera house to another tense scene in a Chinese amusement park. The ivy climate uses cinematography that was experimental for its time. It is well integrated with the writing, as it enables a complex resolution and fuel much symbolism. <br /> <br /> The whole cinematography is interesting, though it usually can't make the issues a priority. Welles blocks skill sets. There are many beautifully filmed institutions, from Central Park to Acapulco to several San Francisco sites. Welles effectively creates symbolic backgrounds for his actions, from the accented heights and drops of Acapulco to the maze-like Caribbean streets, the beautifully framed and silhouetted shots of the San Francisco Aquarium, and so on. The romance, for which the Aquarium serves as one backdrop, is hampered by some kind of discomfort by the movie, but on the other hand, it never makes the romance a novelty. <br /> <br /> Certainly serious Welles fans will appreciate the Lady of Shanghai much more than I did, and of course it's worth a watch if you like Rita Hayworth. The Lady of Shanghai is not a terrible movie, but it is dangerously close not to "pass". Continue carefully.
