Time for a rant, eh: I thought Spirit was a good movie to watch. However, there were a few things that prevented me from upgrading it above 6 or 7. I'm a little generous with the 7. <br /> Point # 1: Matt Damon exacerbates me. I thought, "what a dicky voice they got for the main character," when I first told him - and then I realized it was Matt Damon. The man struggles so badly - his performance in "The Departed" was terrible and ruined the movie (before the movie had a chance to destroy itself, but it's another story for another time) " I was able to get past that because there was so little narration ... thank you Point # 2: Brian Adams sucks ... The whole score was terrible ... The songs were inexhaustible, generic and poorly executed Not once did I found that the music did not fit, and the lyrics were terrible, every time one of the lame songs touched, I was switched off, I almost thought I heard some patriotic propaganda slipping into the super-American freedom style songs Not just reminiscent of the terrific patriotic songs that have been playing on the radio all the time on 9/11. radio-hit, teen bop, 14-year-old girl e. I thought I was back in junior high school. I can't believe I couldn't have done better. I refuse to do so. If it wasn't, I'd arrange the movie more with Disney, who knows a thing or two about originality (okay, don't bother saying what I know some of you probably think;). It's a pity they couldn't have hired better musicians. <br /> <br /> I like the arts and animation, except for some things here and there ... as sometimes the corners seem too sharp on the face and the lines too thick or dark on the body (thick / dark lines near the end). There were often times when I thought they had gone too hard on emotion and facial expressions and failed to draw any real emotion. But there were also times when the emotion became thick. Anyway, many scenes were lazy and the layers were clear. <br /> <br /> OK, I fall asleep here so I can summarize it before I make less sense ... <br /> <br /> Try on an epic movie ... it turns out mediocre. Matt Damon, you suck!
