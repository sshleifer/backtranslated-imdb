Season after season, the players or characters in this show seem to be people you will absolutely love. Is this display frequent to be or have they been chosen for the same? Each episode conceals one single person and ends up killing. You enjoy seeing them being screwed, although it is completely wrong and sick. You enjoy seeing them screw others, screwing themselves, dirtying them, getting them back, escaping and finally being kicked out by Trump. The amount of tears also seems to increase by the season. <br /> <br /> The rewards that seek to compensate for compensation and suffering are also greatly reduced. In the new seasons, it's like: "You get xyx that will teach you about uvw" ... like freaking? The characters are so hateful, collective and individual, that you wonder if they are paid actors? The only healthy person gets to win. <br /> <br /> Be careful and maintain a conscience. These are your fellow men in the firing line.
