When I saw this animation for the first time (I was 15 maybe) I was really impressed! It has a completely different style compared to Japanese animation and I like it more. The whole impression of the film is more sinister and dark ... The colors are not so ... colorful. The characters don't talk much, there are no long and boring conversations about this and that (like in Ghost in the Shell). With its dark photographs, views of strange animals and sense of magic, it looks like one of those old Scandinavian stories, full of violence and terrible creators, enchanted forests and deep caves, living by dragons, throlls, orchestra ... and a mysterious hero to stop evil ...
