I saw this kung fu movie when I was a kid, and I thought it was so cool! Now I'm 26 years old and my friend has it on DVD !!! <br /> <br /> We have a case of brewing, and looked at these classic! It has NOT lost any of its original kung fu cool! If you're a fan of kung fu / karate movies, it's a must see ... the DVD is available. I believe this movie is also called "Pick Your Poison". <br /> <br /> See it soon!
