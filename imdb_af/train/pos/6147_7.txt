Well, this movie is about Bedknobs and Broomsticks, this is one of the nicest, best movies you'll ever see as a kid. This is the memorable movie about two adults and two mocking kids on a fun adventure. It may be a bit deniable to look at, but try it, I didn't even think my mom was bad, I was very enthusiastic about the movie and the animation. They were all pretty good. <br /> <br /> It's a wonderful wonderful comedy that the whole family can enjoy; even the children. Ages 7 years and older will enjoy this wonderful musical comedy with you and your family especially the animation. The animation movements and layouts are really nice and deserve an inch. It is a very good musical for the whole family. What are you waiting for? Go to the video store and rent Bedknobs and Broomsticks NOW.
