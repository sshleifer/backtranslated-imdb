Since I first saw it in the theater, it was my favorite. Since then I have seen it many times and I never get tired of it. The environment has a lot to do with it (the Colorado I know would be jealous), but the storyline was original and I liked how it used the little town people as heroes. There is not a movie that I can compare. John Lithgow plays a clever villain, but I love how he is completely out of his element. He has to lie around Tucker and it's interesting. It's an action movie at the BEST. I don't think I'll see another that is so entertaining. <br /> <br /> You don't need 50,000 laps to qualify as an action movie. It must just enchant you, not drunkenness.
