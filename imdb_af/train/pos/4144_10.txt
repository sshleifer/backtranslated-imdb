For a while I was caught in the trap where I watched myself and independent and foreign films and laid myself down for them. Fat Cars The bus is the exception. This is the truth. It's the best "bad" movie ever. <br /> <br /> Of course, the "bad" of this movie looks natural. Halfway through Satan's opening monologue, the word "hell" appears at the bottom of the screen. The glamorous Bridget is an unshaven man in a wig and a savings store. It takes the eccentric couple trying to kill each other, never to step down the stairs. Jesus walks to a funk soundtrack. <br /> <br /> In any case, Fatty gives the impression that someone has lost their term of office to advise a senior film project. But this is the sincerity of how bad it is that makes it so wonderful. You get the impression that the makers knew it was going to be bad, but never forced it. <br /> <br /> Never wonder, Fatty. Highly recommended.
