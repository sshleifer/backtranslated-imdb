Two years passed and mostly everyone looks different, some for good and some for worse. I still enjoy as much as I originally did. <br /> <br /> Some mistakes they have had to change the Joker now have no red lips and look more like blackish hair and black pupils, still pronounced by Hamill who is a plus I think. They made Poison Ivy more white hint that she became more like a plant, and Catwomen looked very different and not as attractive as she was in the original. <br /> <br /> Although costumes like Batman, Batgirl, Killer Croc and the scarecrow seem bad, especially scarecrow. <br /> <br /> The show isn't as dark as the original because Batman doesn't work as alone as he used to. Most of the time works with Batgirl and the new Robin, Tim Drake. While NightWing (Dick Grayson) often comes to the rescue. Batman showed the yellow logo and the black wing on his suit and seemed to have grown a bit bigger, but still kicking tons of asses. <br /> <br /> The show isn't as good as the original, mainly due to some of the refurbished characters, but the stories are as exciting as ever and the dialogue is still elite. "Over the edge" can be one of the biggest Batman episodes, so make sure you look it up. <br /> <br /> Overall 8-9 / 10
