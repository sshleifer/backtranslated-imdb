I saw it in theaters and absolutely adored it. Geoffery Rush has the best performance as a super villain I've ever seen since Gene Hackman and Lex Luther. Kel Mitchel and Paul Rubens were a match girl in heaven. This film also introduced me to William H. Macy, who is now one of my favorite actors. Hank was big like the Blue Raja, and I especially loved that the character wasn't really British. The scene with him and telling his mother that he was a superhero, almost brought tears into my eyes. I loved the fact that The Bowler was talking to the ball. Some of the funniest things have Stiller and his character, Mr. Furious's fake rage and the fact that his threats and one-liners were all gibberish and never made sense. I almost couldn't stop complaining when he said "Fraculater, Freinken-Puss," said. But one of the things I enjoyed most was that Captain Amazing actually died in the movie. I recommend this movie for any occasion, and I give it my own personal two-imprint.
