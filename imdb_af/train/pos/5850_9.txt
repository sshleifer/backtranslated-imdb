It's been 16 years since it originally went. I would have hoped a "marketing wizard" has already promoted a live actor version of this classic version or at least tried to release the original 65 episodes again. I can't understand why the sci-fi or cartoon network didn't shut it down. Galaxy Rangers actually had well thought out plots, and even better scripts. The animation was above average quality for his time, and excellent compared to today's Japanese animated slideshow. It predicted the heavy toy toy tie in the market, and it also hurt it. I will willingly spend cash on a DVD from GR if available.
