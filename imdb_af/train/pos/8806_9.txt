I chose to watch this film on the day it opened nationally in France, as a personal way for me to think about what happened last year; the collection works as intended: it causes a whirlwind of thoughts and emotions, works as an intellectual heavenly, which never leads to cheap sentimentality or knee-jerk reaction. <br /> <br /> There are many allegations that the film is anti-American: while I cannot speak to everyone in this regard, I am one American who found such statements completely untrue. people are making a lot of noise about the Egyptian segment, by Chahine, because it addresses perspectives of Palestinian suicide bombings that citizens in a democracy are "honest targets" because they choose governments for which the bombers want to attack, but ignore many the piece: several perspectives are discussed, nobody is picked up as the truth, and critics - if they have seen the piece - seem to forget the love and warm dialogue that takes place between the director and the ghost of the American dialogue, and director's intense sadness about the tragedy. <br /> <br /> Many of the films are beautiful, thoughtful and inspiring, especially the brilliant work of Mahkmalbaf, Tanovic, Loach & Inarritu. Nair, well as usual, effectively tells a true story of an injustice committed against a Muslim family in the wake of anti-Islam mystery that has scrapped the states. I found Gitai's piece a bit vulgar hard and simple in his criticism of the media hysteria in the face of terrorism, and Penn's piece was too impressionistic and elliptical to my taste, though I would have liked it. Borgnine is very good and brave in it. SPOILER WARNING: One reviewer below reads the fall of the towers incorrectly as a happy moment for the character; Rather, my reading is that the fall of the towers is that, because the light flooded its room, it dropped into the loss of its life which it refused to admit. Again, this is a kind of impressionist piece, because we know that if the towers really block the man's apartment, then there would be nothing more than smoke and ash, not light, flowing through his window.
