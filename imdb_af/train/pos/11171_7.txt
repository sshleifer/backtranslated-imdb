Overall this movie was great for its time and will be interesting for many more generations to come. Although the plot is not 100% accurate on the book, everything is right. The movie goes far ahead and misses some important parts. I found the book and got ready and immediately wished they had made a movie (because I haven't gotten the movie yet), but later I found the movie in a bargain at Wal-Mart and decided to buy it and see if it was what I expected. Overall, I give these movies a 7 out of 10 for its good parts (relative accuracy and overall sense) and for its bad parts (big time jumping and small but noticeable inaccuracies).
