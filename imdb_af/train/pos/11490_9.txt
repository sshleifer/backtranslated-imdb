I watched this movie many years ago and, in my opinion, looked at it, though it is very mysterious, it is very educational about what the future can hold. I enjoyed the movie and to this day it is very sorry for everyone who disagrees. but a movie should always be judged by everyone to own it, and I think it's a good thing to deal with all the cloning and test tube babies that are happening today, who are we to judge this movie, it can be a dramatic event Be what to become, but there you go. All the horrors of today are so far-fetched, but I laugh, but this one makes me think and it scares me as a mother as if I was desperate. After watching this movie, I would think twice sorry, but I like the movie making your own thoughts Don't make the movie - just know the story and ask yourself how far will you go for a child?
