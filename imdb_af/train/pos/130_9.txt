On October 1945, the American German descendant Leopold Kessler (Jean-Marc Barr) arrives in a post-war Frankfurt and his bitter uncle Kessler (Ernst-Hugo Järegård) gets a job for him in the Zentropa train as a sleep leader. As he travels in the train on the train, he teaches the then-occupied Germany and meets Katharina Hartmann (Barbara Sukowa), the daughter of the former powerful entrepreneur of transport business and owner of Zentropa, Max Hartmann (Jørgen Reenberg). Leopold remains neutral between the allies and the Germans and becomes aware that there is a terrorist group called "Werewolves" killing the sympathizers of the Allied and oppressive acts against the Allied forces. He fell in love with Catherine, and earlier she announced that she was a "Werewolf". When Max commits suicide, Leopold is also printed by the "Werewolves" and needs a position and decision. <br /> <br /> "Europe" is an impressive and anxious Cechanic story by the great Danish director Lars von Trier. Using an expressionist style reminiscent of Fritz Lang and alternating beautiful black-and-white cinematography with a few colored details, this film makes a difficult period of Germany known, and some of the problems this great nation had to face face after being defeated in the war. Very impressive the actions of the occupational forces destroy resources that can allow a faster reconstruction of a devastated land and the corruption with the Jew who must identify Max. Jean-Marc Barr has a beautiful show in the role of man who wants to remain neutral, but is manipulated everywhere by everyone. The hypnotic narrative of Max Von Sydow is another touch of the class in this award-winning film. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Europe"
