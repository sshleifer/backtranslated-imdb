I don't have much to add to what was said before, but it's a great movie of the time and the first (and probably) time that the studio hung the movie entirely on the Dead End Kids. <Br /> <br /> The Warner gave the boys a lot of help, from director Ray Enright and an 'A' budget, to almost magical actors of supporting actors. At each turn, we get one of those real-life jewelery achievements. They are too much to list, but just about everybody on the Warner's fate (Sans the biggest stars) seems to walk through this photo. (See if you can see John Ridgely) <br /> <br /> The only one about the best performance is the ever-reliable Eduardo Cianelli as a boss with a messianic complex. He plays this character almost exactly like that of the Thuggie leader in "Gunga Din". He's something to watch! And Marjorie Main is excellent and gets her best role since Dead End. <br /> <br /> My bid for this one is a second feature on a dual account with something like 'City for Conquest'. <br /> <br /> Hooray for Warners!
