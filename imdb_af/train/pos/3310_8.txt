In the film Kongwon-do ui it has a relatively intimate look at the meaningfulness (as well as general meaninglessness) in the lives of several Koreans; empty people looking for ways to fill themselves, enjoying the escape of nature. From the beginning to the end of the film we see the flawability of the various characters; we learn about their shortcomings and their desires, the overall complexity that is captured in human life (and yet the everyday simplicity of humanity). Although the film is moving slowly, it can be very contemplative. It does not force any ideas, but let the ideas come upon themselves, it allows the concepts to reveal themselves. <br /> <br /> The movie also ends and suddenly as it begins, one understands the meaning of loneliness, that love is often an act of selfishness, and the many mistakes we make. It is a look at everyday life, very good and beautiful. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for action or for an intense drama, this is not the movie for you. However, if you enjoy honest, original and meaningful movies that aren't forced and without glitz, it's a good movie to watch.
