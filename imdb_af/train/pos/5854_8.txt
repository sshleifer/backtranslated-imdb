This game is fun and it has a plot that you can actually expect to see in the comics. Spider man is framed by a mysterious cheater. The city is dominated by a strange guest, and symbiosis such as that of Venom and Carnage appear throughout the city. Who's behind these crimes? Could it be Doc Ock? Well, it looks like he's giving up a new leaf. Giek also does not seem to be involved, as he only admitted that Spider-man apparently cost him a fairly good photo opportunity. Well, come from other heroes and many villains later, Spidey will unravel the mystery. The battles are basic, not too difficult to pick up, the battles with the bosses are quite fun. You get comics, you run out of the web and it's a little fun to pass the city. However, it is also a weak point. The swing is not so good, because everything you do is cross the city as Spider man who apparently connects his webs to the air. You also don't have much maneuverability web swing or especially compared to a spider-man 2 movie video game. Yet it makes the bad move with the other elements, especially the story. So be prepared to see Scorpions, Rhino, Venom, Mysterio, Doctor-Octopus, and Carnage for a one-action package.
