Otto Preminger's Dana Andrews cycle of movies noirs is one of the (largely) unpopular gems of the genre. Because of their lack of paranoia, misogyny or hysteria, they could have been out of place at the moment, but the clear metaphor, the complex game of identity, masculinity and representation, the subdivision of traditional psychological principles, the severe, geometric style look strikingly modern today, and very similar to Melville. The clear irony of this movie is so loaded, brutal and ironic that the 'happy' end is one of the cruelest in Hollywood history. Brilliant at the level of entertaining thriller, strained, and full of double edge.
