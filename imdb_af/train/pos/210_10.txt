Two big comedians in a big Neil Simon movie based on his hit. <br /> <br /> Great combination especially when the relevant comedians are Matthau and Burns. Little wonder why Burns won an Oscar for this; he is as sharp and as funny as ever. And Matthau is both his game, if it's a little more funny. <br /> <br /> It's known Simon territory: two old vaudeville partners reunited for a TV specialist but can't resist each other after all these years. <br /> <br /> It's a pleasure to watch these two together, their screens make this movie an absolute pleasure. I especially liked the "beat, beat, beat / ENTER!" Enjoy. scene. And if you're a fan of Burns or Matthau, you'll enjoy it too. <br /> <br /> In fact, you'll enjoy the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Ten stars. Put a little "sunshine" in your life.
