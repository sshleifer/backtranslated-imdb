While listening to a soundbook, Cambpell Scott is the reader. I was so excited to hear his voice and it made me disappointed that "six degrees" had been canceled. They never seem as if the good performances on the sky are long enough to capture an audience associated with the show story. What a shame, and ashamed of the network not to give this show a full season. It was a great show to watch with a good role. The network gave "Men in Trees" a second chance that the witch is also a good show, but they did "Invasion" and it was also something other than watching, not the same old-fashioned themes. Why can't the networks get it right?
