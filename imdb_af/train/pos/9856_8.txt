(spoilers ??) <br /> I wasn't sure what to think of the movie. Not too much of a children's movie. Definitely look at a parent because it includes death and death. But I was surprised that I had some fun. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed with the 81 minutes we had. (even less without the credits) And the trailer gets you to think the rodent is a major being. But they tortured him. Up to the end of the movie. These two grips covered the movie with 2 stars. But I recommend the movie. Even for a successor. <br /> <br /> 8/10 <br /> Quality: 9/10 Entertainment: 7/10 Repeatable: 7/10
