"World's Finest" is a unique project. It is a trailer for a non-existent Superman / Batman crossover movie and will never exist, at least not in this form. With these characters, actors and plot lines anyway. <br /> <br /> So the movie is one big plague, even more than standard daily real movie fans. The trailer will lift you up for nothing. In this respect, I really didn't like this short project. If you look at this trailer, it makes you hungry and excited for more and at the same time sad - and maybe even afterwards it will seem like a full length movie of this trailer will never exist. Types make you wonder why this project was made in the first place. Surely to point out Sandy Collora's skills, he couldn't have done it with a real movie short, like his previous movie, Batman: Dead End. <br /> <br /> But if you have to judge this short purely For what it is, from a movie technical point of view, it's a very good one. It is wonderful and much more professional than you might have expected, although people who have seen "Batman: Dead End" already know better than expecting cardboard sets, cheap home-made costumes and third-rate actors. The card is not constantly impressive and the budget was obviously not sky-high, but it is mostly impressive and professional, with nice costumes, sets, special effects, cinematography and lighting. <br /> <br /> The short built up a good quick and typical trailer, with perhaps a little too many shots to find it credible but hey, it works well for the trailer style. It has some impressive shots, but also some lame, especially the Superman flying rows. It was obvious that the man was just standing at a moving car, with a camera pointing at him from underneath. I even found it to be a nice, laughing thing to watch. But really the better and more spectacular moments really compensate. <br /> <br /> Michael O'Hearn looked like a good Superman / Clark Kent, although of course he is not the greatest talented actor. Clark Bartram repeated his Batman role again well and Kurt Carley looked like a wonderful Lex Luthor. The rest of the player also served his purpose well enough. <br /> <br /> It is especially interesting to look at the recent new modern reinterpretations of the two main heroes of this movie, in the movies "Batman Begins" and "Superman Returns". It is interesting to compare the style and character treatment of those movies with this one. It's really great and fun to hear how much Kurt Carley sounds like Kevin Spacey, the actor Lex Luthor played in "Superman Returns". <br /> <br /> It is a beautiful and well-crafted trailer that will make you hungry for more, even though you know there will be no more. Whatever happens to the Waner Bros is planning to create a truly full-fledged Superman / Batman movie right now? I thought there were developments going on a few years ago, but since then nothing has been heard. Instead, two new separate Batman and Superman movies were made; "Batman Begins" and "Superman Returns". <br /> <br /> 7/10
