Vince Lombardi High School has a new principal - the evil Me Togar (Mary Woronov). She intends to ban rock and roll music all together. She bumps head with Riff Randall (P.J. Soles) who loves the Ramones. Also the head of the school soccer team (Vincent Van Patten) doesn't look like any girl - not real cute Kate Rambeau (Dey Young) is in love with him. <br /> <br /> An instant midnight movie. It was released in general release and almost immediately bombed - but as a midnight movie it was a big hit and has played it through the 1980s. I remember attending more than a few when I was in college - it was like a party! People sang along with the songs, laughing with every joke and generally just having fun. <br /> <br /> See it now as an adult. I can't imagine why I loved so much. The writing is youthful and full of vowels I couldn't believe I heard. Characters change randomly and the movie jumps all over the place. What saves them is some great lines and great performances by Soles and Woronov (who really enjoys her). Everyone is full of energy and plays their roles on WAY (as they should). As for the Ramones, I was never a fan. I DO like the title tune, but the rest of the songs never really caught me. If you are a Ramones fan, you can give it a higher rating. <br /> <br /> SPOILER WARNING! It's mostly for kids (it has a PG rating) that is likely to find it stupid, but fun. I especially think they will end when high school gets blown up! SPOILER END! <br /> <br /> So, if you're in the mood for a stupid midnight movie from the 1980s, you might like it. Otherwise, stay away. I give it a 7.
