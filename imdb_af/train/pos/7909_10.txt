When it first came out, my dad brought it home. We were surprised. It was so different from what we've seen before. I was looking for a specific movie last night, and I found "The Mind's Eye" again. The box falls apart, and I'm surprised the band is still working! Although it is not Nemo quality graphics, it is still very good. They have to sell it again - it's a landmark for computer animated images. Highly recommended! <br /> <br /> That's what it is: <br /> <br /> "The Mind's Eye" is a spectacular odyssey over time. Your journey begins in the beginning of creation and moves through the rise of man and technology. Travel in the world of abstraction and in the future with awesome computer animation images. <br /> <br /> "The Mind's Eye" joins the imagination of over 300 of the world's most talented computer animation artists with a powerful, original music soundtrack. This unique collaboration takes you on an incredible journey to "The Mind's Eye."
