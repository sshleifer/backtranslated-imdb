How can a movie containing Curtis Mayfield's song be bad? It can't! The Groove Tube is a series of skatological outlines that make fun of the Olympics from 2001. The highlights, (Koko the clown, the easy soup recipe) are more than the lows (too long "The Dealers"), but even the lows are funny. Best of all, Ken Shapiro's manic dance is on a busy Manhattan pavement. (It's Shapiro, not Nat King Cole just singing you, just me). Definitely dated, but at the time, the groove was careless, fat, shameless and hysterically funny. Ken Shapiro made this little cult hit, then 7 years later made the Christmas Day opening bomb, Modern Problems (although I enjoyed it) and ever since, unfortunately nothing. (He might play drums in a jazz group.) The Groove Tube remains an everlasting burst of positive energy, a movie that still brings real joy 26 years after my initial viewing!
