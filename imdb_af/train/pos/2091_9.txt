What Irving Thalberg did today to make this movie will never be tried again. Make a Chinese story with former players, even if they are of the caliber of Paul Muni, Luise Rainer, Charley Grapewin, and Walter Connolly among others. Maybe it's because the story was written by a Westerner, Pearl Buck who received a Pulitzer Prize in 1932 for her novel. Me. Buck, daughter of Chinese missionaries, probably brought China closer to America's consciousness than any other person. Not the political struggle of China, but the lives and burdens of the everyday people we find in the good earth. Unfortunately, Pearl Buck has become an excuse for Chiang Kai-Shek's Kuomintang China in all its virtues and remains. The rest of her literary output never matched the Good Earth. <br /> <br /> In The Sundowners there is a good description of the comparison of China to Australia by Peter Ustinov. When the difference was asked, Ustinov said China was very large and very full and Australia was very large and very empty. This is what you see in The Good Earth, China very large and full of people, more than she can handle at times. <br /> <br /> The Good Earth tells the story of Wang Lung (Paul Muni) as a young man who buys a woman from a large house where she was a slave. The woman O-Lan (Luise Rainer) carries him two sons and sees him through all the good times and bad things they have, drought, famine, revolution and a climate plague. <br /> <br /> Luise Rainer has the second of two consecutive Oscars depicting O-Lan. She may have made a kind of record by being the leading player Oscar show with the least dialogue. Everything she does practically is done with facial expressions. Her performance could have been on a silent movie with very minimal subtitles. I think only John Mills in Ryan's Daughter had fewer words and he was a mentally handicapped man. <br /> <br /> Muni is not always grateful for how supportive she is in the masculine dominant culture. Rainer helps in the field, carries and raises the children, does the homework. When Muni becomes a real estate agent, he takes a Chinese second trophy woman who causes him a lot of sadness. Still Rainer carries it sto. Another Muni is not a bad man and it is a tribute to the film and his acting and Buck's writing that you do not hate him and the cultural gap is over. <br /> <br /> We now have a group of Oriental players doing more than just Kung Fu movies. I'm surprised. The good earth of all movies has not been restored at this stage. I bet the Chinese government will even allow a US company to do it in a real place. <br /> <br /> Until then, we have this great classic to appreciate and enjoy.
