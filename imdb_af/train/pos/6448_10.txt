Kay Pollack (the man behind this movie) is a real big man who tries to share his philosophy of life in different ways. He wrote a lot of good and well-written books on how to control your senses and keep your soul happy. The message in most of his books and this movie is that your mind is actually what causes your problems and that the reason for your anger is never ever caused by what you think. The main message is that you can choose to be happy, but it almost never does. <br /> <br /> To see this movie and learn something very important about life, you need to keep it open and listen to all the "hidden messages" (or guidelines to come through life) that are the most contains some parts in this movie when you listen and watch. Look at your ears. <br /> <br /> You won't learn the meaning of life, but you'll learn how to live and get the most out of it. <br /> <br /> So, if you look, remember: <br /> <br /> "The idea is like a parachute, it doesn't work unless it's open!"
