I loved watching '' Sea Hunt '' back in the day, I was in primary school and would go home doing homework and by 4:30 am ready to go 'Sea Hunt' and Mike Nelson in his underwater adventures. look. I love it! He took a place that wasn't very accessible, under the big blue sea. Pre 'Thunderball' or even before Cousteau became commonplace, Mike Nelson created the imagination of children. I will be willing to bet that more than a few children have developed their passion for oceanography or biology or one of the sciences to watch this show. Underwater photography has also progressed, the fascination for exploration is easily stimulated by watching this show. Watch and enjoy!
