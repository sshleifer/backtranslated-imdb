I know you've already introduced it to film festivals (or at least I think you have, I can only fix it), but I think it should get the best animated short film in each one. Bravo. I can't wait for the full movie. I realize you can't hear it often enough because of the bizarre nature of your animations, but hear it now and accept it as the truth. Kudos, my friend. Well, now I'm just trying to get ten lines of text ... Even though I still mean it. And here comes another one - HOW! - and I can't stop here yet. It is extremely annoying and yet I have nothing better to do. In fact, I'll probably watch all your movies in another spasmodic "Jason Steele Marathon". I have a lot of them. <br /> <br /> -R
