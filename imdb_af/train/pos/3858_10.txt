Director Paul Verhoeven's American vehicles are of different quality, but most films he made in his native country are indisputable masterpieces. This is the story of an alcoholic (and bi-sexual) writer who enters into a beautiful and very foreign woman. But the woman doesn't know he's just interested in meeting the woman's attractive male lover. Meanwhile, the writer is being harassed with strange visions. At first, they look like hallucinations caused by alcohol abuse, but he soon realizes that he is experiencing some sort of pre-ability. Fascinating Hitchcockian thriller, very original and challenging. I love movies that make you think they're about something, but then you realize they're about something completely different. This is one of those movies; a thriller in the first half and a quasi-religious surrealist saga in the second half. Very erotic, original and blasphemous, not for children or people who go to church every Sunday. Great cinematography by future director Jan de Bont. Highly recommend!
