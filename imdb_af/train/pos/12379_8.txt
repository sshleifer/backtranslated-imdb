I was in an old theater in Northern California when this movie came out. As good as it is on DVD, it's even more frightening and scary on the big screen. Although it's been about 9 years since I saw it, it's still one of my all-time favorites. With the danger of sounding, "They just don't make it any more!" If Sixth Sense doesn't freak you out, this movie is definitely for you! Great story, incredible role players, ominous environment; even the soundtrack has a ghostly quality to it. I recommend you not to look alone. What a brownstone apartment rented alone in 1977 will leave you (it will be at least 10 times the price today).
