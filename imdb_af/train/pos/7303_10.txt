I first saw this a few times a few weeks ago. To be made about 30 years ago, I thought the scary moments would rather be tame. Boy, I was wrong. There are some wonderful moments that turn my spine off. Even the scene was wonderful, Jamie Lee Curtis was fantastic and Donald Pleasance was excellent. <br /> <br /> The downside can be quite slow to start, but once it's gone, there's no end to it. It makes all the copycats, e.g. Nightmare on Elmstraat, screaming looks very soft. I can't really say it's Carpenter's best because I didn't see much of her, the only one I can remember from her is Starman (I think he made it). Halloween is the coronation of the horror genre.
