Keep in mind, any film (let alone documentary) that claims any kind of truth will generate an unfavorable and proportionate amount of cynicism, from those to whom any suggestion and search for truth is already meaningless, those of you who are already Masters of psychology, film and chiefs of the soul will undoubtedly find this film redundant. You know everything there is to know. Congratulations. <br /> <br /> For those of us in the minority like me, I found "The Perverts Guide To Cinmea" .... mostly brilliant, and worth watching for those interested in movies, psychology and modern philosophy. . <br /> <br /> Slightly like Scott Mcloud's "Understanding Comics", director Sophie Fiennes, Slovenian philosopher, psychologist and social critic Slavoj Zizek interprets right into many of the films and specific scenes he discusses. The cover is a picture of "The Birds" (Zizek takes a boat to recover the shot). <br /> <br /> Lacanian Psycho Analysis, not necessarily screaming, an evening of fun ... but it is! If you like movies that are ... If you are a little knowledgeable about Lacanic psycho-analysis (Symbolic, Real and Imaginary), it is only beginning to throw away a little, but the scenes that Zizek selects and analyzes make remarkably clear What was always for me , a very abstract subject. In fact, it is probably better to be familiar with the films he discusses than with the terminology he uses. It gets clearer when the movie is running. <br /> <br /> Why I love this movie is not because it picks up big movies to analyze or reveal great truths about Lacan, but shows in a very practical and clever way where film and psychology (and by default philosophy). <br /> <br /> Why is "The Sound of Music" so fascinating, why are the "short cuts" about more than just class and alienation, why do birds fall in "The Birds", what is there to learn about the mind of "Alien Resurrection", which means the planet of "Solaris" wants to do, which means "Psycho" and "The Marx Brothers" to do with each other, and what the hell is David Lynch in movie to movie about. Well, Zizek has some ideas. <br /> <br /> The role of the voice in both the "Excorcist" and "Star Wars: Revenge Of The Sith" is perhaps the movie's strongest and most obvious moment when I start wondering in female sexual subjectivity. .. at one point Zizek recognizes that flowers are a kind of decorative dentata, that they are disgusting and hide from children (funny, it looks ...). <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's a fascinating documentary, which someone who has ever seen a movie, and thought it means something more than literally, should make an effort to see . <br /> <br /> And anyone interested in Slavoj Zizek, it's also a must, much less dry than "Reality of the virtual", and more directly than "Zizek!", Two other pseudo-docs, about the Elvis of contemporary cultural criticism, as he is baptized in the English-speaking world. <br /> <br /> "The Perverts Guide To Cinema" is not about the role of sex in the film. Zizek claims film is the ultimate perverting art because it teaches "how to desire and not what to desire" and that it is the only contemporary art form that can allow these desires to be articulated. It's not a movie about finding reality in theater, it's about finding the cinema in reality, and how important and exciting it can be. Hard to find, and a bit long, but worth it, one of the most "stimulating" movies I've ever experienced.
