I have to admit that from the EROS MOVIE COLLECTION this one must be the one I like most and also what I have reviewed. The story is something you really look at. Many of the EROS movies have a plot that looks like a hammer broke it before production before it was watched. Everything around sex, and who can get with how many different people come to the end of the movie. And oh dear God, never look at any of these movies when someone has pulled out a gun. It doesn't work out that it's almost laughing, but you don't want to waste the energy to do it. <br /> <br /> "Losing Control" is exactly as its name comes. The main character, the main character (the wonderfully talented and beautiful Kira Reed). Control is the control one has over their senses, their bodies and feelings. And one man changes everything for her, almost makes her another woman. But the mirror was broken at the same time. It makes for a good movie I wish I had first appeared! <br /> <br /> 10/10
