A comedy that worked surprisingly well was the small British attempt "The Divorce Of Lady X (1938)". It indicates the first pair of Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon, ahead of that little movie about uncontrollable passion on the English murders of the 19th century. And while Olivier and Oberon are not particularly well-suited for screw ball comedy, they all flow together nicely. Oberon is Leslie, a young woman who ends up in the fancy divorce lawyer Logan's (Olivier) hotel suite through a boring English obstructive journey. She does everything to irritate him - but in the crazy way movies, he falls to her. And she fell for him. But a serious case of erroneous identity occurs when Oberon's "Lady X" (which is all she leaves Oliver in a letter) is thought of by Olivier as a married woman. To make matters worse, and more amusing, Lord Mere (Ralph Richardson) goes to Olivier, who wants a wife's divorce, which dear Larry thinks Oberon should be! There are some nice conversations between the sexes, and exploring sexual politics. You can see that Olivier is not too confident about the comedy, but in real Olivier he is a perfect professional and deliverer. And he handles the screw-turn and turns, maybe not with ease, but with gusto. Oberon was not a big shock as an actress, but she was usually competent enough, and despite her alleged screen, she didn't like her, Olivier worked well. It's filmed in the early Technicolor which looks very primitive today (everyone even looks whiter than Michael Jackson), but maybe the pressure has to be cleared.
