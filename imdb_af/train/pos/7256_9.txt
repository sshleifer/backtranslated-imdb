I saw the long day's death when it first came to the theater. I thought the film gave a good soldier's point of view, and it gave a realistic version of men in the war. The storyline moves with a good fit and shows a group of men behind enemy lines and tries to return to their own lines with an enemy prisoner. The characters are well developed and credible. <br /> <br /> David Hemmings is a good actor and plays the leading role in conviction. Alan Dobie (as German Helmut) was surprised that I couldn't find this movie on VHS or DVD, and I feel it has become the forgotten movie, which is sad, as it is better than many other war movies I have seen.
