One is requested to define the genre of Gert de Graaff's movie as "Thought Event" according to the example of Merab Mamardashvili. The nominal storyline is a certain Bart Klever's tortureous quest for the ephemeral substance that constitutes the essence of personality. The screenplay for his new movie takes place simultaneously on his computer and in his own imagination. This film monologue originated as a response to Fellini's "8Â½" and cost Gert de Graaff 13 years of work. Excited to play with both real and fictional characters as well as with the audience, it shows the whimsical interconnection of true and imaginary, paradoxical coexistence in two different galaxies: those of Guttenberg and those of MacLhuen. For some time we tend to be on the side of the writer, who believes the cause of all the accident is the condemned stereotypes of mass mentality ("man", "catholic", "window cleaner"). And with him we fall into a trap when the author-creator is eventually confronted with the insoluble dilemma: how to eliminate the future film. Bart Klever? Just five minutes before the final, thanks to the general small reproach of the creator's wife, who is deeply immersed in the work, we realize that we are "captured" again with the main character. Really, what is the price of the art for whom it is acceptable to renounce your own name and daily care for the young daughter? <br /> <br /> So who is he, this Bart Klever? Is he a brilliant prophet or someone like Frenhoffer of Balzac's masterpiece (just like the latter who eventually writes the writer out of the computer memory, wrote everything)? Gert de Graaff suggests that we answer this question ourselves. <br /> <br />
