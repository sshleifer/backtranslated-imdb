I want to know why John Amos left the show and how did he go out of the show again? I couldn't relate to everything, but sometimes they hit home with the problems they were confronted with. By the way, have they ever made it out of the ghetto? I think the episode with the black Jesus was my favorite. We had to see that they experienced some good times. something they didn't have much to do. I wish they would bring the show back. During the day, people can actually stop watching. I don't think a movie or a new show will work. Especially without the original cast. They are really what Good Times Good Times made. These are my questions and comments. Thank you!!
