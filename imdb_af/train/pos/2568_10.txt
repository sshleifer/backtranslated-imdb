In this sequel to the 1989 action-comedy classic K-9, detective Dooley [James Belushi] and his dog, Jerry Lee, are investigating crime, but this time with another detective [Christine Tucci] and her partner, an average Doberman called Zues not very good at Jerry Lee. Dooley also doesn't come with his new partner. All this changes when the movie goes together. The film is intense because they are a man who really wants to kill Dooley for the way he treated him in the past. There are some dramatic scenes dealing with the death of Dooley's wife, which does not really occur to the scene of the movie, because the rest of the movie is action series, dog stick jokes, jokes and jokes about dogs that are bad guys bite. in a certain area. I know it seems to be very low in humor, but some of them are really funny. I didn't see this movie for the jokes, I saw it for two reasons. The first reason is because I'm a big James Belushi fan and second for the action sequences. James Belushi is louder than he was in K-9 and the action series are also better. It would have been nice to see more characters from K-9 to return, but it's still a fun movie. If you are a James Belushi fan, you will love this movie.
