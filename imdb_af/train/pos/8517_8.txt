Russ and Valerie have talks about starting a family. The couple live in a solid apartment and run an auction business that deals with valuable collectibles. At the same time, a dedicated adoption agency owner takes a mini-vacation and leaves the orphanage in charge of his father (Leslie Nielsen). Father Harry is in the rental business and he gets the brilliant idea of ​​"renting" some of the children from the orphanage to couples like Russ and Valerie. Being aware of the couple's dilemma, Harry offers a family of brothers and sisters for a 10-day rental period! Brandon, Kyle and Molly move with their temporary parents in the apartment with amusing effects, as the new caregivers are inexperienced with children. But where is the possibility of a happy ending? This is a lovely family movie. The actors, including Nielsen as the wheel dealer and Christopher Lloyd as the friendly home door, are all wonderful. The writing is funny and fun and the overall production values ​​are quite high. Yes, if life could be just like that! Former children everywhere deserve a chance to prove that they love and can give so much joy to parents considering adoption. If you want to see a movie for your family based on good values, but also very entertaining, find this movie. It is guaranteed that everyone laughs, even if their hearts are melting.
