There are at least two big movies with characters with a drinking problem: "The Lost Weekend" (1945) with a beautiful show by Ray Milland and "Days of Wine and Roses" (1962) with a fantastic show by Jack Lemmon. Robert Stack has a reasonable performance and his character's motifs for drinking are level and clich√©s. In the end, the forgotten "Written on the Wind" is just entertaining and never a feature nominated for the Oscar. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Palavras ao Vento" ("Words in the Wind")
