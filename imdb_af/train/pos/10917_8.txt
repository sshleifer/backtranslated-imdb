I just managed to get the Heavenly Region 3 DVDs from The Five Venoms and what a great job they made for it. A fantastic digital remastered transmission and a must for any Kung Fu fan. <br /> <br /> The story is straight ahead and has already been mentioned so I won't go back to it. Needless to say it's the scenes that many people buy the movie, and they don't disappoint. Only problem is that they are a little and far between and seem to be rehearsed. Bruce Lee can take up this lot and at the same time drink a cup of tea! All the kicks and bumps come with the important "type of writer" click and air "whooshes", which is a cool effect but rather amusing! <br /> <br /> I give this movie a B +. Good, but not good. In a way I feel, it could have been better. Golden Swallow, by the same director a decade earlier, had such a story and better action.
