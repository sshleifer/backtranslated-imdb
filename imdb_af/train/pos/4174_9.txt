... when this movie proves so good that they are indeed unnecessary. <br /> <br /> Although there were few lines, it was strange to see this movie, no subs, in a language unknown. A friend of mine sent a VHS, a few pieces of paper, with all lines translated into English. With her translation next to me, I started to look at this story (it is indeed a story), and I was stuck with the very first songs of the whistling melody during the opening of credits. the colors, minimal acting (good in most cases), absurd comedy, slapstick, considerate, beautiful ... along with some other movies (Paris, Texas and Nenette et Boni), this one can talk to someone's heart - without words. When you get the chance, see it. Whatever you do - don't miss it. It's a lifetime experience. Oh, acting is wonderful, the soundtrack is brilliant, the story is simple and has said a thousand times before - but rarely (never?) Like this.
