Simple, meaningful and delivers an emotional punch. I often go through dull short films and it's always nice to spot something that has a simple and enlightened message, without pretensions or self-directed directing. <br /> <br /> A boy at school should attend a lesson when his friend plays jersey and is the most important lesson of his life, just to find that when there are not enough copies to go around , he must share with the school bully. <br /> <br /> Unlike most short films with children or actors these kids keep their own and this is credible. The soundtrack complements the emotion of the piece beautifully and the punchline of the film works well.
