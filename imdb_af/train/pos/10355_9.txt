Fascinating film, based on a true story, about an Australian woman, Lindy Chamberlain (Meryl Streep), has accused her of killing her daughter. She insists that a dingo took her baby, but the story is very suspicious. The film is actually about the media circus that occurred around the case, as the Australians interpreted in the media, and the lynch mob mentality that ultimately led to the woman's belief, based on hardly any hard evidence. I love movies that question the media, and also movies that look hard at how people are drawn through the justice system. I have always thought that jury races 12 Angry Men had to be before going through their duties. It is not, as regularly said, a liberal movie, but a clinical look at how we as humans interpret events that are so much based on our prejudices and a desire for revenge. A cry in the dark is also clinical. Schepisi is careful not to make the movie at all. Some may find the movie boring or dry, but I found it.
