At Eddie Murphy's rise, a woman's audience screams at Eddie and a man from the audience responds. What is said is "women - DO MR ROB (that is a character of Saturday night living), the man responds with SHUT UP BITCH. Unlike the previous post that said the women were screaming, it was wrong, although the posts said he was there, they had a hearing problem! in spite of what the post-says say he can't come to DVD here, a close listen as you can actually hear it on the DVD - DO MR ROB !!!! I hope this helps someone who is delighted with the eruption, cute !!!! !!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!! !!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!! !!!!!!!
