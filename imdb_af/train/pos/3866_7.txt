But the studio of the studio as a producer of TV pulp fiction will be short. After this show, they would later immerse themselves in the other format of which they were known, the adventure series, with "Commando Cody", as well as other series, but like this they didn't last longer than 39 episodes. Also, the Republic was in its last stages as a studio; It will complete its termination in Hollywood as a rental stage for several Revue Studio series such as "Soldiers of Fortune", the original "Dragnet" and "Kit Carson" before finally closing its doors in 1959. <br /> <br /> Anyway, "stories of the century" wasn't that bad of an otter.

The late Jim Davis, best known for his role as the Ewing Patriarch in Dallas, has played a pleasing role as veteran Matt Clark, a fiction railroad thief who has to fight the outlaws. two veteran characters. <br /> <br /> Two wonderful facts here: The incidents will take place in different timelines, some in the 1880s, some at the beginning of the century, but Clark is never older. And also, Matt has the good fortune to seed himself with two beautiful female detectives as sidekicks, Frankie Adams, played by Mary Castle, and her replacement, Margaret Jonesy Jones, by Kristine Miller. The Lone Ranger can only wish for ladies. You can spend so long with Tonto. <br /> <br /> "Stories Of The Century" is a Studio City TV production by Republic Pictures Corp. 39 episodes were made during 1954, of which 39 are in public domain and on DVD.
