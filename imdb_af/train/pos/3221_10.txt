In the movie several references are subtly made to Blade runner, but one of the most obvious is the fact that the Cain 607 and its unit are all genetic constructs, used as warriors. But if my favorite quote is from the movie, you should make them both clever and quick. Kurt Russell did an incredible job, his facial expressions or lack of movies more likely to articulate the story, and the rest of the cast combined. Even when he falls in love with Sandra, but does not know how to handle these emotions, and his tears after being expelled from the group, or his crook when he gets a hug and his attachment to the dumb young boy in many Ways remind Todd of himself and what he could have been if he were not to be a soldier of his choice.
