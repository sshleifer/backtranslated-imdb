<br /> <br /> If you are interested in pirates, pirate movies, New Orleans / early 19th century American history, or Yul Brynner, see this movie for yourself and make your own thoughts about it. Don't be discouraged by various ill-considered reviews. My response to this was that it was entertaining, well behaved, has a very witty dialogue, and it is an excellent work to portray the charm, appeal and legendary fascination of Jean Lafitte's priest. Although not all the events in the movie are historically accurate (can you make me a historical movie that succeeds)? I feel the film is accurate in dealing with the role Lafitte played in the history of New Orleans and the love-hate relationship between the "respected" New Orleans citizens and banning who was one of the city's favorite boys. Don't worry about what the movie does, but watch it for what it does, ie studying one of New Orleans's and most intriguing historical figures.
