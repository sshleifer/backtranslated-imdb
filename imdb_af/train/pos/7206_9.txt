Excellent plot within a plot within a plot. Shame on two of my movie heroes who have a good snare. Must be my education :) <br /> <br /> Well done by everyone. You never really know who is not going to do who. The last small turn at the end makes it possible for everyone to get them straight deserts. <br /> <br /> Recommend to everyone. A harmless tongue in the cheek-thriller that is due to mistakes is probably Michael Caine's over-exploitation of the word "bloody", but that's his signature, isn't it. <br /> <br /> 9/10
