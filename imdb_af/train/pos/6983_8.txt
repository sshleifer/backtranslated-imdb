I loved it, I was a fan of the original series, I always wondered what the back story would be - it didn't please me. I also love the fact that, apart from Eric Stoltz, I didn't recognize one person - it's refreshing, much like BSG. This introduced me to a whole host of new talent - can't wait for the show to start airing. Well done to Ronald D. Moore and team - excellent work. The special effects, dialogue and acting were all about, and I was emotionally tied up in the storyline. I know there are purists out there who probably won't agree with my assessment, but I felt that Caprica was much better than most Sci-Fi goods produced over the past decade.
