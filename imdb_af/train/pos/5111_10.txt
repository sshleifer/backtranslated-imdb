Does anyone know what kind of bakkie John T drove? I look like a middle till late 70's. This movie is my favorite as well as my wife. It was the first memorable movie we saw as a couple. The pickup is important because it's similar to the first truck I drove and recently found another one. I'd like to recover the pickup. I must look like the movie. The music was fantastic too, and the acting was wonderful. Where and what is the lady who depicted John's aunt? Did John also have a stunt double for the scene on the tower when he almost fell? Also, what year of Mustang did Debra W manage in this show. It looks like a 60-year-old model. Thank you,
