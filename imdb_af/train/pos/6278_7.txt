I saw it on a flight to the US and was initially a bit skeptical because a few people said there were so many characters in that you didn't get any of them. But I didn't find it at all. The movie is fast, but it is because of the nature of the director and the star. The hunting is excellent and yes, it can be predictable, but it is not the truth of most movies. The main villain is a bit of a bit, Christopher Eccelston is not as convincing as he could have been, but it said it is still a good movie.
