I finally came around to see it after I heard good things. It actually exceeded my expectations. In view of the budget in question, it was a surprisingly competent and well-made film. The lack of finance actually helped this movie in a number of ways, especially considering the plot. Like The Blair Witch Project, this movie was both better to be shot on video rather than film. Another bonus: Although most low-budget horror movies (even the best of the best) suffer from mediocre to inadvertently hysterical, this movie actually has a talented role-player (except one or two characters), especially the two leaders. The only thing missing from the movie was an original story. It borrows heavily from better-known movies such as "Deliverance" and "Wrong Turn", but if you are like me, movies of this nature never stop fearsome. In addition, the director keeps interesting all the time. I would be very interested to see what the director would do with a bigger budget and I have a feeling that it will only be a matter of time before we find out ...
