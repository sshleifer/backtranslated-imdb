It is the second Baby Burlesk short to be released, and probably the most popular one, a spoof of the 1926 silent movie What Price Glory. <br /> <br /> I watched it and I don't understand the kiddie porn. This is claimed. It's just a cute movie. I saw family shows that I grew up in the 80's and 90's who dressed up little girls who were more challenging in an 'adult' way. It was more challenging because they were NOT clothed in diapers. There is nothing appealing about a diaper unless you have one of those fetuses. (just a joke) I read the description of the movie and where it seems that only a pedophile would love it. It's sick. For me, if you see it and be affected by it, you might have to examine your own psyche and try to find out why it bother you. This is an innocent movie made as a parody of another movie. All the B.B. movies were parodies, nothing more. The parodies / spoofs of today are graphic in nature and have almost almost pornographic scenes and rather dirty language. Shouldn't it be terrible anymore? I can see those without problems, but sometimes they take children's stories and turn them into dirt on those parodies. That's what should get under your skin. Not that they were an adult movie of 1926 (not a word, I don't know), because we know how PORNOGRAPHICS were the silent movies, huh? Not to mention these 'Forbidden Hollywood Pre-Code era movies' so dirty and dirty. They will never be so dirty today? (note the sarcasm)
