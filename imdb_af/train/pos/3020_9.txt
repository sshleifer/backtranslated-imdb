I feel a little protective of this movie because it was my introduction to the U.N. That year was 1972, and I.T.V. ran all eight features in a buffer wave (followed by the repetition of 'The Persuaders' with Tony Curtis and Roger Moore) on Saturday nights. "The Karate Killers" was chosen to open the season. It started with a cool action series as Solo and Kuryakin's sports car were attacked by a squadron of THRUSH mini-copters. I was a fan of life from now on. <br /> <br /> After the main credits (nice to see a special title series here instead of the usual exercise to delay action recordings) we go to Dr. Simone True's lab (Jim Boles), inventor of a new formula to extract gold from seawater. True's wife Amanda (Joan Crawford) had a relationship with THRUSH agent Randolph (Herbert Lom). Indeed, a ruthless man, he kills both the doctor and his wife before trying to find the formula. True prepared him for the event. He divided it into five segments, each written on a photo of himself and sent to his five daughters. Everybody is scattered all over the world. <br /> <br /> Solo and Kuryakin started to get the formula first, leading to a series of episodes in different places, and came from the kind of Telly Savalas (Terry-Thomas and Curt Jurgens). One of Dr.True's daughters - Sandy (Kim Darby) - accompanies the U.N.C.L.E. boys on their worldwide quest. <br /> <br /> After combining the formula, THRUSH appears and lets them hand it over before turning them off to their secret base in the North Pole ... <br /> <br /> Of all the UNCLE feature films , this is the one I felt specially made for the theater. It hurts by being a television product, although it is even slightly expensive than usual. No location filming has been done, and the different segments come across as repetitive, which usually results in a scrap between U.N.C.L.E. and DRUSH. From the cast, Joan Crawford is memorably hammy in her little role, and Curt Jurgens is bad as a sugar daddy. Terry-Thomas is as good as a London bobby as good as ever, and Herbert Lom is good as the main band. However, Kim Darby stirs up as 'Sandy'. She had to stay at home. <br /> <br /> What is surprising about this is that it is more amusing and entertaining than driving over many official theater releases of the time, including In Like Flint, Casino Royale and The Ambushers. I would like to know how Solo and the company escaped from THRUSH H.Q. after Randolph's death.
