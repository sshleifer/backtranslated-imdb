Although Cinderella is not the obvious choice for a successor, I like Jaq and Gus, so I didn't hesitate. The format of the mice writing a book for Cinderella was an inspired one. I enjoy writing myself stories and hope that children will be encouraged by this. The three stories are cute and amusing, though the songs were forgotten. Jaq and Gus were my favorite characters, but I also enjoyed enjoying Lucifer, Bruno, the Mouse Choir and all the others. Pom Pom was the perfect companion for Lucifer and I looked the government. A successor who's done right for a change. My rating 8/10.
