There is not much in this story - just two men who use many different ways to handle memories of Vietnam. But what it lacks in the prospect makes it more than acting and realism. It's a silent movie about the links of friendship and shared experience. We even get romance (not free - just another very real piece of this story). It is worth seeing.
