It will have to be one of the funniest TV sitcoms to come out of the states since the death of 'All Love Raymond'. Warburton is always hilarious, complementing the rest of the ensemble cast to perfection. David Spade continues to tickle my funny leg enormously with its very unique delivery of its lines. After watching the British series Coupling, I can only see where the creators of "Rules of Engagement" got their original idea, but it is not meant as a "brickbat" - the absolutely brilliant dialogue and the way on which it is conveyed, sets this particular range apart. But it takes more than a capable role to succeed in a new series, especially in the very difficult comedy. As part of a professional TV comedy writing team for the best of 7 years in Australia, I particularly appreciate the role of director and the perceptual and creative talent of the camera crew. One of the few grievances I have with the series is the naturally "canned" laugh. Surely a live audience can be used in shooting the series.
