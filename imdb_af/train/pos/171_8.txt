I totally disagree with anyone who may dismiss this film as "just" entertainment. In the early days of the Great Depression, Dance, Fool, Dance, the sadness is a serious warning story, with a clear message on how to endure these difficult times. Yet this fast and stiff film is far from a thirsty morality. <br /> <br /> In the 30's, Hollywood had a talent to take one entertaining and enlightening audience pleaser to another, all without wasting a frame of film. Dance, Fools, Dance - one of the * four * movies directed by Harry Beaumont in 1931 - is barely 80 minutes long, but his characters are well-developed, his story never hurts and despite his many twists in the plot, never left behind. <br /> <br /> With the only exception to Lester Vail as blind love interest Bob Townsend, the supporting cast is uniformly strong. Warning is William Bakewell as Crawford's brother, Cliff Edwards (known as the voice of Jiminy Cricket) as reporter Bert Scranton, and Clark Gable in an early supporting role as gangster Jake Luva. <br /> <br /> But this is Joan Crawford's movie, and she shines completely in it. Made when she was just 27, this lesser-known version of Crawford would probably be unrecognizable to those who are more familiar with her later work. But here's proof that Crawford long before she took an Oscar for Mildred Pierce was a star in the true sense of the word, a tremendous actress with the charisma to carry a photo herself. <br /> <br /> Count: EIGHT from TEN
