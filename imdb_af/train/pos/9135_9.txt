I don't care how much bad reviews are getting purple rain, these movie rocks! Excellent movie, it has everything, good music (prince of coarse!), Romance and drama. <br /> <br /> It's really a very sad movie, very moving. I don't want to say much more; I don't have to give the plot, but I'll say it. The movie is VERY realistic. There are so many romantic relationships going through these problems, as many families are similar to the one depicted in the movie. I see it as very realistic and so real, making the movie so much more moving. My generation loved this movie, so many of us loved Prince and there is a lot to do with any teenager who has similar problems. <br /> <br /> It's definitely not just a teen movie. , Id recommend it to all age groups. And it's not that dark, the movie has some great music, band performance screens and sexy fun screens between Prince and Appelonia.
