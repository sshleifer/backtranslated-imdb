I'm too old to know exactly what the difference between rap and hip-hop is. And if I'm Canadian, it's likely that I've never seen MTV, but I'm not sure. <br /> <br /> But I thought this movie was very funny when I saw it, a bright satire. Hip-hop culture is so pervasive nowadays that it's hard to hear over and over again. (If we could just say the same about the bag of music.) I have most of the jokes (I think I've done it already). Sure, it is derived from spinal tap, but there are many targets that can be a tap treatment. Not just the carpenters, they are holy.
