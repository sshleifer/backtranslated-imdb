At first sight, Who sings there is just an absurd and excellent comedy? with just some kind of unusual, quiet and slow movement: what a mistake! <br /> <br /> Start with two singers in a desert landscape, then a bus and a great bunch of actors. It hides a gem! <br /> <br /> The folded story and a fake rhythm cause you to think, yes it's a cartoon, but you can only think it would be a soft kind of movie. <br /> <br /> Not at all: very funny with immediate, dark subtle cynics over others, the development has surprised you all the time? Very ingeniously and cleverly presented, all the characters are important, and the actors give them full life. <br /> <br /> And what is amazing, it is based on deep observation, good mastery of the camera work and has great significance, and really everything, the general direction and also the details are offered that it just let it go it's a movie: it looks like a kind of human society you don't know yet, shot by a friend behind a camera. <br /> <br /> And you're the one behind him. It's simple, and just exceptional! <br /> <br /> Don't misunderstand me; In no way does it mean the script, the quality of the picture, the music party has a kind of amateurish way, no no! It's great art! <br /> <br /> Because it flows like a river? From high to mountain, to the sea, with all sorts of soils and perches that will see a true river on its journey to the sea? from a small thing to a mainstream. <br /> <br /> This metaphorical image I used to explain is the best way I can find out to explain all the charms that singing there. For me, again, I take the hammer: just exceptional ... <br /> <br /> I saw that the Director is the one who made Chat Blanc / Chat Noir, what I know is quietly known? But as I haven't seen it yet, I had no idea of ​​this gentleman. <br /> <br /> Other reviewers wrote dithyrambic comments on the movie. I totally agree! <br /> <br /> European Eastern Cinema This is not good because it is rarely translated, but I'm fortunate to have this example one in original language, with good English subtitles. All in all: deep, nice and exceptional ... For fast and empty explosive types and special effect buffs, avoid it at all costs, it can be too subtle and good for you! <Br /> <br /> But if you're interested in different genres and / or classics, you won't regret this one, and if you buy it, it will have good companionship in your personal DVD library. as earnings big names like Billy Wilder, Lubitsch, or Sacha Guitry among some of my favorite directors. At least for this movie! <br /> <br /> *** A movie is never really good unless the camera is in the head of a poet Orson Welles ***
