It's not the most hilarious movie I've ever seen. At the end of the four criminals sent by their fathers to the Wienberg Military Academy, there is a play that continues throughout this goofball movie. It's not hard to try for a moment. <br /> <br /> It's hard to try to describe this movie; The humor elements are so spotless and brilliantly assigned that it looks like nothing more than a stupid 80's teen lust comedy. But that's o much more than that! Fresh from the minds of those people at MAD Magazine, the Academy offers a formula and style I've never seen, duplicated by ANY of the "funniest" offers to come out of Hollywood from Hollywood. Basically, the film is so full of childless dots that you can guess the authors were a few 14-year-olds themselves. See this movie if you like being immature. A classic. *****
