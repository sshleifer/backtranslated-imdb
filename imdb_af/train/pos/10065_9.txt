This is an excellent movie suitable for all but the very latest, though accessibility for younger people (at least in the print I saw) hit by using some unlucky choice of English subtitles! For many of the movie it is almost impossible to guess in what period it is set. No modern technology has been shown, not even the ubiquitous Chinese bike, just a murdered, almost black-and-white, everyday life. display of the Sezuan Opera and festive fireworks. Even when a group of soldiers refer to their approaching departure to a war theater, it has always been over the last 150 years. <br /> <br /> But then we briefly see a car - late 30s, early 40s style - and we realize that we are about to become a china of great revolutions, and that much of the world is what we see, taken in the disaster of World War II and the Communist Revolution. <br /> <br /> What makes the central character's desire to keep old traditions and traditions more gripping. <br /> <br /> But the film also raises issues that are vital even today, both in China and in other parts of the world: the inequality between boys and girls, men and women; The trade, for various purposes, with young children; corruption in society; unjust; the importance of friendship. <br /> <br /> Maybe I read too much in this movie; but I don't think so! I also think it's a scandal that movies of this caliber are often not shown in the UK, while foam is passed on as quality material. <br /> <br /> But don't start me there. .
