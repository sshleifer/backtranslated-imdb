I don't think most of us will tend to apply the term "must-see" to action movies, but I was very impressed with how good this movie was and it deserves the "must-see" seal from me. /> <br /> Mandy played by Shannon Lee (daughter of late and great Bruce Lee and sister of late Brandon Lee) is recruited by Martin, a professional thief who helps to pull off a diamond hook at a museum for a criminal syndicate. , and is well rewarded for it. Little do they know that another pair of thieves (Lucy and Tommy, some love birds), who had previously been asked by Mandy and Martin to enter the deal, are planning to steal the diamond. <br /> <br /> How every pair of thieves work out the stickers is a thrill to watch. Things are disgusting, because Martin and Mandy unknowingly find a step behind Lucy and Tommy. <br /> <br /> You will find yourself rooting for these thieves because they find they need each other to stay alive from the crime syndicate, which is not at all happy that the diamond is not in his hands. <br /> <br /> Action fans will not be disappointed as there is a healthy dose of gunfighting, martial arts and hand-to-hand fighting. <br /> <br /> What's surprising, it's not just the action that this movie carries, but the romance and laughter (and I don't mean your typical one-liners in action movies). <br /> <br /> It is not easy to root for bad guys, but we see man's side of these thieves and the chemistry they develop. <br /> <br /> A great movie and one NOT to miss! <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10
