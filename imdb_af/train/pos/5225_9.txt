I think this movie is a very funny movie and one of the best 'National Lampoon's' movies, it also has a very catchy show title, which basically goes over the whole movie. .... But In White !!!! The story is a spoof of many movies, including a Will Smith movie, as you might guess, "Men In Black". I will not get the end, but it has a very good end. It's very funny (Leslie Nielsen style humor) from start to finish, especially the little bit near the start when you're in the street collecting the rubbish bins. Also, they have a nice cool trash truck (garbage truck) in that scene. The acting is not great, in fact it is not very good, but it makes the movie funny, it's a comedy, unleash! I love the story line, partly because it's so far acquired and partly because it's interesting to see how subtle (or should it be non-subtle) they rip all the other movies. I am a huge fan of amazing show movies, but I'm also a fan of the right thing, and with these movies it's hard to decide what is better, the movie that turns it down (rather mentioned in this review) or The real movie is that, but also when you actually make a ghost of comedy movies, it makes it even harder, but this movie successfully delivers it. The two garbage cans are so funny, it reminds me of a TV sketch show in the UK called 'Little Britain'. This movie is a must have for your collection and is one of the best, most entertaining, funniest, best storyline, National Lampoon's movie to date!
