The Lion King 1 1/2 is a very cute story to go with The Lion King. It basically follows the original story of The Lion King, but with a few turns. In the movie, e vents are explained by another character's point of view. This story is still an original plot. <br /> <br /> As far as the successors are concerned, Disney is not that good at making it worthwhile. This one, which is the third part of The Lion King (Simba's Pride is the second.) Actually has an original idea, while still being the fun of the first. Timon and Pumbaa travel to the ideal place to stay. After searching wide and wide, they find the place of "Hakuna Matata". They then meet a small lion named Simba, and go through many things that parents go through today. <br /> <br /> I think it's a very good movie, and I like to add it to my collection.
