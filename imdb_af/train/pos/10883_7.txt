It is surprisingly above average, it's nice and well made, with decent gore! All the characters are decent, and the story is very nice, plus Molly Ringwald played the annoying bitch very well. I bought it at a pawnshop for a $ 1 and it was surprisingly worth it, and the special effects were pretty damn good for the budget, and I loved the mask. The killer was worn because it was actually slightly creepy. The final was really cool, because I loved how they beat the murderer, and the end while predictably very amusing, plus all the characters except Ringwald was surprisingly beautiful. It's made and written, and I thought it was sometimes creative and original, and some of the deaths are very impressive. This killer didn't mess, and I loved it, and Slasher fans (like me) really should enjoy this movie, plus the opening was also very angry with the movie of the movie! It's a surprisingly average estimate, it's nice and well made, with decent gore, and I say it's worth the watch. The direction is good. Kimble Rendall does good! working with solid camera work, use a creepy environment, good angles and keep the movie at a fast pace. The acting is solid! Molly Ringwald plays the bitch very well, and I had problems feeling sorry for her. She had to be the heroine. She got better at the end, but not much. I'm surprised she decided to do this movie. However, she did an excellent job! Frank Roberts is fantastic as the killer, he is threatening, creepy and has one hell of a mask, and this man did not rush around, he was fantastic! Kylie Minogue plays a bitch very well in her little role. Jessica Napier is cute and does well like the other heroine. The rest is good. Overall, the watch is worth it! *** out of 5
