Very Light Spoiler <br /> <br /> This movie (although only on TV) is absolutely excellent. I didn't really pay attention to the differences in appearance or accent, so I can't really comment on it. The acting in this was so good that I had to pinch myself and say, "Remember, it's just a movie, this DIDN` T REALLY HAPPEN". While sitting on Harris and Quinn, I knew it was exactly what John and Paul would talk about if they actually had this meeting. The sacrificial comments and burns of John were right with his character (especially in the restaurant!), Like his depression, while Paul was lying and lying down very easily. Both actors did excellent work and I was excited to see this movie. It's a bad experience for any Beatles fan. And prepare for a few surprises!
