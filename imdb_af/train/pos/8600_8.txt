There was some hesitation about what this movie had to offer. To start with, it doesn't seem right. Kiefer Sutherland has done very well in "24" and the preview did not suggest anything to him or the public. Eva Longoria appeared out of place and the rest didn't look very interesting. <br /> <br /> When the movie finally ended, I wasn't quite dissatisfied, seeing a decent thriller that could have been much better, taking the responsible parties a little more care to watch to the confidential gaps and give a little more attention to character development. We have seen such threats before, and this has made the main conflict much more challenging for the writers. As an audience we do not want to sit through the same old story again. We want to see something different, be excited and entertained. <br /> <br /> There's nothing wrong with the casting. From Kim Basinger's lovely first lady. She carries herself with enough grace and sexual appeal to make the part unforgettable. Michael Douglas has been done before. Unfortunately, the president is much of a non-entity to care for even his fate. Sutherland rehashes his "24" tough man with enough strength to make it big enough for the big screen, and Eva does a sensible job as the newcomer. Don't expect so many twists and fireworks. as some of the established classics ("North at Northwest" and "The Fugitive" come to mind). Leave your expectations outside and enjoy the ride for whatever it is. This is OK.
