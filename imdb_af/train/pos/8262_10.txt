Valliant attempted to use a mining catastrophe as a vehicle to pronounce this director's aversion to the war. The audience not only learns much about early mine rescue procedures, but we learn that the Europeans had on the interval between World War II and World War II, regarding pacifists (lack of better term). The speeches given by both representatives of each country at the end of the film are inspiring. Although the revised edition, through the transfer technology of early foreign films, is sometimes "cut-off characters heads", this film holds its own in many different aspects. Character analysis, lighting techniques, historical content, and a scenario that many tested and inspired a writer and filmmaker. <br /> <br /> Pabst went straight and Weil & Brecht's "Three Penny Opera" original star, Lotte Lenya.
