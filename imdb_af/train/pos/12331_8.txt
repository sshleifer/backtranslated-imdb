Being someone who calls Night of the Living Dead at number three in her top five favorite movies of all time, and at the same time loves this student episode, I feel I should defend this movie against the previously placed scathing reviews. This short, but lovely opus has always been a crowd at horror and science fiction movie marathons where those attending have a love for the genre, but don't know how to take zombie movies too seriously. This film is a tribute to the original, not an insult. It is meant to be funny, and many others I have heard and want to admit agree with me that it succeeds. Especially for those of us who have seen NOTLD 50+ times. Watch the director come as news reporter Jeff Drexel, and also if you have the opportunity to capture his Alien parody, Loaf.
