It was different, that's for sure. Just look at the cast! Talk about oddballs. <br /> <br /> William H. Macy and Ben Stiller were the stars, though a lot of actors almost shared the spotlight, in this farce about superhero-wannabees. The most outrageous thing is Paul Reubens of "Pee Wee Herman" celebrity. <br /> <br /> There is lots of humor, colored colors and no lulls. It's a fun, lightweight comedy with nothing but goofy characters, all of whom want to be heroes, a Laanman, Batman, Spiderman, your name. They have talents in foreign territories, but do the real heroes (and do not want to!). It's stupid, but you know it's going to happen. <br /> <br /> It's also a movie you can see in installments and don't really miss any continuity. It's a long movie for one so hectic, so here's a break and there's okay. The language was tame, so children can also enjoy it. In fact, I don't remember a curse here, except the man in the theater next to me who exhibited: "What a stupid, a movie." I thought it was two hours of fun, but I'd rather watch it on DVD and take a few breaks.
