Fritz Lang's German medieval saga continues in Die Nibelungen: Kriemhilds Rache (1924). Kriemhild (Margarete Schoen) wants to avenge her murdered husband, Siegfried. Her brother is too weak to bring the murdered Hagen. Kriemhild married Etzel, the King of the Huns (Rudolf Klein-Rogge). She gives a child, and invites her brothers for a feast. Donkey and the other Huns must be Kil Hagen, but he is protected by his brothers. We see a great battle of life. and death begins, and she sets the whole fire on fire. Actually Hagen is dead, and so is Kriemhild. These movies are about big themes like revenge and ominous love. Certainly we saw better movies of those topics later, but it was one of the early ones.
