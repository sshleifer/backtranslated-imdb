UC 0079, the one-year war is almost at the end. A Neutral Colony Side 6 is targeted by Cyclops, a Zeon task force. Their goal, a new Gundam building exclusively for Newtypes (presumably built for Amuro Ray of the original Gundam saga). When little boy Al Izuruha, a fan of Zeon MS, meets a Zaku after the fight in the colony, he has a friendship with new MS pilot Benard Bernie Wiseman. The two become good friends, Al is treated as an honorary member of the Cyclops team. Through the show, Bernie acts as a father figure to Al (whose real father always works) and resembles Federation pilot Christina McKenzie, but eventually they must meet .... in battle. Already soon know that war is not a children's game and Bernie must choose to make the ultimate sacrifice to complete his mission. <br /> <br /> For only 6 episodes, Gundam 0080 is a great show. The mobile packs are extremely well-designed, and the animation may look dated, but really show emotions in the characters. If you like 0083, look at this one, or if you're new to the Gundam world, it's a good show to start with. If you look at a show for drama and character development, this is the one for you, it focuses more on that then mobile packing. I'll review it more of a drama than action. <br /> <br /> Mobile suit Gundam 0080, War in the Bag. <br /> <br /> Sometimes you have to lose to win.
