The first installment of this infamous horror series is presented as if it were a snatch film discovered by the producers and set up like an amateur video cassette, completed with a digital timer at the bottom of the frame. It indicates that a woman is being kidnapped by a gang of black clothes torturing her for a few days before finally killing her. The victimless victim is brutally beaten and beaten with raw meat, before her fingernails are stretched with a pair of pliers, her hand is broken with a hammer, her eye is pierced with a needle, and so on. <br /> <br /> In the most nauseous scene, the woman's inmates burn her with hot water and let live maidens fall into the burns. The series received a lot of publicity when US actor Charlie Sheen, who apparently contains the series of true murder, is trying to ban his distribution in the United States. An FBI investigation revealed that the movies were just what it seemed to most viewers - sick reproductions using nasty but obvious special effects. Horrified by the well-known Japanese comic book artist Hideshi Hino, who also directed the third and fourth episodes, this film is a sure way to clean everything but the most tolerant of the rooms. However, ghore will probably not find anything special.
