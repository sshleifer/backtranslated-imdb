OK, first, ignore the last person's review. They admit that they fall asleep, so it's no wonder they didn't understand what's going on !!! Like scarecrows / horrors, this movie is not bad, it is certainly very viewable. From the opening styles you get a general idea exactly what will be the cause of all the folly that follows, and come to the end you have proven right with everything that is made clear. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed it. movie, it was sometimes villain and if old movies were going it was wise. Great to watch at night! I give it a generous 7 out of 10.
