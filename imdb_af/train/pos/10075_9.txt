"Masks" is a moving film that works on many levels. At its simplest, it is the haunting story of a street performer bound with a young child while trying to pass his creative art (masks) to the next generation. Although, sometimes the story makes the old man work, it is so well-crafted (written, acted, directed, wonderful production values), it's easy to move beyond his fate. And if you stick to it, the movie is finally very sweet and uplifting. Kudos everywhere. It's a great movie for kids as well as adults. The trick is how to get Americans who might not like foreign language films to see it!
