I saw this film as a fascinating study of a family in crisis. When Leo announces the eldest that he is HIV +, the responses of the family members are alone and with each other and yet strange. <br /> <br /> I've never seen a family so physically demonstrative as this one; No one tends to shout at each other. I didn't understand why the family felt that the youngest couldn't handle the news, but once that was hard, I found it a moving movie. <br /> <br />
