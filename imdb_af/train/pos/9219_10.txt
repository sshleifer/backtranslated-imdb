The movie itself let me go and call someone so they could enjoy it too. It was extremely funny. Angelena Jolie was wonderful like Juliet. The parents are hilarious. They are caterers as well as enemies. The children play the parts of Romeo and Juliet in the church play. They fall in love and their parents try to keep them apart. (Spoiler ahead. I think) They sneak down to a party and do it. Surprisingly, they still want to get married at the end of the movie. If you don't like stereotypes and don't look at the classic literature contamination. If you don't mind, you'll get an explosion.
