The perfect boy is a story about two 30-something brothers, one who is apparently "perfect" and the other who is actually a screwdriver, often landing itself in drug rehab centers. After the death of their father, the two were brought together after a long absence and the usual sister competition resumed. It is only when the "perfect" brother makes the exciting revelation that he has AIDS that the irresponsible younger brother eventually makes a move to get his life in order and takes some responsibility. <br /> <br /> The movie does a great job chronically chasing younger brother's "return", sometimes sometimes far off (drug addiction is never so easy). What makes the movie more angry is the treatment of AIDS, a topic that has been somewhat over the past five to 10 years in the film. And the development of an almost lovely relationship between the two former fathers' brothers is very credible and well done. The two main actors were both very competent, if not terribly charismatic. <br /> <br /> A solid first feature of director and writer Leonard Farlinger whose own brother died of Aids. The end was also well done. <br /> <br />
