I am a big fan of Simon Pegg and have so far watched many of his movies and nobody stopped laughing at me. Nor how to lose friends and alienate people. <br /> <br /> This movie is really about a man who is good at pissing off people. However, he has an innate set of ethics that prevents him from doing things that just make him famous. But in the end he ends up with them, the culture of life. <br /> <br /> The movie is well-toned with humor, romance, good acting and also some dancing. It's one of those movies where you can just be happy when it ends.
