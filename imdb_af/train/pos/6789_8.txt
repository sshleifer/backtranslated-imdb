Legend of Dragoon is one of those little games that people either love or hate. Some people claim it is too similar to other games, the Final Fantasy series, which is understandable as it was originally Sony's equivalent of Final Fantasy. Honestly I can't comment on the agreements, because I'm not very familiar with the FF games. <br /> <br /> I think my favorite aspect of the game is the combat system. Not only do you have the ability to change into a more powerful dragon shape, but every time you attack, you need to pay attention to complete the attack by pressing the buttons at the right time. Not only that, sometimes enemies will attack you right in the middle of a row, which means you have to press different buttons to avoid damage. Even the use of certain attacks requires some button mashing. If you don't want to attack, you can always watch, which not only reduces the damage in half, but increases your hits without the use of healing. <br /> <br /> The FMVs are reasonably good, about the same quality as Final Fantasy 8's. However, the graphics during the game are not quite as high. They are nice, but they could have been - and honestly - better. The translation also leaves something to be desired. This not only makes interesting character relationship questions, but there are also some grammatical errors that simply should not be allowed to succeed. <br /> <br /> Another thing I found interesting was that you lose main parties characters - one dies, and the other is basically useless for the party and leaves. While the death of one character is often said to have no point, it makes you realize early on that the characters, while heroes, are still as mortal as the next person. The people who are replacing the lost characters just get all their statistics, so the transition game is pretty smooth. Perhaps my one complaint about the characters is the main character of love, Shana. She is the symbol of the helpless woman who needs to save, pathetic to the point of managing a player to shout with frustration. While you can use her in your party, she is insanely weak - I don't even know what her strengths are, because I kept her so little that I never used her. The character Rose, on the other hand, is probably my favorite female character in any game ever. She's not wimp, and some of her dragon magic is extremely useful. Meru is also very strong, while sometimes it is a nasty talkative brat. <br /> <br /> The character designers were as inclined to make the female characters look beautiful or whatever, and did not think much about the real benefit of the outfits. Serious, no armor and most of your skin is not exposed when fighting monsters. But I will give them props because they have women serving as knights in different countries. <br /> <br /> I can't comment much on the plot because honestly I didn't pay much attention to it. where I had to go to the next. I don't know if it's something about the plot itself or my style of play. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a very enjoyable game. It has its faults, but for me it just had the right balance to think and just push buttons and kill monsters.
