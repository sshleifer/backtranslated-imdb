I just can't believe the comments on this show! The show is just genius! Certainly, it does not follow the tried and true, but as consumers, we always do the same things that we press over and over again. Don't have the opportunity to sit back and enjoy something new from time to time. The style isn't as realistic as the previous "Scooby Doo" show, but it's not supposed to be. The show titled "Shaggy and Scooby Doo Get An Idea" which part of that title claims the whole beloved role-playing of other versions will continually join the action. And nowhere does it say they would solve mysteriously, and they can't even stand monsters, so why should they? I'm actually glad they put some long plot points working in a Scooby-Doo show. They still have jokes, boisterous hi-jinks, fast-paced jack-up outfits, standard gaiters and even Scooby snacks. In fact, I'm glad this show is out there because I love it. I am even glad that they got rid of the rest of the team for a while and only concentrated on two main characters and a villain. It's ridiculous, it's supposed to be! Sure it's different, it's supposed to be. It is supposed to make you laugh at the villain, and courage to conquer the idiotic robot farmer over all invading vermin, no matter what size. You gotta get the run "Roobi-Roo" joke. The whole thing is just as well composed, there is not a single thing I can think is wrong. The writing, the play, the animation, everything else. The title music is wonderful (my computer plays "GET A CLUE!" When it uploads), and the background music is just tempting.
