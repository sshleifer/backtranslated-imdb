My dear. This movie really shows the talents of actors. Billy Connelly bends his stage muscles. Truly, a wonderful man, if you look at him in Absolution as a rebel, Boondock Saints as a male / killer, and then finally in Fido as a zombie! His character in Fido looks cute, scary, absolutely fantastic! Cariie Ann Moss is not a hack either! Jump into Matrix and Momento's career as a dark character, a heartwarming conservative 1950s housewife! Hardly these days to see that actors can't be so similar. <br /> <br /> Now on the storyline (No Spoilers, don't worry). This movie would make Max Brooks (Author of the Zombie Survival Guide & World War Z) happy with joy! Ultimately, a good form of zombies and comedy. <br /> <br /> If you like zombies, if you don't like zombies, if you're just bored, or if you're too busy, watch this movie!
