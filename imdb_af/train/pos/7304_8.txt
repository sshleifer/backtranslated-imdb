Occasionally advertise a movie as frightening or frightening, although it's usually not. Most modern horror movies fit this category. <br /> <br /> Then there are those movies that not only cause the veins and adrenaline to be pumped more difficult than usual. They really scare you to a level you've never experienced before. <br /> <br /> "Halloween" is such a movie. This requires so many risks that most film producers will cause. But almost everyone works. "Halloween" is awesome in its simplicity, and frightening as a whole. <br /> <br /> The story is simple. Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) babies a few kids on Halloween night, while a madman was released after being discharged from a spiritual institution after having abused his older sister 15 years ago. Of course, the madman, later known as Michael Myers, starts killing the local teenage population, and eventually comes after Laurie. <br /> <br /> Sound familiar, right? Just another brainless slasher full of stupid dumb teenagers and gobs of gore. Not a chance. <br /> <br /> I think James Berardinelli puts it perfectly in his Halloween review: "Due to his title, Halloween is regularly grouped with all the other squatter films that feature theaters throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s. rightfully regarded as the father of the modern slasher genre, it is not a member ... "<br /> <br /> He has a point, and for a number of reasons. First of all, it's really scary, while most entries in the teenage genre are stupid gore festivals (one can argue that many are in the cheek, but most of them also fail). Secondly, there is almost no violence (very little is bloody). John Carpenter knows that violence is not as scary, and he trusts very little about it (actually the body composition is quite low). In fact, one can argue that it is not really a horror movie, at least not according to today's standards, to have the most deaths that can be packed into a single movie, each more greedy and more sadistic than the last. He relies on ideas for fear, and also skill. Third, while some characters can do stupid things (which sometimes seal their fate), they do not because they are stupid. The characters are real people, so instead of thinking that the characters die because they are idiots, we are afraid they are making a mistake. <br /> <br /> One of the main reasons why "Halloween" is so scary is because it's so easy to believe it's real. Nothing is hard to swallow in this movie. There is no supernatural, there are no ridiculous creative plot elements, or "inventive" murders, or whatever. Instead, all the pieces and camera work (except the opening order) is simple. Carpenter just puts the camera in place and says action. What we get is the feeling that we are actually seeing a murder before us. <br /> <br /> Horror movies are probably the toughest movies to make, because making something is all scary must be perfect and ideas never work twice. It's a hit or miss, and so I'd tell all the good ideas that Carpenter has (what I'm not) look like primitive (especially since they are repeatedly repeated with lesser effect throughout the years). <br /> <br /> Doing this is not a plus, as it doesn't have to be. It's a movie about scary ideas, not a movie about dramatic, conflicting characters. The actors act like real people, not characters from a story. Nothing more. The exception to this is who plays the form, or later known as Michael Myers. It can be frightening to tell a person nothing and kill, but it's hard to pull down (and even harder to ask people why). But the man pulls it off, and the result is frightening. <br /> <br /> This is Carpenter's movie through and through. He corrected it, co-wrote, produced it together, and wrote the cold count of it. It's a brilliance man, and his later film "The Thing" supports this statement, though The Thing is not as scary as "Halloween". Unfortunately, its success has decreased dramatically as it happens when the trap of big money for less freedom benefits from once big producers "recognize your potential." As good as this movie is, it's not without errors. The well-known opening tone is disturbing, but not very scary. And not many of the frightening people work for the first part of the movie. It's not that it's bad, it's just that there's no good reason to fear "The Shape". Fortunately, this time Carpenter mostly uses a relationship between the characters and the audience. Although there is no intimacy in this relationship, it fits the purpose. We grow to know the characters, but not so much that it is dishonest when they die. But as soon as the movie arrives after Halloween night, it's when Carpenter kicks things in a high gear and it never stops until you get to the end. <br /> <br /> While "Halloween" may be faulty, it's just a little bit like that. It's a very scary movie, and a must have for anyone who loves scary movies. Be warned though, this movie will deter you from the living hell!
