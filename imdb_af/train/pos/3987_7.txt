The Mother is one of those movies you know is good, maybe even big, but it's like eating vegetables or doing math homework is for a child - too much work and lots of pain to invest in. <br /> <br /> The story may be unpleasant in all sorts of ways: killing a character within the first half hour, the December-May novels, the idea of ​​a man cheating on his wife and then with his mother on his lover cheats collection of weak and rather unpleasant thirty-something characters, the apparent indifference of the adults to the children in their lives. This film was made in the 2002 or 2003 but is a setback to a collection of British films (usually made for television) of the late 1980s. It has a moral seriousness that never arises, which causes an innovative throbbing anxiety. <br /> <br /> The Mother is flawless, but this is partly the problem; As a movie dealing with so many sensitive issues, there are some errors - inconsistencies of the writing, some less actors - it takes the edge off, but if such a movie is so perfect, the experience is seeing it grief and painful. Even the technical features - lighting, editing, etc. - make the viewer pain; The London in this movie is bright and open, filled with hard, sneaky. <br /> <br /> If you are tough like nails, or are one of those super-sensitive people who like to torture themselves with guts of sad movies or novels, then you will enjoy the mother. Anyone in between, give it a miss, or be prepared to worry. And be warned: the hardest thing the movie is from start to finish is the worst to come. <br /> <br /> By the end of the film, the mother asks her daughter what she can do to make it (because she slept with her boyfriend) and calmly tells the daughter that she thought about it and would like her store. The mother agrees, they both stand up, and instead of a well-flattened slap, the girl clamps her fist and delivers a boxer slap. Oh no !!!
