It's great to see such creativity on TV again. This show is poetic, artistic and fun. The characters are well connected and the writing is not bad (I think it will improve if they get their legs). Definitely worth it. <br /> <br /> The girls are stealing the performance so far in this series. Chuck is beautiful like Olive. The two aunts are a pleasure. I sincerely hope they write them in bigger parts, because they are magic. <br /> <br /> Well, that's all the news that's fit to print. Make yourself a big bowl of popcorn and enjoy it in an old-fashioned way. It's like dr. Seuss for adults.
