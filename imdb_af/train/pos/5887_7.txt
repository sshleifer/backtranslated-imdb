So Maria and Rhoda grew older - who didn't? I was a teenager when Mary premiered, and a "young adult" when it left the air. Yes, it was great to see together with Maria and Rho, and yes, maybe the movie did not support the comedy of the original series, but there were enough moments that remind the spirit of the series to make it a good tribute. to make. For example, the producer who inherits Mary and then prescribes the ideas for a new series of "old people". Isn't it typical of the mentality of contemporary Hollywood TV and movie "bean counters?" It may not be the MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW at its best - but it's a pretty damn good look back on one of the best shows we've grown in the 70's.
