In the time, this film has written controversy about it (like most of Verhoeven's projects). <br /> <br /> With many graphics, deaths; A parachute that doesn't open * slaps * guys' body on the floor. A man is eaten by a Lion * chomp * tooth in the throat. And a man is overloaded by a speedboat * zoom * bloody corpse goes off. <br /> <br /> But besides Gore, this movie also contains some brilliant (and beautifully) scenes filmed in the gray fisherman's village Vlissingen; <br /> <br /> Thousands of rosebuds flying across the screen, in a somewhat irrelevant part of the movie, a beautiful (holy) woman who puts flowers in a milk can, surrounded by sheets of blood-drop and steaming love picture between two male characters in a cemetery. <br /> <br /> The story ends in a madness but with 10 minutes, which does not disappoint, and lets you breathe relief. <br /> <br /> Of course with the benefits comes the disadvantages. Some special effects are over and this is of course done to see how far Verhoeven can push the gore factor (eg, the different eyeballs hanging from their sockets). Also, while the two protagonists (Jeroen Krabbe and Renée Soutendijk) do an excellent job of breathing life into their characters, the character of Herman (portrayed by the rather un-charming Thom Hoffman) just feels underdeveloped, making him hard to care even after his tragic death. <br /> <br /> I did my best to give you a little idea of ​​what to expect from this wonderful movie, and as you can see, it's not easily summed up in words. So do yourself a favor, if you find this movie somewhere, watch it! And enjoy the unique style and substance of this masterpiece.
