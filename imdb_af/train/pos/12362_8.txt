I will quickly address this issue of the film: It was a very interesting story about the devastating characteristics of overall passions; A young Italian woman who cannot connect emotionally with her prisoner political radical fianc√© (due to her apolitical attitudes and indemnity approach to life) finds comfort and passion in a new young lover who enters her on an explicit sexual relationship . The anxiety, anger, tenderness and passions wandering in the atmosphere of the story are equal to the dishonest silence that the two guides seem to make. This makes the film a disturbing mood that withdraws from all the political strife otherwise lost on the viewer (unless you have a deep knowledge of Italian politics in the 80's). I found the film compulsory ... which ruined it a little bit, is a free oral sex scene that performs the actress on the male head ... it is not simulated and leaves little imagination. There are other sexual scenes in the movie that I consider necessary because they outline the madness and loneliness in which the characters live. But the oral sex scene seems to me to focus on the real story. It was smooth to that point and as soon as the notorious sex scene appeared (which caused many hoopla in his day), it was like a roadblock. It is frightening and unnecessary and I am in the camp that believes the movie would not be damaged if the scene was removed from it. And what is a pity is that this particular scene can deter people from watching this intriguing movie that I believe is worth seeing because there is so much under-surface, emotion and further turmoil in the sub-texts. <br /> <br /> Overall: Wonderful movie is hampered by a very unnecessary sex scene.
