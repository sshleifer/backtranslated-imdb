There are many police dramas that do the rounds. I do not know why. This is probably related to the old basic theme of good to evil. <br /> <br /> This film has a documentary style as we follow the tough initiative of Anne, a raw site, in a police group stationed in the Baltic region. . No attempt is made to enchant the police. They are really on earth, difficult at times and unforgiving; on the other hand, Anne has a soft heart, perhaps a little more understanding of the human condition. At all times, she sometimes holds incriminating information on her strips and other investigations. <br /> <br /> It's not a pleasant movie. Not one to relax. There is not much sense of optimism in it. The police seem to be involved in a lost battle. Tomorrow there will be more bashings, more murders, more family breaks, and more distressed children. Let's look at it. This is the world we live in. <br /> <br /> As the days go, Anne becomes more involved with the police and with the families they investigate. The only true warmth in the film is that of the character Benny, a 12-year-old from a broken family. Anne has her own way of uploading things. She turns a blind eye to Benny's shoplifting and tries to help him as well as possible. However, I was surprised that she had gone so far to seduce Benny's father. It asked me if it was appropriate for the father or her own needs. The film makes it clear that she desperately needs a partner and loving children. <br /> <br /> Well thrown, but not my idea of ​​an evening's entertainment,
