The performances in this movie were fantastic. The dialogue was wonderful. Jason Patric delivered a fantastic performance as "Kid" Collins in this wonderful adaptation of the Jim Thompson novel. Far better than "The Grifters", which was a good movie, this film really remained true to the pulp fiction / film noir roots that came from the story. I recommend this movie to all movie noir fans.
