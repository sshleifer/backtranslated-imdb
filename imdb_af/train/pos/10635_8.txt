I appreciate the photography, the textures, the colors and often, in contrast to one comment, the lighting. What was missing for me was a coherent story. I have found it often unsuitable, poorly edited and sometimes difficult to follow. My version was 110 minutes, IMDb shows one at 125m. Maybe the cuts and subtitles didn't help. I rejoice in any movie that escapes from the Hollywood form, but it disappointed me. Miss Gillain was light and the performances were all right, I just wanted a little more dialogue. If someone wants to see another movie that has some affinity for this one, try 'Hideous Kinky' with Kate Winslet.
