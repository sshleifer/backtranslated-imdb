This film is worth seeing for the visual beauty and moving action alone, but there is also an interesting cultural subtext of alienation. Women and artists (both brought together in a supporting role of a transvestite opera star) are both doomed to be rejected by subordinate roles in China. It makes the unlikely bond between an old street maker and a young girl even stronger than a triumph over native culture. <br /> <br /> The only problem I had with this movie was the tendency of the soundtrack to swell with emotion being rendered unnecessarily by the actors' performance. <br /> <br /> A welcome alternative to unsatisfactory summer action movies.
