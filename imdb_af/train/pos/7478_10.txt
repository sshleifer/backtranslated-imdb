I come from Romania, I will try to speak English. All I want to say about this movie is that it is and will be my number one time. See it more than 30 times and have seen it for many years. It has all the little things I keep in a movie, it gets a lot of touch, and I'm crying. Show a lot of twisted love stuff and questions about love and reality, and the real things that matter to different people. It so happens that it matters most to me, love, the soul of a man, he is inner and I see this in this movie. Perhaps it is much more to me than a movie, it is a proof in my mind that it really could exist and that you can do the best every time you live with your soul mate. It's a long way from reality to sci-fi, but .. what if. What if all capitalism disappeared and the economy ran out would fall? We will all worry about other issues and my thought is that the bigger thing you remember on your deathbed is not the wealth, not the adventure, not the countries you have visited and the people who remember you. But the true friends and your true love and the hope that, after you die, everyone will be god, and people will be good and care more. Look at this movie and it will probably lead you through your life, as it did to me. Get out of Romania
