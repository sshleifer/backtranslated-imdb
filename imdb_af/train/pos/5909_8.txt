I remember when I was five and my parents thought it was a regular cartoon movie ... Except when the roar and bullets started flying. I have to agree that this movie will upset everyone and everyone because it has to discriminate everyone and everyone .... but the truth is it's funny like hell because it's deep. I recommend it to anyone who loves cult classics. Also try Fritz the Cat and the nine lives of Fritz the Cat. If I am correct, Ralph Bashki also did the film. It involves a cat that has to deal with family, streets, work, etc. through difficult times. Go. When I was old enough, I rented all these movies. Because Coonskin was an offensive title during the era, it was also labeled Street Fighter. Ralph Bashki also played Cool World with a very young Brad Pitt. Heavy traffic was another cartoon that deals with the street life of a young man.
