Although I saw this movie years ago, the impact never left me. Stephen Rea's depiction of an occupier is deep and moving. His fear of not stopping death is palpable. Everyone in the cast is wonderful from Sutherland who tries to accommodate him and provide ways for the police to coordinate their efforts, for the upset citizen x. Every day, when we are bombarded with stories of mass murderers, I think of this movie and the exhausting work that people are doing to try to find the murderers.
