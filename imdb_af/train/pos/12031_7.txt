(WARNING: Minor spoilers) <br /> <br /> I walked in this one and looked from there, not knowing what it was or what the plot was. It certainly gave me attention; I didn't know until the end that it was based on a real story! The man she used to do the dirty thing looked like a serious guy who just twisted his head through a fake girl. I have to question how lifelong that depiction is. Anyone who would kill a man and woman while they slept, just can't be quite nice. Yet I had some sympathy for him, as he was erected and used; so much has been made clear. <br /> <br /> My main complaint is ending (here's the biggest spoiler! Skip this paragraph if you don't want to learn it). A few minutes before it ended, there was no way to discover the truth. The way it was discovered was in a "sting" operation, but my question is: how did the police convince to go with it? The movie we did not show it, and it was a bit too convenient to absent the explanation of how they were convinced to do so. <br /> <br /> I think the way they were handled was done for dramatic purposes, like the omission of the explanation lent an aura of tension to the critical scene that would not otherwise have been there (we would already know what the scene is about and what happened to Brad. <br /> Otherwise, it's a pretty good movie; I give it 7/10. It made me think. Now I'm interested to find out the facts of the real thing. <br /> <br /> Another thing: the movie was done in 1996. Some of the reviews are here to treat it as a more recent movie. <br /> <br /> PS Meadow Sisto is beautiful. I haven't seen her before. She can also do a bit (always a plus in her line of work, LOL).
