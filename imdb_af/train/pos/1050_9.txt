This incredible documentary gives us a glimpse of the lives of brave women in Cameroon's legal system - policemen, lawyers and judges. Despite tremendous problems - lack of resources, the desperate poverty of the people, multiple languages ​​and various legitimate precedents depending on the region of the country and the religious / ethnic background of the plaintiffs and defendants - these brave, strong women make a difference. <br /> <br /> It's a rare thing - a truly inspirational movie that restores a little faith in humanity. Despite the atrocities we see in the movie, justice is served by these passionate, hard-working women. <br /> <br /> I just hope this movie gets a great release in the United States. The more people see this movie, the better.
