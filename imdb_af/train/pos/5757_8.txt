This movie can only begin in the 1970s! It is a bizarre action movie that operates in a small California town. Some kind of mill or plant is closing down, so suddenly there are striking bad behaviors in the streets! The villagers are tired! So Ben Arnold (Jan Michael Vincent) goes to another town to recruit his brother Aaron, who is played by Kris Kristofferson. Aaron is a Vietnam Fat that looks a little out of balance and acts. He hangs with a lot of other fiery Vietnamese veterinarians. They come to town to clean it (they are being deputized), but under their good deeds, they actually run gambling houses, ask for protection money, and so on. !!! It takes a while for people to catch up, and in a Biblical Cain and Abel performance, Vincent has to accept his older brother. There is an interesting blue-frame sleaze atmosphere for this movie, which makes it interesting (note the rooster scene!). Vincent is almost too English in this role ?? he thinks so high of his brother, he cannot conceive of the evil he is doing to the accused. He finally comes to his senses? his girlfriend, Victoria Principal, was brutally shot in the back and he was beaten in his house. Kris Kristofferson is creepily effective as Aaron. He denies any wrong doing, and even quietly speaks and speaks to Vincent's young daughter (she refers to him as 'uncle Aaron') even while threatening her father's life while always smiling! Vincent and Kristofferson have good contrasting chemistry with each other. Bernadette Peters makes an interesting appearance as a 'saloon' girl who draws Aaron's attention. This is a good 70 action movie, if you can find it !! It is NOT available on DVD?
