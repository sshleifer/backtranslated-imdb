I only saw the first part of this series when it flowed back in the late 90's and just got a chance to watch all three parts via Netflix (convenient service casually). In short, I liked this light-hearted, sometimes genre-challenged mini-series. The story of a younger man who falls for an older woman seems to be working and the actors are all good. Yes, it does have some romance cliches to greet in the rain or a train station, but the characters have a chance to be investigated, so it doesn't seem cheesy as it would be if it was a Tom Hanks vehicle or similar. Robson Greene, who sometimes reminds me of a divorced birth, Scott Bakula, does a good job of someone over the heels and the ebb and tide of desire and rejection throws the series at risk. Personally, I think the series could be done with two episodes, but it is going on for the debate. Apparently there is a successor, and it must arrive tomorrow via Netflix.
