Yes, it's a horror-anthology movie and it was fun! This is because, although the film was clearly horror, some of the stories had a light spirit - and there were even a few laughs at times. It's not a bad thing at all, because sometimes horror movies are a bit stuffy and too serious. As a result and because all four stories were pretty good, this is one of the better movies of this style I've seen. <br /> <br /> The unifying theme that connects each story is the home itself. Four different stories involve people renting or investigating the house that happened to the tenants. <br /> <br /> The first segment died Denholm Elliott as a horror writer who has writer's block. So, for a change of scenery, they rent this home. Almost immediately, Elliott's block disappears and he is constantly working on a story about a serial killer. Amazingly, shortly after his block disappears, he actually sees his fictional character! Again and again the psychotic killer appears and disappears - he seems to lose his mind. It may just be the best of the stories, as the nice-looking end makes the story alive. <br /> <br /> The second, though not bad, is probably the worst. Peter Cushing plays a bachelor who pain for a girl friend who died some time ago (though the picture of her looks incredibly contemporary). When he enters a room of horrors in the city, he sees a wash figure reminding him of his lost lady and he is both fascinated and scared of it. Later a friend (Joss Ackland) visits and he also sees the figure and is enchanted by it. All this leads to an end which, frankly, was a bit of a fall. <br /> <br /> Christopher Lee dies as an incredibly hard and strict father for a pathetic girl. In most of this segment, Lee was like an idiot, but eventually he can understand his attitude. Although slow, this one ended very well. <br /> <br /> The fourth segment was the silliest and was meant to parody the genre. Jon Pertwee (the third "Doctor" of the DR WIE television series) is a very temperamental actor known for his portrayal of Dracula. However, there is nothing right about the movie and in a fitness pique he kicks off the set to find better props for this vampire movie. It's really interesting that he played this role because it was a natural thing for Christopher Lee who played Dracula or other vampires a bazillion time (give or take a few). I enjoyed Pertwee's line when he basically said that Lee's and other recent incarnations of Dracula were all crazy compared to Bela Lugosi's! Maybe that's why Lee didn't take this part! Despite some very foolish moments, it was very entertaining and fun - possibly as good or better than the first segment. <br /> <br /> Since the movie started and ended so well, it performed and wrote, it's hard to keep this movie.
