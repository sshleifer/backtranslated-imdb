Jacknife is a masterpiece of the 80's. It is a movie that is breathtaking with wonderful plays and a very interesting live touch. In Jacknife, both European and American cinema enthusiasts can find relationships. The script is very compelling and full of beautiful characters. Ed Harris is one of the biggest shows to date. He portrays his alcoholic hero, and lets us feel his broken heart every move. Robert De Niro reminds us of him as one of the best actors of all time in one of the simplest but most realistic performances of his career. Jacknife never gets bored, because it shows his heroes of any typical Hollywood typical character elements. After the war, no one is a hero. Everyone is a loser, and this movie is about that simple truth. No one can recover his pieces after a war, just like the heroes of this movie. Jacknife is about the diseases of the soul that causes war. Simple beautiful movie.
