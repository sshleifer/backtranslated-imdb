Here's a fun fact, I was the baby in the movie, the one in the crib. :) I'm now 19 years old. my parents took me to try out for the part. We lived in Texas at the time. I think I just made $ 80 for it, but I wasn't very long on it. My parents said I would cry when I was supposed to be happy and would be happy if I was supposed to cry. I was all mixed up. Strange and funny fact, I suppose .. and no I'm not a child actress. I'm in San Antonio, work 'at a walgreens. I graduated here in Texas, but I lived in Maryland all my life. This movie is a good movie, but good concept. I've seen it a few times in my short 19 years.
