I participated in a small mini production of this when I was at school 8 and my mom bought the video for me. I already loved it !! When I was younger, it was the songs and spectacular dance series I enjoyed, but since I watched it when I got older, I appreciated the fantastic acting and character depiction. Oliver Reed and Ron Moody were brilliant. I can't imagine anyone else playing Bill Sykes or Fagin. Shani Wallis' Nancy is the best character for me. She put so much for the boys, I think she is such a strong character and her final scene when ... Well, you know ... Let me always cry! Best musical in my opinion of all time. It's been all this time, it will continue for many years to come! 11/10 !!
