Burlinson and Thornton give an excellent performance in this movie, along with Dennehy. Although it is only thought to be just about love, it really goes deeper than that. The scenery captures this movie and places one of the best I've ever seen. The horse scenes are absolutely fantastic !! Any horse lovers out there will love this movie! <br /> <br />
