It's a fairly slow-paced movie, slowly building the story of an ex-stripper starting a new family life with a full stranger. The viewer feels slowly that something is wrong here. <br /> <br /> I really love this movie, though it does leave a little taste in the end. It is smart, good-natured and very well done. Both Philippe Toretton and Emmannuelle Seigner are deep in their characters. <br /> <br /> The little boy "pierrot" is also very pleasant. <br /> <br /> A player who doesn't look like one. A very unconventional movie, very special atmosphere throughout the movie, although you may feel uncomfortable a few times with a few scenes. <br /> <br /> I'll give it an 8/10!
