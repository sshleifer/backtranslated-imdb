Meryl Streep is excellent in her animated and stoic performance as the infamous Lindy Chamberlain, who accused and attempted to assassinate her own baby Azaria Chamberlain and use her alibi of ruthless dingoes as a defense. Based on the book "Evil Angels" and titled in the Australian version, a CRY IN THE DARK is an ugly movie to watch. It offers a scenario that is too real for us in America: the witch hunt against a person who is considered an easy target. <br /> <br /> Lindy Chamberlain was this woman. Being someone who spoke to her mind, someone who didn't play the sympathy card and someone who was just hard to keep up with her life despite her horrific ordeal, she was considered suspicious and hated if not clear was not. did not kill her own child. The media started a persistent nose and a progressive invasion of privacy that soon stuck the whole nation to their sets. And all this, Lindy stays so stoic as ever, even when her husband, Michael, falls apart. <br /> <br /> Of course, this attitude is the power of power, impossible as it may seem, and people are very strong about it. They want to see a distressed mother cry and weep and occasionally become weak at every turn, don't sit there and look empty. People do not understand that everyone does not suffer the same and when someone decides to stand strong, they start speculating. Meryl Streep embodies this infected woman on the fringe, creating a cold, but not uncomfortable, woman, who has stood by her beliefs, even if they cost her freedom. Because of her, Sam Neill was allowed to slowly dissolve his character - someone should either leave the Chambermates, and no one wants to see it. Besides the monster that has at the time of this writing, the news media becomes. They will always catch train wrecks and feed the milled manure to the uninformed public.
