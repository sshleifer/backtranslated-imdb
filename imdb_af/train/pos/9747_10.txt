I remember seeing this movie when it first came out in 1982 and then loved it. About 4 years later I had the privilege to see Luciano Pavarotti in the Metropolitan Opera House in New York (in Tosca). To see the end of this movie remind me so much of the big night. What doesn't like this movie? The music is brilliant and Pavarotti (Fini) was at his best and still looked good. The story is really funny in parts and the 'food fight' scene is still one of the funniest things I've ever seen. The hot air balloon flight over the Napa Valley was beautiful and so was the song he sang "If we were in love" (one of the few times, Pavarotti sang in English). And hear the duet of Santa Lucia beautiful. Get real people, it was a movie about an opera singer named Georgio Fini, which has just been played by Pavarotti. Kathryn Harrold & Eddie Albert were excellent in their supporting roles. <br /> <br /> I'm really glad I still have this almost exhausted VHS band from this movie, but I'd love to release it on DVD, especially now that Pavarotti is no longer with us, because I think so Join Nessun Dorma's best performance he sings on film today!
