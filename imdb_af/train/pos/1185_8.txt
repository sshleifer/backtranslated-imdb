Robert Taylor and Stewart Granger link the goodie baths they held in "All the Brothers Were Brave". Taylor looks a little uncomfortable in his bad old role, but Granger plays his part perfectly. But the true hero in the story is the bison and the northwest. The film is made perfect, with the wonderful atmosphere of the times. The direction is tight and although the film is no light entertainment, it is, in my way of thinking a big movie, unfairly ignored by the cognoscent.
