I absolutely loved this movie! It was so good! This film is told by the parrot, Paulie's point of view. Paulie is given to the girl Marie as a gift. Paulie helps Marie talk and they become best friends. But if Paulie Marie tells you to fly, she falls and the bird is sent away. This is when the adventure begins. Paulie goes through so much to find Marie. This movie is so sweet, funny, touching, sad and more. When I first watched this movie, it made me cry. The birds and the courage to go look for his Marie for that time, was so touching. I must say that the end is so sweet and sad, but you have to look it out to find out how it goes. In the end, the lawyer tries to help him after hearing his story. Will he find his long lost Marie or not? Find out when you watch this lovely warming movie. It will touch your heart. Rating: 10
