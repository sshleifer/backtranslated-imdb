Although it was a disaster in the box office, it was my favorite movie. It gives a powerful message from family. It has a lot of violence and has one song with a lot of girls in bikini. Compared to other bollywood movies, the action scenes in this movie are more realistic. It's an incredible combination of Akshay Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan. If you want to see the Indian Godfather, Amitabh portrays it in this movie. Don't read reviews by critics, they are just ignorant. This movie has a good mix of comedy, romance, drama and especially action. So if you want to see more realistic than Main Hoon Na (still good movie), it's the movie.
