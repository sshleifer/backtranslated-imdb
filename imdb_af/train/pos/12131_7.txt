The film is about Philip (Leslie Howard). He is a serious but disabled drug student. He falls in love with a heartless, deceptive waitress, Mildred (Bette Davis). She let him leave, with Alan Hale, Reginald Denny. Meanwhile, he is acclaimed by another writer (Kay Johnson, Frances Dee), but she goes back to a mutually destructive relationship. <br /> <br /> Easily the best and first of several films versions of Somerset Maugham's novel. Bette Davis as the shockingly brutal waitress wins another beautiful rendition with an enticing and smoldering performance, absolutely hypnotic in her report of the slavery taking place from the beginning to the final. Davis raised the stars with her performance. Her role as tough and rough dominant woman will be repeated several times in posteriors acting. Leslie Howard as the substantial good and decent student who has been subtly spoiled, gives an excellent and melancholy performance. He was a wonderful actor (Gone with the Wind), except producer and writer and died in plane crash during World War II. Both play again in Â¨Petrified Forest (1936). The atmosphere film is extensively recreated in the RKO (Radio Picture Inc) studio is quite convincing. Remade in 1946 by Edmund Goulding, with Eleanor Parker and Paul Henreid; and in 1964 by Ken Hughes with Kim Novak and Laurence Harvey. The movie will be like classic cinema buffers. Rating: Very good, but a little dated.
