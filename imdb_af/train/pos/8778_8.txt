James J. Corbett, world heavyweight champion from 1892 to 1897, seems to be Errol Flynn's favorite role. Maybe because he didn't have a sword or had to be in the west. He got tired of the swashbucklers and he said in his autobiography he felt he was being wasted in the west and could not understand why people kept him in them. It's a pleasant movie, but doesn't tell the true story of James J. Corbett. <br /> <br /> As depicted, Corbett was the first scientific boxer to win in the heavyweight division, a brains man who has more speed. as brute force to win. He defeated John L. Sullivan and lost to Bob Fitzsimmons the heavyweight crown. He was also a forecaster and with that it was very much like the man who portrays him. Of course it is not shown on the screen. The character Alexis Smith plays, the banker's daughter who falls for him, really has no basis. In fact, Corbett was married twice and was terribly unfaithful to both his wives. <br /> <br /> Even after losing his title and ending the events of this movie, he had a great personal tragedy. His father was in a moment of depression, probably over finance, because he had lost his son to beat Bob Fitzsimmons, shot his mother and turned the gun on himself. The murder / suicide hardly commits with the happy clan that Alan Hale presides. <br /> <br /> One thing though I liked gentleman Jim. Ward Bond played the career role of his life in John L. Sullivan. Director Raoul Walsh received a good performance from Bond as the exciting but sweet Sullivan. Even a few of Sullivan's bad points that don't make it on the screen like racist racism are Bond's depiction of the essential John L. and the best thing about the Lord Jim. <br /> <br /> Speaking of racism, one thing It must have said was the fact that Sullivan while the champion refused on the basis of a race to meet Peter Jackson, who was black and Australia, and probably the best heavyweight of his time. I'm probably saying Corbett met him as a challenger and recorded him for 61 rounds. That battle more than any other has created a demand for a Sullivan-Corbett title game. Of course, when Corbett was the champion, he refused to give Jackson a title shot. Maybe he didn't want another 61 round marathon with someone who might be better on that particular day. <br /> <br /> Mr. Jim is not Jim Corbett's story, it's a movie by Errol Flynn who James J Corbett. But Corbett lived in life in 1942, would definitely have loved the movie and loved Flynn's portrayal of his life. It's like he'd like to remember.
