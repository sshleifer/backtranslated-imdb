I recently purchased the complete American Gothic series on DVD and it has reminded me of it. I was very grateful to see for the first time episodes that were never broadcast television. I loved the "Ring of Fire", especially the stories I didn't see for the first time. <br /> <br /> Gary Cole is fantastic as an evil, sexy "Lucas Buck. Lucas Black as Caleb is also an excellent player. I thought Brenda Bakke as Selena Coombs was also excellent in her portrayal. the whole cast was terrific and has good chemistry with each other. <br /> <br /> It is unfortunate that the series has been screwed through the network (in conjunction with an emerging group of sensors) because it is truly designed for adult viewing A blend of comedy, tragedy, farce, satire, gothic romance and horror genres, has presented brilliant characterizations that are supported by working on the genius level. <br /> <br /> devil for once in me live. Long live Gary Cole (Sheriff Lucas Buck), the nicest "fallen angel" ever lived.
