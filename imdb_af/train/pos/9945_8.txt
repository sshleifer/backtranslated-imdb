First things first! It's not an action movie, though there is a lot of action! I think you can compare it to American sports movies! Where a team succeeds very bad players, a game or tournament wins out of expectation! In this case, it's not about football or baseball, but Taekwondo! In the beginning, these street people look good! But soon we'll find out they don't want to be rude and actually have to reach something in life! It's nice to see them fight and training! I was amazed at how funny this movie was! From start to finish you will put your pants on! The young Korean actors are very convincing! Check out this great, good movie!
