This episode of Twilight Zone combines a silent section (1890) with melodramatic scene and siggats, a tribute to the early Buster Keaton movies. Very slapstick: Buster falls on a dish door, falls into a puddle, walks around pants-less. Fool scientist's invention of a Time Helmet, reminiscent of a Flash Gordon idea of ​​what the future would be. Cheap prices, such as $ 1.95 for women's hats, or 17 cents a pound for beef, seem scary to Buster. Even the world of 1890 is too much for Buster / Mulligan. How shocking if he was wrongly transported to the "modern" world of 1960! Buster tried to go back! The "scientist" of that time wants to return to a quieter world, the 1890 he studied and admired. They go back together, and Buster / Mulligan is now happy and the "scientist" doesn't regret electronic equipment, modern beds or an electric blanket. So Buster sends him back with the crazy helmet. <br /> <br /> This Twilight Zone doesn't have a heavy message. Since Buster Keaton died in 1966, it is one of his last attempts. That's enough. <br /> <br /> Another cute thing - long-term underutilized Maytag Man Jesse White is a repairman who fixes Time Helmet - the preview of his washing machine track.
