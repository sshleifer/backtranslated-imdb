It was a must for me a documentary when I missed the event in 2004, so I'm definitely going to see the repetition. I have a lot of sympathy with the main character of the movie, because it is true, I have a lighter condition of the skin problem he had, Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB). It is a sad, sometimes amusing and very emotional documentary about a boy with a terrible skin disorder. Jonny Kennedy speaks like a child (because of the muscle muscle) and never went through puberty, but he is 36 years old. Most sympathetic moments see his terrible condition, and his bandages blow off. Jonny had quite a naughty sense of humor, even telling the grave from outside when he showed his body in a coffin. He tells his story with the help of his mother, Edna Kennedy, his older brother and well-known model, and Jonny's supporter, Nell McAndrew. This won the BAFTAs for Best Editorial and Best New Director (Actual), nominated for Best Sound (Factual) and the Flaherty Documentary Award. It was number 10 at The 100 Greatest TV Treats 2004. A Must See Documentary!
