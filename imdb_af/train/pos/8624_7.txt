What is the best way to start a movie review like Der Todesking? Let's start by saying that I just watched this movie, and the images are still burning deep in my brain - and I don't think they'll be running soon. <br /> <br /> It is probably fair to say that if you are on this page, you have a good idea what kind of movie it is, even if you haven't seen it. If not, let me know that it is not a moderate budget gem that has lost some darkness for a few years, nor is it a low budget. What it is is a low-budget art that is presented in a simple but attractive way. The idea is a simple one - seven stories that revolve around, ending in, muddled with images of a decomposing body. Sounds simple right, even boring? It's not. Words can't really describe how powerful this movie becomes by the time you're halfway; it attracts you almost whether you want to or not. <br /> <br /> Here I can go over the technical advantages and disadvantages of the direction; Perhaps the screens are obviously being shot on super-8 cameras and sometimes shaky. I can point out that some of the sound effects are out of sync to compete on any Fulci movie, but it seems to be insignificant at the end of the day. <br /> <br /> As far as extreme movies go, I saw the most difficult of them, yet Der Todesking moved me in a way that few others managed, despite the fact that it was not very stingy and had very few scenes that I would consider "gratuitous". In fact, the most disturbing scene I found was the last story. I won't ruin it, just to say that the character's emotional agony drips out of the screen and makes you sympathetic, if you don't want to end. <br /> <br /> Certainly, this is not the best movie ever made, and in many places it looks rough and maybe a little amateur, but despite these mistakes Der Todesking is an experience I recommend anyone who loves challenging theater. If you are someone who looks comfortable or wants 'nice' movies, or just wants to exchange something brutal and useless, it's not what you're looking for. <br /> <br /> Whether you enjoy it or not, it's one you won't forget soon.
