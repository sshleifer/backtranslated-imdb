One measurement for the greatness of a movie is, "If on TV At the moment you want to sit there and watch?" My answer for the Grand Canyon is so powerful a "yes" like that for almost any movie I ever seen will be. There are so many powerful moments, such an intelligent and moving story, such incredible performances. <br /> <br /> It perfectly captures the confusion and violence that was so great in the early nineties. But it also dramatically confirms the ability of individuals to love, think and care. In a slight way, the movie was out of time. It partly portrays society as a balloon to burst. Because the country was in a recession, and so empty of leadership, it was true from that time on. But the movie is also timeless. I think it can honestly stand up to any film ever made, and this is the most forgotten movie of all time.
