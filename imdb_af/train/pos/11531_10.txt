I remember being a kid when I first saw this movie, it was my first horror movie (maybe that's why I still remember some parts of it). I do not remember much about plays, plays or other things, but I remember a man blowing his head up with a grenade, a man who dipped over a tree, and dropping a man with a truck, and shot :) (Todd Schaefer, Kenny Johnson and Kevin McParland). I also remember the last scene when Jennifer McAllister of the killer got ripped to get the keys to the truck. It's a movie that gives you the crawl and it's worth it. But where do I find it? How can I download it?
