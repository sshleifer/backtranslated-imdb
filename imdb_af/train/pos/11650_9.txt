A most anticipated film of the year 2002. After three and a half years of hibernation, Rajini acted in this movie. The hype for this movie was too high. <br /> <br /> It's not a typical Rajini movie, in this film he also gives spiritual messages. But it also includes typical Rajini actions, style, songs, etc. In. It's a good entertaining movie and also gives good messages. <br /> <br /> I would consider this movie as Good instead of Excellent because of the script. It's a must watch movie. Do not miss it!
