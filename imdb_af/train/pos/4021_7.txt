A complex story laid out in the background of the division of Bharat. An honest Muslim kidnapping an innocent Hindu girl, and a trained Hindu who burns a Muslim man's crop, but ultimately you both stick to them. The story is powerful, but the script and flow are hesitant. Background music score and the songs are outstanding. Next comes unforgettable action by veteran Urmila Matondkar. Photography captures the time, violence and smell of rural Punjab very well. Other actors did not do well either, or did not have a chance to act. Direction is really the worst link. The characters were not well developed. Not sharp, unlike the "Earth", where even a 5-line character leaves a point. The end is very interesting. This story can have different ends - and everyone could just as well have been.
