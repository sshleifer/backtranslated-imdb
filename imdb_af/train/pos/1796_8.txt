I caught the night in the theater with a women's woman. The evening is a chick spot with no excuses to be such, but I can say with some relief that it is not so infused with estrogen that it is painful for a red-blooded man to watch. Apart from a single case at the end of the movie, I watched with interest and didn't have to turn my eyes off or roll on any self-sufficient melodrama. Ladies, for them, will absolutely love this movie. <br /> <br /> Ann Lord is elderly, bed-ridden and spending her last few days on Earth as comfortably as possible in her own home with her two adult daughters at her side. Outraged by the memories of her past, Ann suddenly called out a man's name that her daughters had never heard before: Harris. While both of her daughters have the meaning of their mother's strong urge to remind and restore her careless relationship with this mysterious man at all times, Ann falls back into her head to the fateful day she met Harris. so youthful optimism for the future has lost that we all necessarily share with each other. <br /> <br /> Both Ann and her two daughters - one married to children, one a serial "commitophobe" - struggling with the central question of whether true love really exists, and perhaps more important than true love testing the time can endure. Are we all bored one day to realize that love never lasts forever? Will we all realize that the only realistic outcome of the imperfect is to establish? The subtle fact that the elderly Ann is still wrestling with an answer to these questions on her deathbed is not lost to her two daughters. <br /> <br /> The cinematography for the evening is interesting - most of the film is spent in Ann's. thought as she remembers the past, and therefore I think the film was shot as if it were all deliberately overwhelmed, to give everyone an ethereal glow (and so it makes it very clear that all this is not really, but also in the last). Claire Danes is beautiful (really looks very long, but only 5 '5 "in fact) and is absolutely fascinating in one climbing activity where her singing talent is finally put to the test. <br /> <br /> You can't actually waste trash the movie doesn't talk, which ends with Claire Danes and doesn't come from there: Vanessa Redgrave, Patrick Wilson, Meryl Streep and Glenn Close fill in the other important and minor roles in the movie. <br /> <br /> I Can't really say anything negative about this movie, though Hugh Dancy's battle for his character emerges from one-dimensionality, is ultimately a total loss, playing the spoiled, sweet drunk offspring of the obsession rich in front. of great bravado set up, but secretly scared to never say anything, probably doesn't have much to do with character exploration, he had his orders and stuck to them. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, sir , your wife's friend will surely cry, and while you're probably not l do not feel almost as affected, the night will certainly not be a waste of time to watch the evening. Catch it in theaters or grab it as a rental to finish off for points for when you are accompanied by a viewing of Die Hard 4 or the upcoming Rambo movie. It will be your little secret that this show didn't cost you much at all.
