As the cabinet of dr. Caligari is the father of all horror films (and of the German expressionist theater), this pre-WWI movie is the grandfather. The titular student who is hungry in an empty guard makes an agreement with the devil. The devil gives him a bottomless bag of gold in exchange for "anything in this room." The devil chooses the student's reflection in his mirror. He walks off with the student's doppelganger, who commits crimes for which the student is found guilty. <br /> <br /> The movie is due to some limitations from the technically primitive state of 1913 film filming; the plot shouts for chiaroschuro effects, but the film is essential, virtually everything shot in the shady daylight. But the scene where the reflection goes out of the mirror, still takes another wall. <br /> <br /> More interesting to the trends that tell it than to own wishes, the Student of Prague is still worth it.
