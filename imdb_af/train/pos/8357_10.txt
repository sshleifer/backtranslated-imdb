A wonderful, free-flowing, often lyrical movie whispering to you, ever smiling, even though there are truly shocking incidents on the way. One sees how the women are treated and eventually it looks very good and it is very important for all concerned that so many potentially disastrous scenes all work so well. It is possibly Depardieu's best performance, certainly its most natural. Jeanne Moreau performed excellently, which had a very difficult role to play and including lively sex scenes with a few guys at least half her age. Miou-Miou is quite good and has very difficult scenes to play. Initially, it looks like it is a deviant and dirty misogynistic ridge / skirt, but if the story and characters unfold a lot more soft and honest, it occurs. Eventually, this uncompromising and daring movie requires respect.
