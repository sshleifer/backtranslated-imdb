I found it to be a surprisingly light hand on a 1950s culture clash movie. John Wayne would hardly be one of his first choice as a cultural attache. He is so diplomatic with his good intentions as a race in Harrods. But this time he was left to play a part that was much more passionate than his usual bluff persona, and he completed his task with style. The Duke was a man who could really do well. His facial expressions and body language can be extremely subtle. <br /> <br /> Despite its considerable presence, both as an actor and in terms of screen time, he did not dominate this movie. Many of his good intentions were given a herb. He had no authority over anyone, and the intermittent story was by the titular geisha to whom he was barbaric. <br /> <br /> The story of US efforts to seize favor with isolation Japanese was rather one of political intrigue than swashbuckling or hell-for-learning battles. I cannot comment on the accuracy of his research, but the strangeness of Eastern culture to western sensitivity is well proven. There was a very meticulous choreographic ceremony that involved watching this observer like authentic costumes and props. The chapters were complex and detailed. There was a lot of money and thought applied. <br /> <br /> The broken romance between Wayne and his geisha added a little extra element and stopped the movie just to become a political or flag-moving effort. Scripture was good without being present. There was a great deal of Japanese dialogue, but the long periods of translation did not interfere with the story. It was nice to see many genuine orientations on the set. Whether they were Japanese or not, I couldn't say. But anyway, they watched the part. At least, the leaders were not played by cross-band kukasians, unlike other attempts like "Blood Alley" (yes, I know they were Chinese) "The Inn Of The Sixth Happiness" or even "The King And I". /> <br /> Honestly, I enjoyed it more than any other movie. The writing was better for a start. I never liked the songs in 'The King And I' and was not impressed by the heavily loaded anti-communist subtext of 'Blood Alley'. I confess that I have never seen this work and found that it is very favorably compared to many of the Duke's most popular outings. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
