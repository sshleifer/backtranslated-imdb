Princess Tam Tam is without the pursuit of racism, as we think racism in the United States, but there are more subtle (to American viewer) allegations about ethnic identity over time. Pay attention to Alwina's (Baker) placement within shots, how she is addressed by the other characters, the institutions around her that all portray her as a "fierce" Afrikaner, and ask yourself if Alwina has an agency in the movie. I don't want to ruin anything, but at the end pay close attention, the dichotomy between the "Eastern" and "Western" culture is the least offensive. Often such a dictation is denied wholeheartedly. The French have a checkered pass as an imperial force in the depicted areas (see Chris Marker's Les Statues Meurent Aussie 1953), and note the places where European travelers visit while in Africa and what reflects on their attitudes to the "other". I give this movie a 7 because I have a sugar for Baker. Much of what she did in her professional career, such as regressive Princess Tam Tam, is definitely overshadowed by her efforts to integrate, grab her job as a freaking spy, sorry.) But the movie for me is fascinating of her performance, moreover, it is a narrative remnant of passing mentalities.
