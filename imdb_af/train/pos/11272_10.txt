108: Tarzan and his partner (1934) - released 4/20/1934, seen 8/6/08. <br /> <br /> John Dillinger escapes from prison and robs a bank in Iowa. Bonnie and Clyde killed two highway patrols in Texas. BIRTH: Ralph Nader, Gloria Steinem, Alan Arkin, Richard Chamberlain. <br /> <br /> DOUG: After being disappointed with the original 'Tarzan the Ape Man', we discovered co-users and historians that the second movie, "Tarzan and his partner," was the best in the series. It is true. I got a big kick from this movie. Johnny Weismuller returns as the titular wobbly, animal devil-wild superhero, and Maureen O'Sullivan repeats her role as his absolutely fantastic lady, loves Jane (who plays a two-piece outfit for the first and last time). In my review for 'Ape Man' I knocked Jane over her goodies for her obsession with clothes and her ceaseless shouting, but she delivered her here for me. Make no mistake: O'Sullivan is the star of this movie, and Jane is the most capable character in the whole role. She acts as ambassador between Holt and Tarzan, she can function perfectly in the jungle and go with the animals, and she knows how to pride herself on a fierce lion when she is out of bullets. She even had her own jungle cry. The chemistry between Johnny and Maureen is irresistible. She trained him completely. Cheeta is also quite charming, and takes off Martin's cigarette. The plot is mostly an excuse for Tarzan to fight with the jungle's most evil animals, especially lions, crocodiles and rhinos. The effects, though always visible, are much more dynamic and cool and complement the action nicely. Oh, and you can't talk about this movie without talking about the nude swimming scene. All I can say is: yes, she is naked. Many exciting things. <br /> <br /> KEVIN: Wow. Not Wow. When it comes to the dirty-and-dirty pre-code action / adventure, keep nothing at Tarzan and his partner. The inevitable sequel to Tarzan's Monkey Man is a kicking ass, violent and risqu√© jungle epic. I doubt there will be another Tarzan film in the future, which will not take in prisoners as it does. You will be hard pressed to find a complete scene in this movie that would be Code-approved or Animal Rights-approved for the case. The gruesome violence does not even await the happy jungle couple to come before it even pushes the boundaries of today's adventure films. And after T & J enters the picture, there is a lot of early morning cuddling and asshole swimming. See it for yourself if you don't believe me. I especially like Maureen O'Sullivan in this movie. In the first film, Jane was like a running inconsistency, as the writers back then just didn't know how to portray such a character. But here she is a good forerunner to kick women from later theater. Although she still needs Tarzan's help to get her out of the most jam, she does much more than just wait to be saved. Her personality is absolutely credible for a woman who lives comfortably in the jungle for a year (relatively). I watched it with my mom, and I enjoyed showing how much Jane Tarzan "trained" as Jeff Foxworthy put it. She has the monkey at her every turn and call. While there are quite a few dated optical effects in the film, there is still a lot of hair heating Tarzan against predator battles that are mostly performed for actually. This and the men-dressed-like monkeys are much more convincing this time. ** SPOILER ** The movie climax as the jungle breaks out with a shocking orgy of animal kingdom violence that leaves Tarzan and Jane the only two people still breathing. Although the couple are reuniting in the sunset and leaving victory, I can't help imagining how this story will look like for the next safari, which will hear from the previous group of people who are looking for Tarzan and Jane and have never been heard again. no. . ** END SPOILER ** One of the things that still bother me is Johnny Weissmuller's smooth, hairless bid and stunned coif. Other than that, it's a pre-code action adventure that shouldn't be missed. <br /> <br /> Last movie: It happened one night (1934). Next film: Twentieth Century (1934).
