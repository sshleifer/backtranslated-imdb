basically, i like Verhoeven movie, because in his movie I enjoy a brilliant psycho-sexual story that I previously saw in "Basic Instinct". It's really a great thriller that I really enjoyed. It is, of course, for me to look at this other Verhoeven. film. <br /> <br /> Well, it's his previous direction before his blockbuster "Basic Instinct" hit and so I was very curious to see that movie and yes, the movie fulfilled my hope and expectation. <br /> <br /> This movie "The Fourth Man" is a brilliant psychotic drama that is a bit complex for some audiences. The story of this movie is about a gay writer called "Reve" (Crab), an alcoholic who lives by his own moral values ​​and sees many visions that can warn him of a future accident. After his lecture he introduced a seductive woman named "Christine", who has a mysterious past that she does not want to reveal. Don't make sex with her at her house, because she's a boy. the morning he looked at her sexy, macho boyfriend's photo on her table. , the person he met at the station. He was curious to meet him and invite Christine to invite him to her home. <br /> <br /> That's it. I don't want to tell the whole story because it's a Verhoeven movie and the end of the movie is really surprising! <br /> <br /> I especially like the character "Reve" which is brilliantly played by "Krabbe" I'm basically his acting, because as a gay person I was purely identified with his character and yes, I love his beautiful face. <br /> <br /> I would like to thank Mr.Verhoeven for making such a black comedy. br /> <br /> I rate this movie: 10 out of 10.
