This film was made in 1948, but it is still true today. Very, very funny. It starts with a family who wants to buy a small place in the country and build it from there. Anyone who ever built a house will find this movie very engaging. Great throw. Cary Grant and Myrna Lloyd are beautiful in this movie. It is a classic black and white film that reflects the grand styles of the 40's .... clothes, architecture and family life. There are many references to the cost of things, and the comparisons with the cost of today are quite astounding. I can't imagine anyone not really enjoying this movie. I'm amazed at the number of middle-aged people who have never heard of it. A true classic.
