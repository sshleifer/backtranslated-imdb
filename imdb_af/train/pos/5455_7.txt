Notorious pre-code movie, really the one movie that caused people to insist that the Hayes code be strictly enforced. Barbara Stanwyck stars as a young girl whose liquor-selling father has no problem expressing her. When he dies in an accident, she is released into the world knowing that her enjoyable body can get her what she wants. She goes to New York and continues to climb the corporate ladder, one bed at a time. Although of course there is no real sex, the movie is very messy. Unfortunately, the initial shock value disappears (about the time Stanwyck screws a railway vehicle inspector to travel for free), the movie is a bit repetitive and boring. Stanwyck himself is the only thing worth the film to go through. As always, she is fantastic.
