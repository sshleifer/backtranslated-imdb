After repeated listening to the CD soundtrack, I knew I wanted this movie, it was for Christmas and I was amazed. Marc Bolan had such charisma, I can't describe it. I heard from him that way, but didn't understand what people were talking about until I was in the company of these footage. He was incredible. Clips of the Wembley concert are captured by surrealistic sketches, such as nuns moving around at a garden party. Marc Bolan performs some acoustic versions of Get It On, etc. (I'm still learning the song titles). George Claydon, the decreasing photographer of the Magical Mystery Tour, plays a driver who jumps out of a car and eats one of the side mirrors. Nothing I can say to describe it will spoil it, even though I leave the judges' indemnity on this review, so you'll just have to see it for yourself. This evokes description. <br /> <br /> Yes, I love the Beatles and was curious about Ringo who is a rock documentary - it was 35 years ago - now, I finally find it on DVD for 2 years, but it's finally in my home. . It's a wonderful viewing experience - even captivating. <br /> <br /> Now the DVD has hidden extras and the following is a copy and paste from another user: <br /> <br /> There are two hidden extras on the Born To Boogie double DVD release. <br /> <br /> 1. From the menu on disk one select the bonus material and go to the extra scenes. 2. Go to the extra screens page. Screen 42 takes 1 and holds on the left 3. when the pointer disappears, press right until a "Star + 1972" logo appears. 4. Press Enter <br /> <br /> 5. From the main menu on disk two, select the sound options 6. On the audio option page, go the 90/25 (I think it's right) option and keep left 7. If the cursor disappear, keep right until a "Star + Home video" logo appears. 8. Press Enter
