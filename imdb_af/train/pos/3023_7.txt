This pleasant little noir boasts a top throw and many memorable scenes. The big distraction is the complete disregard of authentic accent. The Spanish characters in the film are played by a Frenchman (Boyer), a Belgian (Francen), a Greek (Paxinou) and a Hungarian (Lorre)! And above all, Bacall is supposed to be an English aristocrat! Despite these absurdities, the performances are all very good - especially those of Paxinou and Lorre. But the scene in which Boyer, Paxinou and Lorre meet, and speak in many different accents, is a real hit! And I think they were alone, that they should actually speak in Spanish! It seems pretty strange that the Brothers Warner could not find Spanish speaking actors in Los Angeles! Of course, Hollywood often did an "old accent" policy - my other favorite is Greta Garbo (Swedish) and Mata Hari, who falls in love with a Russian soldier played by a Mexican (Ramon Novarro). Maybe they should have Novarro for "Confidential Agent" - he would have been good at Boyer's role or at least in Francen (who saved a lot on the dark makeup budget).
