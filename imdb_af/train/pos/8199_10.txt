After what was considered the official Dirty Harry trilogy with The Enforcer (1976) to be the last chapter in the series. Dirty Harry is back, older, more dirty and cave than ever since the original 1971 classic. <br /> <br /> In the past, Dirty Harry killed a psychopath killer, vigilant police, and Vietnam veteran terrorists. But now he is going to a new killer, a murderer who wants repayment, by captivating her attackers. <br /> <br /> Sudden Impact brings new meaning and darkness to Dirty Harry. Callahan is on a new murder case turning to a woman (played by Sondra Locke), who was brutally raped, along with her sister, who is being set on fire. Ten years later she was forced to force her attackers. At the same time, Callahan, through his superiors, is on a difficult heat after he challenged a ganglust to a heart attack, which the gang also hunted for. To get rid of the heat in the city, Harry is on his way to a vacation in a coastal town, but at the same time the victim is also in town while hunting one of her attackers. Harry is on the investigation and finds the murders very similar, as he lives on the murderer's roads. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, sudden impact should be one of my top 10 revenge films, as well as the second best Dirty Harry movie, much better than both The Enforcer and The Dead Pool combined. Sudden Impact, which had the original Dirty Harry, had a dark tone with entertaining value. <br /> <br /> So do you feel happy, punk?
