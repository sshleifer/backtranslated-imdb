Mat Spirogolou's (Toby Malone) family knows he is a talented soccer player and is happy when he assures an audition to join a big club. They hope that when he arrives in the city, his cousin will look after him. <br /> <br /> But the cousins ​​are like lime and cheese: one is a naive farm boy, the other is a street fisher who succeeds in mixing. with drug dealers and gang members. Mat is unlikely to have a quiet evening before his big day. <br /> <br /> After missing out on his cousin George (Damien Robertson) on arrival in the city, Mat meets further difficulties when a young cyclist takes him for a ride in more ways than one. <br /> <br /> Toby Malone, probably better known for his work in the theater, puts a laudable performance as the bucolic teenager. There are signs of a low budget, but as with so many other low-budget films, there is more fun, seemingly more spontaneity and more charm than the average Hollywood group has to see.
