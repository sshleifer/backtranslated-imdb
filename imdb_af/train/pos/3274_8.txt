This is one of three 80 movies I can think of and unfortunately overlooked. One of them was Clownhouse directed by Victor Salva, a movie that is terribly overlooked for Salva's legal / sexual problems. Another would be big Cameron's Closet, which is somewhat underestimated - not as bad as the reviews I have seen. Paper House is worth your time and I think it is one of those very quiet movies that will stay in your brain for much longer than you might think. I mean, 10 years after I saw it and I give it a little while, while something I saw six months ago went into the ether.
