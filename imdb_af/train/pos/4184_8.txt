Some war movies succeed where others are, and it can be judged from different angles. The humanistic angle, one where you can feel the raw emotions (the terror of being under attack, the companionship of soldiers, the difficult trials people see in them when they are in battle, etc.) Are always movies I find forcing. Movies like Das Boot and A Midnight Clear are just two examples of movies you connect with the characters in the movie. <br /> <br /> This movie also succeeds on that level. It speaks of "The Supreme Honor" and the honor does the right thing. These 23 soldiers did the right thing, they had honor and it is recognized in a way that is totally incompatible with Western thought, but it is ultimately a true story of honor. Unforgettable movie. Based on the true story.
