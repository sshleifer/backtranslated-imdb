The film revolves around a man who believes all forms of media are outdated. The idea behind his art project is to unmask the ridiculous culture with which we are bathed. Of course, the movie takes place in Los Angeles / Orange County. He attacks the scene (caw, caw, caw), rock bands, models, Hollywood movies, and touches on many other mediums. Eventually, he finds himself in the sights of the weapon he has put into operation. The film is five years old and every day it becomes more true. This is the best description of the post-punk anger I've ever seen. This is also one of my top 10 favorite movies.
