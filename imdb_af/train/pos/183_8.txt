Beautiful comedy with Marian Davies (with the lovely William Haines). Young Peggy arrives in Hollywood looking for stars. Cameo performances show "all the stars in MGM's heaven" in the famous commissioner, plus many vintage filmmaking details for the scholar. Pic also catches up with Davies's well-known, sarcastic, sarcastic impersonations of the best stars of the day (Swanson is a beauty!). <br /> <br /> "Peggy," picks herself up while meeting the famous star Marian. Davies at tennis shows her nose and comment, "Oh, I don't like her!" <br /> <br /> My printing was perfect. Story, direction, acting an authentic charm and a must for all quiet afficinados.
