It is always satisfactory when a detective picks up a case and the criminal is brought to the book. In this case, the climax gives me even more pleasure. To see the smuggling out of Abigail Mitchell's face when she realized her victim, she testified a death testimony. It has no doubt that her debt is very satisfactory. <br /> <br /> Please understand: while admiring Rut Gordon's admiration performance, her character really * really * irritates me. She is selfish and demanding. She gets her own way through a cunning 'little girl' act that causes an embarrassment in a woman of her age. Worse, she now set her up as judge, jury and officer against her dead cousin's husband. <br /> <br /> When Columbo gets too close, she tries to evade him by manipulating him to an off-the-cuff speech to a high-class ladies audience. He made the tables perfect by delivering a very warm and human speech about the reality of the police work. <br /> <br /> Nothing can distract Columbo from the pursuit of justice. Abby's final appeal of his good nature is rejected because he has too much self-respect for not doing his job well. Here's a situation you can't scare off of Mitchell!
