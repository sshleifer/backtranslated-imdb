Some movies you just know you will love from the first few seconds. This is one of those movies. This is a good example of Modern Film Noir in the 90's. These are the roots back to Double Dissipation, and The Postman Always Rings Twice. Nick Cage plays the main character of his "happiness" caught in a man-woman murder plot - and his happiness goes from worse to worse, even worse as he tries to get away from the people, town, violence and threat of Red Rock West. Many turns and turns, good performances by Cage, Hopper and Walsh, a hypnotic move-guitar musical background, and seamless directing makes it a real joy. Favorite Line: When Kage looks at the empty gas meter in the climb, she shakes his head and says, "F *** in a story of my life."
