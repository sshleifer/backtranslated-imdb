Director Douglas Sirk is counting here again, the grandmother of all dysfunctional family films. This lush, trashy saga is a masterpiece that combines all elements of Sirk's sleepers and places them strategically in one movie. "Written on the Wind" obviously influenced the 1980s TV series "Dallas" and "Dynasty" as it is basically a feature-length version of that later night soap. <br /> <br /> Lauren Bacall, wonderful and subtle, plays Lucy Moore, a New York City secretary who marries oil baron, Kyle Hadley (Robert Stack). Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson) is also unknown to the quiet but sexy secretary. They all go back to the home of Kyle's family in Texas, where we meet his white rubbish bin Marylee (Dorothy Malone in an Oscar winner). Yipee! The sparks start flying - from romance to cat camps, it's a camping tour. Not only must Mitch fight the feelings he has for his best friend's wife, but Marylee tries to sleep with everyone because she can't have her one true love that Mitch is. Kyle learns this impossible, but Lucy ends up pregnant. <br /> <br /> It's pure soap and pure melodramatic entertainment. How can you not love it? This movie signals one of Universal's most popular films and one of director Sirk's best works. Some of the dialogue is absolutely hissing and visual metaphors are thrown in every way - the theme of the wind door is great. The role-play is wonderful, although Bacall is totally underutilized despite the fact that he receives the best bill behind Hudson. Stack's Oscar loss destroyed him. He regards it as his best performance and apparently no one was happy to lose. And he showed a fantastic performance as the whimpering alcoholic. What a beautiful movie! This film proves what I have been thinking for years - Sirk is the master of classic melodrama. Where's his Oscar? <br /> <br />
