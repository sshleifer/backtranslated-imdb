One day I accidentally stumbled across this movie on TV. It was broadcast in the middle of the day on a channel that is not exactly known for good movies. However, this one was nothing short of good. <br /> October / October Sky tells the true story of Homer Hickam, a boy inspired by the Sputnick launch to become a rocket scientist. He and his friends started to build rockets. His father is not happy about his boys' new hobby and rather wants to see him become a coal mine as he or she goes to college on a soccer bursary like his brother. <br /> <br /> The story is well written. . A bit too predictable, but it's OK because it doesn't focus too much on those parts of the story. This is important part, but where it is clear the inner action, the action between the characters is focused. The story is good. It has a few clicks, but that's right. It's based on the real event, so you can't just drop these cliches. The characters are really good. Where the story is on a descent, the characters are brought out and the action and quality of the movie are kept high. You know these characters and you get sympathy for them. They are well written and credible. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie. The styles and the 50s are thorough and the pictures are well composed and well lit. All this makes the movie's mood very good. <br /> <br /> The play is really good. Jake Gyllenhaal is performing well as Homer Hickam and Chris Cooper is good as John Hickam. As for the rest of the cast, they are also good. All in all, it's a pretty strong role. <br /> <br /> All in all, I'm glad I caught this movie. It was only after I saw it, I learned that it was based on real-life events. If I knew this when I saw it, it would probably be even more interesting. October Sky is a good and interesting movie. It's a movie I believe everyone can enjoy. It's kind of a good movie. Not bad at all!
