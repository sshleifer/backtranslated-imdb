I really enjoyed the performances of the lead. Emma Lung is courageous and interesting. The director developed performances where the characters are not one dimensional. A complex story with the change between periods. Also appreciate the underlying story of the unions that lose strength and the effect of a large employer closing in a small town. I disagree with the remark that the older man should be attractive. There are many relationships with older men and younger women - without the man looking good. Depth of character can appeal to the not so level. The film has a good look and the movies are good too.
