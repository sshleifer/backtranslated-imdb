It's a fine music with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers (Gershwin) and a beautiful Parisien atmosphere that gives the film a lot of charm, but in terms of a story. Well, it's not really there. Or at least not very well worked out. The play is also not so smooth by Caron. But I kept some of the dialogues, I kept the scene at the Signals, I enjoyed the character of Levant, the colors; and of course the dance, which is very beautiful. <br /> <br /> A 7.5 - 8 looks to me.
