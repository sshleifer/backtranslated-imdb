I only saw this movie in the 1980s and now in 2006 this movie is still one of the best movies I've ever seen! I would recommend someone to watch this movie. You won't be sorry. It was well behaved, so actually and never a dull moment. The acting is great and the place makes the movie look like you are there. From the beginning to the end, this movie is the type that makes you lose. The actress does an excellent job of portraying the girl who has survived this terrible plane crash in the Amazon and shows how she could survive in the Amazon alone. It's amazing that someone can survive under such conditions. That's why this movie is so attractive. The fact that it is a real story makes the movie even more interesting and to think that a young girl can survive this ordeal is overwhelming. I find this movie one that I can see over and over and one that I never get tired of. This is indeed a compliment, because I have hundreds of movies! I'd say it's probably my favorite movie and the best I've ever seen!
