It's great to see Shane Meadows already exert international influence - LES CONVOYEURS ATTENDANT shares many themes with a room for Romeo BRASS: the vague class identity above work, but far below the center, the unforgiving father, the deserted urban environment, the sense of adult failure, the scarcely hidden fascism that supports modern urban life. <br /> <br /> But if Meadows is an expert formalist, Mariage trades in images, and his cool compound, beautifully surreal, monochrome frames serve to divide the grim and rather pale subject, which, like pasture, feathers from high farce to tragedy within seconds. <br /> <br /> There are longue and cliches, but Poelvoorde is compulsive, an ordinary man with ordinary ambitions, whose efforts to realize them are dangerous; while individual pieces - the popcorn / pidgeon explosions; the best wedding series since death and death - succeeded in disrupting epiphany from despair.
