This is a wonderful and heartbreaking movie !! Ripstein's places are spectacular, extremely detailed and well-lit, the dialogue is extraordinary, García Márquez, no doubt about it. Fernando Luján and Marisa Paredes give us excellent performances as the colonel and his wife. <br /> <br /> You must see it !!!
