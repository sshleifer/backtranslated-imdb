I have read many negative reviews of this movie and finally got the chance to see it on DVD. To be honest, I really don't know what the problem is with that. <br /> <br /> It's a decent killer excitement, shown from various points of view, of an often-tolerated eccentric broadcast of potential killers / suspects. , including late-night, John Holmes. Please read the plot synopsis for the exact details of the movie's plot. I would like to add more to a review as a summary. <br /> <br /> Many reviewers went so far to give this movie their lowest rating due to violence, but I really don't see it. Many modern films were worse. Saving Private Ryan was ultimately more violent than this movie, which often relies on implied blood stains if the actual brutal killing (the murders portrayed in this movie were followed by lead pipes.) <br /> <br /> both halves of the movie - the first to show John Holmes as a hopeless cash-hungry drug addict, and the second half showing his team as a minor conspirator in a senseless massacre. The movie has an excellent play, though Dylan McDemorant looks more than a bit in his biker-esque persona and is a bad boy-personality. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was also fantastic - a fantastic mix of 70's B-side rock and dark pop, spread over a few hours in all the right places ala Boogie Nights.
