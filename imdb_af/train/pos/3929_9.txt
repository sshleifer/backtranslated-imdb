What a director's intuition can bring to material that just needs the right bat in the right direction. Young Mr. Lincoln is full of old-fashioned values ​​that are, in the background, at least better respected in spite of its two-dimensional depiction than one can see in the porch in the current cinema. What works so well as it does, in all its simplicity and grandeur, is that it is a truly great courtroom drama in the mind of a history lesson. <br /> <br /> We all know Abraham Lincoln as the 16th president who did the emancipation and after the Civil War was murdered. But as an advocate in his previous years, he was charismatic, funny at the most unexpected places, and a true gentleman. He is not a superhero who can do nothing wrong (it was Fonda's only fear of the part before he signed up), but a figure with possible errors that is surpassed by his innate goodness and right and wrong outlook. <br /> <br /> It is enough to say that John Ford is exceptional as a storyteller, almost without trying. Actually, it's a lie, he tries, but he makes it so effortless in the studio system; He worked in an independent manner while he was also happy at the same time. So he was very much released from his own concise practices in "editing in the camera" and didn't move it away from the story. It is this strength of conventional wisdom that somehow goes hand in hand with the material, like a sort of companion to the full-blooded Americans in 1939 as seen in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (just here it is the law and not politics). <br /> <br /> Fonda is fantastic in the lead - its first with Ford - and let's never leave Lincoln out of the show and extra boost in the shoes. Fonda's own personality, in a sense, as it would in Grapes of Revenge and My Darling Clementine, comes out in the character of Lincoln. However, it is unlikely that no one else is out of the time that he played: he is mature and wise, but has the suspicion of proving himself in the case of a complicated case he has killed. <br /> <br /> Only in small pieces, such as the final shot that Lincoln lays down with its monument, and a few small cases appear early in the big parade scene, it looks very dated. What the goals are with Young Lincoln, Ford and his crew were all played. It's not as hopeful as one can think, and it has a strong balance of humor and true pathos.
