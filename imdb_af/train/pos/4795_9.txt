When I hear a movie because it has no sex, violence, bad language, special effects, etc., b. detector goes off. Usually, a movie is like sentimental pigwashing pandas to people who don't want to surprise them, but to confirm the better they are for our people. So when David Lynch's RIGHT STORY began to get such reviews, I was worried, especially since I wasn't a fan of his other "uplifting" story, The Elephant Man. For all the beautiful images and the good acting in that movie, it was more interested to preach to us than to inspire us. <br /> <br /> I don't have to worry. The direct story is rather an honest movie than a saccharine. Most of this is due to the fact that Lynch and writers John Roach and Mary Sweeney tell it straight and simply for the most part. There are a few homilies by Straight that I could have done without, and the shots of grain being harvested are a little over-repeated, but it's just malicious. There is no heavy-handed message, no sentimental strings to push our emotions, and no condemnation to us and its characters. Instead, they depend on the story to build their own power, and so do, so against the final scene, we're really moving. <br /> <br /> Of course, Richard Farnsworth makes realism. He is really someone who seems to have lived a lot, but still perseveres, and besides those homilies, the desire he has to get with his brother doesn't seem too sentimental, because you can feel here as someone who also lived. long and too much to be long-suffering by anger. And he knows his time runs out, so he wants to make peace, not just with his brother but with his life. Sissy Spacek also does fine, unhindered work as Straight's daughter. And although I am a city and suburban boy, the Iowa and Wisconsin landscapes are beautifully shot, and I want to visit at least one day.
