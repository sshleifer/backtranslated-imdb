It's absolutely one of the best movies I've ever seen. It takes me on a toboggan run of emotions. I laugh and cry and become disgusting and happy and in love! All this in just over two hours! <br /> <br /> The actors are all brilliant! Of course, I must call the leading actor, Michael Nyquist. He does a remarkable job !! I also admire the actor who plays Tore, who plays this mentally challenged young man in such a convincing way! He reminded me of Leonardo di Caprios's movie in Gilbert Grape! And then there's the most beautiful song in the world: Gabriella's song. <br /> <br /> I recommend it to everyone to see and enjoy!
