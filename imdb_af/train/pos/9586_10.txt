The film really challenges your ideas about identity and society in which we live. It is well made and very powerful. The people in the film are honest and unveiled about the world that exists outside the normative ideological perspective. I believe it gives good insight into a subculture that shakes the ideas that the viewer of society has. It is sometimes shocking and more powerful as a result. Some parts were difficult to look at, as is most true, but it is not over. It's good the first time you look at it, but it's even better the second or third time. because you have had the opportunity to discuss your thoughts on the topics they discuss and challenge.
