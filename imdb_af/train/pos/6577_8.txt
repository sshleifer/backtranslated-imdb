With few exceptions, most of George Bernard Shaw's plays have virtually disappeared from the theater. Too bow, to talky seems to be the general verdict. This BBC version of one of Shaw's funniest plays does not refuse that verdict. It's definitely bow and talkie, but it's great too. And because of the quality of the British theater, it was perfectly thrown with actors who - with the exception of Helena Bonham Carter - probably never heard most of us. Carter is beautiful as the Bulgarian girl who hides the professional "chocolate soldier" (Pip Torrens) and later falls in love with him. One can doubt the particularly ridiculous interpretation of Sergius (Patrick Ryecart), the Bulgarian cavalry officer who led the enemy lines and succeeded only because the enemy had the wrong ammunition for his machine guns. The role, however, invites overworking and Ryekart is obviously told to hand over. The other players are later perfect. Carter as the self-dramatic Bulgarian "aristocrat" and Torrens as the Swiss soldier-of-fortune are of course at the center of the play and they are wonderful. Yes, "Arms and the Man" comes across as a filmed play. But you'll probably never see a Shaw movie that doesn't betray its origin. The plots are generally clever. But Shaw is all about dialogue. The action is minimal (even in St. Joan) and the sets are unimportant. Enjoy it for what it is.
