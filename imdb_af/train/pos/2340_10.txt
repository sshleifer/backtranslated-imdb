I immediately fell in love with "Pushing Daisies". This performance succeeds in putting a smile on my face with his wonderful storytelling, witty dialogue and great acting. But it is not all: it also keeps you to the end. The basic idea behind the show - To bring people back at once, with the end of the undead at a second - is interesting and can be later in the seasons. But the exciting murder case, the unique appearance of the show and the highly skilled narrator add to the experience. But "Pushing Daisies" is more than it's parts. It has a certain charm that I really enjoy and I look forward to entering the world of Ned and Chuck for a second season.
