I heard good things about this movie and was, you guessed it, a little disappointed. Reese Witherspoon is, as promised, surprisingly good, surprisingly confident, at a young age; really all the (small) throws are pretty solid, in their simple 50's american environment. The reason I did not rate this movie higher is mainly that it did not seem so real to the end as the older sister showed, and it made me a little out of the movie. Perhaps we are supposed to fill in the plot, or maybe the movie should be a bit longer. Maureen's character is pretty underdeveloped, I think. It is understandable that Dani (Reese W., the younger) is traumatized and angry, but why is her sister upset? Because she is a few years older? Didn't the end undermine the rest of the movie? The pacing of the movie makes it seem as if Maureen and Court have just met, when he is treated (warning: this scene is surprisingly brutal. It may seem a bit shocking. Well, it works!). It depends on what you want - if you want the girls' happy young love story, it looks like you're going to be surprised. Man in the moon is both beautiful and dreamy and a hard coming lifetime movie ?? a rather uncomfortable combination? I like the character of the court although I can see which girls are watching it. And I loved having the courage to hurt both the younger sister (most men wouldn't want the most movies) and be killed. <br /> <br /> 7/10 on my pretty hard graduation scale. For some reason I got Jason London on a tractor.
