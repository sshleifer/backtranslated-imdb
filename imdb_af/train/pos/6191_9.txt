It looks like Hal Hartley's movies are kind of hit or miss with most audiences. This movie will be no exception to the rule. Fay Grim acts as a successor to Hartley's "Henry Foole" from 1998. The focus is this time on Henry's ex-wife (played perfectly by affluent Parker Posey), who by CIA goons about Henry's unpublished book on all his shadow intercourse. In the meantime, Fay ended up on an odyssey dealing with international spies, etc. The film is slightly shifted in the second half. If you've been a fan of Hal Hartley in the past, it's one that can't be missed. For the beginner Hartley's first timer that first heard of his film production, you may want to see his previous movies before he has adopted this one (especially if you haven't seen Henry yet). I admired the camera work, which sometimes reminds me of some early Man Ray photography.
