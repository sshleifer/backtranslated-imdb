**** = A masterpiece to be recorded in the books and never forgotten <br /> <br /> *** 1/2 = A classic in time; just a must see <br /> <br /> *** = A solid, valuable, very entertaining piece <br /> ** 1/2 = A good movie, but there is a few uneven elements or noticeable errors <br /> <br /> ** = Can still be considered well in areas, but this work has serious problems or is limited by inevitable elements that are inevitably considered (e.g., genre) <br / > <br /> * 1/2 = Mostly a heap of nothing caused by lightweight moments. <br /> <br /> BOMB = Not of visible quality <br /> <br /> - California = *** <br /> <br /> - Unrated (for strong violent material, substantial sexuality and language) < br /> <br /> I hired this movie and expect you to have a face-blokbuster-quality celebration of Brad Pitt's face, but are fortunately surprised. and disappointed. It's really more of a drama, and very grim about it. I remember a few emotionally intense Duchovny voice remains. <br /> <br /> Pitt ever plays his exciting talent with the best sex. Who started out as a hopeless but harmless "white rubbish" man realized as a violent, disturbing alcoholic with a mess. During some of the last stages of the film I found it hard to keep watch - he was unpredictable and scary. It proves very good writing and acting. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is filled with bizarre, sensational scenes that let me hold no less than once, and I don't mean action scenes. I mean dialogue scenes that have been made so brilliant that I actually gained and sank on what I saw. It was like watching a rhino and a lion was sitting in a cage watching while killing each other. Again, I am very impressed with the scriptwriter (s); Whoever they are, has done the impossible: mixed oil and water. <br /> <br /> I also really enjoyed Juliette Lewis's performance. It is so rare that this talented young actress makes this appearance, that when she does, it is such a joy. Some of her moments in this movie brought me tears. I mean it. The emotions that this girl can make in your head are incredible, and I remember clearly being unclear several times. <br /> <br /> I almost feel I have been cheating on the quality workmanship that the filmmakers have shown, "KALIFORNIA" giving a *** rating. But the dark feelings it stirs are too strong and depressed to increase it. However, I believe everyone should see this movie. I really work.
