When I was six, I learned about a series of Los Campeones, and even though I was just a kid, I did everything I needed to convince my parents once a week 'The Champions' and' The Watch Avengers'. . I think it was the Golden Age of the English series ... (I already own the full cycle of "The Prisoner"!), But also a few years later with "The Tomorrow People", "The Worst Witch" ( just me, whether it's "Harry Potter" in the girl, of course, before as much as I want to be "The Campions" in Zone 1 or Zone 4, I'm also waiting for "Dr. Who" (pack the whole series) a set, uhm, maybe 300 DVDs, please, I couldn't spend any more, 8), "People of Tomorrow" and some other "low budget" but good stories available within my reachable areas. not all my family members, including my parents, who introduced me to these great stories ... I hope somebody can feel the appeal of this series and then sell them if I see them originally. in the same format I saw them, remember, Zone 1 or 4 is OK with my TV!
