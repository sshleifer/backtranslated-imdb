Having seen the movie last night, I was left with a sense of hopelessness that organizations are trying to tackle the problem that the film portrays. The extent of prostitution seems so great that it is difficult to see how it can be defeated without major government changes in Cambodia. <br /> <br /> Anyway, with the review. <br /> <br /> Though it's a bleak movie with an uncomfortable central relationship. It's a very compelling movie, and I even go as far as saying it was nice. The movie was well edited for the run and the performance by Thuy Nguyen was excellent. I also felt that Ron Livingston played a very difficult role. <br /> <br /> It would be nice to get a little more insight into the fact that Patrick feels he has to help Holly, but maybe the reason is simple. explain to Chris Penn's character. I won't explain it here - check out the movie. <br /> <br /> It's a good, thoughtful movie with obviously good intentions. I hope it gets a wide enough release to reach a decent size audience and get more support for the K-11 project.
