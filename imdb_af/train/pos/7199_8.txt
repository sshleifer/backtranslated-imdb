Playwright Sidney Bruhl (Michael Caine) had a series of flop games to a big hit. He received a play written by a student of his, Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve) who is fantastic. It's so good, Sidney says he'll kill for it. Will he? <br /> <br /> A thinking man's excitement. It was originally a play ... and it shows. It's mostly on one set and everyone is talking but I was never bored. It is very well written with lots of twists and a good working power. Caine is just as good as Bruhl - another of his great performances. Reeve is surprisingly good. I never thought of him as an actor, but he is really good at this role. Dyan Cannon does wonders with an underwritten role as Bruhls wife. Irene Worth is also good (and very funny) as Helga ten Drop, a psychic. However, her accent came to my nerves. Director Sidney Lumet does very well with his one set. The camera always moves and keeps your attention. <br /> <br /> EXTREME SPOILER DEAD AHEAD !!!!! My only complaint is that two gay characters in this movie are purely sociopaths, and it also contains one of the most unremarkable kisses I've ever seen - but these are light complaints. <br /> <br /> A very good thriller. Critics hate this movie (for some reason) and it seems to have disappeared completely since it continued in 1982. It's too bad - it gets better.
