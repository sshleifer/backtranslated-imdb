Spoilers Next: I picked up the book "Evil Angels" when it first came out and didn't know anything about it. Just to give the press and the Austrian people a break, I was quite far in before I started questioning the camera money. The author obviously planned the reader to understand why the public jumped on the conclusions they made. John Bryson told the story just as it did to the jurists (and picked up by the press) of the arterial syringe, the stage records, dr. James Cameron's assurance was that the scarf was cut with scissors, that a baby could not be taken out of her clothes, with the buttons still made up, bloody handshake, etc., very convincing. After all, it was experts in their field who testified without a clear reason to lie, and the fact that the evidence was completely wrong was not clear to me at all. It was also highly technical evidence, difficult for a layman to understand. So far, almost anyone who has never heard of a dingo attack has not been heard. People didn't believe it was possible. The public was suspicious of the Seventh-day Adventists, whose origins made them look like a cult, and all sorts of wild beliefs about them contributed to the appearance of guilt. Had it not been for dedicated, selfless lawyers who relentlessly worked to investigate and counteract the trial, it would not be enough to get Lindy out of jail. That book shook me for that reason and I have been reluctant to come to any conclusions from anyone's fault (except of course OJ). I was excited that a movie about the matter would be made and didn't think it could have been better done. I always loved Sam, with whom I could completely identify, and Meryl was perfect as always. Beautiful photography, ghostly music. I think it's not just a very good, but a very important movie. It didn't actually get publicity when it was released.
