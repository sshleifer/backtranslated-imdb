Made in 1946 and released in 1948, the wife and Shanghai were one of the great films that Welles made after returning from relative exile to make Citizen Kane. Dark, breeding and expressing early Cold War paranoia, this film is a long film-Noir crime film. The cinematography of this film is filled with Welles' distinctive features of odd angles, fast cuts, long pans and sinister lighting. The use of surrounding street music is a precursor to the incredibly long opening shot in the touch of evil, and the mysterious Chinese characters and the sequels in Chinatown can only be regarded as the inspiration, in many respects, on Roman Polanski's Chinatown. Unfortunately, it is Welles's obsession with technical film entertainment that hurts this movie as a whole. The story of this story is often lost behind a sometimes incomprehensible junk of movie techniques. <br /> <br /> But despite this criticism, the story combines with wonderful performances by Welles, Hayworth and especially Glenn Anders (Laughter) a joy to watch this movie. Orson Welles not only pulls off the Irish brogue, but the torn identities as the honest but dangerous sailor. Rita Hayworth, who was married to Welles at the time, breaks with her usual roles as a sex goddess and takes on a role of real depth and contradiction. Finally, Glenn Anders's strange and bizarre portrayal of Elsa's spouse's legal partner is nothing less than classic!
