I loved this mini-series. Tara Fitzgerald has done an incredible job depicting Helen Graham, a beautiful young woman hiding with her young son from a mysterious past. As an anglophile who loves romance ... this movie was just my cup of tea and I would recommend anyone who wanted to escape in the 1800's England for a few hours. I also have to mention that Toby Stephens, who portrays the very magnetic Gilbert Markham, is pretty enough to see this amazing production.
