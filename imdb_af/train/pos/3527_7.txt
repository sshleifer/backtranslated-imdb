Scott Henderson (Alan Curtis) meets a mysterywoman (Fay Helm) in a bar and invites her to see a show with him. She agrees that they don't exchange information about each other - not even names. Sometimes it's the best kind of dates. However, when he returns to his apartment, wait insp. Burgess (Thomas Gomez) and his team on him. Scott's wife was killed. His alibi is the mysterious woman, but no one can remember seeing her and as a result Scott is sentenced to die for the murder of his wife. His secretary Kansas (Ella Raines) is not convinced of his guilt and is determined to find the woman who can save him from the death penalty. <br /> <br /> It's a good movie and the viewer is 100% behind Kansas's efforts to get the truth. We follow her through some memorable scenes, such as her pursuit of Mac, the bartender (Andrew Tombes) at night and the claustrophobic place where Cliff takes the drummer (Elisha Cook Jr) to hang her out, drink and while dancing with his friends. It is such a blatant depiction of sexual desire that it is a striking part of the film, as everyone is intense and rhythmic for the duration of the scene. Ella Raines is good in the female lead and Thomas Gomez makes a nice policeman. Alan Curtis started well as the confused, innocent man, but as soon as he was arrested, his performance turned into a left-hand side, as he had no serious discomfort for Kansas. God knows why she was holding him. <br /> <br /> The movie doesn't tell you who the killer is, as we know about halfway through the movie, but it doesn't matter. In fact, it adds to the tension and dramatic development of the story, because we will find Kansas out and then hell! It's a good movie with some great scenes, but although Elisha Cook Jr has a memorable role, I never keep him in anything I see him ... someone gives me a neck tie .....
