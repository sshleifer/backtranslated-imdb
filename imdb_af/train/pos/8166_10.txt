This movie is great! The acting is good, with the excellent death of Corbin Bernsen as the perfectionist dentist freaking out and torturing his patients. In the beginning he saw his wife at the pool man, and then he became mad. He also takes revenge on his wife and the pool man, except the patients he tortures. The most special effects are also beautiful, although some are actually nests (such as a boring tongue lying outside for one night and still red in the morning). But the torture scenes were done absolutely well. Although this movie has the weak point, it is very slow; between the heavy parts are sometimes only extremely boring parts. But for the real horror / thriller fan it's a must-see!
