Just a few comments before me do not know the facts of this case. It is based on real events, a highly-published disappearance and murder case in the Wilmington, DE / Philadelphia PA region from '96 to 2000. I must admit that I was very skeptical about how Hollywood would dramatize real-life events and events and was actually very impressed with how close they have been to being constantly reported on local newsletters and Philadelphia Inquirer news stories throughout the period. Of course, I immediately pointed out that the actress (which I really like in Cold Case) that played Fahey didn't look like her (Anne Marie was actually nicer). I have to admit that Mark Harmon has really stumbled upon the type of personality that was revealed as Capano's and the behavior Capano exhibited during this period. Details of the case were right ... no deviations from dramatic effect ... even up to the carpet, gun, furniture and cooler. In conclusion, I would also like to add that I have met Tom Carper many times (a good man, despite a politician) and I am so glad that he has drawn the strings into the federal empire needed to commit this abominable crime to solve. Churches like Capano are actually and it was great to see him finally sitting behind bars.
