Despite excellent trailers for Vanilla Sky, I expected to be disappointed by the movie because I heard it didn't get good reviews. However, I completely touched the cinema on how good Vanilla Sky is. <br /> <br /> There wasn't a bad role in the whole movie, every character is credible. The romantic moments between Cruise's character, David Aames and Cruz's character, Sophia, are slow-realistic and intimate (probably because they were a real-life couple). <br /> <br /> The plot of Vanilla Sky will confuse you in the last third of the movie and there is very little chance you will guess the end. However, the end is tied to the end, with a strange mix of feelings consisting of sadness, shock and empathy for David Aames. <br /> <br /> The movie is intellectual and you need to pay attention throughout. It's not that hard, because chances are you'll be completely in the movie and will not see one second off the screen. <br /> <br /> I usually leave theaters watching everything about the movie. But Vanilla Sky is still asleep in my mind after watching it. I recommend it to anyone who wants a change from simple, flat films.
