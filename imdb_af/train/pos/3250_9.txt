Another for the Babes & Bullets crowd. The story is much more elaborate than any other music I've seen: cannons hid the females from the females and each one generatively puts it in another way that comes closer to intelligent comments than we would expect for the venue. More effective than contemporary 'drama'. It is difficult to identify with a woman who abandons a gun on her pants. Pretty remarkable if you consider the context. <br /> <br /> Despite the canon that produces the 90% of surprises, this film also chronicles how greed replaces all other considerations in the lives of a group of yakuzas pursuing a woman holding her leg " a hidden cannon / rocket launcher (thus no group stop scenes or tongues). The hidden projectile launcher withdrawn from the back of the protagonists, apparently from nowhere in Miike's Dead or Alive (1999), The torch passed through the heroine at the end of the original Tomie (2000), or the disturbing flame - Throwing scene in Sunny Gets Blue (1992), everyone bears witness to an almost third world Cantinflas esquire <br /> <br /> You won't see good quality movies of this essence in Hollywood, that's all but extinct and with cheap shit they pump out for a cheap excitement, everything is laughing. It's a real movie and while it's big, the end is a brilliant or non-blatant rip-off of some Sergio Leon photos, which include guns where bones should be and are definitely appropriate!
