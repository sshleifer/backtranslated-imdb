I saw this movie on the Hallmark Channel and thought it was great, especially since it was based on a real man. Pierce Brosnan was very good as the lonely English man who adopted the persona of the half-grass Gray Owl. Photography was beautiful. <br /> <br /> This movie has inspired me to explore this character, Archie Belaney, simply known as Gray Owl. I want to read as much as I can about him. When I didn't know Richard Attenborough did it. But I'm not surprised. I like all his movies whether he is acting or directing. I gave it the highest score. However, I would have liked to see more in the movie, why he adopted this person, because it only showed the two aunts who raised him and his room in their home. <br /> <br /> You can't go wrong with this movie if you are like me and enjoy a beautiful story without hearing dirty language and giving special effects every few minutes.
