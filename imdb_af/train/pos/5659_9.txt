AG was an excellent representation of drama, excitement and excitement that is so scarce for American TV. Sheriff Lucas gave many spectators the magicians. We have rooted for Caleb as he strives to resist the transfer of Sheriff Lucas. We realized and became terrified to learn the unthinkable connection between these two characters. The manipulations that caused weekly to fear what Lucas would do next were truly surprising. This show lived up to the "Gothic" moniker in ways American entertainment so rarely attempted, much less mastered. The packages definitely made a big mistake not to support this show. This show puts the shame on current "reality" shows, which are so less than satisfactory. The call for a DVD set is well-founded. This performance is a quality sight for a demanding market that is hungry for quality viewing. A public audience that overheats intelligent hypocritical staff will welcome this jewel of real storytelling. Bring the DVD set!
