It is one of Jackie's best films that have him without opera friends Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao. It has one of the best openings in any action movie and it carries with Jackie high-quality stunts in such a way. The only criticism is that in the middle it gets a little slow, but for the last 25 minutes it seems in the film and show the end credits that a crazy fool is chan to keep our movie addicts happy.
