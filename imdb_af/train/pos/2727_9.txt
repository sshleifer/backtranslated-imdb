One of the best real crime movies ever made and very true to Truman Capote's book, which invented the true crime novel genre. Haunting Quincy Jones musical score and great acting by Scott Wilson and Robert Blake as the killers and Perry. Why didn't Wilson become a big star after this movie is a mystery to me. <br /> <br /> In addition, the black and white film and editing in this movie is. The re-design of the murders is frightening and since it leaves the real murders to your imagination, even more frightening than they have shown the shotgun. The film was filmed in the actual Clutter House which was sold to another person after the killings. The film had a lot of documentary feelings - besides the scenes at the actual Clutter House, other scenes were filmed at the petrol stations and shops where the killers actually went. Nancy Clutter's beloved horse, Babe, is even in the movie. Will Geer has a great turn as the prosecutor in the short trial scene not only filmed in the actual courtroom, but has several of the real Clutter murderers who portray themselves as the jury for the movie. <br /> <br /> It's a solid movie, scary every time you see it.
