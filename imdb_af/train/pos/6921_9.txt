Keep in mind I'm a fan of the genre, but first saw this movie for the first time. How I have overlooked it all the time is a miracle to me. For me this is a better movie than the high price "High Noon" praised. It's a wonderful western with excellent acting and a good story. The DVD is in beautiful black and white with excellent cinematography. If you like Westerns or James Stewart, this movie shouldn't be missed.
