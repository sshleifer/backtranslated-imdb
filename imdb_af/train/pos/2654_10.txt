Everyone should see this movie completely! It's freaking scary, but don't mean you can make a "jump-out-of-just-to-surprise-you-and-pass-it-off-as-scary" stuff. It's really great. See this freaking awesome movie !!! The director is Stanley Kubrick, easily the greatest director who ever lived. Every single one of his films is masterpieces, including this one. The Shining is about this family who goes to the Colorado Rockies, as ward overseers, and gets snow. Well, the house is ghost. The child is psychic. The man is easily influenced by evil ghost hotels, and ... well ... HILARITY SHOULD! Not really. It becomes this gripping thriller where things are thrown at the viewer from all the different directions, and it gets scary. Not just the classic, here's the Johnny scene. It's unforgettable, but can't talk to the whole movie. It's one of those things where words don't explain it adequately, and you just have to see it. So go on Netflix and get it! GEEEEEETTTTTTTT ITTTTTTTT !!!!!!!
