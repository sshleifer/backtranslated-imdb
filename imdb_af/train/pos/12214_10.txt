This low-budget digital video film has strong points in the right places - writing and acting. In addition, digital photography is the best of fate so far. In low light conditions, the characteristic video is umberton, but surprisingly, it is against film stock for brightness, brightness and saturation in brightly lit situations. These are grass roots that make the best of a funny dialogue with a "Midnight Cowboy" kind of story about gagglers doing everything to survive in urban San Francisco.
