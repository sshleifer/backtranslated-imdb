I was probably one of the few Australians who didn't watch the tennis when this series was broadcast. I must say when William McInnes first appeared, this is one crappy actor! But when the series continued, he showed his performance and I loved him completely. He was such a rotten guy, but he made me laugh. I watched the show to see Hugo Speers (Hart and Bene, The Full Monty) and Tom Long (SeaChange, Two Hands). It was interesting to see Speers playing a nice, quiet man and even more interesting to see Tom Longs cricket muscles! Sug ... Seriously, Long's performance was a total shock and very brilliant. He stole the show. Martin Sacks was also good in a small role, and the leading actress delivered an entertaining performance. I would recommend this program if you enjoy stories with a twist and watch Tom Long walk with no shirt on ...
