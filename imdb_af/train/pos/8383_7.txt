Robot Jox is trying hard, but basically is a series of battle scenes that are bumped together - robot against robot, man against man, man against woman. The point of departure was potential, but the screenplay didn't seem to be the few more concepts it needed. Yet it was pretty good for a science fiction action movie. Part of it was because the writing was by Joe Haldeman. For those who are not known by the name, Haldeman writes the award-winning science fiction novel "The Forever War." It is considered one of the very best powered combat weapons novels, along with Robert Heinlein's "Starship Troopers" and John Steakley's "Armor." And this movie is really more like a giant powered weapon film, rather than giant robots. It is closer to what fans would have wanted instead of the transvestist Paul Verhoeven's "Starship Troopers", which is just a similarity to the novel it was based on. <br /> <br /> Despite some assumptions, it really isn't. It's not based on Homer's "Iliad". A few names are all they have in common. Achilles deflated with his robot's foot, had no parallel in the Iliad, which did not include the death of Achilles. The ancient Achilles were not a noble warrior either. He was the most powerful, but also friendly and small. Even the robotic jack killed in the first scene does not fit. He called Hercules, while the Greek Iliat would have had Hercules. <br /> <br /> The effects were pretty good for the time and budget. True, it wasn't comparable to Terminator 2 a year later, but that movie costs ten times as much. The stop motion was almost as good as the robotic walkers in "The Empire Strikes Back" and "Return of the Jedi." Better than a lot of Ray Harryhausen animated, highly rated but fairly dated animation. <br /> <br /> Don't bring high expectations into it and you'll probably not be disappointed. It's better than a lot of other low-budget flicks and even some big-budget solid wannabes that have better effects, but much worse scripts.
