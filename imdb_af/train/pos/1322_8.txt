What a fascinating movie. Even if it was not based on real life, Verboed Lies was a fascinating portrait of an artist in her element. And this is the kind of film psychology that students can study to learn about the doctrines. <br /> <br /> The author of Forbidden Love, Norma, has been revealed as a fraud in the media, but this move really gives her enough opportunity. to clean her name. <br /> <br /> But the scripts and turns she's taken by the documentary author are incredible. What a patient woman! I loved this movie. I didn't read the book, but only heard good reviews and saw it on a boring rain afternoon. The journey that this movie is undergoing is clever, interesting and completely staggering.
