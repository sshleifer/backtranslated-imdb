This movie looks on the surface to be a run-of-the-mill children's movie that parents can see with the most entertaining. The movie looks and is mostly aimed at children, but it doesn't stop at this level. I first watched this movie as a young child and found it funny, entertaining and heart-warming and didn't see it for a few years. I recently watched it again at the age of 18 and found it to be almost as funny but just as heart-warming and entertaining. This movie is highly understated and contains many messages of real life. This movie is an inspiring search story that is made even more epic in children. I recommend this movie to anyone of any age.
