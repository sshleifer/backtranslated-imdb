A very well-made film set in the early '60s communist Yugoslavia. The five young actors who are teenagers in the middle of the story, give strong, sincere and emotional deep performances. A clear portrayal of how the natural confidence and na√Øve inherent to teenagers can be easily manipulated and how it affects the rest of their lives. Highly recommended.
