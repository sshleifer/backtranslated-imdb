It is a wonderful movie about a brothel in a fishing village, best described with theater constellations and direction of the old Kurosawa's works, combined with Dostoyevski's topics of human psychology (O-shin - Sonia Marmeladova), Shakespeare's drama and Hans Christian Andersen tragically and cheerfully. The screenplay is wonderful, the scenes are color and beautiful screens really keep in mind. The plot is interesting and unpredictable - each of the characters is very well developed and interesting. There is also some action, so if you don't like all the sentiments, you'll also come to your expense. It's not about mysterious Geishas and proud Samurai, with their Bushido throwing them all out, but about life, work, and people everywhere. A lovely and fascinating tribute to Kurosawa, well worth seeing.
