You spend most of this two-hour film wondering: "What's the main character story?" <br /> <br /> Will Smith, as a low key "Ben Thomas", will guess you. The last 20-25 minutes is when you find out, and it's a shocker .... but you knew something would be dramatically revealed. Until then, Smith plays it mysteriously, almost stalking people. You know he has a good reason to do this, but it has never really been explained, to let us guess until the end. <br /> <br /> All this, including an on, again with Rosario Dawkins ("Emily Posa") may frustrate or want some viewers to stop this movie ..... but not because the final long segment Collect all the pieces of this puzzle. <br /> <br /> It's a two-hour movie and not the typical action-packed Macho Will Smith movie. In fact, the most shocking aspect can see the drawn, sad face of Smith throughout the story. It almost doesn't even look like him in a number of shots. He seems to have lost weight and is sick. Smith does a beautiful job depicting a man who is very sad. <br /> <br /> As a good movie will often do, this movie will make you think of credits for a long time.
