"The man in the white suit" is another feather in the eye of the expert Scottish director Alexander Mackendrick (Whiskey Galore!, Sweet Smell of Success). The star of the film is Alec Guinness (whose comedies include Kind Hearts and Coronets and The Lavender Hill Mob). Guiness brings his regular class to the film, making it much more than a typical comedy. <br /> <br /> In fact, the comedy isn't quite open. By the end of the picture, it's almost a complete drama. It's the kind of Ealing studio comedy that isn't calculated to produce laughter, but a sense of general entertainment, such as the best British comedy of the time. <br /> <br /> The whole idea of ​​the suit is not very original. but the way it is executed. The film is highly original and is recommended for any fan of Guiness or Britsh comedy. <br /> <br /> 7.6 out of 10
