A very good war film that sees the effects of the war on a hometown son who loses his eyes on Guadalcanal and has to come home and adapt himself with the help of family and friends. An excellent movie from the actor helps make this movie very entertaining. Eleanor Parker's role as the girl was worth an Oscar nomination. She has such innocence in her movie. Ann Doran's role was as satisfactory as all her little supporting roles. I especially like the hometown aura of the pre-war Phildelphia. The hunting grounds are very good. Of course, the war image on Guadalcanal really showed the horror that our soldiers faced during this epic battle. A well-deserved movie and one that should not be forgotten
