"Dangerous Criminal" is the story of an apparently anti-social girl, and how did she become so. It is based on a true story, and although I was annoyed by the one-note depiction, that is, ever, of the title character and the difficult dedication of her lawyer, I am forced to accept that life is art. imitate art, and that there are people out there. <br /> <br /> The movie succeeds me, because even though the title character's attitude is almost to the end, one is gradually moved to sympathy for her, as the movie shows her has reached its present state - which is self-destructive rather than anti-social. <br /> <br /> Surely a moving movie that will bring a lump in your throat when you think about it. It will often be. Despite its many flaws (it's hard to watch, sometimes due to bodily functions and suicide attempts), it's another production I'm proud to call Canadians.
