Away, back in the 1980s, long before NAFTA was set up and corporations began to cast their national identities, the United States and Japan were at each other's throat in the world manufacturing races. Remember words like "Union Yes!" "The Japanese are taking over this country," and "Americans are lazy?" As the Reagan era came down and put corporations on a global market, director Ron Howard made one of several voyages in the comedy genre with his 1986 smash 'Gung Ho', which accounts for over $ 36 million in US cash. received. While dated in many ways, Howard's tongue-in-cheek story of conflicting workplace cultures still provides a hard truth to industrial life. <br /> <br /> 'Gung Ho' focuses on Hunt Stevenson (Michael Keaton), the automakers union rep of Hadleyville, a small, depressing city in the foothills of Pennsylvania. Stevenson was asked to visit the Assan Motor Company in Tokyo (similar to the real Toyota), who is considering a US operation in the town's empty factory. With hundreds of residents from work and town gathering, Assan decides to move in and Stevenson is appointed as a liaison between company officials and assembly line workers. <br /> <br /> The 112 minutes of 'Gung Ho' is a humorous look at these two sides, considering their strengths and weaknesses: on the one hand, an American labor force that guarantees its traditions, but often caught in the madness of pride and trade unionism; On the other hand, Japanese workers who are extremely committed to their work but do not yet have personal satisfaction and self-esteem feelings. In Stevenson, we find a US working class figure of average intelligence with the skills to talk to people through misunderstandings. With the survival of his workers' work and most of Hadleyville on the line, Stevenson proves to be a nice man who wants nothing more than a fair chance, though his smartness will make him fall into trouble. Apart from Assan's heads, we are witnessing a delicate balance between Stevenson and his fellow members, many of whom have been raised. These include Buster (George Wendt), Willie (John Turturro) and Paul (Clint Howard, Ron's brother). <br /> <br /> The Japanese film is led by Gedde Watanabe, also known as' Sixteen Candles' and 'Volunteers. "Watanabe plays Kazihiro, the plant manager who falls on his luck and begins to feel American life. He is constantly shaken by Saito (Sab Shimono), the cousin of Assan's chief executive who is desperate to get his place in the pick order Although it is a light touch, these characters go out very well to convey ideas of Japanese work culture. <br /> <br /> With Hunt Stevenson dominating the script, Michael Keaton should give a good performance for this movie "Gung Ho" is indeed a slam-dunk success for Keaton, who also played with Ron Howard in 1994's "The Paper." He made this film during a series of lighter roles that Mr. Ma, 'Beetle Juice' and 'The Dream Team' before being in 'Batman', 'One Good Cop' and 'My Life.' It is also difficult not to keep out Gedde Watanabe's performance as the strange man, who first bears Japanese shame before he joins Stevenson to make the car unit a coherent unit. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast is top notch, including Wendt, Turturro, Shimono, and Soh Yamamura as Assam CEO Sakamoto, Mimi Rogers provides a romantic interest as Audrey, Hunt's friend Edwin Blum, Lowell Ganz, and Babaloo Mandel worked together for Gung Ho's solid writing, the coincidental music, which received a BMI Film Music Award, was composed by Thomas Newman and Gung Ho's soundtrack songs are wall-to-wall 80s, including Do Not Get Me Wrong ',' Tuff Enuff 'and' Working Class Man '. <br /> <br /> The success of' Gung Ho 'actually led to a brief TV show on ABC, while more than impressive as a social comment 20 years ago, Ron Howard's film still has its comic value, which is available on DVD a s part of the Paramount Widescreen Collection and has changed a bit short. Audio options are provided in English 5.1 surround, English Dolby surround, and French 'dubbing', but subtitles are in English only. There are no extras, not even the theater trailer. On the positive side, Paramount's digital transfer is pretty good, with little grain for opening credits and high quality audio. While some extras would have been useful - especially that 'Gung Ho' was a success in the box - there is little to complain about the film presentation itself. <br /> <br /> *** out 4
