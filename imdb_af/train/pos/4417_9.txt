This film is a lyrical and romantic memo telling the eyes of an eleven-year-old boy living in a rural Cuban town the year of the Castro revolution. It is a clear, truly worthy work of love. <br /> <br /> The names CUBA LIBRE and CUBAN BLOOD are just trying to market it as an action movie. DREAM OF JULIA makes much more sense. It has more in common with the European film than with RAMBO and the revolution is simply an inconvenience to people's daily life and pursuit. The fact alone makes the film more honest than most of the works in this period in Cuban history. <br /> <br /> The excessive use of the voice over narrator undermines the story, but the film makes it unqualified from Hollywood movies that can say much more visually than the narrator. <br /> <br /> Comparisons with CINEMA PARADISO and fair if the film does not become melancholy about movies, but there is an underlying pain in losing a lifestyle that surpasses lost love. <br /> <br /> The revolution, like the film JULY, never seems to end.
