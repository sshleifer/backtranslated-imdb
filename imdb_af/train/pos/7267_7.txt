Curly Sue is a 6-year-old with an abundance of hair and a life as a drift. She and her father, Bill (Jim Belushi), are trying to survive on the streets by being small time consultants. In Chicago, Bill decides to jump into a beautiful car park in front of a car while Curly will shout over the lawsuits and traction for the intended victim. It's as if he is a very exciting lawyer called Gray (Kelly Lynch) who is shocked at what she did. Not only do the scammers make money, they get to Gray's beautiful apartment the night. Even then, Gray felt that she owed them more, so the three of them were hanging out for a game. Gray only knows the lucrative legal business and nothing about life. Who better to teach her than Bill and Krullerig, those knowledgeable experts about the reality of life? But all good things must come to an end and there is no life for a legal expert and a few men. Or is there? It's a lovely and funny movie about the unexpected. Curly is definitely as entertaining as Shirley Temple, but of course, a lot of edder. Belushi gives a rare recommendation as it is on his luck and Lynch is light as the sneaky but soft contact attorney. John Hughes, writer and director, shows us his magical touch, as the writing is alive and unpredictable. Just watch Curly and Bill take Gray out for a night, without money and see the humorous results. Do you long for happy ends, long promised and eventually delivered, with a few uncertain moments in between? It's your made-up movie.
