John Thaw, of Morse Inspector fame, plays old Tom Oakley in this movie. Tom lives in a small English village during 1939 and early World War II. A bit of a boost, Tom has not recovered from the death of his wife and son while serving in World War I. If you can imagine your inspector Morse, old and retired, twice as angry as when he was a policeman, then you have Tom Oakley's character. <br /> <br /> But this heart of flint is melting. London children are evacuated from the flash beforehand. Young William (Willie) Beech is photographed with the protesting Tom. Willie is played by Nick Robinson. <br /> <br /> This boy needs care with a capital C. Behind the school, still watering the bed and not reading, is the smallest of its problems. He comes from a terrible background in London, with a mother who can't handle it, to put it mildly. <br /> <br /> Slowly, but still, man and son get warm. Tom again discovers his ability to love and care. And the boy learns to accept this love and care. See Tom and Willie at the end of their garden a bomb shelter. See Willie's joy about what is probably Tom's first birthday party. <br /> <br /> Not to end, but Willie is taken over by Tom and the couple are beginning a new life. for their mutual love. <br /> <br /> In this movie, Thaw and Robinson follow a long series of movies where one meets and develops a common love. See late Dirk Bogarde and Jon Whiteley in "Spanish Gardener". Or Clark Gable and Carlo Angeletti in "It Started in Naples". Or Robert Ulrich and Kenny Vadas in "Captains Courageous". Or Mel Gibson and Nick Stahl in "Man Without a Face". <br /> <br /> Two points of interest. This is the only appearance of Thaw I know of where he sings. Only a verse of praise, New Jerusalem, but he sings. <br /> <br /> Secondly, Robinson is also in a second movie entitled "Tom" in the title, Tom's Midnight Garden, on a classic children's book.
