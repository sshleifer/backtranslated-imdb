This movie was a classic. I would have to say that this movie caught the best of a working man learning about his mistakes. if we could all find and learn how everyone in this movie did. It has played an important role in showing how family is an important part of life and how proud it can cause you to lose something important in life if we cannot find a "GREAT THROAT" and that it is sulfur is proud.
