Who would have suggested - Hal Hartley draws a cinematic conclusion to Syria while retaining his signature-idiosyncratic style. The merger is very entertaining. <br /> <br /> Having not seen a Hal Hartley movie for about a decade, I approached this one with caution. His brilliant productions of the nineties impressed critics and audiences with their unique style and dialogue. The director's earlier films had colorful characters and presented meticulous observations of life - often in the Long Island, New York or New York City regions themselves. It was insignificant and informative. <br /> <br /> My first warning comes from the description of this movie as a "spy thriller". To my pleasant surprise, Hartley succeeds in capturing his well-established style and focusing on producing a highly original drama of international intrigue. It works in more ways than one might think. Hartley's film maintains the dialogue and character focus of its brands, along with a single cinematic style. <br /> <br /> Given the current situation in the world and the war condition promoted by dark elements on all sides, it is extremely suitable. Hartley has brought all his skills to something new - a political film worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as Syria. Surely he comes in his own. The cast has a good job of interpreting Hartley's vision and style. Fans of Parker Posey will see her in full bloom, still with us and more ripe and beautiful than before.
