Nothing is more pleasing to me than a thin or tense story that keeps you guessing how the whole thing will end. And that's exactly what happens in DEATHTRAP, based on a cold play by Ira Levin ('Rosemary's Baby'). <br /> <br /> And in that, Michael Celine and Christopher Revee get the kind of stunt that Caine and Laurence Olivier have moved into SLEUTH - with as much skill and as many puzzles as ever in that extraordinarily clever play. <br /> <br /> But because it's meant to scare you, surprise you and keep you guessing In terms of outcome, it's hard to write a plot review. Let's just say that what we know in the beginning is everything you need to know about the movie for the present. MICHAEL CAINE is a bad jealous playwright whose latest game failed. When a young aspiring writer CHRISTOPHER REEVE sends him the manuscript of his plays to him, Caine realizes he will pass it as his own will solve all his problems and get his reputation back. <br /> <br /> From then on, it's a fun and fun thing for the audience, as Ira evokes Levin's story while comforting Agatha Christie for the number of twists. <br /> <br /> Caine and Reeve play brilliantly each other, each bringing a certain dynamic tension to the story as well as some humorous attacks coming from a script that works out drama with humor. <br /> <br /> Summary: Well worth seeing - but not everyone is happy with the end.
