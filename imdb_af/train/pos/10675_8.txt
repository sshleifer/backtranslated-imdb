I wanted to watch this movie for a long time, a fan of both Peter Cushing and David McCallum. I agree that the romantic part-plot was a waste of time, but McCallum's talent shines through this young role. Thanks for Turner Classic who broadcast the show last week. I can imagine that after the war there were many problems with children, especially with the way things were throughout the 1950s. Some of the boys are scary. I would definitely not want to meet them on a well-lit street, much less a dark one. There were also good insights about the feelings of a firefighter, or as they call a firefly.
