As usual, Hollywood stereotype everyone in the movie. But this one is a classic - from the upright white-collar to the Russian woman! Well done. Even facial expressions were wonderful! Language was perfect (even in Russian language) and Nicole did a wonderful job !! Hey guys - you get what you pay for :)
