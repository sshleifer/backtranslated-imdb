I watched this movie after watching Capote and Infamous. It's just amazing how homosexual relationships between author and protagonists in the movie are being sublimated. The reporter is straight, the lead players are more beatniks than gay. <br /> <br /> The movie starts slowly, but if we review it a second time, we get all sorts of interesting information from comparisons created by author / director Brooks. . <br /> <br /> Notice the incredible cut at the beginning where murderers and killed people are linked. Sniper on the phone is linked to Perry over the phone. The cutter that was his face was cut when Perry was his face. Just Perry looks in the mirror and sees his erotic male body imagining that he is playing a guitar in Las Vegas to play empty chairs. This failure / fantasy is consistent with the failure-fantasy that Perry tells us about his father who just built a beautiful motel in Alaska to find it forever empty. <br /> <br /> Dick talks about shooting pheasants and the fact that the pheasants I don't know they are going to die. We cut to the Clutters. <br /> <br /> Perry talks about his dream of a yellow bird, "longer than Jesus," attacking the nuns who have persecuted them. "The nuns are pleading for mercy," he told us, "but the bird slaughtered them anyway." The bird lifts Perry to paradise. Oddly, Perry says he has a dislike of nuns, god and religion. It echoes later in his last words when he wants to apologize, but does not know who. <br /> <br /> The director puts in all sorts of en-forms. <br /> <br /> Nancy Cutter gets an offer to sleep at a friend's house. She holds a horse. Perry will comment later on a photo of her and the house. Nancy can't sleep with her friend's house, because her boyfriend is coming over for dinner. The decision sealed her fate. <br /> <br /> Perry talks about Bogart in "Treasure of Sierra Madre". But it's another Bogart picture, "Beat the Devil" co-written by Truman Capote, where a fiction treasure hunt is McGuffin. But Dick knows that the protagonists of that movie ended up with nothing. Dick wants the hard cash, the $ 10,000 he thinks is in the Safe Box, which seems to be ironic as a fantasy like Perry's Mexican Treasure. <br /> <br /> Cut into Herb Clutter and sign a $ 40,000 life insurance policy. He is currently thinking about deaths. Ironically, his deaths will end in a few hours. The insurance agent on behalf of the company wishes him a long life, again ironic when we know what will happen in a few hours. <br /> <br /> Dick said they didn't want any witnesses, no one would remember them. Later, it is because they have eliminated all the witnesses. one witness, "the detective Dick later told. But it was the witness of the prison friend, Dick, Perry, Truman Capote or God? The viewer becomes the witness after watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Fascinating film.
