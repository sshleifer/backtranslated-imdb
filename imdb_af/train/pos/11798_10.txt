I saw this movie literally more than 100 times ... it's absolutely jam-entertaining with entertainment !!! Power Boothe gives a star performance. As a fan of actors such as William Shatner (Impulse, 1974) and Ron Liebmann (Up The Academy, 1981) I never thought an actor could capture the intensity of Shatner and Liebmann in those roles until I was Boothe as Jim Jones seen. ! As for me, Powers Boothe is Jim Jones ... this movie captures its best performance !!!
