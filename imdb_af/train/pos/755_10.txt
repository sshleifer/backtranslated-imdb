Dirty Sanchez is the more extreme British version of Jackass in which the four boys (Pritchard, Dainton, Joycey and Pancho) are greatly hurt and humiliated. The reason why this show is better than Jackass is because most stunts are not planned, which makes the reaction much more funny. There are 3 series of shows, the first they follow and look at their lives, eg. There is an episode about their love life, work, etc. The second series sends the boys to try out different careers. The third follows their European tour. The boys seem to be risking more and more as the show progresses. In my opinion, the third series is the best, but trust me when I say, if you have a stomach for a week, DO NOT WATCH, because you are light to see a fair amount of blood in each episode.
