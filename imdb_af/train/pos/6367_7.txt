While there are no talking animals, great cute song production numbers or villas with half white / half black hair ... it has one thing ... realistic people who normally act in a strange circumstance and Walt & Roy have in their eras with the studio. If you thought "The Castaways" or "The Island At the Top of the World" was not identical, or you hold them to a higher authority than Atlantis, then your idealism is just as well-groomed as having your kids until midnight to keep. watch a friggin 'cartoon.
