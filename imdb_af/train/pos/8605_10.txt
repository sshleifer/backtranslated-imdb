Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy star in this "modern" music game that shows MacDonald's comic skills. Surreal 40's musical seems to be fun from 40s fashions, even as they were in current fashion. Eye-catching costumes and sets (yes B&W) add to the surreal, dream-like quality of the entire film. Several good songs entertain the movie, with the "Twinkle in Your Eye" number a highlight, including a fun jitterbug number between MacDonald and Binnie Barnes. Also in the big cast are Edward Everett Horton, Regin Owen, Mona Maris, Douglas Dumbrille and Anne Jeffreys. Also in extensive parts are Esther Dale, Almira Sessions, Grace Hayle, Gertrude Hoffman, Rafaela Ottiano, Odette Myrtile, Cecil Cunningham and many others. <br /> <br /> Very nice to see the wonderful MacDonald. in her jitterbug / vamp routines. She can do it all.
