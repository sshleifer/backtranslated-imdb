This is a good adaptation of Austen's novel. Good, but not brilliant. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is inventive, sometimes crossing the border to gimmickry, but it definitely prevents the snare from making it look like a boring TV soap in costumes, as the whole story is dialogue driven. <br /> <br /> The acting is competent. Ms Paltrow is apostate, as her character requires, but the required distance from the other characters is accompanied by a much less appropriate detachment from her own actions. In other words, it doesn't seem to care enough about the results of her games. Some of the supporting role players are guilty of overworking - much in the style that is appreciated on stage, but out of place in movies. Personally, I had trouble accepting Alan Cumming as Mr. Elton - without his own fault, except leaving such an impression as a gay trolley dolly in "The High Life," it's now difficult to accept him playing any serious role. Acting honors go to Toni Collette who radiates the warmth, and Jeremy Northam puts his character at just the right level.
