I saw this film on Turner yesterday, and I couldn't stop watching until it was over, although I can guess what would happen. Farrell was great in her role, and everyone did a great job. Some of them stretched the boundaries, but I love it all! If you get the chance to see it, please do! I actually cried a few scenes, but then I think if you're a mother you want. Loretta is beautiful, and I was just amazed at the idea that they were uncomfortable moms there, before his time. I say, see it if you can, and don't listen to criticism. As they say, I laughed, I cried! I enjoyed it a lot!
