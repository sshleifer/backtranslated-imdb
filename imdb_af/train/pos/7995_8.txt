Here's a malignant, bad guys revenge story with relentless and rough Denzel Washington. He is three personalities here: a thin-and-low-key-now-drunk former mercenary, then a loving father-type person to a little girl and then a cruel maniac on the loose-looking answers and revenge. <br /> <br /> The story is about Washington hired to be a bodyguard for a small American girl living in Mexico, where kidnapping of children occurs regularly (at least according to the film.) He joins the child tied up, which the child played very well. actress of our day, Dakota Fanning. When Fanning is kidnapped in front of him, Washington goes to the men who are responsible and nobody saves. Beware: this movie is not for the sick. <br /> <br /> It's a stylish movie-making, which is good and bad. I liked it, but a number of people found it too frenetic for their taste as the camera work is one that can give you headaches. I thought it fit the tense story and was fascinating to see, but it wasn't (the shaky camera) for all tastes. <br /> <br /> In addition to the two stars, there is the always interesting Christopher Walken, in an uncharacteristically low key role and a number of other fine actors. <br /> <br /> The movie pander to the basic emotions in all of us, but it works.
