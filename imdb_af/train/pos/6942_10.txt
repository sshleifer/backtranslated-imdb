In the fifties, the age restrictions for films in Brazil were as follows: no limit, 10 years old, 14 years old and 18 years old. Usually, the westerners were ten years old, when they had a little more violence, they would go to 14, but it was scarce that a western younger than 18 years could see. Winchester 73 was one of those, and I think it explains very well how this movie looks different from the average. The hero, James Stewart, fought his own brother who killed their father. He was looking for revenge and was fairly traumatized, far from the average good guy. Anthony Mann tried to change variations on this type of character in the following films he did with Stewart. Shelley Winters, the front lady was far from virtuous, she followed the man who stayed with the gun. Then Duryea as Waco Johnnie Dean is one of those great villains who will always be remembered. The story of the film, which always follows the man who stays with the gun, is one of the best suited for a western. It had to be made in a Fritz Lang movie that didn't come through. When offered to Mann, he made a point of starting again and taking nothing prepared for Lang. With Winchester, Mann created another view of Western, but still retained all his traditions. Winchester is still a good movie to see again and again, but nothing will be comparable to the impression it made to those who saw it when it was originally released.
