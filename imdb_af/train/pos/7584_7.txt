This PM Entertainment production is sown with enough bullets to let John Woo say, "Enough already!" Of course, it's not nearly as nice as Woo can do, but it gets the exploiting work in 90 minutes. Eric Phillips (Don Wilson) is a sub-captain in the near future. When his wife is framed for killing the Governor by a team using a blue cyborg, it's up to Eric to clear her name. Wilson gets Van Damme's duty when he plays the heroic hero and his evil cyborg doppelganger. Why the Academy didn't notice is outside me. To be a PM production, there are tons of motor yachts, explosive cars (4 in the first 5 minutes!) And shoot outs. I especially like the truck turning in midair before it even comes close to an explosive truck. My other favorite bit had a neighborhood girlfriend to complete her karate in Don's simulator. It's just a chance to show some cheap LAWNMOWER MAN effects around 1995.
