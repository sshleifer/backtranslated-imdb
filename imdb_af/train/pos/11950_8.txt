I went into this movie and didn't know anything about it and finally enjoyed it. It had no authenticity and credibility. Some of the things the characters said and did were completely bizarre, and many of the writing seemed to be ad-libbed (perhaps it is typical of Woody Allen? Excuse my ignorance), but the whole audience In the theater lay so hard. It wasn't even the jokes in the movie, but on the whole movie itself. The actor reminded me of Seinfeld's play, where he didn't try to laugh at his own jokes. They are lean, but if you don't take the movie too seriously, you can't really appreciate the humor of the ACTORS, not the FEATURES. If you are looking for a random movie and you want Woody Allen, I definitely recommend it!
