I don't care if you want my comment or no, but I think you're writing that the movie is not good. You're so obsessed with Hollywood's movies that you can't see how good it is. movie I'm not a fan of Jay Chou, but I like his play and not just his ... and maybe you don't think there is a big point in the idea and maybe you don't think so interesting, but look deep there is more than action in the movies more than love and passion and tears there is more than the US in the world and that is good :) really good. And it costs a lot to do that. Please do not criticize the actors who cause the directors to not know how hard they work to be happy in this hour and a half to thank them, thank you :)
