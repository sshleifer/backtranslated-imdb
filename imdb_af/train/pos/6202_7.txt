When I started looking at Fay Grim, I had no idea that it was a sequel to "Henry Fool". Now, the latter was not a movie I intended to have a successor. But one has arrived, and it's pretty good. I suppose you saw the original, so I won't explain it. This one starts with Fay (Parker Posey) who stayed with her son, the one she had with the murder, Henry (Thomas Jay Ryan). Simon (James Urbaniak) is still in prison. One day the boy was suspended to bring a pornographic toy to school. But this is no ordinary toy. It has a secret that explains a lot of what happened in the first movie. And this secret goes deeper into geopolitics than "Syria". <br /> <br /> I must say I'm pretty impressed with what Hal Hartley has achieved here. Perhaps this one does not reach the original's quality, but it certainly takes a good look at what's going on in the world. And the end opens the possibility for another sequel. <br /> <br /> Also with Jeff Goldblum.
