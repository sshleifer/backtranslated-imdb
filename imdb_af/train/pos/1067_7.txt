Like a lot of pilots, Dark Angel's opener shows a mixture of great potential and a slight problem to find his own feet. Not that it is unusual in any way, but there is a feeling that it could have worked better if the story grew and focused a little more. In today's world where something needs to be caught up or canceled immediately, the series has done itself a bit deceptively by not being half-focused, with all the guns burning. <br /> <br /> The ninety-minute pilot really feels like two deductions glued together, and both episodes have a problem with focus. In the first half we are introduced to Max and filled in on what drives her. We also get some interesting routines with Max using her ability to win, to communicate with a PI, or to sort out employees' domestic issues. The problem here is that it's nothing out of the ordinary for anyone with a normal set of genes, on television or otherwise. <br /> <br /> This is when we hit the second half, we get a story with a goal and focus. During the two halves, Max finds herself attracted to a pirate journalist who feels it is a mission to save the world by exposing one dirty trader at a time. In the second half, the consequences get him up, and Max prevents the resulting mess. It sets the point for the rest of the series, and it works, but it doesn't really click if you get my meaning. It's like most of the pieces are there, but a couple making a full picture is left out. Perhaps they are filled with later episodes, but that is next to the point. The fact is that the contents of this episode could easily tell with twenty-eight less minutes. <br /> <br /> The last of the negative is that many of the support opportunities are completely unchanged. Original Cindy in particular is a nuisance, and I doubt the following twenty episodes have changed. While the acting is not as bad as daily soap, it is not such a thing that I will command. Jessica Alba is not the worst actor in the world, but is briefly convincing when the story needs it the least. <br /> <br /> The good news is that the starting point and the production values ​​are all. of top quality. In fact, this series was considered to be reasonably expensive to produce, and it is rather unfortunate that it was canceled to be replaced by another show that did not endure a whole season. Especially if there was enough time for both shows, they could have simply canceled one of the pieces of careless rubbish that they had flown under the banner of reality TV. The fact is that we need more programs like Dark Angel, where imagination rather than overhyping is used to draw attention. <br /> <br /> In all, I gave the Dark Angel pilot seven out of ten. It never rises above the level of disposable television, and it never had a chance to live up to the potential it shows within its own running time. But the potential is there, and it's often all that matters to pilots.
