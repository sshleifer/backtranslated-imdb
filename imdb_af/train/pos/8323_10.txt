Some nonsense is nurtured by wise men from time to time. "<br /> <br /> If you're too smart to watch this movie, you're too smart to be alive. <br /> <br /> Wonderful skirt, great point of departure, period piece with a keen eye for detail. <br /> <br /> Walter Matthau, Meg Ryan, Tim Robbins - et al - just great! <br /> <br /> Rent it, sit down, relax, take it in, smile a little. Enjoy yourself. <br /> <br /> Then, thank you.
