WOW! <br /> <br /> This movie is the best living will, I think, of what happened on 9-11-01 in NYC, compared to anything shown by the big media outlets. <br /> <br /> Those stores can only show you what happened on the outside. This movie shows you what happened on the inside. <br /> <br /> It starts with a focus on a burning New York firefighter waiting weeks for the first big fire he will be called to fight. The subject suddenly comes with the ONLY EXISTING PHOTO OF THE FIRST PLANS TO HIT THE TOWERS. Then you get a front seat while firemen rush to the scene in the Tower One lobby. <br /> <br /> In the minutes that precede the second plane crash, and Tornet's next fall, you see firemen responding to the disturbing noise of people above the headquarters. It's a face you won't soon forget. <br /> <br /> Heartbreaking, tearful and very compelling from the first minute to the last, "9/11" deserves to go down in history as one of the best documentaries ever made. <br /> <br /> We should never forget. <br /> <br />
