It's nice to see a movie with real people with honest feelings. Sissy Spacek is as absolutely convincing as a simple yet daughter of Robert Farnsworth, <br /> <br /> who will eventually show off in his last role how a good actor he was. It's hard to believe it's a David Lynch movie. It is slow and equally, sweet and moving. One of the best, unless you like car hunting, sex scenes and violence.
