What can you say if you see a good French movie trying to draw an exciting story in line with the social background of the characters? The key point is that we believe in those characters and as soon as they meet, we want them to stay together. It's simple and really effective. The background story is less important. Why is the screenplay on the side of a half-developed thriller? It doesn't help to hold on to those social demonstrations that most French filmmakers would like to make. Not too much ambition, right: Sur mes l√®vres is just an entertaining French film with good characterization. <br /> <br /> For all the smart noir points in the script, the end is too much. It's as easy as in the back window (a clear reference and certainly not a noir movie), but with a less compelling context. Where I am surprised is to see that the character of the probation officer has not been erased. He brings very little to the story; when he appears alone, we wonder if we haven't missed a part yet. Jacques Audiard is not yet a newcomer. Strange and strange.
