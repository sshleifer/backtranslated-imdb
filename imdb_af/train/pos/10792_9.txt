Good performance, very entertaining. Good march art that acts. Good story plot. The entire main staff did a good job of Robert Urich, Chuck, Norris, Jennifer Tung, and especially a big hand to Judson Mills. A special tribute to Robert Urich, in his last days. WONDERFUL! actor who will really be missed.
