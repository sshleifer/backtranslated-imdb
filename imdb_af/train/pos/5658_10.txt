It was one of the best programs ever made for TV. Full of mystery and plot and twists and turns. Compulsive display. I was fortunate to have seen it in the UK. They may have ordered the episode incorrectly, I can't remember, but it was at least every time at a regular time. My girlfriend and I hacked off the trailer, and none of us is usually a big fan of the American range. <br /> <br /> After the pilot we knew it was something special. We missed a few episodes, and it made you sad and angry for a week that missed this fun. <br /> <br /> Great decisive, great acting. Gary Cole was absolutely brilliant, even better than his role as Custer. Lucas Black made a wonderful performance for a child, and Paige Turco was also at her best since the Party of Five. And Nick Searcy of course, if the Sheriff's long suffering, sidekick. <br /> <br /> Yes, there were some confusing and confusing bits that I suspected would be explained later, and that would undoubtedly be in a later series. . It made the end poor, and you could tell they killed it. Did we go WHAT? Why did they do it with one of the best shows ever? Shoot the exec.
