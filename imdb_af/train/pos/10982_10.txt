I found that Gray Garden's is a gripping movie, an incredible intimate <br /> <br /> look at eccentric ones that basically have the right idea: forget <br /> <br /> the community and live in a towed house with no heating and large <br/> cats and cakes, rather their own interests <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ Save. <br /> <br /> Big Edie and Little Edie are the two crazies the Mazles Bros. <br /> <br /> chosen to document. They look like characters from a <br /> <br /> Fellini movie, just a stranger, if that makes sense. Old Edie is almost full of beds, a stack of paper, clothes and dirty dishes. <br /> <br /> Growing her. Little Edie is even more interesting. She <br /> <br /> performs at home, always wearing a baby shawl <br /> <br /> headscarf around her head, covering her hair completely. We <br /> <br /> never see her hair throughout the movie, and we never get a tip <br /> <br /> that she still has a lot. At the age of fifty-eight, she is still beautiful and full of life. <br /> <br /> In Gray Gardens we feel that both of these women's <br /> <br /> lives have become much less than they once were. Small <br /> <br /> Edie is probably the grief of the two. While her mother was married in her previous years, made a family, lived luxury and <br /> <br /> even made some recordings (the scene she sang about 77, <br/> <br Together with a recording of Tea for Two that she has made these days, <br /> <br /> is one of the best plays of the film, Edie has her promotional career as a <br /> <br /> model to take care of her sick mother. At 58 she still wanted to <br /> <br /> her prince's charm. As something, Little Edie is another girl, <br /> <br /> full of dreams of glory and fame, and of domestic and romantic <br /> <br /> congratulations, yet to be fulfilled. <br /> <br /> Highlights of the movie include the opening moments, where Little < br /> <br /> Edie explains her outfit to the camera, the "tea for two" series, <br /> <br /> the birthday party, the climax argument, the grocery delivery <br /> <br /> scene, and the scene on the attic, the whole thing is incredible /> <br /> Honest and rude. And it's becoming more and more memorable, because it's all really. <br /> <br /> I suggest that Gray Gardens see rugby with the Kenneth. <br /> <br /> Anger short Puce Moment. The Criterion DVD is $ 35.00, but this is worth <br /> <br /> every penny.
