Quite simply, the best reality show ever made. The first two seasons (the only thing that matters) are at Hulu. I challenge someone to watch the first three episodes of season 1 and not like it. I guarantee you will watch the season. Then I assure you will see the season 2. <br /> <br /> Other quick reasons to see it: 1. Anderson Cooper is hilarious 2. The places in Europe are fantastic 3. The games are mentally challenging 4. It's very interactive 5. Responding to one episode a player on another player's desperate, "I try as hard as I can!" with an equally desperate, "Not necessarily." <br /> <br /> Can you find out ... Who is the Mole?
