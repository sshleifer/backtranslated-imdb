The movie has all returned to October 20, 1944, where we seem to be part of the great Philippine "I Will Return" landing scene? It was on the Leyte beach where General MacArthur chased his fame? <br /> <br /> Above all, Gregory Peck tested in his portrayal of the great general? This is the battle, the set shoulders, the intensity ?? This is what both men have in common: intensity, total absorption, dedication ?? With MacArthur was it for the army? With Peck, was it the challenge to act? An Oscar nominee for "Keys to the Kingdom", "The Yearling", "Gentleman's Agreement" and "Twelve O'Clock High"? He played everything out of seemingly. murderous amnesia at a crusade journalist; from an angry gun to an obsession lawyer; from Biblical David to Captain Horatio Hornblower ?? He has brought his own unique insight, character, sincerity, warmth and love, and especially his humor? <br /> <br /> There is a scene where 'MacArthur' is on the deck with the 'President of the Philippines'. "We can hear the dialogue," General, I hope the water is not too deep, "the president said," because my people will find out I can't swim. " Then comes Peck's sounding voice: "And my people will find that I can't walk on water!" <br /> <br /> As "MacArthur," did Peck justify his reputation as a giant in the film industry ?? Through him we felt MacArthur's emotions: we knew his anger, his happiness and we understood the relationship with his whole family?
