A surprisingly good movie! It has quite a few good jokes throughout the movie. The only negative thing is that some scenes go to the extreme to show how stupid the two main characters are. We get it, stupid blonde, go ahead with it! <br /> <br /> The plot just barely dodges is called "corny". And boobies are always a plus, though for some strange reasons the movie doesn't play much with the card, even the plot line introduces two black-haired women who act as the malicious part of our two blondes. <br /> <br /> All in all, a good movie to watch. I almost gave it an 8/10, but let's not go mad.
