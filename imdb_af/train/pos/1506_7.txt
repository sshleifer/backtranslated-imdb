Before movies like 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre', 'Suspiria' and 'Halloween' changed the look of horror forever, there was a more gothic and much less violent era in the genre. Films such as the Hammer Horror series and 'Rosemary's Baby' were scary and excited audiences in the 60's and early 70's. I can't tell you how many times I've rented this movie during my childhood, but I did because there was something about it. I didn't want to limit myself to the movie and zombie movies of the 70's and 80's, and movies like this production of the well-known but unfortunately long-time Amicus movie company was a good start. <br /> <br /> Benefits: A grand, honest music score. Strong performances of a star cast. Brilliant cinematography. Very good old-fashioned excitement and chills, especially in the first and last vignette. Some ghostly moments and images. Move at a slow but slow pace The house is one spooky, repressive home. Great production design and decoration, which gives the film a true old Gothic horror feel. Depends more on mood and bloodless cold fever than on gore and unnecessary nudity for his tension. <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: Some pacing issues in the first half. Apart from the 'Cloak', the rest of the stories feel like they've been done before. Clich√©s large. The second story, 'Waxworks,' is fine acting and it is moments, but is the worst of the four in terms of fear and tension. The low budget sometimes shows. <br /> <br /> Final thoughts: After watching this movie for the first time in many years, I can see why I rented it so often. It's not a masterpiece in any way, but it is a good example of a time when horror movies were made with style and class. Look at this one with the lights off. <br /> <br /> My rating: 3.5 / 5
