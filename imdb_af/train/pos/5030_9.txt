Something surprised me about this movie - it was actually original. It wasn't the same old recycled shit that came out of Hollywood every month. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie on video because I didn't even know it before I saw it at my local video store. If you see this movie available - rent it - you won't regret it. The voltage builds throughout and the rotating end is excellent. <br /> <br />
