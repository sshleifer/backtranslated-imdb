You have to see it to believe it! Directors Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield have done a very good thing, it's a 10 out of 10, so I can't believe other users of this web have seen it so badly unless they expected just a normal movie see, with people, love scenes, and so on. I am also convinced that these types of documentaries are a great way to wake us up to save our beautiful planet. Finally, it has nothing to do with Al Gore's documentary film "An Uncomfortable Truth" that is not always accurate from long monologues, painful and with "truths", as many scientists have already indicated. <br /> <br /> The best thing you can do on earth is not to miss the Earth.
