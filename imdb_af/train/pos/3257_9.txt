I only saw this movie on television for the second time. It is beautiful, warm, sentimental, very romantic. I have rarely seen actors who can reveal better through their movements and gestures of love for another -Cybill Shepherd, Ryan O'Neal, Robert Downey, Jr. and especially Mary Stuart Masterson surprised themselves. Masterson probably has the most difficult role and is just rich. <br /> <br /> The film is in the early years of both romantic movies like While You Sleep, Then Harry With Sally, Sleepless In Seattle and the "High Gimmick" movies like Big, Back to the Future, Peggy Sue married. I hate to say, because this movie was great and I will never change one of them - but I think it did not succeed, as well as the above movies because the cash appeal of the cast was just not that great as Meg Ryan, Tom Hanks, Michael J. Fox and Kathleen Turner when the film was made. <br /> <br /> It is not well written - eg. The characters' lines are not particularly memorable. Yet it is perfectly executed. <br /> <br /> The romantic longing is truly tangible, the feeling of people falling in love is communicated perfectly, love's timelessness and all-encompassing cattle, the sense of loss and desire to regain that connection are so touching. delivered. Again and again you will move yourself. Actually, a comparable movie is Made in Heaven - the same romantic longing. <br /> <br /> See it - it's great.
