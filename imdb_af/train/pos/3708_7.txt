An attorney is drawn into a deadly game of cat and mouse as he engages in a femme fatale in this adaptation of a Grisham novel. Altman creates an exciting, gothic atmosphere, but the writing is weak. Branagh is convincing as the lawyer, and Davidtz is tempting as the object of his desire. Downey is like a private detective. Duvall has a small role, which does not allow him to do much with his strange character. Hannah and Berenger played the impressive role. After an interesting set-up, the film fell down and didn't really give his first promise, but Altman was always worth a look.
