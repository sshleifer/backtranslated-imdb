Laureen Bacall reveals in her autobiography that Bogie told her that she shouldn't make such fake movies like this one or something. At the time, Douglas Sirk was labeled "WOMEN'S WOMEN", actually he was recovered in favor of At least in Europe, after stopping. And when he was writing on the wind, Sirk only had three movies to make: "Angels," a time to love and a time to die, "his masterpiece, IMHO, and finally," Imitation of life "(1960). Then there was silence. Actually, Bacall and Hudson have no interest in Sirk. They are too straight, too virtuous. Dorothy Malone - a kind of replacement for his former German star Zarah Leander - and her brother Robert Stack give the plot the greatest. A plot constantly built up. Most of the movie is a long flashback. The instability of the brother and sister, of a family of rich, Texan oil owners, is brought to the fore by fiery clothes and routine motors in the derricks. landscape. Malone's metamorphosis at the end of the movie is stunning: pack and chignon, toys with a small triad: she is ready for life, the rebel is tamed. Now alone, because she lost Hudson (but anyway, he wasn't in love with her). This end is a little reactionary, but melodrama is excellently reactionary, three years later, in an imitation of life, Sarah-Jane (Susan Kohner) will be accused of not knowing her place.
