Although time has revealed some of the consequences, this story of love and adventure is still exceptional. <br /> <br /> If you've never seen this movie, you'll be shocked by how much stolen by later filmmakers. I watched it with a friend who was amazed at how much Disney's Aladdin got out of the movie. They loved the movie and enjoyed it being such a touchstone for so many other movies and filmmakers. <br /> <br /> I gave the movie an 8 out of 10 instead of a 10 out of 10, which is where a good part of this movie lives, because in the last 15 minutes the movie falls apart the pacing. Everything is rushed as if suddenly they have to come to an end. From the point of departure of the jinn to the end, it seems more sketchy and then finished with painting. It doesn't kill the movie, but it weakens it. <br /> <br /> Still looking for everyone who loves a good fairy tale or even a good movie.
