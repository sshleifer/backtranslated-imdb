The story of a drifter, his sheep farmer and the boss's daughter is not for all tastes, but it is still very interesting. It takes place in the beautiful country of New Zealand, under the beauty we have come to know so well through other films of this region. <br /> <br /> This movie was the first time I saw the excellent Mary. Regan, and since then I've been a fan of her. The movie also features Bruno Lawrence, who is probably best remembered by American audiences from the movie "Smash Palace". Terence Cooper takes the turn as the owner of the farm who pays too much of the wrong kind of attention to his daughter (Regan). <br /> <br /> Sharp action, with unforgettable performances by all its leaders. For the first time I saw this movie in extremely edited form on late night television here in America, but believe me the unexpected version should not be missed.
