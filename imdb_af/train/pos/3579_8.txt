The Stone Boy is an almost forgotten drama from the 1980s. Considering how many well-known or soon-known people are in the film, one wonders how this could be overlooked. It is a slow, moody, but touch of a tragedy that has taken place. The film is more or less a charge of Midwestern stoic values ​​and suppression of emotion. The movie won't be for every taste, but anyone who appreciates the right human drama will do it. <br /> <br /> In the early moments of the film we see two brothers in the early hours choosing a few peas and maybe shooting a duck or two if they are happy. As he climbs through a barbed wire, the rifle is accidentally unloaded and the younger boy kills his older brother deadly. These boys apparently never took a hunter safety course. The way two men go with a gun through a fence as well will be as follows: The first man climbs through. The second man then gives him the gun through the fence. The first man then puts the gun down and helps the other through the fence. In any case, the man must have his hands on both the gun and the fence. <br /> <br /> Anyway, when his brother died, the 12-year-old Arnold falls into his own world. He didn't even run for help after his brother was shot. He simply goes on and picks the peas and later tells his family about the accident. At no time during the funeral or investigation, Arnold seems to be somewhat sorry or sad. His family seemed to avoid him. Maybe they're even angry with him to kill his brother. An Ornery uncle who played Frederick Forrest is extremely upset with Arnold, although the older brother's death allows him to hit the child's girlfriend. Arnold's parents don't seem to understand how to deal with their son. They really didn't even try to talk to him. About the only person he can communicate with is his grandfather who is played in typical grandfather skill by Wilford Brimley. After a while Arnold even moves in with the old timer. <br /> <br /> Nothing seems like Arnold opens before he takes a bizarre road trip to Reno Nevada to seek his uncle's ex-wife inexplicably. After meeting her, he started coming out of his shell after she apologized for breaking her marriage by starting all the family's unrest with the accident. From here, the film is a quick study of reconciliation and reconciliation. <br /> <br /> In most cases, the play has been removed ghostly. Robert Duvall and Glenn Close make the perfect stoic farm parents. Forrest is good, but may be trying too hard to channel Paul Newman's performance in Hudson. The cinematography is also exceptional. If you like moody photos about ordinary people, this one can be for you. Some may even be advised to bring some tissues. 8 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> The Hound.
