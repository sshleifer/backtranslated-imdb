Why can't directors make horror movies like "The Shining" these days? There is an easy answer: contemporary directors are not Stanley Kubrick. Kubrick once proved with this movie that he is truly one of the greatest directors and authors. <br /> <br /> So, the plot is pretty simple. A man named Jack Torrance (played brilliantly by Jack Nicholson) and his family moving into a large, secluded hotel to watch over the season. The kicker is that the former caretaker of the hotel brutally murdered his wife and two girls. Then the title of the movie follows most, but you have to see it to see what I mean. <br /> <br /> It's the first movie in a very long time to hit me as "scary". These are a few things that are very well-wasted, but in a good way. One of the things that adds to the frightening factor is the wonderful music. Music is a big part of Kubrick's movies (2001: A Space Oddysey and A Clockwork Orange, just to name a few) and he certainly does not disappoint with this one. The score shows the tone and this movie won't be the same. <br /> <br /> Finally, I should comment on Nicholson's legendary performance. Jack is terribly convincing as a crazy killer. In fact, only his stare steals a few scenes from this movie. It is top-notch acting that has to be seen to believe. <br /> <br /> There will never be a horror movie that fits this one. TEAR. Stanley.
