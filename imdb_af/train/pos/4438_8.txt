Director Edward Montagne does in a little over an hour that others, more expensive and filmed films fail. Mr. Montagne shows us a police story written by Phillip H. Reisman Jr., while not one of the best of the genre, it keeps the viewer involved in everything. <br /> <br /> This is clearly a B-type movie. In fact, the best thing for "The Tattooed Stranger" is the opportunity to take a look at the way New York looked at those years. The crystal clear cinematography by William O. Steiner has also been held over the years, or is lovingly restored. <br /> <br /> There are fantastic views of New York in the opening sequence. Later we are taken to Brooklyn to the Dumbo section and later the film travels to the Bronx and Gun Hill Road area with its many monument stores in the area. <br /> <br /> John Miles and Walter Kinsella have a good detective team. Patricia Barry is perfect as the plant expert of the Museum of Natural History. Jack, who has gone to great things in his career, is seen in a non-speaking role. <br /> <br /> It was nice to see a city, as it was, because it no longer exists.
