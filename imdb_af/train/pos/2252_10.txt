Henry Hathaway was daring, as well as enthusiastic, for his love for the people of the early days of American history. However, to criticize critical historical inaccuracies of his film about Brigham Young and the Mormon, it is not necessary or useful to comment on this film. In my opinion, Hathaway gave excellent guidance to a Mormon people in the early history of the Church of Jesus Christ of the Last Day Saints in the period beginning with the martyrdom of Joseph Smith until the date of the release of the film. In often subtle filming and dialogue, he covered Mormon's philosophies and teachings in many segments and scenes. <br /> <br /> Remember to watch this movie very early on in the early 1950s during my youth. It was just over 10 years after the movies were released and before the Los Angeles Temple was completed, which I watched to be built and wondered more about who Mormons was. I recently bought this movie and will enjoy the following messages Hathaway has portrayed in his film. <br /> <br /> 1. Love for all people, regardless of their personal beliefs. 2. Charity for the needy or not. 3. Family is important. 4. Listen with sincere and careful, because even conflicting messages have important points to consider and adopt. 5. Work hard, both individually and in the community. 6. Prepare and store for future days. 7. Hope is a binding link to a higher being and to our daily life. 8. And that there is a unique quality for any group, and appreciate those identified as beneficial.
