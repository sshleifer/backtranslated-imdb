I like the silence of the first part, the play of Pacino and Cusak, especially their scenes together. The state of mind of the environment and the opposite of the old pole and the idealistic youth were bringing about. I wish Bridget Fonda had more scenes in the movie; She was a serious and attractive character. The movie went out of my way when the assistant mayor started sniffing the mafioso to get to the bottom of something his boss clearly didn't want him to meet. No one in their right mind would have a mafioso on an abandoned dock in a junkyard. Here the story became inexorable. Something I don't understand, why did the policeman and Vito have a shootout if the latter provided what the corrupt judge could bring down?
