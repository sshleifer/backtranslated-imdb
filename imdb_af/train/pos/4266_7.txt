In the first half of my life I saw a black and white television in a small Samoan village and thought it was hilarious. Now, I saw it for the second time, so much later, I don't find it hilarious. I find nothing more hilaries. But it is a witty and light-hearted comedy that moves fast without obstacles and I thoroughly enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> It's 1945 and Fred MacMurray is a 4F who dies to get into one of the armed forces. He rubs a lamp in the scrap yard he manages and a genius seems to give him some wishes. (Ho hum, right? But although the introduction is no more than okay, the fantasies are pretty alive.) MacMurray tells the genius he wants to be in the army. Poof, and he marches with Washington's soldiers in a particularly warm and inviting USO where June Oats and Joan Leslie wear many lace or whatever they are, and lavender sweaters. Washington sends MacMurray to spy on the enemy - red-layered, German-speaking Hessians, not British. The Hessians are rushed into a Beer Stube and sing a very entertaining drinking song that radiates the virtues of the Vaterland, "where the white wine is winier and the Rhine water's Rhinier / and the Bratwurst is softer / and the yellow hair is gray / and the Frauleins are jucier / and the goose steps are goosier. "Something like that. The characteristics are fantastic, as good as Sig Rumann's best. Otto Preminger is the suspicious and sinister Hessian general. "You know, Heidelberg, cattle are 241 to 1 against you - but cattle are not scared." <br /> <br /> I can't go too far with these fantasies, but they're all very funny, and so are the lyrics. If he wants him to be in the fleet, MacMurray becomes windy with Columbus and the fantasy is presented as grand opera. "Don't you know that sails mean west / a very expensive investment? And what do you think means the means / but Isabella, Queen of Queens." When they see the New World, someone says it looks good. "I don't care what it looks like," muttered Columbus, "but the place will be called Columbusland." <br /> <br /> Anyway, everything is ultimately straight, though by now the genius is very drunk, and MacMurray winds up with the right girl in the Marine Corps. <br /> <br /> I made it sound cute, but it's cute. The kids will enjoy the smoke of the smoke and the magic and the stingy love story. The adults will get a kick from the more challenging elements of the story (who are the Hessians?), Unless it is university qualifications, in which case they may want to keep the army demain and say, "Wow! Awesome!"
