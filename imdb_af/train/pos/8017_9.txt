This time, Kermit, Fozzie, Miss Piggy, Scooter, Rowlf, The Electric Mayhem, Gonzo and Camilla the chicken are out of college and play in a musical they are trying to get on Broadway. After they failed, they all separated and went their separate ways. I love the characters and cameos. The songs in the movie are 'Together Again', 'Look At Me, Lord I'm', 'Saying Goodbye', 'And I always love you', 'Rat Jazz' and 'He'll make me happy'. Frank Oz directs this movie excellently and all the actors do a good job as if the Muppets are real. See it! 91 minutes Rated G. My rating: A.
