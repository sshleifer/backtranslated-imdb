Terry Gilliam's fantastic, twisted story of a virus that destroys everything as a handful of people across the Earth and forces them to move underground and the man who is back in time to get information on it is a fantastic, dark and highly stylized film bragged by Bruce. Willis' best performance ever. <br /> <br /> What sets 12 Monkeys apart from the most time-travel sci-fi movies is that Bruce Willis's character is actually about what the psychological effects of time travel do, not knowing what reality is real reality: the place where the traveling traveler comes or goes. Also, the film acknowledges that things that are over cannot be changed and that the prevention of a catastrophic event, in this case the release of the virus, cannot be stopped or altered. As Willis claims, "It's already been happening," while in a mental hospital, is the big dilemma the movie is going to unite, not a trite, exaggerated plan to save the world; Instead, Willis's inner struggle is simply to survive. It is a fresh, innovative concept, and it works beautifully through a solid writing through the unique dementia of Peoples and Gilliam. <br /> <br /> In addition, 12 Monkey's storytelling is completely non-linear and prefers to deform and bend the way the story is told to skillfully include a variety of time series: flashbacks, dreams, memories, present , the past, the future, and even a scene raised from Hitchcock's Vertigo. Everyone serves the viewer in the disturbing cacophony of madness and futility. <br /> <br /> Visually, Gilliam is a master of abandoned rage and shadow that reflects Tim Burton's strikingly scenic scenery and images. With cold, wide and immersive cinematography, Gilliam sticks into the colorless environment and the darkness of his characters. The screens are often bathed in a foreign antiseptic, dead white and help as a contrast to the often-guarded characters. <br /> <br /> Performance mode, Brad Pitt steals the most scenes, fills them with a patented loony, off-the-wall performance that earned him an Oscar nomination. As mentioned before, Bruce Willis gives the best performance of his career, not back to his heroic clich√©s and cardboard heroes, and places Cole as a simple, fearful, tragic man. Just as well is Madeline Stowe as Willis psychologist. She holds her own, injects her character with both wild energy and strength as she collapses under the weight of what she believes is a false 'religion'. <br /> <br /> Gilliam's expert, overwhelming and complex handling of what a routine action / science film could have been, makes 12 Monkeys a compelling vision of a nightmare, futuristic landscape. His rich, well thought out, intricate storyline, along with bravura performances of the entire cast and his scary, dark film, make it a masterpiece of madness. Arranging in my top 10 of all time, 12 Monkeys is a dark exaggerated spectacle of a film with shine. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10
