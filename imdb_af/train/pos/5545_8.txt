**** Close Spoilers **** <br /> <br /> I've been a horror movie fan for a few decades. Just when I think I've seen the big one, another one appears to surprise me. I've never seen this movie. It was a surprise, even outside the beaten track ... not just the road to the marsh boat. Here was a horror movie made in the 1940s that dared to try something very different. The pretty girl is fearless for a change and saves the men, including the man she loves, from the monster! How about a turn. The girl was the opposite of most women in the then films, no shouting in her own shadow, no faint of fright, and not jumping over a leaf over the leaf. This gall wasn't afraid to stay alone in a secluded hut far from the rest of the villagers. Not only that, but the place was on a misty swamp that was rumored to be pursued. Heck, she even takes naps on the marsh grass outside ... like a regular 1940 version of Ripley. No snake, gator or ghostly stranger will risk this gall. Books on early feminist films should be sure that these accompanying works are included. <br /> <br /> See it if you're a fan like those of the wonderfully atmospheric classic B / W horror movies they first made in the 30's and 40s. And be sure to wear your cast iron turtle neck for protection.
