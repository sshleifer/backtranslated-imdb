Hilarious movie. I watched this movie at the 2002 Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Grass Film Festival and laughed from start to finish. The acting was subtle but very funny. I'm not quite sure about the "Real World" influence, we don't get it here, but keep the movie without understanding the show. Heather B steals every scene she appears, especially when she performs with her rarely speaking red hug. Highly recommended. I would love to see it on Video / DVD at some time in the future.
