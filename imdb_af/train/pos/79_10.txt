I loved The Real Mc Coys (1957-1963). It is too bad that Lydia Reed decided to be forgotten and not to appear. She was excellent in the show. Of course, Walter Brennan was great as well as Tony Martínez. I loved it when he called Amos Señor Grampa. I bought Season I on DVD and I can't wait to buy Seasons 2-6. If there were more programs on television like this, everything would be better. This show appeared shortly in the summer of 1999, but then disappeared. God blesses all the departed members of the role and please, Llydia Reed, make yourself known to the public again. You love and respect. The Real Mc Coys will live forever.
