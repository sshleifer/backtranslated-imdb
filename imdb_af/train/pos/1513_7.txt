This movie is another horror anthology. It's pretty good, but it could have used a little more. I compare it to "Doctor Terror's House of Horrors", although in this one fits the title. It has four stories that are all linked by a house. The first story is about a writer and his wife moves in. He made a killer for his latest novel and then he began to see the killer moving around in his house. This one is kind of predictable, but it throws some twists in the end. The next story is a bit more unpredictable, and you really don't know where it's going. This one has Peter Cushing and was probably my favorite of the bunch. This man buys the house, but it's not the middle-class house, but a strange washing museum. The third story starts pretty well and contains Christopher Lee. This one has him as a bizarre father who looks very protective of his daughter. The problem is that when you know what's going on, the story doesn't end soon enough. This leads to a very predictable conclusion. Then the last story relates to an actor who buys a garment from a strange little shop. The actor really gets what he paid for. Then there is a small story about an officer who is seen everywhere trying to find out what happened to this actor and then an explanation of why these things happened. Although I was not very happy with the explanation, I think Cushing's story didn't explain much at all. I think they need a little more storytelling for that one. All in all, it was an interesting set of stories.
