"Imagine if you could bring it back with just one time." When I first heard it, my attention was closed to the Trailer. And after the first episode, I fell in love with this show myself. A modern Fairy Tale that builds my spirits and keeps my attention throughout the show. I think Acting and Casting is just perfect. Each character brings something unique to the show that adds it. Even once Villains battles with a unique sense. From the Bee Man to the Guy who can swallow Kittens, it never seems to drop me. And the deaths that normally lead to an oppressive moment will often be pure comic (such as an explosive Scratch & Sniff book). Even with the huge number of crime shows we have one day, daisies are one of the few who really stand out from the rest. It's not just a mystery, but a love story, comedy and a fairy tale with a hint of drama, all baked in a wonderful pie ..... bug show. <br /> <br /> What really shocked me was the fact that it was on ABC. For years I never had a reason to turn to ABC, but it brought me back every week with a smile. It was as if Pushing Daisies brought ABC back to me. But just like that, after two seasons, a few awards, a huge fan base and positive answers from critics have dropped the scene. Ned seems to have hurt ABC again and killed me forever. I will always be a fan of this show, and I recommend it to anyone who speaks a lot and loves the shows they watch.
