I thought this movie was great because Corrine and Sean were newcomers to the business. It was full of action and a little romance, but there were a few points when Corrine didn't speak very clearly (when she was Sean with the gun) and she cut her teeth ... maybe she had to? I think the roles of Joseph and Sonny are very well portrayed and there was a clear contrast. Also, since I watched the next action star, I'm sure Corrine and Sean did their own stunts that were done very well. I'm looking forward to another movie by the couple, as they make a good team, or maybe a sequel to betting your life - perhaps called "big in the big apple" This can be Carmen this time. Pray your life is excellent!
