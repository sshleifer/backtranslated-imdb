I was so surprised at how big the man in the moon was. I initially expected to expect a cheesy and predictable movie, but I decided to put it aside when I looked. Well, when it was over, I just remained This film is so entertaining and so aware of its tone, and it's just a wonderful movie. The play was especially of Reece Witherspoon was so cute and lovely) and everyone else. There was nothing that really bothered me. I finally had the predictable, but very well done. I also felt that some things were clear or as if done before, but still a wonderful movie. Generally, I have to say that I don't want to say too much about this movie, not that it was bad, it's just a movie you don't like or like. However, I would recommend it to anyone and everyone, even if you don't like these movies, it's still a nice movie. <br /> <br /> 8.7 out of 10 stars
