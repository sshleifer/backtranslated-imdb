There is a story (possibly apocryphal) about an exchange between Bruce Willis and Terry Gilliam at the beginning of twelve monkeys. Gilliam (allegedly) made a long list (think of the plane one of the fifth element) and give it to Butch Bruce. It was entitled "Things Bruce Willis Do When He Acts". It ended with a simple message that said, "Please don't do the above in my movie." <br /> <br /> There is a fact about this movie (definitely true). Gilliam didn't have a hand in the writing. <br /> <br /> I would argue that these two factors played a major role in creating the extraordinary success (or not commercial) that the Twelve Monks are. <br /> <br /> Visually, the Twelve Monkeys are all we really expected from a Gilliam movie. It's also full of Gilliamesque surrealism and general (but beautiful) strangeness. Gilliam misrepresents his audience. Though the end of the Twelve Monkeys will not surprise anyone who had actually sat down, Gilliam borrowed heavily from Kafka in the clockwork, bureaucratic relentless movement of the characters to their fate. It is this journey, and the character developments they undergo that upset. <br /> <br /> I love Gilliam movies (especially Brazil). But they all tend to suffer the same weakness. He looks so many ideas and so much enthusiasm that his films almost always come as a tangled mess (especially Brazil). I still like Brazil's Gilliam tour de force, but there is no denial that the Twelve Monkey is a fresh air in the tough department. Style, fabric and shape seem to be merging in a way that is not usually seen from the ancient Python. <br /> <br /> Whatever the truth of the rumors above, Gilliam also manages a first (and very atypical) performance from the bare one. Bruce is excellent in this movie, like all the role-players, especially good bonkers - and very scary - Brad Pitt. <br /> <br /> It has been more than a decade since this film was released. When I looked at it again, I realized that it wasn't really outdated. Of course I changed. And it made me look at the movie with fresh eyes. It seems to me to be a fitting tribute to a film that partly deals with reflections in mirrors, changing perspectives and the absurd one-way journey through the time we all make. A first-class movie. 8/10.
