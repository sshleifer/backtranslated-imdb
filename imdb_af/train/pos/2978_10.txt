BASEketball is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. It is an outdoor film featuring South Stone creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker. They play two slacker friends who make a sport in their driveway that becomes a national sensation. Most of the gags are indeed hilarious, but the funniest parts of the movie are when players try to "psyche-out" other members of the opposing team. There is no rule over what is not allowed, so of course they do the craziest things. One mistake from this movie is that the pace is too fast, and after looking at it for about half an hour, I asked myself, "Wow this this already?" Another hilarious part of the movie was how Joe and Doug continually hurt Squeak, who is a lofty little guy. BASEketball is a comic classic with some very quirky lines, and it's fun to watch!
