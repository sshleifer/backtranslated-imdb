One of the more satisfying Western all'italiana, Johnny Yuma, has the freshness of many WAI made during the genre's heyday and is highly recommended for fans of the genre or death, intelligent theater. <br /> <br /> In most respects, Johnny Yuma isn't terribly original, but it doesn't actually count against it. The success of a genre film depends on how well it meets the expectations of the audience and also offers surprising variations on these expected elements. Earlier, pleasurable experiences are recreated, but with subtle (or large) strife that offers constant interest. The quality of the performance is of course also important. A tired feedback will be less successful than a genuine effort to entertain or move the audience. <br /> <br /> Given these criteria, Johnny Yuma succeeds. There are numerous repetitions of elements from previous films. The institution is the brutal, twisted semi-feudal twilight world shared by many of the best "Gothic family" westerners made in 1964-1968, such as Tempo di massacre (1966). The plot is a combination of the basic Fistful Dollars (1964) plot and the Ringo films, a fact not surprising, since the screenwriter Fendiando di Leo was involved with both. Di Leo was one of the best screenwriters in the popular film that came out of Cinecitta in the 1960s and 1970s. His work helped to give many of the thematic continuity and coherence to the genre (along with some other personalities in some separate circles of actors, directors and screenwriters). In the FPS plot, the protagonist arrives in the town, pushing up a tense situation, followed by a near death, followed by a resurrection (in some films, such as Quella sporca storia nel west (1968) it is literally a crucifixion). The Catholic undertone to the narrative and symbolism is intriguing, especially given the implicit populist / explicit socialist handrails of the filmmakers and their films. The Ringo plot, developed more by screenwriter Ernesto Gastaldi in a series of films starring Guliano Gemma, chooses an egoistic protagonist the interest of a community over its own through a relationship with a member of the community (with a healthy dash of ironic uncertainty). <br /> <br /> The relationship between Carradine and Johnny is clearly based on that of Manco / Mortimer of a Fistful of Dollar (1965). The two scenes of the exchange of rifle bands provide a smart dialogue and understanding between the two. Many movies, including Da uomo a uomo (1968) or even El Chuncho, are you sabe? (1967), uses this relationship between an older and younger man (father / son, parent / younger brother, Anglo adviser / adversary and farmer revolutionary) as a central dynamics for the plot. <br /> <br /> In addition, there is a focus on deception and mismanagement, mazes and mirrors, repeated by the best early WAI. The cannons and pueblos of Almeria become literal mazes through which protagonist and antagonist play which changes cat and mouse games. <br /> <br /> What distinguishes Johnny Yuma from other WAI is the quality of director Romolo Guerriri's use of visual / psychological space along with the script's intelligent mechanisms to send the plot. Dialogue was never very important for the WAI and often absurdly incomprehensible (thought there are exceptions, such as the cynical commentaries in Django (1966) or Faccia a faccia (1967). <br /> <br /> Psychological depth of character is created almost completely through iconic images, this is a compilation of the text, and it is a description of the overall narrative situation. See how the presence of the deadly Samantha feels during the knocking scene? background of action Samantha and Pedro of their security and confidence in their power through their rogue invasions of their farm, hotel, even bedroom (this is again a theme of FPS). Lastly, note how there is a focus on the search for information, many elements, it is borrowed from FOD, which is ultimately based on the hard-boiled mysterious novel Red Harvest, by accidental contacts, wanted posters, obedient conversations, glamor from windows, watches in the kiss, t or wrong -identit√© food and movement through the wrinkles created by the actions of Pedro and Samantha within this surreal and absurd reality which focuses the narrative on its conclusion. <br /> <br /> The movie was remarkable in time for what was considered excess violence. Of course, these movies were hardly more violent than many American westerns. What was different was the psychological intensity of the violence and the causes it was attributed to, ie it was not the violence, but it meant that it had changed. Johnny Yuma is clear and interesting in the use and depiction of violence and this is another interesting aspect of the film. <br /> <br /> What I personally find most interesting about most of this genre is the link it has to the anonymous, anonymous audiences in Italy and Spain to whom these repetitive stories have interest and interest. The artefact may not have intrinsic value and itself? some flint protection from a prehistoric site, a jar of herbal pottery, or a mole of leather and rusted metal ?? but it refers to some unnamed presence, lives, which were meaningful simply because they existed. While Johnny Yuma has intrinsic value, much of my interest in this connection and mystery. <br /> <br /> Top Spaghetti Western List http://imdb.com/mymovies/list?l=21849907 <br /> Average SWs http://imdb.com/mymovies/list? l = 21849889 <br /> <br /> Only for fanatics (bottom of bar) http://imdb.com/mymovies/list? l = 21849890
