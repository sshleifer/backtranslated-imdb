The Old Mill Pond is more of a tribute to the African American entertainers of the 30's than any deviation from the whole race (Stapin Fetchit caricature despite). Besides who I just mentioned, there are also frog or fish performances by Cab Calloway, Fats Waller, Joesphine Baker, Bill "Bojangles" Robinson and Louis Armstrong. This happy harmony cartoon of Hugh Harmon and Rudolf Ising is very musical entertainment with perfect characteristics everywhere. They all sound so much like the real thing that half of me think they can do. If not, they are definitely very flattering imitations. Even the lazy, shaky Fetchit characterization gets an exciting workout here when he is chased by a tiger, as "Hold That Tiger" plays on the score. Highly recommended for fans of 30s animation and jazz music.
