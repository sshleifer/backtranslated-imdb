It's an excellent documentary, full of racing action, beautiful photos and a wonderful story. The IMAX cameras give you a very wide perspective. As a DVD movie, it's perfect. You hear every speaker almost always work. The film is not speeded up and gives only the natural feel of 230mph. Of course, there are some sound effects added, but I think they are good, they give a depth to the driving scene ...
