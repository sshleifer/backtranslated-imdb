It's a chick first, it's a romantic comedy. There is a fair balance between the two. This particular movie has the addition of some pretty sweet fight scenes, I don't think any threads were used or if they were, they weren't flat-blooded. It's not a very complicated movie, so it's easy on the brain, nothing to understand deeper meaning, fairly simple, good chemistry between the lead and a fun look. I would like it if they brought out the full potential of the girls, just look once because she can be incredibly cute, but throughout the movie they keep it very good. I'll see it again ... with a girl.
