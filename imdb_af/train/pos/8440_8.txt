This is the last episode we've earned. At the end of last season, things were left in a "life in progress", which was almost the wrap-up that earned this realistic series. Although it wasn't a happy show, this series was always one that reminds you (a scarce thing on television), and that's no exception. "Is death justified by reason?" "Is morality reflected in society, or is society formed by the moral that few people choose?" "What is a righteous death, and can it exist?" All of these questions, and more, are put by the authors of this show every week, which is their final thesis. Fine-acting, wonderful writing, wonderful camera work, brilliant editing, clean direction. If you saw the series and you missed it when it first ran, you get a copy somehow. If you never watched the series when it ran, it would stand up on its own, but it could be difficult to keep track of who all the characters are and what they refer to in their varied past. For those of us who have been in the series for the past two seasons, it was very satisfying.
