Ira Levin's Deathtrap is one of the mysterious films in Sleuth's tradition that would be very easy to spoil with a view to an actual exploration of the movie's plot. Therefore, I will be brief to say that it is about a play, a man who is a well-known mysterious playwright, another man who is a promising writer, the playwright's wife, who is much younger and more sexy than the role , and a German psychologist for the ride. Director Sidney Lumet, no stranger to the film, is pretty good for most of the stress the movie needs to ride. The dialogue is fast, fresh and witty. Michael Caine shines in roles like this. Christopher Reeve is serviceable and actually grows on you the more you see him acting. Irene Worth stands out as the funny psychics. How about Dyan Cannon? Love how Lumet wrapped her back in the real sturdy pants and possibly wrapped her up with the twigs, but she's terribly scary in this role - a role to be given to an older actress and one that is less seductive. But why does this scare off with an obvious attempt to bribe his male viewers if nothing changes it now? Deathtrap is funny, sophisticated, witty and elegant. The mystery has some mischievous mistakes that are somewhat detrimental, and I wasn't quite happy with the end, but looking at Caine and Reeve under Lumet's direction with Levin's exaltation, was enough to ease my interest and the whole length of the film in captivity.
