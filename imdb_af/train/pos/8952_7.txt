Gillian Holroyd (Kim Novak) is a witch. Mysteriously, she was attracted to her regular neighbor Shep Henderson (James Stewart). She throws a game on Shep, forcing him to shower and fall for her fiancee. Things are going well until Gillian discovers that she really cares about this mortal man. She decides to tell her secret. But how will Shep respond if he finds out "he's fallen in love with Gillian? <br /> <br /> As far as the lighthearted 1950s comedies, Bell Book and Candle is good, but nothing spectacular It is a pleasant enough watch and should appeal to almost everyone who is sitting on it, just not in the movie that expects the best thing as sliced ​​bread, the movie is cute, funny, sometimes and touching Kim Novak and James Stewart are doing their best and have a real chemistry, and Novak (as others have seen) looks pretty amazing in an understated way, and the supporting film with Jack Lemmon, Hermione Gingold and Elsa Lanchester is often very funny and much of the spotlight from Novak and Stewart, the biggest problem I see is that Bell Book and Candle can't quite decide what kind of movie it wants to be, is it a screw comedy, is it a romantic comedy? a supernatural comedy, as director Richard Quine with just one b held, the movie could have been even better and more memorable.
