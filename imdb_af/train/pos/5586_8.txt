Eva (Hedy Lamarr) is just married to an older man and in the honeymoon she realizes that her husband does not desire her. Her disappointment with the marriage and the liberation of love makes Eve back to her father's house on a farm, leaving her husband. One afternoon, while swimming in a lake, her horse escaped with her clothes and a young worker returned and gave them back to Eve. They fall in love with each other and become lovers. Later, her husband misses her and tries to get Eva back home. Eva refuses, and luck leads the trio to the same place, and ends the case in a tragic way. I only watched "Extase" for the first time, and the first comment I have is relative to the terrible quality of the VHS released in Brazil by the Brazilian distributor Video Network. The movie ran just 75 minutes and it seems that there are different roles of movies used. Some parts are completely damaged, and other parts are very damaged. Therefore, the beauty of the images not obtained by the Brazilian viewer, if he gets the chance to find this rare VHS in a rental or for sale. The movie is almost a silent movie, the story is very dated and has only a few lines. As a result, the characters were poorly developed. However, this film is also very risky, with the exposure of Hedy Lamarr beautiful breasts and bare fat body for the current beauty features. Another fantastic point is the poetic and metaphorical use of flowers, symbolizing the intercourse between Eva and her lover. The way the director performs the scenes to show Eve's needs and delivery is very clear. The unsatisfactory end is also very unusual for a 1933 movie. I like this movie, but one day I hope to see a 87-minute restored version. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "asextase" ("Ecstasy")
