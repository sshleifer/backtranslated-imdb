Robin Williams and Kurt Russell play guys in their 30s who compromise their marriages by deciding (Russell somewhat reluctant) to play their heartbreaking tie with rival Bakersfield year after fact. Williams is ok, but Russell is outright big as legendary Taft quarterback Remo Hightower. Holly Palance does a nice and attractive turn as Williams's wife, who could live without this delivery. Movie is worth watching just to see the famous Remo in action. Highly recommended.
