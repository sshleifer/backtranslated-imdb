I have never seen a Barbara Steele movie I didn't like and have always been a bastard for a good haunted house story (especially for such wonderful pictures such as The Legend of Hell House and the original versions of The Haunting) and "House on Haunted Hill"), so I had a feeling that "Castle of Blood" would have risen upright by me, and boy, was it ever this French-Italian co-operative, while perhaps not the classic that Steele The first horror movie, "Black Sunday", to date, remains a very atmospheric, cold entry into the ghost genre, filmed in black and white, it manages to convey a truly creepy miasma. relates to a journalist betting one Blackwood and a writer named Edgar Allen Poe that he could spend the night in Blackwood's castle on the night of the Most Holy Day, when the spirits of those killed in the castle The viewer gets these deaths to look after, and it is re delicately terrible, for the most part.

Not for nothing is she called "The Queen of Horror".
