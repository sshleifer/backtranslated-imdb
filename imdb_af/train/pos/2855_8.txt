An entertaining and substantive film, Non-Stop, has drawn deserving comparisons with "Run Lola Run". The film is rapidly evolving in a sequenced sequence, with viewers learning about the three main characters through flashbacks and daydreaming series. The race does not serve as a fast climax, but as a journey that makes up the bulk of the film. During the "run" we see the characters grow and forget their dreamy lives, about the "macho" roles they bought, and finally forget why they started running in the first place. Like the fight to give a "brightness" to the characters in "Fight Club", the characters of this movie give a way to hide from the false values ​​that allow us all to create. Their run serves as a way of tasting life from an unprecedented perspective, and all three find some order and joy in the process. <br /> <br /> My appreciation and enjoyment just waited a bit in the end of the movie, where the characters, instead of learning from their experience, seem to be returning to the false macho roles I thought they had escaped their journey. <br /> <br /> However, the only real problem with this movie is that it is not distributed sooner outside Japan.
