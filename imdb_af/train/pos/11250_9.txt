If you only saw the A Perfect Spy mini series once, you can do nothing but your hat. A pure masterpiece, which, compared to the other Le Carré minis about Smiley, has many different features. <br /> <br /> In the minis about Smiley, it is Alex Guiness, like Smiley, who steals the show. The rest of the actors just support him. One can say. <br /> <br /> Here is the important ensemble and story, The main actor, played by Peter Egan in the last episodes, is not charismatic at all. <br /> <br /> Egan just plays a man named Magnus Pym, who is all lying, inconsiderate and telling people what they like, much loved by everyone, big and small. The only thing that looks like his own self is Alex, his Czech handler. <br /> <br /> Never tell the machinery behind a spy and / or traitor better! Having followed his life from a very young age, we fully understand what makes it possible to change him into a traitor. His ability to deceive and despise everything makes him a perfect spy, as his Czech handler calls him. <br /> <br /> And by following his life, we fully understand how difficult it is to get back to the straight and narrow road as soon as you wipe it. He turns on, even though he doesn't get anything economically out there, except the promotion by his MI5 spy masters. Everyone is happy, as long as the flow of expired information continues! <br /> <br /> Magnus's dad, who was wonderfully played by Ray McAnally, is a non-good consman who always invents schemes to keep people out of their money. In later years it was his son who had to sponsor him again. But by the example his father and uncle set as guardian when his father goes to jail and his mother is sent to an asylum, Magnus quickly learns that lies are the way of survival and do not tell the truth. Initially, he overdo it a little, but quickly learns to tell the right lies, and to be constant, and not to change the stories from time to time, he tells those who want to listen to himself and his father. <br /> <br /> His Czech handler Alex, who is played by Rüdiger Weigang, creates, using Magnus, a network of non-existent informants, who have been supplying British MI5 for years and years, just like the British with the German spies who were active before and during the war in the United Kingdom - they continued to send false information to Das Vaterland long after the agents themselves changed, liquidated or simply replaced by MI5 men. <br /> <br /> The young boys that Magnus plays in younger years are wonderful, and most of them are more charismatic than the parent, a bit more cynical, and tired, Pym, played by Egan. But you buy the difference easily, because it is often the way we change life, from enthusiasm to sadness, or indifference. <br /> <br /> Indeed, that money is worth it!
