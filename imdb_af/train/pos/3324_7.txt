Someone mastered the difficult task of combining sport with romance. In reality, sports and romance go together like oil and water. So, to put the two on the screen successfully. Well, it's about the equivalent of splitting the atom. I never thought it could be done. I will be the first to say that I generally don't like romantic comedies ... but I like sports and most movies about sports. This movie was a pretty good mix of the two. As a baseball fan, I really appreciated the comedian ordeal with Ben Wrightman (Jimmy Falon) as a rabid Boston Redsox fan. Anyone who knows anything about baseball knows the babe of the Babe who has hit the Redsox for 86 years, and they just know how many baseball fans are many Redsox fans. The Farrely brothers did it well and it made for good comedy. It was a very good movie that could appeal to many.
