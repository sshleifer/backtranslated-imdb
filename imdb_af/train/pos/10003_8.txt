This is not the typical Mel Brooks movie. It was much less slapstick than most of its movies and actually has a plot that could be followed. Leslie Ann Warren made the movie, she is such a fantastic, understated actress. There were a few moments that could be a bit more, and a few scenes that could probably be cut to make the room do, but it's worth the price to rent and see. The action was good overall, Brooks himself did a good job without typically talking directly to the audience. Again Warren was the best actor in the movie, but "Fume" and "Sailor" played their parts well.
