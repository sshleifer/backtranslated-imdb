If you need yourself to escape, something that will keep your attention for two hours and lose you in another world, Domino will satisfy that need. It's fun, yet! The plot keeps your brain moving - one of those movies (like ordinary suspects) where you want to see it a second time to figure it out. I wondered about Domino Harvey, how her life became important to Hollywood. Regarding the acting, many celebrity performances are not shown in the trailers. And any actor who made me forget who they are, did their job well. Not once did I think of Kiera in a soccer uniform or pirate dress. And awarded, Mickey Rourke plays well and regularly Mickey Rourke, but here he shows signs of being able to care for other people, despite the violence.
