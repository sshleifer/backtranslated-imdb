I waited for the bar to expect it to be a hot beer on a waving Texas day, but was pleasantly surprised. Having struggled through Saturday Night Foolishness, I had no desire to see a repetition in a southern Texas barn ... and I didn't. John Revolta was good as the jealous redhead, Scott Glenn was well-cast as a lazy ex-con, and Debra Winger was as always a joy. * Love for the woman * Plus, the soundtrack was dynamite [and it comes from a man who cannot stand the sound of country music]. A fun movie entirely.
