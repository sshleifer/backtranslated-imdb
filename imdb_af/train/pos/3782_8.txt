When I was a kid, I both loved Bill & Ted Movies. The other night, Bogus Journey was on and since it was at least 5 years since I last saw it, I decided to agree. AND I LOVE THIS EVERYTHING! This movie is still funny after all these years. "Excellent Adventure" is better, but this one just slaps the same. Sure, some of the perfomances are a bit cheesy, but hey, this whole movie is cute in a cool way. Plus it contains the coolest personality of death ever in a movie! Concluding: Completely like non-deceitful movie child! Excellent way! STATION !!!
