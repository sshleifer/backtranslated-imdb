I only saw this movie when I was about 6 or 7 years old and didn't really think it was anything special. As time went on, I watched it a few times and it started to grow on me when I began to understand the moral of the movie, which I will come later. For a while I left this movie alone and didn't watch it for a while. If I was looking for an old classic movie to watch a few weeks ago (now 15), I bound the homosexual VHS. After watching it, I was left on a natural height that I couldn't really explain. The movie gives an overwhelming sense of joy that you never really expect. The movie nature of three completely different animals working together to get their way home really sends a message at home that no matter how different you are, you can always find common ground, something you all need. The way the personality of the characters is chosen is really fantastic. Thereby, you have an old, knowledgeable golden retriever, to love the fun or to have a chance to be a little ugly young American bulldog, with the clever, vulnerable but confident cat. The movie follows these three friends or companions on a journey that is so realistically impossible, it creates magic by believing that this journey can happen. <br /> <br /> I don't want to sound like a soft tissue grabber when it comes to movies I assure you. I am quite the opposite, but the most exuberant part of this movie is undoubtedly shade back, when shadow desperately tries to escape and accidentally and ill, being painfully told by him to leave. When both animals return to their beloved owners, there is a silence to shade across the horizon to the awe of all. There is a fine line between heartwarming and indulgent refuse, but this film is pure magic even at the age of 15. This movie may not be the Lord of the Rings, but for Disney to produce such a fantastic movie by using and elevating animals The way it even happens at this age deserves it 10/10.
