Buddy is an entertaining family movie that, at a time when "human animals" are accommodated, and making them cute was an acceptable way to interest people in them. <br /> <br /> Based on a true story, Buddy shows the great love that the main characters for animals and each other have, and that they will do something to each other. <br /> <br /> While not a perfect movie, the animated gorilla is quite alive most of the time and the evil in the home is usually amusing to children. <br /> <br /> This movie misses an opportunity to address the mistake of bringing wild animals into the home, but it shows the problems. <br /> A recommended movie that was the first for Jim Henson Productions.
