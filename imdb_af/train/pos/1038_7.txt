Love the movie. I even liked most of the actors in it. But for me, Mrs. Davis' very poor effort to make an accent, and her tight play, make it really another compelling movie very difficult to watch. Seriously if any other modern actor played the same role with the same style as me. Davis, they will be laughed off the screen. <br /> <br /> I really think she called this one. "Now if Myrna Loy or Ingrid Bergman played the part of the woman, I would have enjoyed it much more. <br /> <br /> I don't think I'm getting 'Bette Davis'. I have always thought of her as an actor who "plays her," no matter what role she plays. The possible exception is Now Voyager. <br /> <br /> I am sure many of the other reviewers will be cautious about explaining (and hopefully civil) how I am totally wrong. But I will continue to watch the movies she is in because I love the stories / writing / supporting works, but I will always think of different actresses that could do a better job.
