It's not a bad movie. It's not very funny, but it's interesting and <br /> <br /> entertained. It has some funny moments. Cher gives a good <br /> <br /> performance in a role much to her real self. Her <br /> <br /> performance alone is worth the watch. If this movie came out <br /> <br /> today it would not be nominated, but at 80's it is <br /> <br /> excellent.
