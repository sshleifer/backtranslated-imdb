Having seen "Mafia wedding", I almost lost my faith in Korean movie business. But this one brought back my faith. <br /> <br /> The foremost female character who is a university student has forced to teach the spoiled, rich, but charismatic high school student. He's actually a female character's age. Through some hilarious quarrells, these two become good friends. <br /> <br /> I was pleasantly surprised that newcomer was singing, doing his work with excellence. He was such a revelation !! The actress Kim ha zero was also charming as usual. <br /> <br /> This movie tried hard to avoid any click that can be seen in typical romantic comedies. And that didn't show us an unnecessary naked, sex scene. It was brilliant, beautiful, fresh, made me see. <br /> <br />
