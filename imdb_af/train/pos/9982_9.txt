I saw this movie last night after waiting centuries and ages for it to be released here in Canada (only in limited release). It was worth the wait and then some. I am a very avid reader of Margaret Laurence and was excited to see this novel change into a movie. I finally chose the movie better than the novel. I liked the fact that the character of Bram Shipley was a little less hard and that there was more of a love story between Hagar and Bram, which made the scenes at the end of Bram's life. The loss looks stronger. Hagar was no longer nice on film than in the book, but Ellen Burstyn was a genius in this role. She was through Hagar. Christine Horne was brilliant and has many more good things. I'm sure. Her plays with Cole Hauser were electrifying. I can keep on, generally a 9 * out of 10. Fantastic and can't wait for it to come out on DVD, a must have for my collection!
