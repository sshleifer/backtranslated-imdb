FULL SPOILERS. <br /> <br /> It's a fairly fast and enjoyable crime thriller based on Ira Levin's play about two gay playwrights (Caine and Reeve) killing the murder of his rich wife (Cannon) to get. and insurance. The plot succeeds Christopher Reeve, as the younger and less established of the two authors decide to make a play from the real murder - with only minor changes in the details. Reeve admits Easthampton, Long Island, for example, Southampton, Long Island, is being written. The rest of the play is giving away a dead and telling the truth. Reeve doesn't mind a little gossip or even an investigation into Cannon's seemingly accidental death. This will increase revenue and its own Warhol quotient. <br /> <br /> Michael Caine is the megabucks writer Sidney Bruhl, whose last four productions have been bombed and want nothing more than to quietly go back to work on a new game, perhaps with Reeve 's input, which will save his reputation. He can't let Reeve's scandalous play-a-key be produced. So what else? He's trying to kill him. Eventually, they kill each other, the manuscript is appropriated by their neighbor, the psychic Helga Tensdoorp. She makes a million dollars on Broadway. <br /> <br /> It's a lot of fun for a number of reasons. One is the production design. The multi-room, multi-storey home with the big windmill on top, located on nine of the most valuable acres on earth (Easthampton!) Should be a beautiful set of digs. You won't be able to afford a pup tent in Easthamptom. The house is not too big or baroque in its decor. It's just pretty modest, although it's neat for my taste, the kind of home that's so clean, you're scared to walk on the thick mat, because you don't want to leave the foot pressure. <br /> <br /> Next, the acting could hardly be improved. Caine, Cannon, and Fred Jones are wonderful. Dyan Cannon speaks perfectly when the anxious woman whose slacks are so stiff looks like they've been sprayed, which is good with her assets. Even Reeve, whose talent was limited, seems to find a comfortable niche in his role of sweet but psychopathic killer. Irene Worth, as the psychological neighbor Helga, was somehow difficult to define, a mistake. Granted she - or someone like her - was essential to the plot, but my God, who is an offensive snoop character, goes around claiming, "I feel pain in the cheek!" I'm supposed to make her a little more interesting, she got up in sweat and a sturdy hat with bicycle reflector on it. Yet she is a nuisance from start to finish. <br /> <br /> You must love Ira Levin's typing dialogue. The indignant Caine begs Reeve to tell him why he wrote the tell-all game. "Because it's there, Sidney!" says Reeve, and Caine shouts: "It's MOUNTAINS, not PLAYS! Play isn't there until a little *** hole write them!" Also great is Caine's call to the police after his wife, as planned, is dead of terror. He works himself in a stream of sobs, almost able to speak, as he reports the incident and claims that an ambulance is sent immediately. When he hangs up, his face picks up his usual, calm expression, he blows his nose in his handkerchief and goes again, all the business again. <br /> <br /> The climax, though appropriately ironic, is confusing and noisy and full of art, lacking in the divine charm that Levin and Lumet brought to the previous scene. The score consists mainly of light riffs on the harpsichord, neat in the film. <br /> <br /> You'll probably enjoy it.
