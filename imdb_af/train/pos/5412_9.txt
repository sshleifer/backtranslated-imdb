As a Pokémon fan, I really enjoyed this movie. It introduces new legendary Pokémon (like every movie does) and adds depth to the relationships between its characters. However, I don't expect those who aren't Pokémon fans to enjoy it (this includes MOST adults). Some of the lines were corny, but it may be somewhat inevitable when the movie is translated into English. The animation was beautiful, although there were some parts that didn't look good. And although the villain is a wheat, I think the movies have done a good job of cycling through various types of villains, and I guarantee you they are not all like this one. Those who didn't like it, I tell each one of them, but Pokémon fans will love it.
