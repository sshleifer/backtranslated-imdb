This is one of Dev Anand's films that gave big but separate movies to Hindi movie industries such as Jewel Thief and Guide. The story is short (if you ask me what the story is), plot is simple - a brother is looking for his lost sister. Sister joined the hippies who smoke from pot and chant Hare Rama hare Krishna. Yet the film shows some of the important events the world has experienced in the 70's. Hippie culture, their submission to drugs, freedom, escape from duty, family, and the adoption of anything new as eastern (which was new to whites) religion. They are perfectly handled. Zeenat has her best and Dev was as usual conspicuous. Songs are best used (other than being abused for the sake of songs) in this movie. They are not spoiled. A perfect example is 'Dekho o deewano ... Ram ka name badnam after karo'. Each word in the song is very philosophical and meaningful. The end is tragic, but it's not the core of the movie. Overall, Devji who believes in making different movies is successful in showing what he wanted to show here. A must see hippie culture and gorgeous Nepal of 70's experience.
