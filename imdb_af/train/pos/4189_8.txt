Richard Widmark is an infected character in this movie. He is a professional bag. He is in prison three times, but at the start of the film he tries to celebrate it. Thelma Ritter is a busy body that sells information to almost everyone. Jean Peters is wonderful as the girl flared through Widmark. <br /> <br /> It is a period piece during the McCarthy era where the Red Terror reigns throughout politics, and it is very well incorporated into this plot. What is unusual about this movie is that Peters & Ritter are both victims of violent battles in an era where women are rarely more than sex objects in movies. This is what makes this film noir, as women often have different roles in this type of film. <br /> <br /> The film is only 87 minutes long and is of course made by Fox as the double-function sub-card in the theater. . The sets show it's a limited budget movie. The writing made J Edgar Hoover angry because patriotism was written briefly. Hoover wanted to change it. <br /> <br /> Instead, it became a B under map photo that struck a sleep in 1953. The writing and play in it is better than other great features of that year.
