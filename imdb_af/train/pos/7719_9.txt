If you like Star Wars / Trek, come see where they have all their ideas and movies. This is my top 2 favorite movies of all time, other-world-futuristic and psychotherapist. The intensity of the root material (Shakespeare's "The Tempest") is not overshadowed by whizbang gimmickry (a la later Lucas). And just because it was made in 1956, don't assume you can see the strings holding the flying spectacle. It was the first movie you couldn't do. Wondering what it did on the scale of a film, economy and taste was heavily stacked at the time. And director Wilcox's previous "hit" was "Lassie Come Home". Until I watched him, I assumed that Fred Wilcox was a pseudonym for a director who had already become famous, but not wanted to be associated with sci-fi at the time. It was a B genre then. It was either a very visionary production or a very prosperous "mistake" by people who praise Hollywood. <br /> <br /> There are massive scale mats with live action, almost microscopically inserted that Lucas used. comprehensive. There are intelligent machines that surpass the stereotypical "user interface"; "computers" as they are depicted much less futuristically in later works. Star Trek's 'carrier' was visually nearly unchanged ten years later by Roddenberry. And if the Trek / Wars technobabble turns you off, FP's scientific references aren't overdoing it and is accurate even today. The "ship" set is comprehensive, sparklingly realistic, as well as everything you've seen since, and more convincing than what "Trek" did for TV or movie. We didn't spend as much time there as I wanted. <br /> <br /> If you've ever wondered how movies come in so much space, FP will explain it all. This is definitely not 'Wagontrain to the Stars'.
