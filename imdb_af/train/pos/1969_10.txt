Honestly I don't understand why this movie was such a big "flop" in publicity. Sharon Stone certainly did not lose her charisma and "touch", as "basic instinct". I voted this movie 10 and I tell you why: Game opens this time in London. London is the city where Catherine Tramell has moved since the events in BI1. Again she proved to be a master brain manipulator of her own class. She is "your brain screw" like Catherine with such a skill that you are not entirely sure who the right villain is. <br /> <br /> Regarding the technical part of the movie: Only real setback is the B-rate crew of actors. Sharon Stone is the only big name in the cast compared to her and Michael Douglas, etc. In the first part. I also think BI2 would have been better if Sharon Stone was a little younger, but she is pretty beautiful in her appearance and just improved on her charisma. Her B-rate "assistants" are not that bad, although I would like even bigger names for the cast. <br /> <br /> I think there are pretty good improvements to the basic plot. I think it's a much better thriller than many of the running love movies that Hollywood so easily spreads today. The plot is wonderful, it's easy to see technically, you don't snore halfway through the movie and most importantly the heather is on.
