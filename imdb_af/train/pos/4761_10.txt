An excellent movie featuring great performances by Zack & Lochley. Much of their dissatisfaction (and mine) arrived at Garibaldi at the station. (With all due respect to Jerry Doyle, but in Seasons 4 and 5 I lost sympathy for the character.) It doesn't take him long to criticize Zack (who's the best of all at shows) and to control take. I'm sure Zack could have gotten it. The Soulhunter plot is fascinating, especially if you believe in heaven like Zack does. The humor complements it nicely. 10/10
