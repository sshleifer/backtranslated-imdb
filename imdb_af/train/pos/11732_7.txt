OK, I saw it in the theaters when it came out and I don't know why. I didn't see it, but I finally came to this page because I thought of this movie - again I don't know why. But the fact that I remember it, speaks volumes. <br /> <br /> Comedy is difficult - much harder than any drama. To fix it, looks easy, but does it wrong ... is there anything worse than a bad comedy? Steve Martin, notice, you fall into this category for some reason. <br /> <br /> Elvira Mistress Of The Dark must have done it right to love this movie. Ready at a fast pace, with a tongue in the cheek and knowing it's not the Philedelphia Story, it's entertaining from start to finish. Brain Donors is another that fits right into this category (even most of the free boob jokes). <br /> <br /> One point of battle - the end. The authors / director seem to have had no idea how to complete a comedy. The end is trying to be a love story, which undermines the exciting fast dialogue to the point. Then there is the "evil" scene. While it should be seen (male opinion), it is so over and out of place it is like a shock. Another rewrite for the end was needed. <br /> <br /> It's not comedy genius like Spinal Tap or The Producers of The Holy Grail. But if you're not trying to analyze it and get the words and juicy fun, you'll laugh, I'll guarantee it.
