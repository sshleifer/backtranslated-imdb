Your average garden variety - psychotic mother bag (beautifully set with unforgiving enjoyment by Stephen Sachs) beats several dull young adults (to use the term very loosely) in the Dayton Hall University, which is closed for demolition. With Daphne Zuniga, who is frighteningly acting, Daphne Zuniga makes her sobering and ominous film debut here as Debbie, a bimbo who bruised her head through a car!), A sturdy style of 10, okay fiction by Matthew Mungle, a some bloody murders (baseball batgeoning, chicken wire crumbling, your standard drill bit by bit, the kind of horrible thing), an indifferent surprise twist later copied into "Intruder", a terrible count by Christopher ("Hellraiser") Young, a little smithy of unreliable feminine nudity, and endearing incompetent direction by Jeffrey Obrow and Steve Carpenter (who also blessed us with "The Power" and "The Kindred"), these entertainingly messy spectacular cruelty sizes as a good part of delectably dopey and drcky low grade fun.
