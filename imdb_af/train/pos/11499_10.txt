Since it was just a toddler when this show was originally broadcast, I just picked up the DVD series and I wish there were more episodes filmed. This show was a 70-year-old version of the pop 90's TV series "X-Files" - but with a bit more of a comic / light-hearted approach. But don't get me wrong, some of these episodes are full of horror themes, many of which have some nice sizes (obviously the imagination - it was the early 70's television). <br /> <br /> Some of the plots where a little stupid as well as the acting, but this is the charm and appeal of this series. Whether you're mystery crime dramas, comedies, or sci-fi / horror themes, this series has everything that goes along. Every episode clock in about 50 minutes or so (1 hour of advertising) and that 50 minutes goes fast, always leaves me more. A great classic show that is underestimated in my book!
