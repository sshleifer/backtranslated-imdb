I really enjoyed this movie as a young child. At that age, I thought the foolish baseball antics were funny and that the movie was "cool" for sports. Now, a few years later, I can look back and see how a well-designed movie was. This movie opened my eyes as a small child to the struggle that other children deal with and real world issues. That kind of exposure is currently lacking in children's films that I don't think of the benefit of our society. Certainly the baseball antics now look really stupid, but they pulled in children. No seven years old will ask to see a movie about foster children, but they will ask to see a movie about baseball. Disney realized this fact and benefited from teaching these children an important lesson on the world. <br /> <br /> As a young adult, the performance of Al and the other angels seems far less impressive, but I will give credit to the actors who play both kids and Danny Glover, who have all done a fantastic job .
