From a modern sensibility it is sometimes difficult to watch older movies. It is annoying to watch the stereotypical wall-flower librarian who has to take off her glasses and become beautiful and stupid to win a man. Especially such a shallow and unstable man. He is, of course, a player (I don't want to trust him to stay true to her) who doesn't want to settle down, who just looks dumb attractive women and always calls them "baby" (me!). Even after she completely changed her look and life for him, he just went to her when he (presumably) was rejected by another woman and learned that Connie was spending all her money repairing a boat for him. I wanted her to get him up, not chasing him pathetically! His sudden switch within a few minutes was completely unrealistic and didn't work for me. <br /> <br /> Apart from the subplot, I had the movie. How can you not dance like sailors? (You can say they were from San Francisco .... D) The "rehearsal" dance was wonderful, while Ginger Rogers was deliberately entering and leaving the "real steps" big. The last dance scene "Face the Music" with its beautiful costumes and the art deco set was beautiful. And I really enjoyed "We've seen the sea" (though they've used it a few times, as if they realized it was their best song). <br /> <br /> Anyway, the plot was a bit poor, like most musicals (IMO) - and the songs were OK, but the dance was worth watching the movie. I wish they could have shown a few shots from San Francisco, because that was where the movie was supposed to be. <br /> <br /> It is also strange to see such a light-skinned movie with the knowledge of what Hitler is already doing about it. I must try to suspend all knowledge to immerse myself in a fantasy land.
