Whoopi was the only reason I watched the Oscars that year. She is hilarious. Of course there was a big serious side to the show. She was wonderful not only because she was funny but because she had said something that had to be said in a public forum. White people should be reminded that Hollywood awards are strategically balanced, ceremonies, employment and representation. There should not be a "black" award show. The white bread, milks players, nominators and judges should bring their heads into the sunshine and see that great material is not limited to "white" directors, producers, actors, etc. This is the bad taste of Woody Allen. He had no business. The fact of the matter is, this is the first Oscar presentation I watched as "The Color Purple" was for awards. That miscarriage of voice warned me to watch the programs until 2002. It is not to deny other providers. Billy Crystal is a riot.
