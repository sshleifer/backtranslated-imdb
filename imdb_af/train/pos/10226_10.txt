I was about 7 when I saw this movie first. It wasn't that special, but a few years later I saw it again and that time made it fun. <br /> <br /> I think the best parts of the movie are: Yeti's body language and the 'special effects' as well. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch this movie, don't wait for a Hollywood manufacturer, even this movie is made of about. $ 1000 :) <br /> <br /> I have a copy of it. Movie and video version too (But I don't think it's ever been seen in theaters) <br /> <br /> Watch It Enjoy! Yeti forever !!!
