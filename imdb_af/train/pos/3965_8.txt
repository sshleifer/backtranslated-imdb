The movie as entertainment is very good and Jimmy Stewart is excellent as Chip Hardesty, with well-co-scripted works by Vera Miles and Murray Hamilton. But the film, directed by legendary director Mervyn Leroy, is constantly witnessed and the approval of scripts as well as all aspects of the film, to clothing, has been carefully controlled and controlled by J. Edgar Hoover. Not that J. Edgar Hoover didn't have anything to be proud of. His management of the bureau from 1924 until his death went to the best investigative services in the world. But by 1959, Hoover began to worry about the enforcement and had already started collecting files on powerful people to protect his small kingdom. And he was determined to make sure no movie even showed a single wart over the desk. The films show only sustained success and brilliance over the failures that occurred, and the desk's share in the witches of the early 1950s. Enjoy the story, but with tongue firmly in the cheek.
