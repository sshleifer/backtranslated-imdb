I caught this movie on IFC, and I enjoyed it, though I feel the editing station was a bit rough, though it might have been deliberate. I had a bit of a hard time figuring out what was going on, as they seem to be a bit of a Pulp Fiction style nonlinear plot offer. However, it was a little forced. I definitely think the movie is worth watching, but I think it could have used some cleaning. Some scenes don't just seem meaningful to others. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised to see the score here as low as it is. It's not outstanding, but it doesn't really have serious problems. I gave it a 7/10. The film at least showed that Laurence Fishburne can act when he wants. They just had to tell him not to be in the Matrix movies.
