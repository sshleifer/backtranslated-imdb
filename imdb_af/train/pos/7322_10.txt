Halloween is one of those movies that gets your skin deep! It is in my opinion the scariest movie of all time. Michael Myers is the best bowman ever! He was just as scary! What makes Halloween so special is that there were no special effects where you could tell how the computer was animated, it was on a low budget and had a one note score, but managed to get hell out of people. fright. 25 years and this movie still has the same effect as in78. <br /> <br /> It's about a son Michael Myers, he kills his sister at the age of 6 and so many years later escapes the spiritual institution. Dr. Sam Loomis is after him and will do anything to get him back, as he describes Michael as "pure evil. The blackest eyes, the devil's eyes." However, Michael is on a mission to kill his other sister, Laurie, by a new Jamie Lee Curtis. She must be on Halloween baby, while her friends get apart and of course we know the rules, they get it! But Laurie can stand a chance because she is the virgin. ; D <br /> <br /> Halloween pays much tribute to Psycho, we have another character called Sam Loomis and Jamie Lee Curis, the daughter of Janet Leigh. Halloween is an absolutely fantastic movie that breaks borders and opens the doors, stores your windows and turns the lights off! "They're going to get you! They'll get you!". Halloween, the ultimate horror movie! <br /> <br /> 10/10
