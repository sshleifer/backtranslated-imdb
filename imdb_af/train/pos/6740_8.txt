The completely rounded character of the lead role of this movie, that of the cop unearthed by his past and on a path of self-destruction so clear to the viewer, is unique to his time, 1950. <br /> <br /> Along with the haunting music and the well-written plot, the film is an excellent example of film noir at its best. Close-ups of Dana's eyes reveal the fear inside, Karl Malden glorifies as his boss, who explodes no nonsense, but also sympathizes with those who are under his command in the area. <br /> <br /> Otto Preminger made this kind of movie just about his own. If there is any mistake, it will be with the breathtaking beauty of Gene Tierney who looks strangely out of place with the hardened cop. However, their scenes in the cafe are wonderful and true. <br /> <br /> Tom Tully, in the bit of her dad, is perfect as Gary Merrill as the hood. Great lighting and mood. The building where the deadly acts take place very atmospherically, I love the old woman in the basement. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10.
