SPOILERS This is a gripping film about greats. But who is who arrives here? When does the hunter become prey? This eager, dark film is slowly moving and seductive. It pulls you in and pulls you through the proverbial garden road, just to seduce you, just as you think you are safe. <br /> <br /> It has a sounding script, with good acting (at least of the lead). I didn't notice the background music, but it never crawled, so it had to be done right. <br /> <br /> I was very surprised that I like this movie because I don't usually go here, but this one sucked me in and held it to the end.
