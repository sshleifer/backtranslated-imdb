I think James Cameron can be my favorite director because it's my second review of his movies. Anyway, everyone remembers the RMS Titanic. It was big, fast and undamaged ... until April 1912. It was all about the news and one of the greatest tragedies ever. Well, James Cameron decided to make a movie, but died two fictitious characters in the spotlight instead of the ship. Well, on the main review, but let me remind you that it is all and no fact and the only thing that will be present is an event from the movie. So our two main characters are Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose (Kate Winslet). They are not too irritating, but watch it and you will find out why they can be irritating (http://tinyurl.com/ojhoyn). The biggest villain I think is accident, fate, hand of God (no blasphemy), or just Caledon Hockley (Billy Zane). Combine all of the above and what do you get? Oh yes! We get a love story on a sinking boat. The supporting characters are the following: My personal favorite, Mr. Andrews (Victor Garber), Lovejoy (David Warner), Murdoch (Ewan Stewart), Lightoller (Jonathan Phillips), Captain Smith (Bernard Hill), Molly Brown (Kathy Bates), and more. We also have today's treasure hunter, Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton). They add something to the story, something good. The action here is great, especially in the second half, the drama is also good. Eventually, your eyes may drop rainworms or quiet tears. The story is simple and it works. A treasure hunter seeks the Heart of the Ocean and rather finds a drawing of a woman wearing the said diamond. She calls and tells her story on the RMS Titanic. Two lovers separated by social class and finally the fate of the ship. Everything about the story works and there are very few mistakes. I give Titanic, an 86% awesome
