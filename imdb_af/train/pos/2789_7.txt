Bend it like Beckham is full of intriguing scenes, but has an overall predictable battle line. It's about a girl named Jess who is trying to reach her lifelong dream of becoming a well-known soccer player and finally getting the chance to position herself on a local team. There are so many boundaries and boundaries that she keeps faces that hold her back, but she is still determined and striving. I would recommend it to anyone who likes a nice light movie and wants to inspire what people can achieve. The song choices are really good, "shoot my child, just move on ... to your destination and you make boundaries and complications." Anyway, hope for your needs in a review.
