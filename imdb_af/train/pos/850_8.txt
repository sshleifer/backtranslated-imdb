THE MATADOR (2005) *** Pierce Brosnan, Greg Kinnear, Hope Davis, Philip Baker Hall, Dylan Baker. Brosnan gives one of his best non-Bondian roles as a middle-aged killer who is facing a mid-crisis, while being committed to Mexico's friendship with a square but lovely American businessman (Kinnear at its most favorable) way) and discover there is more to life than death. The latest movie maker Richard Shepard makes a solid big-screen debut with a splendid black comedy with a keen eye for visual detail and nuanced dialogue and character development that make him look at the breath-fresh air in the buddy Comedy '' formula awaiting its prospects and that Brosnan gets his ya yas with devilish joy. A sleeper jewel indie hit.
