Bo Derek's beauty and John Derek's revolutionary direction make this movie worthwhile. <br /> <br /> Bo, who looks more than ever, is a recent widowed woman who experiences visits from her "dead" man (Anthony Quinn). He has a plan. Above must get the body of a young man so that her ghost of a man can make his ghost transformation back to bodily life. Can she find a suitable candidate? How will she do him so Tony can do his thing? <br /> <br /> With Bo's features, John's unique direction, Quinn's film presence, and, thanks John, a very exotic look at the whole movie, this movie is pleasantly viewed.
