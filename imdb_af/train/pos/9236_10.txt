Let's think people, stop the original bad mouth, because time was the original Battlestar series a masterpiece, even with all the stars, story lines and art. Lorne Greene was wonderful like Adama and Richard Hatch was perfect like Apollo and Dirk Benedictus was funny like Starbuck, but I dare say not as beautiful as Katee as Starbuck. <br /> <br /> I loved the episode with the Pegasus and Greetings from Earth was good. John Calicos was wonderful as Baltar, War of the gods, best was Experiment in Terra. I thought it was a tribute in a way to wait for Heaven, then you have the women of Battlestar, not to compare them to say that Tricia is beautiful as Number Six, but Jane Seymour's beauty cannot be compared. Standing Loerrta Spang as Cassiopea was fantastic. She had beauty that a rainbow would be ashamed. I love the original as new. <br /> <br /> Can you imagine whether John Calicos had a number six? :) <br /> <br /> Thanks for listening.
