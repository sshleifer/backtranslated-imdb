"October Sky" is a movie that will steal your heart, your thoughts with sharp images and raise your mind. The story of Homer Hickham and his dream of creating a rocket only look so simple, especially if the film is in a video town, where the future is as clear as the lumps of coal in the mine. However, Homer can't follow in his father's footsteps. With the encouragement of me. Riley (a friendly teacher), members of his father's staff and his friends, Homer are trying to make his dream a reality. <br /> <br /> But as in any truth to life story, there are many stops on the way. Director Joe Johnston lowers us in the coal mines, where we testify to the cold fate of miners under a rock ceiling. With light helmets and curved posture, they looked more than humans in the dark as alien insecticides. The hacking cough of the miners and the black faces was a constant reminder of the danger faced by miners in their work. <br /> <br /> The contracting of the mining tube's air freight is the images of Homer and his friend's rocket launches. Under the blue bakkie, rockets are placed on a road and launched into the stratosphere. And nothing can match the scene when Homer sees Sputnik for the first time. <br /> <br /> But what makes the movie so engaging is the relationship between characters. Homer's father is a classic hardened man ... but he also has a soft side. We see that he loves his son, despite their many arguments. The love and support of Miss. Riley is also clear. Best of all, the movie is uncomfortable. It does not bind everything in a nice bow. It tears you, lift you up. It holds an air of reality, which is important in a movie like this. <br /> <br /> This movie can be regarded as a complete work. Initially, I was disappointed that the movie did not continue with Homer's life. I didn't want it to end. Then I realized ... that's what a good movie does for a person. If it did its job, you wouldn't want to end it. And "October Sky" just gets it.
