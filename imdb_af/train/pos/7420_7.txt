Although Kris Kristofferson is good at this role, who doesn't want to see Elvis Pressly rather? With the drug addiction and the fall of the highest celebrity, Elvis's agent might have rushed away from the movie, it was a mistake. It would have been a perfect movie for Elvis. Although the soundtrack is far from great, Paul Williams and Barbra Streisand do a decent job in creating an original soundtrack for this "period" piece / musical. Something of a love story, it's more of a drama about the fall of grace and the gift of salvation. Like most tragedies, the hero of the story is dead. Also, Gary Busey is once again perfect in a not so perfect role.
