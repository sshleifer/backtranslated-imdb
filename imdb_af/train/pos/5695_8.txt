Some movies almost survive on originality - "Wonderland" is definitely one of those movies. The writing succeeds in throwing everything in a chorus height, but without making it incoherent. The speed of this thriller cannot be chosen to cover a poor script, but to accurately reflect the drug addict's reality. <br /> <br /> As a director, James Cox, as a special way to work his actors. Most characters are constantly on the verge, and often because they are rather ugly personalities. Val Kilmer described John Holmes as a hustler who was able to manipulate and control. No offense to Kilmer, but his version of Holmes only seems to be able to control the severely weak. However, this is a beautiful show. Compared to Kilmer's more "Hollywood" roles as in "The Saint", it proves to be much more at home in eager indie movies. <br /> <br /> The actors are the main force that keeps everyone together. There are several small appearances that stand out - especially the women. Carrie Fisher, Kate Bosworth, and Lisa Kudrow all have a limited screen time next to their male counterparts, but they are all fantastic. Apart from Kilmer, Ted Levine and Dylan McDermott give a strange, wonderful energy to their roles. <br /> <br /> I originally watched Wonderland because I assumed it was a movie about a porn actor, in the strictest sense. Yes, the story revolves around John Holmes, but it literally has nothing to do with his professional career. This movie is basically a murder mystery and as such it is excellent. <br /> <br /> RATING: 7.5 out of 10
