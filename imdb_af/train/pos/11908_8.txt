This movie plays very well with an audience. Especially when the chase begins. Plus, Trevor Howard with his sensible, smart charms and Jean Simmons with her innocent attitude and piercing eyes is great together. <br /> <br /> The movie starts out as a psychological drama, but after the murder it is played in a chase player as the two lead to the border. Some may think the chase is superfluous, but actually the chase is essential because it relieves the spirit of the Jean Simmons character by getting her out of the oppressive household. It also helps to bring out the right killer - suddenly in such a position that they have to complete the job. The murderer rightly believed that when the Simmons character was arrested, she would be thrown away. And it is true that her lack of control in the household - as well as evidence that shows her - shows that she would not have received the murder allowance. The pursuit that follows helps to bring the truth out. <br /> <br /> It's an entertaining movie. Find out if you can find it.
