There is a political documentary, from recent vintage, called Why We Fight, which seeks to investigate the infamous Military Industrial Complex and its grip on this nation. It is considered both polemical and insightful to address its case against both the complex and the war phase we are currently involved in Iraq. Yet a much more well-known series of films of the same name was made during World War II by Hollywood director Frank Capra. Although considered documentary and Oscars in that category, this series of seven films is really just agitprop, more in line with Leni Reifenstal's Triumph Of The Will, where Screens recycle Capra for its own purposes. That said, it doesn't mean that it doesn't have essential information that subsequent generations of World War II lack documentary programs (such as the BBC's promise The World At War), and that also means its value as a primary source, the less valuable it is. They were skilled and, having recently bought some used DVDs at a discount store, I had the opportunity to choose a free DVD with my purchase. I selected Goodtimes DVD's four DVD collection of the series. <br /> <br /> Rare is something free so valuable. While there are no extras on the DVDs and the sound quality of the prints varies, these movies provide insight into the minds of Americans two-thirds of a century ago when racism was open (as in many of the classic Warner Brothers projects) war cartoons of the era, and there was nothing wrong with blatant distortion of facts. The seven films produced between 1942 and 1945 are Prelude To War, The Nazis Strike, Divide And Conquer, The Battle Of Britain, The Battle Of Russia, The Battle Of China And War Comes In America. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie series is worth watching, not just for the obvious reasons, but for the subtle things it reveals, such as using the plural for terms like X million when It refers to dollars, rather than the modern singular, or the most over-exploited graphic in the whole series - a Japanese sword that penetrates the center of Manchuria. Yet it also shows the complexity of trying to apply previous standards to current wars. The lesson of the First World War (avoiding strange scattering) did not apply to World War II. The own lesson (early in the dictatorship) does not apply to the three major wars that America has fought since: Korea, Vietnam, and Iraq. The fact that many of these series relate to the uncertainties of the times in which it is made merely highlights its historical value in today's information-obscured times. It cannot help you sort out the truth from the lies and propaganda of today, but you will at least realize that you are not the first in such a difficult position, nor will you be the last.
