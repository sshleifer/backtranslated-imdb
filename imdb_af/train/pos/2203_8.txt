I also loved this series when I was a child. In 1952 I was 5 and my family always watched this show. My favorite character was the one who played Marion Lorne as a very stuttering, clumsy and very sweet auntie-type person. I can remember her "ubba bubba um um" type of remarks because she will try to say something important. And when she came back and played aunt Clara in Bewitched, it was wonderful! <br /> <br /> It was the first time I could see Walter Matthau whose career I had been a fan for many years. <br /> <br /> I have a question if anyone can verify: was the title or end credits playing the "Swedish Rhapsody" by Hugo Alfven? Every time I hear it on my classic radio station here in Southern California, it brings memories of the image of Mr. Peepers with his back to the camera. I'm not even sure if this image is correct in my head.
