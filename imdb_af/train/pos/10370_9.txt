Some movies seem to be made before we're ready for them. While watching this movie, in 1988, in 1999, I thought I had the O.J. Simpson debacle (though I have many different opinions about the innocence of individuals in each situation). <br /> <br /> The Australian news media, if this movie is to be believed, has devastated the case of a possible childhood and truth. It was frightening to see the scenes of invasive, floating media hordes, ridiculous accounts of half-truths and lies and debates on the alleged merit of the case by people at all levels of society. <br /> <br /> Equally frightening is the media's portrayal as indifferent and incomprehensible to the technical information in the case. I wish more of the issue of religious prejudice in the case (the accused is Seventh-day Adventist). <br /> <br /> Today, these circuses have become commonplace, but it only makes the lesson more important. /> <br /> Stripe is excellent as usual, and it's the best I've ever seen Sam Neill. The Aussie accent is sometimes temporary but not incomprehensible.
