I am amazed at the negative comments I have read and can only accept that the people who make such comments were less than honest. It is the most moving and true portrayal of Joseph Smith I have ever seen. It was well behaved to the point that I sometimes forgot that I was watching a movie. It brought Joseph's life of hardship, good-natured optimism, lasting faith in people and God, and ultimate sacrifice to life, in a way that left me frank and quiet in awe. If anyone from any Christian religion can see this movie without being touched positively, I must say it is a reflection of the individual and NOT the movie. I give the movie a "10" and encourage honest souls to see it. At least it is a very warm depiction of man who gave everything he had for what he believed. In a world where values ​​and beliefs become ridiculous, this movie stands as a lasting reminder of the kind of people we suppose to make no matter what religious beliefs we hold.
