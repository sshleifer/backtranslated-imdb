Although too young to remember the first show of the series (I'm just a baby), later on in the late 80's, I repeated it on television just when I was interested in the war and all its aspects. It was my grandfather who showed me the series and also gave me my first interests, related to stories of his time in the Royal Navy in Malta and later in the Pacific. Since then, I have devoured many books and seen many television series over World War II, with mixed opinions. The British television stations are generally very good at producing it, as the World at War can easily testify, with many gems made by the BBC and independent companies. I strongly recommend such titles as "The Nazis - A Warning From History", "Blitz" and the BBC series on Dunkerque. "Britain in color in color", with its companion series "Japan", "Germany" and "America" ​​is of a very high standard. World War is by far the best and, despite his age, never fails to deliver. There will always be new revelations about the war, which of course will no longer be in the series. Of course, this is not included in the series and, of course, World War II took on such a huge canvas that a series was compiled with every detail that would require more time and money than any other, even if such a business was possible. What I feel I have to say to those who deny that it doesn't include everything is that The World At War can't do it physically as a series, but it can certainly ask you to do further research and enjoy it. make. It certainly worked for me: I now have a very comprehensive library of books, videos, DVDs and tapes and CDs. Recommend anyone with even a passing interest. The series was so well-made that it was difficult for them to disagree that it was quality programming and highly informative.
