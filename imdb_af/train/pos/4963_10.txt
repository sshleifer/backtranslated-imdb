Leave it to Braik to present a good performance. Eventually he and Zorak live their own lives outside the Spac Ghost Coast to Coast. I must say that I both enjoy these shows very much. They are completely mature adults. Brak made it great with an album released in the year 2000. It may not be platinum, but its performance was very popular with tons of people out there who show love for adults. I must say that out of all the Adult Swimming Shows without plot, it must be the one with the most no plot ever made. That's why I enjoy it so much, it's just a classic in Adult Swimming History. I think it's just a good performance if you don't like it. Hey there were tons that hated it and tons that loved it.
