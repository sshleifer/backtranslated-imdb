First, if you intend to watch it, make sure you look at the UNCUT version (although it is very interesting to go back and then watch the scenes tampered with), make it a big difference . This film is about a young woman, played by Barbara Stanwyck, who has been forced to prostitution by her father for 14 years. When her father suddenly passes, she can come out alone in the world. After reading Nietzsche's philosophies about life, she uses her sexuality to manipulate men to give her what she wants and leave them in ruins and desperation for her love. Throughout the movie she is becoming increasingly materialistic and manipulative and the audience starts to wonder, she has some sense of morality. Overall, Baby Face is a very shocking movie with blatant sexuality scenes that most people would not expect to see in a black and white film. While no sexual acts are explicitly shown on the screen, it is very clear what happens to the camera. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed watching this movie and I think most modern audiences will at least enjoy a bit of pleasure, especially with the movies shocking. I thought as I watched the pacing look a bit slow on parts, but I think for the first time most movies are seeing them. Actually, I think almost all the movies I've seen from the early 30's had some small pacing problems or some parts just didn't have the right to flow. It was probably just the craft of making movies yet perfect? It will only take a few years. Compare a movie from 1939 and compare it to an early 30's movie and I think you'll see what I mean. <br /> <br /> Again, I am very happy to see the original track. It really makes a big difference. Any John Wayne fans would also be surprised to see him in this movie before being known in an uncharacteristic role.
