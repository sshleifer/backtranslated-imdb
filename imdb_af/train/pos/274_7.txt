I look at most movies that Nick Mancuso is, because I'm honest, I love the man, even though he is usually thrown as the bath. (Long-term fans should note that he is somehow blond in this movie). This is a fairly well-known movie in terms of plot (but then most movies are not exactly original), but Rick Roberts is appealing because the imperfect man, Martha MacIsaac, is as attractive as the daughter and Mitzi Kapture do. a good job, if it was her purpose, to be angry and sometimes pretty hard to keep. Nick still has it in terms of both charm and psychosis. However, too much of the plot places screen-like motivation, past behavior, good times and bad times - and things that are clear to the characters never make it to the audience (ie). The final scene leaves everything to be desired in the "but of ..." category, and generally I can't say that I care about any characters. It is said, that was what it was - a pretty entertaining way to spend the afternoon - and I still love Nick.
