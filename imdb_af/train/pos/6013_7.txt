To see it again after a gap of many years and to remember the flop, it was at its original release. I'm amazed at how well it got. One of the reasons for the failure was that one generation just thought it was about staggering shit and a younger one was disappointed that it didn't show the full hippie glory. Now, it is clear that Antonioni was already aware of and fascinated by the fierce mix of fiery enthusiasm for change and a lack of a clear vision for the future. The main pair is excellent and it is disgraceful that they have taken so much flak for the film's perceptible failure. They are ideal and perfectly convey the various contradictions and demonstrate a wonderful joy in love stories. I blame others for over-emphasizing the student-uprising races at the beginning, but have to say that from here one of the directors is the most beautiful photos and he definitely has the best of man-made and natural provinces. Oh, and I didn't even mention the highly explosive end.
