Gender Bender sex stuff a bit for the x files. This episode has an interesting foreground, a good story, but an end to it. Gender Bender is also the x-files debut for actor Nicholas Lea, better known as Alex Krycek. In this episode he plays Michael, a man attacked by one of The Kindred. You should see this episode just to see Nic Lea's less than spectacular start. An interesting thing about the Kindred's "power of temptation". When Marty does it to his victims, they are changed to him / her. However, if Andrew seduces Scully, she's just because she's oriented and coarse, and not attracted to Andrew. Maybe it's because Marty has more experience about it than Andrew. This episode reminds me why it would be miserable to film in British Columbia. During the episode, it was so wet, morning and muddy, it couldn't be much fun. Despite the disappointing end, Gender Bender is still a decent episode to watch.
