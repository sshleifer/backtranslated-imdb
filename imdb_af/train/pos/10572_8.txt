I have a feeling that the Warners Bros Depression era musicals will become much more relevant in the next few years. Yes, we are in the economic doldrums (or have you lived under a rock) and times seem pale. But we always have the movies as a way to escape our problems. In the 30's, filming was very popular, even at the height of economic gloom. "Footlight Parade (1933)" was one such audience that flocked audiences. While these Lloyd-minded musicals do not pose the social problems of the time as "Gold Diggers or 1933 (1933)", it is still a wonderful appearance of talent. We have to wait until the end of the movie for the three mid-sized Busby Berkely incredible numbers, but boy, are they worth waiting for me. Yes, little Ruby Keeler is a terrible singer and actress, and her tapping is so-so, but Busby's magical "By A Waterfall" whispers her, and what seems to be one hundred other choir girls, in a dizzying water wonderland. Of course, Busby's numbers can never really be performed at one stage (they represent the gravitational circles for one thing), and they frightfully contrast with the realism of the difficult, wasteful, non-musical scenes. And "Footlight" also has James Cagney at one of his too few musical (really, what can the man do?). He even gets from the leading man to take over, not a sailor dress, and about the sex pot Shanghai Lil (which is really wedge Ruby in China girl!). He is co-starring with Joan Blondell, his worshiping secretary who somehow views Cagney in favor of other women (to the final rule, that is). Blondell was apparently the only other woman who loved Cagney of his wife. And you can see the mutual worship in every scene.
