An excellent and accurate film ... McGovern painfully examines and documents and pays his writing. He is not afraid to tell the truth, although it can make unfavorable reviews and comments from some who like to keep stories clean and bright and shiny. <br /> <br /> Again, McGovern brings in Christopher Eccleston, though not as high a profile as he played in Hillsborough. I did this movie so accurately, well done and well presented as Hillsborough and I rejoice McGovern for his terribly unapologetic writing. Well done and my hat is off for the writer, the actors, the production team. A good movie!
