I loved this movie. I thought it would be easy to watch, and easy to forget. I ran after watching it to buy the DVD, not forgetting it easily! <br /> <br /> The writing is brilliant, and the casting couldn't be perfect anymore. Every character has their moment, and I walked hard throughout this movie. Comic timing was spot-on. <br /> <br />
