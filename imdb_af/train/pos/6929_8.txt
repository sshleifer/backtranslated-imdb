Watched this movie on ENCW last night for the third or fourth time. Enjoy it as much as I have ordered the DVD. It's really an outing and, of course, the first of the Mann-Stewart games. More here than the ordinary breeder, though not quite as powerful as The Searchers. Very obvious symbolism of achieving masculinity, but mainly it is by Stewart, his partner Millard Mitchell, Shelly Winters and Waco Johnny Dean Dan Duryea. Steve Miller (not the Joker) is interesting, as a handsome hero would be interested in Lola, but too yellow. Like Stewart in the man who killed the Liberty Valance, he was nearly reduced to putting an apron and serving his enemies coffee. Decaf no doubt. Tony Curtis of the Bronx Cavalry and Rock Hudson act like no Indian I've seen on the screen, has interesting cameos. <br /> <br /> Special Shows by John McIntire as a Happy Card Dealer / Gun Dealer at a very low grade Western version of Rick's American Cafe. Nobody wants to spend the night there. Jay C. Flip out on a kiss from Lola (Winters) and has some nice scenes with Stewart before joining Bend of the River and Far Country. Will Geer as Wyatt Earp and the Indian Chief who take Walter Brennan's teeth from him in Red River are pleasant observations. This is the kind of Western that could only have pulled Stewart, not Wayne or Scott. Worth the shot, I repeat. :-)
