I had a lot of experience with women in Russia, and this film shows how many of them are, unfortunately. They are very cunning, relentless and greedy, as well as highly unfair. From the robot sex, the hustling for gifts, the lies and betrayal, I experienced it all in Russia. <br /> <br /> I know what I'm talking about. And here are my qualifications: Here is the photo journal of my three trips to Russia looking for a bride. It contains thousands of photos of very hot Russian girls I met, black comedy, scams I was involved with, and the story of my overpowering and appearance on Russian national TV. <br /> <br /> http: //www.happierabroad .com / Photojournals.htm <br /> <br /> It's like Reality TV. You're going to love it. I spent a lot of time adding it. So check this out. The Russian woman who plays Nicole Kidman is much like Julia and Katya in my photo journals. <br /> <br /> My 3 wedding rides in Russia are very exciting and will sell, so why don't they make a movie from my bride looking for adventures in Russia? However, there is one factual impossibility in this movie, and that is the way the man orders his bride out of a catalog and arrives at an airport. It doesn't work that way, so I don't understand why the media wants to endure it. There is not a single Russian bride introduction site that works this way, and I challenge someone to find one who does. The fact is, you can only order the Russian lady's CONTACT INFO (email, address, phone number, etc.) from the site. From there you agree and then visit her. If you want to bring her to your country, start the immigration process at your INS office and wait months after that. So it works in real life. You can't just order her to arrive at your airport. American Immigration will NEVER allow such a thing. <br /> <br /> WuMaster <br /> <br /> - I have everything I wanted by going abroad! You can too! http://www.happierabroad.com
