I watched this movie so many times through my little capsule that I can see the dialogue properly today. And if I see it now, it just makes me laugh and laugh. I think it's amazing how they managed to train animals especially the cat, so they can play the leading role in a feature film. Looking at it now, I can unfortunately also notice that this is not the masterpiece I have ever imagined. But I prefer to remember how I felt about it when I was younger to watch it on VHS on my fist TV that would cloud the image. And taking that into account, it's a kid's movie, so I'll definitely give it 10/10.
