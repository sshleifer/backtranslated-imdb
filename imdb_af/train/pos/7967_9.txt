It's definitely one of the greatest Disney movies ever made. It is a real pleasure for anyone. It will make you laugh, it will make you cry, and it will put you in tension. <br /> <br /> Basically, Homeward Bound's three household pets are being sent to live on a farm. while their owners are on holiday. They do not know what is going on and desperately want to go home, escape from the farm and try to find their home through the desert. <br /> <br /> This is one of the last movies Don Ameche dies in. He provided the voice of Shadow, the old, wise and friendly golden retriever. Also in this movie, Sally Field was the voice of Sassy, ​​the Himalayan cat. But seriously, what this movie is about is the chance! Feeling by Michael J. Fox (my all-time favorite actor). Chances are basically everything you love from a dog, yummy, energetic and goofy. Every time I watch this movie, it's because of Chance; It's like the comedy never ends! <br /> <br /> This movie is also sometimes very sad. It sometimes reminds people of the times when they were alone or when they lost their pets. <br /> <br /> One scene that always puts me in tension is the scene where the pound of the pound escapes; I especially feel shocked at the part where Chance grabs his collar in the fence and hardly does it. The movie has other exciting moments, but no one seems to me more exciting than that one. <br /> Overall, this is a wonderful family movie. If you enjoy this movie, you'll probably also enjoy the sequel. I give this movie a solid 9 out of 10!
