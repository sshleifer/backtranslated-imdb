I saw this movie. This movie is best according to today's need. Groom in marriage is the big problem these days. When mentioning this problem, this movie is the best. In this movie, the Indian values ​​are set very well. Today's youth must understand this problem. There are fewer population girls. And because of this groom's problem, the girls committed suicide. If this problem persists, the day when there is no girl child is not far away. So, remember this statement, today's youth must understand that we cannot marry a groom. We must learn from this movie that the dowry should not be taken. And if we understand this problem, we can see the new trend in society. This is the great change in society.
