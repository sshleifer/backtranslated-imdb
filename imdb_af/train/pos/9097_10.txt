I gave this movie such a high point because it was really cute, really funny, while it was unpretentious. I went to see this movie when it was playing in the Philly area, and it was the hub of a wonderful evening with friends. The film is well written and performed well, though it does feel like a sitcom rather than a movie that doesn't take off the movie. You won't find any comedies like this, where you shouldn't shock people to be funny. The film revolves around an Ucranian housekeeper who finds herself for a young couple in need of help. Although she initially helped, she soon added more madness to their lives, after which the couple negotiated. Things are getting more and more out of control until .... you'll have to see! The villain laughed me even after I left the theater. This movie just puts me in a good mood. I can't wait for it to be released on DVD because I want this movie in my collection.
