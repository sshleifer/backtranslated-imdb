I finally set myself up on mail order DVD rentals so I could get movies that weren't available in the stores. I chose The Souler Opposite because I like Christopher Meloni, and also of small, often ignored films. <br /> <br /> This one is such a treat! Meloni has such charm in this part. It's easy to make a pigeon. He ever sees you as his alter ego Elliot Stabler (LOSVU). In this movie, Meloni is an unmatched midwife who hits the slopes in many ways, just to find a way to happiness in someone who is unexpected. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Barry (Meloni) and Tim Busfield's character is realistic and not over. I have never seen Busfield, and he was nice to watch. But it was Chris's movie. I became such a fan girl again. <br /> <br /> It's a bit slow in the beginning, I will admit. I thought some of the "flashbacks" could have been edited. But in general, this movie will entertain you - male or female - as it has an honest, refreshing display of relationships today.
