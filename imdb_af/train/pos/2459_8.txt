A beautiful and touch movie that deserves a wider look than it probably will. Semra Turan plays Aicha, a second-generation Turkish immigrant, who tries to break the shape. Not only at home with her moderate conservative Muslim family, or with her liberal Danish friends, Aicha's martial arts experience becomes a struggle to find herself and have the power to let herself be what she wants to be despite both family and friends. <br /> <br /> Director Natasha Arthy manages introspection and narration so that it can have depth without becoming a panicky philosophical discourse. By settling Xian Gao's choreography skills, he pays in spectacular battle order. In the end, however, it is Semra Turan's beautiful debut performance that gives this movie spirit. Raw charisma and required martial arts skills are complimented on making her personal drama credible. <br /> <br /> Well worth it.
