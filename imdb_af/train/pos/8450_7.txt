Wasn't really bad for Raw's first PPV of 006. But the end was really shocking to anyone attending and watching at home. <br /> <br /> FIRST MATCH-RIC FLAIR USA. EDGE W / LITA FOR THE WWE INTERCONTINENTAL CHAMPIONSHIP Not a bad opener, these two can seriously jeopardize a game if they had more time to play a wrestling match. Flair won by DQ after Edge relaxed with his MITB briefcase. 3/10 SECOND MATCH-TRISH STRATUS USA. MICKIE JAMES FOR THE WWE WOMAN'S CHAMPIONSHIP Not bad, note that this is the first time these Divas have been sitting together in the ring. Mickie goes for a custom Chick Kick, but Trish duck and nails her own Chick Kick for the win to retain her title. 3/10 THIRD MATCH TRIPLE H VS. BIG SHOW Very well, this game really was. The entire game HHH focuses on Big Show's injured arm, but Big Show is still fighting back. Later, HHH can lay down a pedigree for the victory. 5/10 FOURTH MATCH-SHELTON BENJAMIN W / MAMA USA. VISCERA {This was a bonus game} Not so bad, it was good. After Viscera was down, Benjamin's mother, behind the referee, had a wallet that had the bricks in it. And Viscera beat it three times. Viscera got up to get stuck with Benjamin's spinning head for victory against the big man. 4/10 <br /> <br /> FIFTH MATCH-JERRY 'THE KING' LAWLER VS. GREGORY HELMS Drilling, still a sloppy. Both men didn't really make a good effort. Jerry Lawler wins after a Fist Drop for victory. 2/10 <br /> <br /> SESDE MATCH-TORRIE Wilson USA. VICTORIA USA. ASHLEY VS. MARIA VS. CANDICE MICHELLE IN A FIRST WINNER VALUE POWER It was quite entertaining to me. Ashley (Candice) finally rejects Candice to win the first Women's Gauntlet match. 5/10 Seventy MATCH-JOHN CENA USA. CHRIS MASTERS USA. CARLITO USA. SHAWN MICHAELS USA. KANE VS. KURT ANGLE W / DAIVARI IN A ELIMINATION ROOM MATCH FOR THE WWE CHAMPIONSHIP It was a cool Elimination chamber match. But nothing will last year's Elimination Chamber, which was best. The last three are Masters, Cena & Carlito. Carlito turns his back on Masters and gets a role on him to eliminate him. Seconds get Cena a role on Carlito for the three score to win the Elimination Chamber and retain his WWE title. But his night was not over yet. 7/10 After the match, Vince McMahon comes out and congratulates Cena for his victory. Vince McMahon states that his night is not over, and says that Edge is giving money in his Money In The Bank opportunity to challenge Cena for the title. Edge comes out with Lita, gives the briefcase to Vince and heads off in the ring, because Cena has another game to go tonight. <br /> <br /> ATTENTION MATCH-JOHN CENA VSA. EDGE W / LITA FOR THE WWE CHAMPIONSHIP {Cena opened at the room match} is immediately cut by Edge, Edge and nails A spear on Cena goes for the cover and to his shock Cena breaks. Edge Nails Other Spies & Decks for the Shocking Three Score as he hit Cena & won the WWE Championship for the first time in his career. 1/10 So last year's New Years Revolution was better than this year, but it was still right. The EC match was also good and the shocking edge of Edge money in his MITB event is definitely the most shocking on the PPV show. <br /> <br /> Overall: I give it 7/10 and a C
