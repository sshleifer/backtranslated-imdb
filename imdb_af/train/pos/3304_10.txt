This movie is one of the few indian movies that never fades with the passage of time, nor will it ever diminish its game-binding appeal, just as the Indian movie turns into the abyss of artificial style culture while drill-oriented extras take to improve the PT style movie songs. <br /> <br /> The cinematography speaks of the excellent skills of Josef Werching emphasizing the monumental and biographical magnitude of the film as a whole. <br /> <br /> Gone are the days of big movie, when every scene has to be cut many times and retreats must be taken before it is finalized, while the scenes have been meticulously attended to. Some of his striking scenes are filled with sublime emotional intensity, as is the case when Meena Kumari refuses to say "YES" as an approval for Nikah (Marriage Bond) and climbs down the mountain as he runs into traumatized madness. Right now, Raj Kumar is following her, and a strong whirlwind blows away the veil of Kumari and on the legs of Kumar ........ <br /> Kamal Amrohi will always be remembered with golden words in the annals of Indian Cinema's history, trying to complete this movie in a record environment for 12 years. He had to film the filming of some of the important songs without Meena's close ups, as the lead star Meena Kumari was terminally ill and fought for her life early in 1971.
