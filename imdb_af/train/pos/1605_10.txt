"Moonstruck" is one of the best movies ever. I own the movie on DVD! The movie is about a New York widow (Cher) who falls in love with her boyfriend (Danny Aiello )'s fierce brother (Nicholas Cage) working at a bakery. I'm glad Cher won an Oscar for that movie. Nicholas Cage and Danny Aiello are also wonderful. The direction of Norman Jewison (who directed "Fiddler On The Roof") is fantastic. "Moonstruck" is an excellent movie for everyone to see and laugh. A must-see! <br /> <br /> 10/10 stars!
