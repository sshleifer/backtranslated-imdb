He glorified himself as a great supporter in `Glory '. He proved that he was not a Malcolm in the Middle mediocre actor in Malcolm X. He showed his brotherly love in Philadelphia. "He had a game," he drew no bumps and hit us like a hurricane in the hurricane. He gave us effective Thespian Education in Training Day, and now he has shown that he could do it! Denzel Washington's director debut "Antwone Fisher" is the most moving film of the year. This tearjerker`s fisher story is not related to the debacle that happened in the 4th quarter with the Miami Dolphins against the New England Patriots in the last match of the 2002 season. Unlike the Dolphin tragedy, Antwone Fisher has an emotional joyful conclusion. The film is based on a true story about a young naval officer who has a rage problem because of the aversion he had as a foster child. Denzel plays the flood psychologist who helps Antwone overcome his anger and convinces him to find his natural mother. Derek Luke's debut performance as Antwone is the best admirable play I've ever seen by a beginner actor. I actually saw the detailed eccentricities in Luke's scene as I saw in Washington's performances. It was as if Washington Luke-la la la Luke was telling me, I'm your acting father. Ok! I'll write the Star Wars jokes before my readers send me to a galaxy far away. He speaks of the great Denzel, his work as a psychologist was masterful. But what can you expect from acting "Master D" himself. "Antwone Fisher" was written by none other than Antwone Fisher himself. The emotional pathos he put into his storyline's script was of "fisher king" material. I pick up the head. Washington 'to catch the right bait in' Antwone Fisher '. ***** Excellent
