Clean family-oriented movie. I laughed, I cried ... I loved it. I was worried that I couldn't see Steve Carrell as nothing but good-hearted Michael of The Office. Boy, was I wrong. He has to win an Oscar for his performance. I will definitely buy it on DVD if it comes out. My husband enjoyed it and he is not in movies of this type. I saw it with 2 other couples in the 30-year-old series and we all agreed it was the best movie we've seen in a long time and definitely the cleanest. Only 1 cuss word! Not even why it was PG13. I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves comedy, drama, romance and more!
