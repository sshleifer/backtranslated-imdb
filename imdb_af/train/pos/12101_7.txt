I remember seeing this movie at the West End Theater in Louisville, Kentucky, when I was a boy. The scene where dr. Carmus found the gardener's coffin, and the breathing dead body in it, was the scariest part of the movie for me, only enhanced by the darkness of the film. I also wondered about the people hanging at the end of the trees, until I recognized the part of the movie in which Blackblood's Blackwoods family name was changed, because in the family history there was a character known for its many hangings from different people. Mr. Thomas Blackwood was planning to add his kicks to the death his family caused. I also noticed that if Foster first entered the gate of the cemetery, he was careful not to notice the sharp object of the gate where he came to his end. I would not hesitate to recommend this movie to horror movie lovers.
