This is a story that could really happen, given the right circumstances. Street entertainer who gets the attention of famous opera star and friendship. The aging artist finds / buys a male child to pass his art. From there we follow through the trouble of their challenging but free life along the river. Travel village to town, he feeds and has some notorious. Despite the times and the influences, the man is beautiful and good. <br /> <br /> Overall, the performances are the first time, especially Xu Zhu, depicting the street show. The child (Renying Zhou) is beautiful, and straightforward and resists the overt bias. The two protagonists, along with supporting help from the kind of opera singer, Master Liang (an interesting androgenic Zhao Zhigang), paint a very interesting story of forgiveness, sadness and love. Some have called the deviant similarities of this movie to BA WANG BIE JI (FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE); Yet this film cannot stand alone. Any agreement is at its best at its best. <br /> <br /> My only blame for the KING OF MASKS is the end. It was poor, cliche and about as subtle as a sledge hammer. The audience was already wrapped up in the story, what was the unnecessary manipulation? What a pity. To bring such a fine movie, just to give to emotional (and stingy) pathos like that. It honestly made this movie good, instead of the classic, it should have been. In addition, the KING OF MASKS is well worth the effort. I was happy to see the Shaw Brothers still producing good movies. Highly recommended.
