Make it Right: This is one of my favorite movies of all time. I'm relatively unaware of David Mamet's (writer and director) other works, but after watching this movie half a dozen (it's always a joy to watch), I can say without hesitation that he's a genius. This film is extremely well written, and quickly turns you into the environment of fraud, art and back room. The feel of the film is very similar to The Sting (1973) and it also pays tribute to film noir. <br /> <br /> It is quite a psychologically complex movie and will definitely remind you of the various plot shots and motifs of the shady characters. It is sometimes predictable, but the shocking climax is always exciting to watch. <br /> <br /> Overall, the play is fantastic - especially Joe Mantegna - but someone I watched the movie noticed that it's not a good idea to have a heroine (Lindsay Crouse) which is not just a player, a smoker and a thief, but also a bad 80's hair card sport. I agree, but I think she is still outstanding in the role. The less you know about the plot of this movie, the better, just like Mamet's most recent movie, The Spanish Prisoner, because the end will be even more impressive. Just sit back and be prepared to take a ride through a movie that is dangerously close to brilliance.
