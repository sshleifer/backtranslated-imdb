The story of the immeasurable actor like a great soldier, saving the lives of hundreds if not thousands, is told in the 1939 movie "Gunga Din". Based on the Rudyard Kipling poem, the film is brilliantly directed by George Stevens and stars Cary Grant, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Victor Mclagen. The title role is played by Sam Jaffe, known in my era as Ben Casey's boss, Dr. Zorba, a name that has become synonymous with large, out of control hair. Say "Dr. Zorba's hair" to any of my generation and they know what you're talking about. <br /> <br /> In India at the time of the British profession, three soldiers - two romantic, stomping figures in Grant and Fairbanks, and McLagen as a big sky - are cuts - in fact, three overgrown boys. Gunga Din is the aquifer, which is somewhat intended - verbally, anyway - by McChesney (McLaglen), but Cutter (Grant) loves him. When he catches Din (pronounced Dane) to be his soldier, walks and greets while he monitors the unity during his maneuvers, Cutter gives him some tips. <br /> <br /> The cheerful band of musketeers will break when Ballantine (Fairbanks) announces he will be married to a lovely young woman (Joan Fontaine) and leave the service. However, when Gunga Din and Cutter walk over the Home, a murderous cult led by a guru (Eduardo Cianelli) escapes Gunga Din to warn the unit. Ballantine insists on registering to save Cutter. It is a friendship. <br /> <br /> "Gunga Din" starts lightly with a slapstick and wonderful, broad comedy, especially by Cary Grant, who is quite funny. Both he and Fairbanks are so attractive, it's hard to decide which one to look at first. Many of the film is made up of huge action sequences that are very exciting. In the latter part, the story becomes very dramatic and culminates in a tense, exciting battle. <br /> <br /> Grant has the best-known role, Fairbanks is the lovesick romantic, and McLaglen as McChesney, mainly due to his treatment of Gunga Din, is the most untouchable character, although one delivers his gentle heart. find his love for his elephant Annie. His meekness comes to the end of the movie, especially in the very touching, tearing final scene. <br /> <br /> Always a gentle and sweet actor, Sam Jaffe gives a gorgeous show as Gunga Din, a simple, brave man with a big smile, powerful imagination and lofty dreams. Without much dialogue, Jaffe Gunga carries Din's soul wonderfully. <br /> <br /> It's truly the ultimate adventure movie, massive range, with good plays, exciting scenes, a great musical score and some beautiful movies. Another of that remarkable year, 1939. Highly recommended.
