A highly atmospheric cheapest, showing good ingenuity in using props, sets and effects (dung, lighting, focus) to create an exciting and moody texture. The story is packed, the acting is only functional, but it shows how imaginative effects can develop a whole visual story. This movie is recommended for its mood and texture, not for its story.
