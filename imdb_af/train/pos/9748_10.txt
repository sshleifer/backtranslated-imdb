I saw this movie when it was 17 years old and in classic rock (still) ... <br /> <br /> I never had opera because I hated soprano voices, but he changed it all . He was rich in the movie and had such a wonderful voice. <br /> <br /> I heard at CNN that he was dead tonight at the home of pancreatic cancer, he will be missed, and he certainly left his mark on this world. <br /> <br /> I hope to buy it movie if I can find, watch and enjoy it. * Smile * Maybe I should go to Amazon.com and look before it is sold out.
