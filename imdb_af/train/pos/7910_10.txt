When it first came out, my dad brought it home. We were surprised. It was so different from what we've seen before. I was looking for a specific movie last night, and I found The Mind's Eye again. The box falls apart, and I'm surprised the band is still working! Although it is not Nemo quality graphics, it is still very good. They have to sell it again - it's a landmark for computer animated images. Highly recommended!
