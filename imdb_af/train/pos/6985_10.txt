I must say, as a SCR fan I wasn't exactly sure what I would think of this show. I saw tonight (on the big screen at the Arclight theater) as part of the Paley Center performances, and the filmmakers talked after the weeks. Ron Moore said they wanted to make a clean break from Battlestar and do something else, and yes, they will lose some fans, but hopefully they will get others. <br /> <br /> Even without their talk, I am now a fan of the new show. But here's what I thought of the movie. <br /> <br /> I loved it. It was really good. I think I'm a true sci-fi (or "syfy" - should I really type it?) Because I looked it all as a series. It has a strong and rich story and has kept my interest. <br /> <br /> It starts with a small group of teens who notice something that was the worst part to me and a bit confusing. The actor who played 'Ben' gave us a glimpse of his intense beliefs. The actress playing 'Zoe' looks a bit positive, but she played a teenager (and I'm sure I won't be the only one who thought "Zoe" was a silo at first, dangers to a BSG geek. If they hope this will be the new Bamber / Helfer. / Park, they might want to reconsider it. Surprisingly, these were the adults who caught the audience's attention. <br /> <br /> Eric Stoltz gives a star performance as Daniel Greystone, a man so haunted by his family tragedy that he jumps at the first chance to get out of his life and not let go. He does a cold and surprising job of wearing his character's clever knowledge of the inner world of computers and people, especially in a scene in which he played a web for the young teenage friend of his daughters, dropped her and dismissed her. and release. No sign at all the "serial killer" he played on Grey's Anatomy, really impressive acting. <br /> <br /> Even so, it's not as much as Paula Malcomson as his wife, Amanda Greystone. She is just as clever and well-written and beautifully played as Stoltz's part, and I totally believed they were a few, and a couple who were together forever and had a strong relationship, something that is rarely seen . I look forward to seeing what happens to this family and hope they will give her as much as Roslin in BSG. She is strong and smart and when she streaks on her child, you scream, it's really great. Not to mention her eyes, which can hold magical powers, is how intense they are. The scene where she takes the government agent - very short scene, but played beautifully - gives you an idea of ​​her strength. <br /> <br /> The other part of the show that didn't work 100% for me was the screens with Esai Morales, and the mafia-type stem of its. He did a good job overall, but I didn't believe in this mobs power, nor was he intimidated by their threats. I found myself finding this whole story line a little more mysterious and difficult to find out; The way it is presented is almost a tribute to the Godfather. They hit you a little over the head. But I can see how it will develop into an interesting "top / bottom" thing, with the poor minorities (Morales et al) facing the rich people who rule the planet (Stolz et al). And frankly I enjoyed it when he talked to his son about the origin of their name. It was a very well-played scene. <br /> <br /> Note to SCR fans, the boy playing 'Willy Adama'. doesn't really look like Olmos, but he's just a kid. Whether he will appear more than he was in this movie, who knows? I can't say. But it didn't bother me, because he wasn't as interesting as anything that happened to him. <br /> <br /> Polly Walker plays 'Sister Clarice' and she's in every scene she's in. I'm not sure where she's going or who she'll end up, but I was very impressed with her acting. In this film his kind was on the side, but of course it was set up to play a very important role later. She was nothing like her character in Rome, something I always find impressive in actors. <br /> <br /> One nice surprise - the music is actually better and less obvious than SCR, even if it's the same man doing it, Wear McCreary. It has a ghostly and unusual approach that surprised me. I'll buy this score if I had the chance. <br /> <br /> Regarding the 'panel discussion' after the show, it was presented by Seth Green. Ron Moore was very clever and articulate, David Eick was cleverly cracked (much like his video diaries), Esai Morales told a long story about how he was thrown, and Eric Stoltz was very funny and didn't really answer the questions (but I always had a thing for him). Paula Malcomson was tough (she took on Seth Green because she mistakenly said she was "24"), and the girls who played Zooey and Lacey were both treasure. Grace Park and Tricia Helfer were also there to answer questions about how they performed the scenes with themselves at BSG. Overall a very interesting and wonderful evening. <br /> <br /> I give the show a 9 out of 10, and many look forward to watching it all unfold. <br /> <br /> PLEASE NOTE: I just watched it a second time and really hope they will explore what the HOLOBAND was originally made of. I have no idea what it may be, but it keeps me very fascinating.
