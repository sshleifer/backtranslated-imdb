I don't know what movie some of these other people have watched, but they should have seen another "Joseph Smith: Prophet of Restoration" as the one I saw. <br /> <br /> I think the movie was both well done and inspiring. I think it's definitely worth watching. It seems from the very beginning that much care has been taken in making this film. The background is beautiful. <br /> <br /> I think the film does a good job of portraying Joseph Smith as a man and as a prophet. Joseph's spiritual experiences are portrayed with taste and reverence. <br /> <br /> I would definitely recommend watching this movie.
