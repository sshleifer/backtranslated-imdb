This typical Mamet movie delivers a quiet, equal insight that makes a trustworthy man (Joe Mantegna) good. Except as a psychological study by a well-known psychologist (Lindsay Crouse), it slowly pulls her into his world with the usual nasty consequences. The movie contains a number of the players found, several of Mamet's films (Steven Goldstein, Jack Wallace, Ricky Jay, Andy Potok, Allen Soule, William H. Macy) and they do their usual good work. I loved Lindsay Crouse in this movie and often wondered why she didn't become a more listed player than she had become. Maybe I'm not in the right places! <br /> <br /> The movie is slow, with a flat dialogue, but it maintains a point of stress as it leads logically to the breakup. You would expect the end to be a huge downfall, but I found it to be exciting and satisfying. I love this movie!
