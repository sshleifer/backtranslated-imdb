Dressed to Kill (1980) is a mystery horror movie by Brian De Palma and it really works. The atmosphere is right there. The atmosphere that scares you. And that's not what a horror movie is supposed to do. All the actors are in the right places. Michael Caine is perfect like dr. Robert Elliott, the shrink with a little secret. Angelie Dickinson as Kate Miller, the sexually frustrated adult woman is awesome. Keith Gordon as her son, Peter, is brilliant. Nancy Allen as Liz Blake the call girl is fantastic. Dennis Franz does his typical detective role. His detective Marino is one of the most colorful in this movie. There are many creepy scenes in this movie. The elevator scene is one of them. Comparisons have been made between this and Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho (1960). There are some similarities between these two movies. Some of these movies may cause sleepless nights.
