For fans of 1970s Hammer-type horror movies, this movie should be a surprise. The only thing I didn't like about the movie was the fact that Peter Cushing was wasted on the worst episode. In general, however, it is a solid, ghostly little movie. If it's not Amicus's best movie, it's definitely one of them. The best episode, which is saved over time, is the one with Jon Pertwee as a horror movie actor - it's really great. As good as Pertwee was in this role, it's hard to believe he didn't do these types of movies any more. All in all, it's an entertaining movie, scaring my pain as a child, and still giving me the creeps to this day.
