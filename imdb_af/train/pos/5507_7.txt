I will not be surprised if Soderbergh was under pressure to prevent pre-revolution from corrupting Cuba as graphically as it was. To offer just a few stats won't make it to the younger crowd. Still, sharing one, which is almost completely shot in the jungle, takes the feeling of the place, especially when the mountainous areas of Cuba are penetrated. I like Del Toro's interpretation of Che Guevara's personality. And the actor playing Castro, Bichir, also did a good job, against all chances. It is clear that Soderbergh does not look at these people, but it is also clear that he will not plead their case for 'yanquis' far removed from the recent past. Some of the most important historical aspects contradict what I have read. To my knowledge, Castro did not have the Soviet Union court until all attempts to obtain acceptance of the United States were exhausted. But on other aspects he is right, especially with regard to the looting by expatriates, as the island has other rebel control. The country's treasury is left empty.
