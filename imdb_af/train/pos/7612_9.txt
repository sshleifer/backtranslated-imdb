OK, I'll be honest, when I saw the trailer for the program for the first time, I thought it was an advertisement for some sunscreen products. With all the people walking around the beach. Despite this, I decided to look at it and think it would be a new show I could laugh at. But I was seriously surprised. <br /> <br /> From the first 10 seconds of the program I was addicted, why did he lie in the trees, why did the plane crash etc? Etc. <br /> <br /> It's not every day a show that combines intelligence, humor, action and tension. But 'Lost' manages it all. With great roles and crew, beautiful places, and reasonably decent special effects, 'Lost' will catch someone who agrees, and it's a must have for anyone who is sick of cheesy sitcoms and crappy reality TV. <br /> <br /> Lost is on Tuesdays at 10am on channel 4 (UK) 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42 = O
