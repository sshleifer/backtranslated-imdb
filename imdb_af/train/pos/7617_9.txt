A very addictive series. I have never seen an exact combination under drama, action, tension and sci-fi. I am impressed by each chapter. The script is very intelligent, I do not know how the creators find out all these wonderful stories, each character has a strange past, trouble, stormy relationships. It gives the show the human sense needed to create intimate characters. <br /> <br /> The most amazing thing is that all the characters are related to them: The numbers they've met before without knowing it, and so forth. The other, mysterious security system and the Darma initiative are elements that do not allow us to lose a chapter. <br /> <br /> Mr. JJ Abrams, what did you think to create this wonderful story?
