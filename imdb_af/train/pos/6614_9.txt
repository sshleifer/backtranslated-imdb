I read that it didn't do well, that the story wasn't solid, that Volckman felt he had somehow failed. <br /> <br /> I disagree. First, it was well executed. Volckman does well not only to try a new technique, but to have a focus worth thinking: would immortality diminish the value of life? Big question ... <br /> <br /> I can see he's trying hard to build a feeling, and he's not in danger. This is attributed to. I'm sure it was an interesting exercise to build characters in such a shape. I saw artists reducing a shape to a minimum to build the intensity of a moment. I identify this movie with this. <br /> <br /> It's also much more interesting than Richard Linklater's roto-scoop, and Volckman's story has more significance than Linklater's later stories of a wasteful life on drugs. Old news. Everyone knows it, but nobody does anything about it. Renaissance has more to offer, something new to think about. And there are many more stories out there with lots of holes in them that do much better. <br /> <br /> Well done, Volckman. Really nice work.
