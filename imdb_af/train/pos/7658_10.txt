<br /> <br /> I've seen this movie many times. At least a dozen. But unfortunately not recently. But I have eaten in my mind never to leave, is a scene in which Mickey Rooney, 'Killer Mears' knows he has to be executed and it gets close to the moment of truth. He is dancing and crying and laughing, he is hilarious from hysteria to euphoria and runs the gambit of eternal emotions. I have never seen such a brilliant performance by any actor who is alive or dead, past or present. Then I was sure Mickey Rooney, yes, "Andy Hardy" was an actor of great genius. But I kept it, thinking about myself for years, surely, I have to be alone in this regard. About 15 years or so after watching the television for the last time on television, I struggled to read the old Q&A section of the Los Angeles Times. The question was put to Lawrence Olivier, and the question was, "Mr Olivier. You are considered one of the best actors of all time, who do you consider to be one of the greatest actors?" His answer was: "Peter Finch and Mickey Rooney" I was amazed, but not surprised. I immediately returned to his Killer Mears. And I felt very good at seeing this great ability in him, and now I supported my view of another whose work I admired. Later, of course, Bill and many other great moments were with Mikey Rooney. This film, "The Last Mile", should be watched by all acting students. I can't remember France much about the movie after all these years, but Mr. Rooney will never leave me there. If someone remembers out there, is this movie the same as me? I would be interested to hear from you. Because this picture was only eaten in my heart, but I just gave it a 10 on the face of his performance.
