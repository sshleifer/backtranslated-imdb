A few years ago, I bought several $ 1 DVDs containing two movies each. One of them had Three Broadway Girls (an alternative title for the Greeks had a word for them) and this one, Happy Go Lovely. It's basically a background musical comedy that takes place in Scotland and relates to the faulty identity that one of the dancers involves a millionaire's limousine ride. Vera-Ellen is that dancer and wow, what legs! Ceasar Romero is her producer who takes a chance on her after the original front lady leaves because he thinks she is the millionaire whose car I just mentioned. And David Niven is the rich man who, when looking for Vera-Ellen, is wrong for a reporter who was supposed to question her, but is stored by Romero. What I just mentioned can be confusing, but (usually) makes sense if you are willing to check your brain while watching this spectacular screw-ball with wonderful music numbers as by the beautiful me. Vera-Ellen performed. Romero can be a bit devastating here, but Niven is hilariously bemused throughout. The pressure I saw was actually pretty good because of his age and the fact that it is in the public domain. And Vera-Ellen is doing pretty well with her lines since she's not really an actress. So on the note, I highly recommend Happy Go Lovely for movie buffs that love old-fashioned musical comedies.
