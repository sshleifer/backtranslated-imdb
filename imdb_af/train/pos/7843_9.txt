I can't believe they took it out of the air. Especially when they only had a few episodes. My daughter, sister and some of my friends loved this show. We were so upset when they stopped showing it because of so-called ratings. It's not fair to the people who have been watching this show since the beginning. We had the right to see the end. I wish they would take an overall voice of all people with a voting system three times a year. They can send papers in the mail and we as viewers can give an overall voice on all the programs we are watching or hearing about. It can also help promote a new performance. People will see and wonder what it is. Not only can you see what the viewers are watching, you can also use it as a tool for free ads for TV and cable channels. We want to see the other episodes. Bring it back !!
