"Maybe we can arrange a meeting." 'Where are you now?' "I'm in my office." "I doubt it." "Why would you doubt it?" "If you were in your office now, we had" I will face this conversation. " <br /> <br /> Bourne stays street hard and elusive. Only his inhuman resilience leads the film a little too far into fantasy. Conversation is macho, to the point with only Bond-type ghoulish screens. It's all about the action. <br /> <br /> The feeling that something is happening on another level to the world we live in is what the trilogy does so well. A scene set in Waterloo with a Guardian journalist makes it very good. There is no encounter of worlds - you are in it or just an abundant body. <br /> <br /> If the shaky camera doesn't annoy you too much, enjoy this movie and hope to keep the franchise somehow.
