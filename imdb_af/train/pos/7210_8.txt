New York writer Michael Caine (as Sidney Bruhl) is 46 years old and blurs quickly; As the film opens, Mr. Caine's latest play on Broadway. TV reviewers throw fun at Caine, and he gets drunk. Outing on the Long Island Railroad land Caine in Montauk, instead of his East Hampton residence. Finally, Caine comes comforted by Dyan Cannon (like Myra), a sad patient. There, Caine and Mrs. Cannon a new play called "Deathtrap", written by young Christopher Reeve (such as Clifford Cliff Anderson), one of Caine's former students. The couple believe that Mr. Reeve's "Deathtrap" is the hit needed to revive Caine's career. <br /> <br /> "The Trap is set for an evil funny Who'll-Do-It." <br /> <br /> Directed by Sidney Lumet, Ira Levin's long-running Broadway hit, does not chase too far from his stage of origin. The movie is enjoyable and the story's twists are still busy. One thing that didn't work for me was the curtain call; Certainly, it played better on stage. "Deathtrap" is a fun movie to watch again; The performances were dead - but afterwards, the greeting Reeve gives Caine at the East Hampton train station, had to be simplified with a smiling "Hello." The place is not actually East Hampton, but the windmill and dam look similar. And the very ballyhooed love scene is shocking tar. But the play was so good, "even a gifted director couldn't destroy it." And Mr. Lumet does not disappoint. <br /> <br /> ******** Deathtrap (3/19/82) Sidney Lumet ~ Michael Caine, Christopher Reeve, Dyan Cannon, Irene Worth
