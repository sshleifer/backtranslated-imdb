Edmund Burke said "all bad needs are good for me to do nothing." Hollywood often gives us garbage because not enough families will watch quality movies. This movie was an exciting story of the loss and restoration of faith. It had no violence, no injustice, and did not earn a PG rating. The western scenery was well filmed, and some of the views were simply breathtaking. Actors were a little young for their parts, but otherwise credible and talented. Music score was too loud, and in some places the dialogue drowned completely. I'm rarely surprised by movies, but I was pleasantly surprised by this one. Sometimes the good guys win and they win with honest efforts. We love the movie and the message, and will recommend it for the whole family.
