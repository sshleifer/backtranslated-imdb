In an era of such horrible cartoons, I'm rather shocked to see a movie with such a good morale, making it the IMDB list for Animated Movies. <br /> <br /> This movie contradicts the first. I won't deny it. However, when I was in the audience for this movie, I didn't even notice, and it wouldn't matter if I did it. The people who made it could have used "New Generation" to note that it's another way to start the Care Bear Family. Perhaps we should decide for ourselves how the Care Bear family really starts. <br /> <br /> This was my favorite movie at the age of 3-6, and it didn't frighten me or confuse me. <Br /> <br />
