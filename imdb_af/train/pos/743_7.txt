This work is striking in its accurate portrayal of the teen life at the time of its execution. Although it is a broad generalization, parents of that time were themselves absorbed to be true parents, and those who were at home tended to be distracted from the real issues their children were involved in. <br /> <br /> This film teaches us how to let go, even when it is painful, and does it with a sweet, melancholy but informed style through which Foster speaks philosophically about the pain of life. I loved that scene. It was my favorite scene in the movie. <br /> <br /> The transition from funeral to wedding was meant to show that life is going on, and so should we. Baio's skateboarding through a pack of goons and running them was to show us that the tough times will pass, and we are meant to come to better times by them. <br /> <br /> The whole metaphor of "moving up," and the march of life, is present throughout the film and ultimately serves hope for us. <br /> <br /> I like this movie, though I don't see it often, as it tends to make me melancholy. <br /> <br /> It should not be seen by young children, and probably only those raised in the 1970s and 80s will want it. <br /> <br /> It amounts to 7.4 / 10 of ... <br /> <br /> The Enemy :.
