This movie is great. It was always going to be. I'm really mean that is better than a house girl who falls in love. Walt really did himself here. And the music! A dream is a wish that makes your heart beautiful is beautiful! What else can you say except fantastic! I can't wait for the special edition to come, it will be so great! I can't wait to hear all the scrapped songs! This movie is so beautiful and clever! It is beautiful. What about the cute mice too! I know I still keep the same things over and over and over, but hey this is a good movie! Woods was great in this beautiful, beautiful BEAUTIFUL movie
