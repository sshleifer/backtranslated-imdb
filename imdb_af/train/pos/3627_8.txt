What a fun movie experience! I expected a juicy children's film and found that I enjoyed it more than my teenagers. Take a tissue, it's not sad, just 'move' into parts. Finally, it's a 'feel good' movie for the whole family. Note: It is 2+ hours, so consider leaving the smallest 'squirmers' house for this one. AP
