Well, what can I say, this movie really got me, it's not that bad, as many say, I really loved it, though the idea looks so simple, and rather boring, it's not. First of all, I enjoyed the soundtrack (Bryan Adams), it's really about the movie. Secondly, the simple story, and the drama of Spirit gets your attention. One thing I like most is that they didn't give the stallion a human voice to communicate with the other horses, it makes the movie more realistic, not many animations look realistic, do they ?, But .. I do not know, make animals talk is just like ... lamb. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, one of the most beautiful animations of 2002, I recommend it to everyone, not just the kids :) because it is very relaxing.
