Actually, I'm surprised there was so much comment about this movie. I saw it as part of a Slavic film festival at a large American university. But no one in the US has heard it, it's a real shame! The dynamics between the people is what makes it both funny and sad. They sit together on a long bus trip - which most of us are! But I never had such a thing !! <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is the one where they stop for the funeral. Then the man and woman sneak in for some love in the woods, but everyone follows them to look without knowing! Just as she made her dress up and he entered the whole road - the consumer started hacking and they realized everyone was watching! Talk about surprise! But ... you really need to feel them, even if it's hilariously funny! If you see the end, it is ironic that they enjoy themselves while doing it! Serbian humor at its best!
