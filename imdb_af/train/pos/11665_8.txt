I wouldn't have known about this movie if it's not for his "surprise" Oscar nomination for Best Animated Feature movie. Fortunately, it happened that I could see this animated little treasure. <br /> <br /> The story is about the child Brendan who was the cousin of the imposing and overprotective Abbot of Kells town. The main occupation of the Abt is to build a wall to protect Kells from the attacking Vikings. One day, Aiden, the well-known illustrator of Iona, escaped from them. Aiden opens Brendan's eyes to the art of illustration and the lure of the outside world. Along the way, Brendan became friends with the white forest spree Aisling, as he tried to restore an antique crystal valuable to the meticulous art of book illustration. <br /> <br /> Unlike most of the animation, Kells secret is released. these days. It is a setback of kinds as the illustrations are done in sharp geometric lines and designed without caring for realism, as much as symbolism. The movements of these lines are reminiscent of the simplistic but fluid animation style used in the beginning order of "Kung Fu Panda." However, it is the wonderful use of color which is the greatest source of wonder for the audience. The red used in the Viking invasion row is unforgettably ghostly. <br /> <br /> Try to capture this silent jewel of a movie. It's a welcome break from all the senseless bombards of the current animated prize such as "Monsters vs Aliens" and the like. The sparse Celtic musical score is effective in generating the sense of fantasy that impresses the film. OK, the story may be a little bit flat and want to end a little. I would like to know more about the book Brendan and Aiden worked on. But the clear star of this movie is clearly his wonderful stylized artwork, which is said to be based on the artwork in the actual book of Kells.
