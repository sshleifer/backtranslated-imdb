Elmer Fudd laughs while sitting in his easy chair and reading his cartoon, his dog is comfortable in the vicinity of the fireplace. Everything is quiet until a flea comes bouncing. (The flea is dressed in a farmer outfit with a large sombrero and wears a patch called "A. Flea" on it.) He sticks out his telescope and mocks the dog. (We see a big shot of the dog's buttocks and flea whistles in excitement, shouting "T-Bone!" He sings then: "There is food around the corner, there is food around the corner!") <Br / > <br /> It puts the storyline of this cute but unpleasant flea on to the poor dog. The mutt is hilarious as he responds to the flea. <br /> <br /> The drawings of his big teeth flowing right next to the flight are clever and the dog's dialogue made me laugh loudly a few times. It might be the funniest dog I've ever seen in a cartoon! The poor pooch, under the threat of taking a bath, NOT to respond if the stupid flea causes him pain. It is almost painful to watch, as the flea uses pickles, tree trunks and the like on the dog. He puts crackers in the dog behind. It's brutal!
