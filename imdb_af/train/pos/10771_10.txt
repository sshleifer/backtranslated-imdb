This movie features an all-star movie, John Candy, Richard Lewis, Ornella Mutti, Cybill Shepard and Jim Belushi to name a few, amuck in Monte Carlo, as well as run some other beautiful European places, and It is very funny. The problem that everyone enters when they lie to protect themselves is wonderful, and I recommend seeing this movie, it's worth it! John Candy is in the best shape in Once Upon A Crime, like everyone else! If you and your family are looking for a good family movie, this is your ticket. Everyone gives star performances, great acting, great comedy, and good timing, which is currently hardly a movie. Great plot, great mystery (which I love anyway) and overall, worth the money you spend on it. So get the kids, grab popcorn, juice, or tea, or soft drinks, and enjoy the show !!
