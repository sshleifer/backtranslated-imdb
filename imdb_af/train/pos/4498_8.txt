Francesca Annis, Michael Kitchen AND Robson Green !! Wow, what a trio ... OK, so it's not Anna Karenina, but it's a good love story, very well written and well done by everyone. Even a few "lag-out-loud" moments blended with some pretty serious observations about fidelity, age bias and parental aging / Alzheimer's issues. <br /> <br /> Quirky guitar music also added to the story. <br /> While I was a fan of Mrs Annis since 'Lillie' (in the 70's) and Mr. Kitchen's since 'The Buccaneers' and 'Enchanted April', I just recently mr. Green ('Me and Ms. Jones', 'Touching Evil', etc.), Ask me the question - why didn't I see 'Reckless' until recently? !! Admittedly, more of a chick flick than something a man is sitting in, it's perfect for a rainy afternoon's lazy look.
