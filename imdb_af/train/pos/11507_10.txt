I remember the original series brilliantly mostly because of its unique combination of cruel humor and macabre subject. Kolchak was a difficult man at the Ben Hecht school of big-city reporting, and his eager determination and wisdom made even the most everyday episode extremely noticeable. My personal fave was "The Spanish Moss Murders" because of this totally original story. A poor, troubled Cajun youth from Louisiana Bayou country, participates in a sleep research experiment for dream analysis purposes. Something inexplicably goes wrong, and he literally dreams of a swamp inhabiting the dark folk tales of his youth. This malicious manifestation seeks out all the people who have done wrong to the dreamer in their conscious state and brutally suffocate them to death. Kolchak investigates and remembers this terrible truth, much to the chagrin of police captain Joe "Mad Dog" Siska (wonderfully compiled by a grumpy Keenan Wynn) and the main sleeping researcher played by Second City improv, Severn Darden, immersed perfection . The bad funny, harrowing final takes place in the Chicago sewer system, and is a series of highlights. Chess chess never got better. Timeless.
