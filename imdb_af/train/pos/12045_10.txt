I watched this movie for the first time when I was a child and is the only time in my life that I can remember placing my hands on a particular scene over my face and eyes. I remembered it again with a dissipation with my uni friends and it quickly bought it on video, with much hesitation I could add. I just found it on the web in the United States when it was made in England!) When I looked at it again, my response and to my surprise was almost the same, of horror and fear and my heart had never hit much . It's in my opinion the SCARIEST movie ever made, Hollywood movies look tame in comparison and a bit of Pony and Trap (crap), forgetting the pun. What is incredible is the power of this movie and at Uni when I see it with about twenty of my collaborators, I've never heard so much scream! Even the eye of the video brings the fear of God into me of that particular scene, and makes me feel like I'll never be in the dark again !!
