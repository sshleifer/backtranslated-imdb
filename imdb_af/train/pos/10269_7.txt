In the spirit of the classic "The Sting" this movie hits where it really hurts ... in the heart! A primary, proper female psychiatrist, hungry for adventure, meets the dirtiest and rashest of years. The vulnerable doctor falls for the career, and plans to be involved in his operation. While the movie is kind of slow, it's climax and finish is stunning! You will especially enjoy how the doctor forgives herself!
