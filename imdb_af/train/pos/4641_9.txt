Eytan Fox did it again: moves the viewer's heart into a modest story that takes place in an overwhelming mess. The film also manages to describe the atmosphere of the incredible city, Tel Aviv, so perfectly and subtly. <br /> <br /> I was there a month ago and that's all there: the lifestyle, relationships, heart beat the city, the mess, the beating of utopian thoughts in the light, bleak and forgotten megalopolis ever. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended: it is a journey of heart and mind, with an interesting perspective on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. <br /> <br /> Note Legs: There is a central gay plot in the movie. If you don't think you are too gay-friendly, be prepared to be challenged and eventually see it as "just love". (And don't worry: the chick is also hot!)
