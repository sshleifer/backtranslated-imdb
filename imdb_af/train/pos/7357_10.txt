OK where do I start? ... This movie has changed my life! The plot was seamless. James Cahill did himself. Initially, I was disappointed that I didn't see it on the silver screen. However, this was explored before the DVD's many features !! Oh my god Jakes Cahill's commentary on the film was almost as flawless as his acting. He told us about industry secrets used in the movie that you just got to experience. <br /> <br /> I was so impressed with the other actors. The scene where the security guard speaks to the girl in the corridor reminds me of some of my favorite blue (pornographic) movies. I'm definitely with Gangsta when he doesn't express his disappointment at all. <br /> <br /> I'm still blown away with every viewing of the particular martial arts skills, just match the sign of the school's location at school ... and possibly the guy who plays a retard! All in all a timeless classic and the best movie that has come from Europe for years! where my oscars at dawn !!!!!!!!!!!
