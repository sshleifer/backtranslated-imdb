<br /> <br /> If the Loving Cinema makes me a pervert, so be it! <br /> <br /> If you're a real 'moviefreak' like me then I'm sure you can't get enough movies about making movies and I don't necessarily mean the dry documentary and then. I mean a total discourse on the movie show experience. Well, if so, I have a lulu of a movie experiment for you. <br /> <br /> In Sophie Fiennes (sister of Ralph & Joseph if you are wondering) noted that philosopher cum cinephile Slavoj Zizek gives his analysis at cinema with some impressive (and often excessive) learning all about the silent era from Chaplin to the modern age of the Wachowski brothers who analyze, investigate and pacify the psychological foundation, socio-economic, political and, of course, indefinite magic of film experience. with its incessant, determined and traced trades. To explain how the house of Bates in PSYCHO is actually the pictorial psyche of confronted Norman Bates with every level as its Ego, Superego and Id is one thing, but then the same thing from every Marx brother in barely a partner set. a remarkable test of faith that wins over the skeptical layman. <br /> <br /> Although I had no idea who Zizek was? He looks like a hybrid of filmmaker Brian DePalma, European actor Rade Serbedzija and the hyper-kinetic energy of film makers Quentin Tarantino and Martin Scorsese ?? With his sibling language and passion, the host comes over as a mad prophet. <br /> <br /> Fiennes cleverly adds Zizek into some of the movie clips' backgrounds that are riddled, which makes a humorous scene, but leaves the ranting and ravaging continuation of the full throttle to continue the argument in three. giving deeds covering the range of films. such as Kubrick, Lynch, Hitchcock and films as diverse as THE WIZARD OF OZ, THE RED SHOES, and FIGHT CLUB. <br /> <br /> There is something for everyone and if one man can provoke an argument or at least a reason to discuss a movie's themes? even though they are Freudian / Jungian at fault? then I say this collection of movie theory is worth the watch. Look for it now if you can before it comes to the home video; It's the only way to appreciate it.
