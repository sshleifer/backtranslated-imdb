"The Mother" is a strange low-budget movie that touches at least two awkward themes that are not usually explored in theater: denial of the love of the mother for their own son and daughter, and lust and passion in the third age. <br /> <br /> The characters are terrible: May is a disgusting old lady and I believe it's impossible to feel any sympathy or sadness for her. She confessed that she did not love her son and her daughter. She cheated her husband twice with an intellectual. She steals the beloved man from her daughter, not to protect her from a man without morals, it doesn't like her, but just because she feels like him. She tries to organize her life after the loss of her husband in the worst possible way, and destroys her daughterhood. Paula, her daughter, is a fragile loser, who accepts her life as it is. Her brother Bobby is a man who has lost his savings because of his wife, who insists on having her shop a terrible business. Darren is an amoral addict who doesn't like anyone like him. <br /> <br /> The acting and direction are excellent: the actresses and actors have excellent performances and the direction is very accurate. I like this movie, but I admit it is recommended for very specific audiences. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Recome√ßar" ("Re-Start")
