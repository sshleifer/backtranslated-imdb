Hitchcock was of the opinion that audiences were not really interested in what the protagonists were at risk - just because they were in danger and had to escape. <br /> <br /> This movie proves Hitchcock was not 100% correct. Police believe Jean Simmons is guilty of a crime when she is not clear. Trevor Howard decides their best action is to run for it. And so the body of the movie exploded our charismatic couple on and off trains, buses and coaches - jumping over the rocks on top of a waterfall - watching the roof of the yard. <br /> <br /> All the good exciting things - but I couldn't figure out that it was all unnecessary. They had to stay. <br /> <br /> In other words, the MacGuffin wasn't strong enough.
