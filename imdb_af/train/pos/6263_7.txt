The first collaboration between Schoedsack & Cooper is a compelling documentary document on the migration of the Bakhtiari tribe of Persia. Twice a year, more than 50,000 people and half a million animals cross rivers and mountains to graze. You will feel like a wonderfully weakness as you watch these people herd their animals through cold water and walk barefoot through the snow to cross the mountains as they try to make their animals walk along steep and narrow mountain paths.
