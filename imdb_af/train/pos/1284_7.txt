I watched the Babysitter as part of BCI Eclipse 'Drive-in Cult Classics (with Crown International Pictures releases) on DVD. I think it's a very good movie. <br /> <br /> This movie packs a lot of story in a very short time. You have hippies, rock music, bikers, lesbians, sexual impropriety, extortion and murder, all in one place! <br /> <br /> The protagonists are doing a credible job. And I found the intricate woven plot to be credible and interesting. <br /> <br /> However, the supporting casting, especially the cyclists, delivers a stilted performance, especially when asked to produce lines with just a few words. Maybe they used real bikers instead of actors. A few characters were particularly credible. <br /> <br /> The musical score is absolutely spot-on, for the times, the tempo, and the story moving forward. I found the music a real surprise. I noticed in the opening credits that the movie contains the music of "The Food", I threw them; but couldn't find anything. <br /> <br /> Anyway, George E. Carey, who wrote, produced and played in this movie, loved the idea so much (from a walking married man brought to salvation through trials and tribulation, and a little help - of course) that he wrote, produced and died in "Weekend with the Babysitter."
