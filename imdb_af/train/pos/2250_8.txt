It's a wonderful movie about the Mormons battle and their final settlement in Salt Lake, Utah. The beginning and the end are especially powerful and the message is one of which we all need to be reminded. God does not speak, but he communicates if we just listen. As I write it in the midst of the horrors that happened in New Orleans and the surrounding environment because of Katrina, I was particularly disturbed by the Mormons who had to leave everything and continue after Joseph Smith was killed. People came to this country to escape religious persecution, and yet they could not. The battle of the Mormons to cross the country, the cost in life, the hardship they suffered, was truly awesome and showed their tremendous power. Regarding the real beliefs of Mormone, it is not heavy, and polygamy is called, but is not at all the center of the film. <br /> <br /> The role play is on the other hand, although others who comment know more about the real characters and can talk about how the depictions were. But as actors, Dean Jagger, Mary Astor, Brian Donlevy, John Carradine, Jane Darwell, all do excellent with the writing they have given. <br /> <br /> Though the movie could easily stand on its own (and certainly not today) Tyrone Power and Linda Darnell were added to the crowd in the movie theaters to watch a movie about the Mormons. Power is wonderfully attractive like a young Mormon, and Darnell, like Zina, is not a Mormon, but stays with the family after her father is murdered. Power doesn't have much to the end of the movie, when it has a big scene, and Darnell (still a teenager at the time of filming) has even less, though they make a beautiful couple. Their fate is unclear about her conversion, and one wonders about the polygamy in their case. However, you can't beat one for eyebrows.
