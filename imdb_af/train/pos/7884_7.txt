WARNING !!! TONE OF DEAD ROAD !!! PLEASE NOT READ IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THIS SERIES! OR YOU CAN, WHY. <br /> <br /> They are few words to describe a movie claiming to be the last and coming out with another. Liars, Cheats, maybe even a few words that can't be spoken. But when Elmstraat 6: Freddy's Dead shows everyone what the series has become, he didn't want to see anymore, or people who wanted their hero (or Villian) to stop his last breath. This movie was it. <br /> <br /> This movie starts with a parody of Wizard of Oz. Then you see a child just called John Doe. Who is the last child in Springwood, Ohio, goes from Freddy area. A woman living at a hospital / place to get children off their feet, meets this boy, and at the same time has a dream about a man, a water tower and a promise of a secret in her mind swing, go back to Springwood to find out this scary vision and soon find out that she is Freddy's child. And we soon find out that Freddy can only leave Springwood if his daughter can be a kind of host to him. And out there, scared. This movie seems to hit the nail on the head of everything you wanted to know. <br /> <br /> This movie has many humor, and cameo phenomena, such as Rosanne Barr and Tom Arnold, Alice Cooper, Johnny Depp, and a very young Breckin Meyer who plays a teen-stoner playing a psychadelic vision. see and an "In-a-Gadda-da-vida" of the Iron Butterfly's, get stuck in a super Mario parody. This movie will also make you hate this movie, or like Krueger even more. The best of the best.
