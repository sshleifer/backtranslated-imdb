It can be the definitive film of all time. The Columbia Studios didn't cut much of Orson Welles' original. What we left behind is a flawed but brilliant film depicting the overwhelming talent of Welles as an actor / director and Rita Hayworth as a serious dramatic talent. <br /> <br /> 'The Lady From Shanghai' is film noir at it's most confusing and confusing. Welles, with a disproportionate accent, depicts Michael O'Hara, a traveling Irishman, who, after a fatal encounter with the seductive, dangerous Elsa Bannister (Hayworth in a great performance), forced him to work as a Crew member to accept her and her mutilated husband (Everett Sloane) yacht. Elsa, or 'Rosalie' as Michael likes to call her, plays the innocent, helpless doll very well, which O'Hara decorates in her web. As the lovers do a non-secret relationship at sea, Arthur Bannister's partner in his law firm, George Grisby (Glenn Anders), comes aboard. He's a strange, unreliable figure that offers Michael a unique proposal: he'll get $ 5,000 to help Grisby kill Grisby's death, so it looks murder. The plan is for Michael to come technical and run Elsa in the sun. But things won't plan. <br /> <br /> Hayworth delivers us one of the best femme deaths of all time in a very ambiguous depiction. Sometimes she looks really vulnerable and child-like, at other brutal, world-wide and hard. She is always wonderfully beautiful, whether he is pressing the situation to get wet in a swimsuit or black dress, with a gun on fire. Hayworth is beautifully photographed here, and she is an outrage of her well-known 'Gilda' role. Her husband, Orson Welles, cut off her trademark auburn locks for a colored blonde crop (rage Columbia's boss Harry Cohn). It was a tremendous marketing package, and he changed wonderfully with her changing attitude. She is not the sympathetic femme fatale who is 'Gilda', here she is a predatory, black-haired woman who sees murder as a very useful option. <br /> <br /> At the Time the Welles and Hayworth couples had extremely difficult marriage. They would divorce after the film was made, so it is also a curiosity to give the complicated relationship. They are hateful, not romantic, lovers in it, so it's hard to tell whether or not they have real chemistry on the screen. Certainly every encounter is powerful and filled with raw sexuality, with Welles as the "fall man" (he even admits it himself in the movie!) And Rita as the double-crossing babe. <br /> <br /> Welles character is the typical noir'drifter with not much sense. As Welles's voice-over proves to be used, O'Hara does not use his brain, "expects to think of her (Elsa)". Welles has mostly played intelligent, charismatic fellows, so his turn here, as the dull Michael is very unusual and very interesting. Indeed, Welles was an actor of good talent and he pulls it off well. <br /> <br /> Everett Sloane is pretty slender as Hayworth's lame man. One wonders why he's renting Michael. It is obvious that his wife is interested in him romantic, so why does he invite a "threat" on board? One interpretation may be that Michael gives his wife the "service" that Bannister cannot have in his lame state. There is certainly something about the theory, with many implications for Elsa's behavior before meeting her husband (was she a kind of prostitute?) And Grisby's knowledge of Bannister's most intimate secrets is featured in various scenes. <br /> This is a dented, winding movie with a plot that is ultimately flawed. We are more interested in the love triangle than the murder plot, as with most noirs. Welles offers many of his usual brilliant films, including the well-known 'mirror gallery' climax. This is a tremendous scene, one ending that can almost erase the mistakes that were previously in the movie and magnify it. This fun home scene is visually stunning, with a Dali-like feel for the painted sets (apparently Orson painted them himself). The subtle visual imagery used by Welles enhances the plot and makes it a formidable experience. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is scorching and confusing, rendered excellently by Rita's alternating blowpunch and helpless, high-ranking little girl voice. Hayworth proves her acting abilities in this one and proves that SHE is the ultimate femme fatale of 'noir'. It's a pity (just a small one like Rita was a brilliant dancer) that in the 40's she did so much joyful and frightening musical for Columbia in the 40's. She was a brilliant actress when she had the opportunity to show her talent. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
