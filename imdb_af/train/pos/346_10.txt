What a fantastic movie! It was very scary, great acting, well written, nice plot twists, interesting characters, very good direction and a surprise that will leave you with a smile on your face. This is a popcorn horror flick that may not be appealing to non-abusive fans, but is still one of the best thrillers out there today! I recommend it ONLY fans of: <br /> <br /> 1) The horror genre <br /> <br /> OR <br /> <br /> 2) An actor or actress appearing in it. </ br> <br /> *** from **** stars! <br /> <br /> PS- I'm sick and tired of people comparing it, and other modern horror movies, with SCREAM. You know what, they didn't want to be like SCREAM. Everyone is like "Oh, they copied SCREAM!". Well, if I'm not wrong, SCREAM also copied other movies! In fact, just about every horror movie copied a previous one. However, SCREAM was a good movie. But, still, stop comparing it and enjoy it for what it is! <br /> <br /> Go and rent this one! <br /> <br />
