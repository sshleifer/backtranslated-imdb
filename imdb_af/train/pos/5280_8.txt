Reda is a young Frenchman of Moroccan descent. Despite his Muslim heritage, he is very French in attitudes and values. Out of the blue, his father announced that Reda would drive him to Hajj (pilgrimage) to Mecca - something Reda has no interest in but agrees with obligations. As a result, Reda is angry from the beginning, but as a traditional Muslim man, his father is difficult to talk or discuss his doubts. Both father and son look very strict and inflexible - and it is very ironic when Dad tells his son that he should not be so stubborn. <br /> <br /> When I read the summary, it talks about how many characters have grown and started to know each other. But I don't really think so, and it's the fascinating and sad aspect of the movie. Sure, there were times of understanding, but so often there was an undercurrent of hostility and oppression. I really liked and appreciated that there wasn't a complete solution to this - as it would have been evil. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is well behaved and fascinating. This gives Westerners an unusual insight into Islam. and the hajj. It also offers a fascinating compilation of traditional Islam and the secular younger generation. While the slow pace and lack of clarity of the movie may irritate some, I think it made the movie intense realism and it looks like a movie about people - not a formula. A fun and unusual movie.
