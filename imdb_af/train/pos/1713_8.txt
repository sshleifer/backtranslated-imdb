It is a kind of movie that has long been with you. Soha Ali and Abhay Deol both look very nice. Soha reminds you so much of her mother Sharmila Tagore. Abhay is a born actor and will rise a lot in the future. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie is very different from most movies. In a way, you are left dissatisfied, but if you really think about it, you realize that the only sensible end was the end that was shown in the movie. Otherwise, it would be unfair to everyone. <br /> <br /> The movie is about a professional witness coming over a girl waiting to get married in court. Her boyfriend didn't appear and she was eventually helped by the witness. Slowly, over time, he fell in love with her. It is not clear whether or not she has similar feelings to him. Check out the movie for full details. <br /> <br /> The movie really belongs to Abhay. I look forward to seeing more movies from him. Soha is beautiful, but didn't speak much in the movie. Her eyes, her innocence spoke the most.
