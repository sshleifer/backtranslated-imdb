The idea for this TV series is probably the result of the huge success that Ally McBeal worldwide enjoys, even here in Germany. However, Edel & Starck said in many ways is very different from Ally McBeal. <br /> <br /> The two main characters work together beautifully. Felix Edel (Felix Noble), played by well-known German actor, Christoph M. Ohrt and Sandra Starck (Sandra Strong - Noble & Strong, get it ???), played by beautiful Rebecca Immanuel, swapped fast romantic reparties and constantly spies on each other while involved in sickly criminal cases in Berlin and the surrounding area. Furthermore, they are supported by a wonderful role-players of co-stars, especially their secretary, played by Isabel Tuengerthal, which is a rare gem with a great comic potential. Also shadow wheel dealers, Otto, and Felix's precious childhood years, Frank, work very well, not to forget that Sandra's best friend and roommate, Patricia, is played by the beautiful Barbara Demmer. <br /> <br /> All-in-all a joy to watch on monthly magazines: no wonder the series and its stars have received several prizes. Will Felix get Sandra? <br /> <br /> I hope we will have to wait for many more episodes to find out ......
