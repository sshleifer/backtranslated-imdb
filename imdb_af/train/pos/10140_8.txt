Fans of the HBO series "Tales From the Crypt" will love this MOH episode. Those who know the basic archetype stories most of the classic EC cartoons were based will recognize this one right of the bat. <br /> <br /> Underrated indie favorite Martin Donovan (also an excellent writer - co-author of the screens for APARTMENT ZERO and DEAD COME HER) is the kind of man whose good-natured may look good. He can play a lot if the man is not understood by the door, or he can play the same role with a nasty undertone of corrosive insomnia. In the case of right to die, he takes the latter approach, and it certainly works. <br /> <br /> Donovan is a doctor who recently had a relationship with his office officer (Robin Sydney), much to the dissatisfaction of his inexorable, unforgiving husband, Abbey (Julia Anderson). When the two of them get involved in a terrible car accident while returning from an unsuccessful weekend of "make-up" and she's burned terribly in a fire, he is reluctant to pull the plug on her, not without. an enthusiastic hug from his even stranger lawyer and best friend (Corbin Bernsen, who looks even worse today) <br /> <br /> But Abbey was never one to give up without a fight, and that's where the EC theme of the episode. Cuckolded men - and women - have always been the favorite of the genres for some haunting (and OOKY) supernatural shenanigans, and this case is certainly no exception. Anything, the upward quotient of sex and gore, Bill Gaines has to go somewhere in his mausoleum in his mausoleum. <br /> <br /> And it is not to mention that John Esposito's original script just turns the adultery corner a little. You don't realize if you see that you know only half of the story, close to the end ... (think WHAT IS LISTENING with more gut and lawn gas, and you're there.) <br /> <br /> Not a bad attempt, but not the best of the lot. At least Rob Schmidt shows here and there the sense of flair with the direction, especially in a scene that actually makes the mobile image counseling in a truly terrible experience! As with most MOH episodes, this one follows a common theme this season of flaying and dismemberment, so the extremely bad need doesn't have to apply.
