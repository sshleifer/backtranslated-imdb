The story is somewhat silent, which, with the main character's sudden turnaround of luck, but Leslie Howard and Bette Davis's portrayals of Philip Carey, the naive obsession lover and Mildred Rogers, the unworthy object of his sadness, greatly increase this film. standard melodrama. <br /> <br /> Sensitive, cultured Philip, who for the most part is in slavery, and then his compassion for Mildred, is nothing but a character Howard would play a few years later - Ashley Wilkes, The Southern gentleman is refined and decent to make it into the rough reconstruction era. Philip actually looks sad to disappointment even before Mildred enters the picture? He didn't even seem surprised when his art teacher told him he would never make it a painter. This is perhaps this passivity. It prevented him from serving with the selfish Cockney waitress as long as he did. <br /> <br /> Although Leslie Howard is unforgettable, today is mainly thought of "Human Bondage" as a Bette Davis picture, perhaps because of the well-known story of how to fight Jack Warner for the Mildred part. and perhaps also because movie audiences tend to prefer characters with her kind of brash energy. Mildred can have a roasting voice, but she also has the ethereal beauty of a stained glass glass. This makes it understandable why Philip helped himself as long as he did. Although the man who eats Mildred sometimes sometimes looks one-dimensional, she occasionally sympathizes with the viewer, as when she gets sick and realizes that Philip is the only decent man who ever cared for her. One might also think she's about something when she accuses Philip of looking down on her not to be enough. (The scene in which Philip and Norah reject romance magazines as garbage garbage seems to confirm that.) <br /> <br /> Most of the supporting characters are also effective, especially Norah the sensible romance writer who loves Philip, but know she can never compete with Mildred and Sally who have Mildred's beauty and Norah's decency and come to the fore when the deserving woman, Philip, is finally rewarded. The only character I found hollow was Sally's eccentric, all-slung aristocratic father who resembles a stock character from an earlier era. <br /> <br /> A classic that deserves its reputation.
