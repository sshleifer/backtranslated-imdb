I selected this movie based on the summaries and critics' quotes on the back of the box. I'm not big in foreign films, and didn't know what to expect. I don't really care about captions. But I absolutely loved it! It has a simple, lovely quality that makes you feel good about life. I repeatedly laughed aloud. I would recommend this picture to anyone, even those who scare off foreign films with captions. This one is worth it.
