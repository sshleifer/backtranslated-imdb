I am from Belgium and therefore my English writing is very poor, sorry for that. <br /> <br /> It's one of those little-known movies that only play once on TV and disappear into the air. I browse through my old VHS Video collection and watched this title, I watched it and it had an IMDb score of more than 7/10. It's pretty decent. <br /> <br /> I have to admit it is a very well-crafted movie and that's why I'm amazed. This is the only movie made by this director ...? How did he not make many movies after this pretty good one? Someone with so much potential has to be forced to make another movie, ha ha ;-) <br /> Anyway, I really want to see him gathering his act and another good movie like this one make, please .....?
