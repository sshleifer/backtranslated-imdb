Hitchcock is displaying his already developed understanding of footage in this early motion picture. The plot of the movie, which includes two boxes that fight over a girl, is straight forward drama without recommending it. Hitchcock's talent, however, was found in his beautiful use of images. Almost every shot is filled with visual symbols. Especially unforgettable is the jewelry that one boxer gives the girl just before she marries the other boxer. He puts it in a clear sexual way on her arm and with a simple movement Hitch showed us everything we need to know. The boxing screens are well handled with some interesting perspective shots that prove how far before his time Hitchcock was. The film also gives insight into its later treatment of women. The purpose of the boxers' desires is driven by money and lust, not reason or love. The only other women in the film are either beautiful party girls making open offers of sex or old crones that help to destroy happy relationships. All in all, the Ring is a must for anyone interested in Hitchcock's early work and development as a visual storyteller.
