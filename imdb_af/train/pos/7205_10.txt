Deathtrap is not a whodunit. This is who will do it to whom first. It is so difficult to describe this movie without giving away anything so I will not mention anything more about the plot. As far as this is concerned, it is Cris Reeves's greatest role as Clifford, a young play. You really see the series in its acting abilities in this movie of "cheeseburgers exhaling" to frighteningly. Clifford has such a hard role to play and in stage production I have never seen Clifford play well on both sides of the spectrum. The actor plays him as a puppy or a murderous mania. Reeves is the only person I have seen who has the character throughout the road. Like Michael Caine, he's ..... well, he's Michael Caine. One of the best actors of the past 50 years and in this movie as good as he ever was.
