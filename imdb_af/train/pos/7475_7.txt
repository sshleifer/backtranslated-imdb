After reading some very negative views for this movie, I wasn't sure if I had to spend a little money to rent it. However, it was a pleasant surprise. I didn't see the original movie, but if it was better than that, I'd be in heaven. <br /> <br /> Tom Cruise gives a strong performance as the seemingly unstable David, convinced that he is more than a smile on legs (for the third time in his career only - the other examples were Magnolia and born on the 4th of July). Penelope Cruz is slightly lightweight, but fills the demands for her role, like Diaz. The only disappointment is the slightly dull Kurt Russell. In the movie, however, it is not the play that really impresses. This is the movie. <br /> <br /> Cameron Crowe glorifies in the role of the director and offers him a welcome change of his usual sktick. The growing madness of the movie is perfectly executed by Crowe (the short sequence in which Cruise runs through an empty time slot is incredibly effective). The soundtrack (a distinctive feature of a Crowe movie) is also sublime. <br /> <br /> You will be shocked and challenged as a viewer. The plot looks a bit confronted, but the issues being investigated are endlessly debatable. The movie is not perfect, but it is a welcome change in the pace for Cruise and Crowe and for those who are raised on a Hollywood luster diet, it must be a revelation.
