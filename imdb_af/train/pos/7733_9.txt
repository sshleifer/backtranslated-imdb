Foley's noir quality in this saturated and intense pulp film is apparently "perfect". Shot by shot, edit by editing, the film unfolds itself to a disturbed boxer who discovers his own purpose (or lack thereof). The other comment on this may indicate a lack of pulp interest, but I personally think it's a great movie story!
