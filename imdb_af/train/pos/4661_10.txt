I can only repeat the praise of the other reviews on this. It is a beautiful film with a sense of feeling that reaches it without crossing the line in supple sentimentality. Of course sweet - no added sugar. <br /> <br /> One small point: it seems to me that the soft objections about Ustinov's character Pendelton are capable of entering and defeating the system security, ignoring the fact that Pendelton is clearly a genius / savant on this kind of thing. Yes, the movie was nice computer illiterate, but it did show Pendelton's computers on his flat and I believe the implication should be that his gifts allowed him to light the entire subject, just overnight. <br /> <br /> There were some strange moments when it appeared in some scenes that Gnatpole tried to test Pendelton's knowledge and call his bluff. I am not sure if we were supposed to believe that Pendelton had wiped his ways out of these situations, or that he was actually good enough to pass the tests. It was a bit unclear. had to know enough to set up the dummy accounts. Probably Wallach and Ustinov relied on their own, rather foggy, idea of ​​how computers worked in those days, and in order to understand in detail what they gained, it was necessary to know what their concept was. They knew there was something about 'procedures' that was important; they thought the 'smart light' could actually control security rather than just state; they thought that the (stupid) user terminal's features would have a strong influence on what could be done on the main frame itself. Although I, besides things like graphical function, do not see it myself. <br /> <br /> Mostly, I think they're trying to avoid the subject of real-life computer operations, and they've done well. To allow them a little artistic license, I don't think their efforts have noticed any mistakes. <br /> <br /> CD
