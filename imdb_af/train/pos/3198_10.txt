This is how I felt while watching this movie. I loved it. It was hilarious. But I felt a sense of having a spectacular view of someone's psyche, and then laughing while turning around to make an interesting point. A friend put it this way: <br /> <br /> "I feel like we broke in someone's home and now look at their terrible home videos without their knowledge." <br /> <br /> Another of that fact is strange as fiction pieces film. "Groovin 'Gary", the original "Beaver Kid", is a small town man who arrives at a nearby TV station, hoping to come to movies - and certainly, though not, maybe, like him initially expected. With great hope of fame and interest, he invites Harris to come up with a truly awesome talent quest that he has organized in his hometown. He put his own hit, Olivia Newton-Don. <br /> <br /> Director, Trent Harris, does a brilliant job with this slowly evolving story. Some footage from an uncomfortable child who wants to be someone, morphs, over two subsequent reinterpretations, into the story of freedom of oppressed sexual identity in small-town America. Harris simultaneously criticizes the attitudes of small-town America, the cult of celebrities and the exploitation of the film and television industry. <br /> <br /> Both Sean Penn and Grispin Glover perform overnight shows. A young Sean Penn is the most exciting - so now he follows the real 'Gary footage', but with strong nuances given to push the meaning of the interaction, as Harris wants it to go. <br /> <br /> In the end of the wide eyes, the original Gary, is what surprised me - unlike these possible interpretations of his situation. <br /> <br /> A movie not to miss. I saw nothing else. <br /> <br /> Jacob.
