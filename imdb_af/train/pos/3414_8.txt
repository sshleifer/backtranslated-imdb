This interesting documentary tells a remarkable story of an expedition to draw blind Tibetan children in the Himalayas; but also from a personality clash between two remarkable people. On the one hand there is Erik Weihenmeyer, the first blind man to climb Everest, and the team of (seeing) mountain climbers who lead the kids. On the other hand, there is Sabriye Tenberken, a blind woman who is the first school for blind Tibetan management, who consents to the expedition, but later doubts about how it is progressing. On a certain level, Sabine simply doesn't understand the mountaineering philosophy (with emphasis on summitting); She is probably ready to identify the mismatch between the mountain climbing goals and the desires of the children, but her certainty in her own correctness makes her a hard person to sympathize, especially because she has an effective veto. In the background of this (reasonably well-made) clash, we gain insight into the lives of the children themselves. I enjoyed the movie, though it does deliver a message that is clearly designed to lift. Although this indicates the doubt, the film claims a bit relentlessly how wonderful everyone is in it. But it is difficult to argue with that assessment, even if it is presented to the viewer somewhat impeccably.
