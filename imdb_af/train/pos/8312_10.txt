The life and time of Little Richard, as told by Little Richard, produced and directed by Little Richard, was about one-sided as one of his songs. It's not a biography or even a docudrama, but has good writing, good energy and a great leading actor playing Richard. All the music is by Little Richard, so it slaps a tight lips on every song. <br /> <br /> The movie covers his early childhood, carries the formative years in music, the wild success and Richard's throw it all away to praise the Lord. It's all well tied together and managed the obvious return in 1962 to stay away from the idea that Little Richard had discovered the Beatles, which opened to him. <br /> <br /> My main objection is that she is underprivileged against cultural behavior and you get no sense of how she heard him at the time. Some of his energy, which he still has, doesn't come full of power. He was tame, compared to what I remembered from him at the time. <br /> <br /> The best scenes are Richard, who is cut by Lucille and writes a song about it and the strip for bikini shorts while performing. indicates that you do not have a decent place to change. <br /> <br /> If they came in the "Bronze Liberace", as Richard used to refer to himself, there is a story. Trust me I just saw him a few months ago and he still flirts with the pretty white boys and gives the one very good dancer in the audience, his headband. Nearly 68 and still strong I recommend this movie and any concert or TV appearance you can find. Little Richard is always on
