Quite a heartwarming little movie and not just for the kids. John Thaw is brilliant as always (without any hint of inspector Morse about him). The boy William plays also did a good job, although I didn't convince him in every scene. I loved the whole feeling of the small town and the slower pace of life in those times. I also have the screens in London where it was historically accurate, as far as I could tell. <br /> <br /> It reminded me of a Scandinavian movie I mentioned a few years ago, called my mother. That film had a son evacuated from Finland to Sweden during WW II. The wife of the family who took him asked for a girl because she (as it turned out) lost her daughter. To get a boy, she completely ignores. The fact that the boy speaks Finnish makes matters even more difficult. I recommend the movie to everyone who's tonight, Mrs. Tom, enjoy it. It has the same feeling.
