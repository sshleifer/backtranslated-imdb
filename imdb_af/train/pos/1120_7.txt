Not to be confused with the British black comedy of the same name that came out in 1994. But this Shallow Grave is a worthy addition to the 80-year-old woodpecker. <br /> <br /> The plot is going = 4 girls from a monastery girl are planning a spring break in Florida, but they are planned when one of them testifies to a man who is a local wife killed and when he realized that he was seen, let's just say it became deadly game of cat and mouse and things got worse when it appeared that he was the local sheriff. <br /> <br /> Shallow grave is, in my opinion, one of the more enjoyable slashers that came out in the 80s, especially the late 80s that were when slashers were similarly downhill, which was one of the few did not and this movie should be more familiar, it is a pity it is not. It's a movie that actually confronts stereotypes (just try to guess who the final girl will be - I'm completely wrong). The principle is all good and it's one of those movies you'd love to see them all get away from, of course. This, together with the fluffiness of the first half-hour potty (in a good way) with some flashes of real nastiness (the second murder offers a real blow) and some unexpected insomnia (although not high budget thriller I didn't expect the topless scene where a woman with her own bra (accompanied by a hysterical religious radio broadcast) was strangled in a film of this late 80's. <br /> <br /> There is one or two bad things about this movie, not bad, just minor, like the subplot with the two teenagers who are not going anywhere and the end that was stupid and the deputy inability to follow logic. implements in SHALLOW COLLECTION, but in my mind it's a blow through anyway - the screens where the girls are hunted by the bushes by the malicious Sheriff are tense and thrilling. <br /> <br /> All in all a very pleasant and valuable treasure, with good performances of all four hay girls and the psycho sheriff.
