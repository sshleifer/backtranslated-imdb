Moonwalker is such a big movie, from start to finish you can't throw your eyes away. I love all the songs from Michael singing and dancing and I just love the 'studio tour' a bit ... so funny :) And the 'mini movie' is to cool off, with all the special FX etc ... Michael is a genius and will always be !!!
