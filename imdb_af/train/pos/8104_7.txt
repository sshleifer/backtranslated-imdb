This is an amazing movie from 1936. Although the first hour is not very interesting (for the modern viewer), the stylish vision of the year 2036 is for that. But don't plan to understand the whole dialogue - the sound quality and accent (it's American - but "1930s" American) make it difficult. <br /> <br /> Basically, the story a cattle 100 years look at a fictitious American town called "Everytown". It dates from 1936, when a war is on the horizon, until 2036, when technology leaps forward and creates its own problems. <br /> <br /> The first one hour is a bit slow - although it's hard to tell which audiences I would have thought. The events, tensions and footage are pretty low key in today's terms. But when it comes in the future, it's just fun to watch. The big sets and retro-sci-fi look of everything is hard to beat. <br /> <br /> Unless you have good listening ability, this movie is hard to listen to. I think I understand only 80% of the dialogue. It can use a closed caption. <br /> <br /> If you are a sci-fi fan, it is one of the genres of classic and it's a must see (well, at least after the first hour). For the average viewer, wait until there is a closed caption version and then watch it if you are comfortable with movies of this period.
