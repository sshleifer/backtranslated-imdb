Although I love this movie, I can hardly see it, it's so real. So, I sat there tonight and hid behind my computer sofa. I remembered it sharply, but just wanted to see if I could find something I hadn't seen before ....... I didn't: it's because it's so realistic to me. <br /> <br /> Another user wrote the centuries of commentators should be shown with their summary. I'm all there! It is absolutely clear that most of these people who commented on "Midnight Cowboy" may not have been born when released. They call other movies Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman appeared later. I'll be just as ruined: I'm 82 years old. If you are familiar with some of my other comments, you will be aware that I was a professional female impersonator for 60 years and also appeared in a movie - you will never recognize me, even if you were familiar with my nightclub person. Do you think I know many of the characters in this movie? YOU DO BETWEEN I! .... <br /> <br /> .... and I'm not the least shy. If you didn't fall into some of them, it's your loss - but there's a big chance, but you didn't know it. So many moms, fathers, boys and girls can surprise you. It should be no secret. Many actors / actresses came from the background of "Midnight Cowboy". Who is to judge? I can call several current BIG-TIME stars that were raised on the soothing streets of many cities, and they were not least damaged by their time there. I do not judge because they are people, just as we are all - love, courage, kindness, compassion, intelligence, humility: you call these qualities, they are all there, no matter what the package looks like. <br /> <br /> The "trivia" about Hoffman actually begging the streets to prove he can do the role of "Ratzo" is a jewel. He can be seen driving his car across Los Angeles. How do you think he gets his input? I can also name many male stars sitting on the street and crossing the bars for money. Although the nightclub I worked for 26 years, was world-famous and legitimate, I can also name a few big stars that had to be constantly chased out of our back street to make a takeaway. <br /> <br /> It should not be surprising today, although it is definitely in Hollywood and other cities, big and small. Wake up and smell the roses. They do not smell any less sweet, because they are of a different color. <br /> <br /> Some of the "users" thought "Joe Buck" was molested by his grandmother. Although I saw him with a boyfriend in her bed, I didn't find any appearance of it. Believe it or not, children do not always have their own rooms - because it is a must today tell you something that kinky can do in the master bedroom. Whose business? Hoffman may have been begging on the street, but some of the users pointed out that Jon Voight was not a big star for the filming of Midnight Cowboy. His real salary will surprise you. I think he's robbed! No one can doubt the clarity he has set in his role, nor that it made him a star for such a great work as "liberation". He defined a strong man who conquered his demons and was the better for it: few people said he was sodomized in this movie. The end of the 60's may have been one of the first films to be open, but society has always been hip. <br /> <br /> I also found no homosexuality between "Ratzo" and "Joe" was clearly contradictory, unattractive to one another. They found a very pure higher relationship - true friendship. If you didn't understand it at the end of the movie, then you wasted your time. "Joe's" confusion, but unashamed commitment was clear. Yes, Voight deserves an Oscar for this role - one that John Wayne could never draw, and he was so beautiful in his youth. <br /> <br /> Hoffman is Hoffman - you expect fireworks. He gave them excellently. Wayne got his Oscar. Every character in this movie was beautifully defined - if you don't think they're still around, you're wrong. "The party"? - Attend some of the "raves" that younger people attend ... if you can come in. Look at the lines of people trying to get into hot clubs - you'll see every outrageous personality. <br /> <br /> Brenda Viccaro was the symbol of society's slender women who had to come temporarily on the cake. If you were shocked at her brilliant acting, you think "it's not really", look at today's "ladies" who are on the brink of disrepute ... and are admired. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the brutality "Joe" robbed of the old man is also part of life. You don't have to condone it, but it's not too much different from any violence. "Joe" mentioned his purpose promptly - in that situation I would have handed the money faster than he asked. This is one of the screens that made this movie a breakthrough, of which I didn't look. I am saddened by both. <br /> <br /> John Schlesinger surely had to be familiar with this sordidness to direct this spectacular beautiful eye-catcher. Waldo Salt did not write brightness. Anyone who had any part to get it on the screen had to realize they were making history and should be proud of its honesty. Perhaps "just in America" ​​we can close our eyes to unpleasant situations, while other filmmakers do not envisage proposing it to the public. Not looking, doesn't mean it's not there - give me the truth every time. Bravo! at all ......
