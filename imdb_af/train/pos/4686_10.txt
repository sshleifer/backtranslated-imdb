This is by far my favorite movie of all time. This is mainly because it is not afraid to immerse in some very politically inappropriate topics (such as spanking and female submission) that other mainstream films are just too modest to touch. Nothing in this movie seems to be, as the director freely develops the story without worrying about breaking the viewer. However, I think nothing is done here just for shock value or intentionally insulting someone. Sean Young turns into an excellent and courageous show. Most established mainstream actors would not have used this role or would have wanted for some important script changes before being accepted. The other role players are also doing a good job. <br /> <br /> Did you notice that this movie did not appear on payline as a mandatory one year after it hit the theaters? Have you ever wondered why? The obvious reason is that it just doesn't fit the political atmosphere of today. It seems to me ironic that some premium channels now carry cartoon pornography (which comes closer and closer to hardcore pornography), but will not carry a mainstream movie such as 'Love Crimes'. Unfortunately, even though this film is only 11 years old, it is unlikely to be made today. <br /> <br />
