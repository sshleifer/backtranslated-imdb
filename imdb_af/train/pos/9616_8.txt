Worth watching twice because of the rapid causal shifts among several compelling stories, "Bug" appears as a perfect work of art that plays ever-optimistic love against many examples of frustrating reality. <br /> <br /> My favorite characters are Wallace (John Carroll Lynch) whose biggest concern for life - from the cockroach to the airline passenger for whom he is partially responsible - rattles the movie; Olive (Christina Kirk), who spends a lot of time creating surreal but delicious meals for her impossible husband Ernie (Chris Bauer); and Mitchell, a cable television technician with unlimited confidence in cookie messages: "You will meet the girl of your dreams." <br /> <br /> At such optimism, the forces of strange reality, all generated by actions of the characters: parking tickets, a clogged drain in a Chinese food / donut shop, TV disruption, a crashed automatic fender, an expired dinner discussion that eventually leads to the cancellation of a Hawaiian holiday. <br /> <br /> The movie is funny: Olive gets drunk on a Chippendale show, Johnston (Michael Hitchcock), as a customer service attempt trying to handle an indifferent customer. The germ-obsessive Cyr (Brian Cox) faces a restaurant inspector, Dwight (Jamie Kennedy) who responds to his girlfriend's response. refusal to have children by writing hostile Chinese cookie tunes: "Your girl is lying to you" and the man falling asleep while manning a jackhammer because he was looking for his girl's missing cat the night. <br /> <br /> A small story with public cabl an access manager (Darryl Theirse) and a local acting teacher reading "The Boy in the Bubble" speak the main theme: love comes from the heart. <br /> <br /> "Bug" is entertaining on the same level as "trains, planes and cars", but on a lower budget and with a fresh eye.
