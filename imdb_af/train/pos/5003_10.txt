I didn't watch this show. But I'm glad I did. The critics of this just don't get it! It is currently one of the funniest and most entertaining things on T.V! Although, when interviewing general people, it was probably useless; but put it in the mouth of animals and insects, and this is a legend. I laughed so loudly, I had tears in my eyes. The pig with the babies who suck and her mother is priceless. The man and woman are talking about health problems, and the male bird who takes a shit after the woman said she is constipated has completely broken me! Creature Comforts is the most imaginative show I've ever seen! Hopefully this summer will be back if this race is over.
