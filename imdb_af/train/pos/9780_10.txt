I watched this movie at the BIFFF Festival in Brussels, spring 2004. What a surprise! This German production, a stylish and imaginative shock, is one of the fearsome movies I've seen. Be warned: this is not a joke! This terrorist has great role-players of good actors. Peter Martell, a European guru, has a strong presence. Excellent direction, good production design, a very good soundtrack and very heavy gore sfx like Italian horror movies in the eighties. Meat is ripped to the bone ... and the blood runs red ... this wild heart stopper will catch you ... and give you some dark dreams ... a must-see !!
