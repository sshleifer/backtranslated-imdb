I read a number of reviews on this movie and I have to say, "What's wrong with your people?!?!" It was a great movie! I thought this movie was excellent from start to finish and the story was very well told. I am convinced that the people who do not like this movie do not pay much attention to the movie. There are a number of very important scenes that, if you do not pay attention, you will be confused and the following scenes cannot make sense. I appeal to anyone who didn't like this movie, to watch it again and see it alone so you can really pay attention. The story made me completely healthy and, as I said, it was very well told. Every scene in the movie has a point and everything fits the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> All the actors did a fantastic job! Sean Connery was very good at his role as always. Laurence Fishburne was beautiful like Tanny Brown, who plays a very interesting character. Kate Capshaw was also a good touch and looks great. Blair Underwood was a pleasant surprise, I didn't really expect anything from him, but he did a good performance. Ed Harris was the real jewel in the movie. He plays a really sick individual and really lets you see how disturbed his character is. See his eyes in his screens, just fantastic !!! There is also a very young Scarlett Johansson (as Kate) in one of her first roles ... not a bad place to start. Excellent role in this movie! <br /> <br /> I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes or just likes thrillers. It's a good movie and should be seen. Don't listen to all these other people's opinions, look at the movie and come to your own conclusions. I hope you will see the movie, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do. Thanks for reading, <br /> <br /> -Chris
