The best-selling horror story writer Cheryl (a solid and sympathetic performance by the lovely Virginia Bryant), her husband Tom (the nice Paolo Serra) and their son Bobby (nicely played by Patrizio Vinci) go to a remote castle located in the countryside is. summer vacation. Local legend claims the area is cursed. Cheryl discovers a creepy, hairy, nasty ogre (sob David Flosi in a remarkably boring costume) living in the basement. Cheryl should overestimate her fearful childhood fear of the beast so she can defeat the filth. Director / co-author Lamberto Bava does an expert job of creating and maintaining an ominous and unpleasant nightmare. In addition, Bava forfeits the standard blood'n'guts fright flick routine in favor of making a compelling and challenging dark mature fairy-tale fable about how the best way to fight it is frightening us to address the head. Sturdy supporting turns by Sabrina Ferilli as friendly school teacher Anna, Stefania Montorsi as hottie babysitter Maria, and Alex Serra as bitter painter Dario. Gianfranco Transunto's brilliant cinematography boasts some liquid detection shots and very good atmospheric lighting. Fabrizio Sforza's upscale make-up f / x, Simon Boswell's splendid spooky's herding score, and the calyx-covered cellar all hit the creepy spot. Worth watching.
