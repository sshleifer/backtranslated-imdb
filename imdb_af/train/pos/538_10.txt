Back to the cabin at the lake may be one of the few successors who can live to the original. It had black humor, good suspension, nice looking girls and of course a psycho-killer. What are we missing? I don't think anything. Except that we were left with a small amount of gore and nudity because it was made for television. Aside from being one of the best pursuits, it is one of the best vibrants to watch as a family. Recommended for everyone.
