This film has become one of my favorite pseudo noir experiences over the past ten years. The three storylines we have given by Kazan each have their own unique and distinct pleasure. The domestic bell between Bel Geddes and Widmark, the movement between rooms, the small gestures like the phonebook Barbara puts on the chair under her son so that he can reach the table, the small intimate exchanges between husband and wife, all are well made and of course . More than anything else, I love their patio, the second living room where it's clear, they spend a lot of their summer time. The second thread is the professional relationship between many in the film, but especially between Widmark and Douglas's characters. It may not be completely original and become a bit scary, but it all comes across as real, respectful and effective. The third thread, the grungy story of Blackie and his broken little gang, gets us closest to a dark and frightening noir world. The Blackie's Blackie is as cold as a block of ice. This self-proclaimed businessman, this self-made man, obviously has a complexity that we just briefly incorporate. For me, this movie is still a completely satisfying experience.
