Uncompromising look at a suburb in the 21st century. Vienna blending the stories of six groups of characters by former documentary author. U.Seidl is a challenging, minimalist and intense piece of observation theater. <br /> <br /> After the worldwide spread of Big Brother's reality shows, Hundstage takes modern voyeurism to a disturbing, deep level. It's hard to keep, but an undisputed piece of European cinema looks cruel and seedy, but manages to convey the nihilistic estranged sense of modern society in a commendable way. <br /> <br /> A must for world cinema lovers.
