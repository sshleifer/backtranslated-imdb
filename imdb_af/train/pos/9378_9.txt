Dahl seems to be under the influence of Wenders' The American Friend. Innocent Nick Cage is recruited for a hit. Dennis Hopper plays a real hit man. Lara Flynn Boyle is dangerous. The hero gets closer to him as he tries to free himself. And small town America doesn't look much safer than the Big City. As the predecessor mentioned above, this movie has many kicks and turns that are unlikely to appear, but everything leads to cat-like self-discovery.
