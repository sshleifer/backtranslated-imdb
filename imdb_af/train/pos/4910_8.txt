This very good movie cracks with tension. Of course, the input is high. Will public and public health and law enforcement officers arrest the criminals who do not know they have a pest before breaking out a full-blown epidemic? But smaller platinum elements present tensions in every scene - between Widmark and the police captain, between the bad guys who played Palance and Mostel, between Palance and a dying pestor who mistakenly believes Palance, is the subject of a man hunt because he Widget and his wife smuggled into a valuable commodity, and with the underlying question whether the public is better served by informing them about the danger or hiding the situation to avoid a full-blown panic. The film is beautifully shot by Kazan, shot in exceptionally well-choreographic long shots in place in New Orleans, and ends in a beautiful climax, where Palance flies like a rogue from his pursuers, through the city's docks and warehouses. The commentary is wonderful, probably the best I have heard about cinematography, the framework and lighting of shots, the production design, the cast of non-professional actors in small roles and the ironic and parallelism in the plot, like an insightful seminar in the 1950s film techniques and film noir in general. Watch once to enjoy the movie on its own, and if you're interested in film making, a second time with the commentary to learn.
