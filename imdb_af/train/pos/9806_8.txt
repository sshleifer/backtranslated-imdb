I agree that Capital City should be on DVD. I just watched this tournament by accident in 1994 and am in love with Rolf Saxon as Hudson Talbot. It was nice to see Americans working in London overseas in London for a change. I loved Rolf in this role and loved every other role he participated in. I can't believe the show lasted just 13 episodes. I kept William Armstrong as Hudson's flamboyant charming friend in the series. When they broadcast this show in the New York City area, it was always late at night or at times. The show is less than an hour long. I felt this show had to go longer, but the decisive changes in the second season really made the performance slightly less interesting. I don't mind Sylvia, but missed the actress Julia Phillips-Lane in the previous season. I felt this show had chances and it often worked. It showed Americans who loved and chose to stay in London. The American characters were not arrogant or were trying to overshoot their British counterparts. I also liked the fact that they tried to internationalize the role rather than making them all British. I liked watching Julia Ormond in an early role. I felt this show had to last longer. I sometimes felt that the previews lasted as long as the show in less than an hour. They could have passed the strip to New York City and it would have been a hit in America.
