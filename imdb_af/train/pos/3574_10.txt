It's hard to say why a movie is so effective. From the moment I first came across the "The Stone Boy", something told me it would be a good movie. Even so, it was very unlikely that I would ever have the opportunity to see it for myself. Then one day, while watching through the online catalog of my local library, I saw that they recently purchased the DVD edition of this movie. I am very happy about, because cinematography is of incredible depth and quality that an old VHS copy can never repeat. <br /> <br /> And talking about cinematography, I have to stretch it so far and above the most beautiful aspect of this movie. As a photographer close to the exact visual style exhibited in "The Stone Boy", I strongly believe in the fact that a large filmmaker can carry a movie almost alone. Here, he has a lot of help from a very talented role, and a director who perfectly understands what the story needs. But to have Juan Ruiz Anch√≠a behind the camera, almost every scene makes something of beauty. And you can hardly ever say it. Most movies will never expect you to. Scene after scene catches some detail, a little visual magic that takes your breath away. <br /> <br /> The director, Christopher Cain, had a long and interesting career. As far as I can gather, this film is not very representative of it. But sometimes, to catch a director near the start of his career, before all the big budgets and loss of focus, there is a really subtle magic. Cain returns to this film, lets things happen with his own life, and then even further. Like early John Sayles movies, characters are given space to breathe, time to talk. Side stories happen because they do it, and so is life. Cain shows a remarkable, raw and even painful understanding of human nature in this film. <br /> <br /> The play connects a lot of this story together. When people talk, when they are in this movie, they do it as real people, not held back by the fact that they play characters. Gina Berriault's screenplay spends amazingly talented and respected actors such as Wilford Brimley, Robert Duvall, Glenn Close and Frederic Forrest spending time alone. Whether the things they have to say is small or of great importance, it all comes down to the weight of pure reality. <br /> <br /> Looking at the actors involved, or the big soundtrack by James Horner, it seems odd that such a movie is almost forgotten. Perhaps much of what the Stone Stone is, what it was like, the period in which it was made. There is this 70-year-old hangover for this photo that reminds me of my own childhood. People are talking about the 80's in terms of modern styles and music, but it's not the 80s I lived or remembered. The appearance of the images, the underestimated and dark knowledge of the acting, and the overall outcome must come under the skin of any person who grew up in or near this era of time in North America. I see myself in this. I see how I saw the world. And a movie like "The Stone Boy" sees the world as it really is. <br /> <br /> For more of this feeling, please see: <br /> <br /> The Black Stallion (1979), Never Cry Wolf (1983), Tender Mercies (1983), Testament (1983), Places in the Heart (1984), Matewan (1987), High Tide (1987), Driving Miss Daisy (1989), The Secret of Roan Inish (1994), Wendy and Lucy (2008)
