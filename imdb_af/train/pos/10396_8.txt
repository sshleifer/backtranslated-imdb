It was usually producer Alexander Korda's advice on appointing many of his mutual; The film is credited with three directors, but in reality, Alex, Zoltan Korda and William Cameron Menzies, helped push it to six. <br /> <br /> For John Kobal's 1987 book, The Top 100 Movies, his record of 81 film critics has reached The Thief of Baghdad 55th. A closer investigation shows that only Jose Luis Guarner, John Russell Taylor and Kobal actually voted for the picture, but their high posts were enough to take it close to the halfway. <br /> <br /> The outbreak of World War II shifted the film's production around England and America, eventually finishing in 1940 and winning three technical Oscars. Like Citizen Kane, in some ways this may be a movie you might rather admire than love. <br /> <br /> The special effects, outstanding for the time, are still reasonable, and actually stop when you're scared. But it is not so much their effectiveness as the audacity of the inventions. Among them is an entertaining horse, built from an instant model, which is inserted as a key, is the back, starts flying. There is also a killer toy from the six armed goddess Kali, (perhaps quite a single woman with two women sitting behind her) and a terrifying giant spider. Also impressive is the climax with its wonderful flying carpet. But the most memorable one should be that Rex Ingram appears as a jinn (genius) nearly a thousand feet in a wonderful moment of cinematic conception! Ingram portrays the genius as a very threatening being, adding an element of danger to the proceedings. And look out for the moment he is lucky in his bottle! <br /> <br /> John Justin does well as the Arab king who, for some strange reason, has an English accent and a stiff lip. Sabu, the surprisingly muscular 15-year-old, is the closest namesake Abu, a similar scavenger. After crossing paths with the evil Jaffer (Conrad Veidt), Justin finds himself blind and Abu is turned into a dog. When it turns out, the rest of the film will be told in retrospect by the blind Ahmed's (Justin's) perspective. We find it halfway through the movie we catch to the present and the adventure continues. In fact, the second half is somewhere better, full of bigger incident and more fantastic of nature. <br /> <br /> Three small songs pepper the piece, although the film lasts for 100 minutes, feels more like a soft flavor rather than a real ingredient; I wouldn't classify it as a musical. It's fun; Justin and June Duprez is the love interest for the mothers and fathers, Veidt is the boo-lift villain, and Abu is the youthful, irreconcilable robber. It may take a while to get into the somewhat dated mindset and remaining melodrama of 40's English movies, but once you've been sitting for the first half of an hour, this movie really pulls you. Very laudable.
