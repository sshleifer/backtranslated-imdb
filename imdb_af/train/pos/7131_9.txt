This made-to-TV movie is a brilliant one. This is probably the best and favorite role by BAFTA winning John Thaw (Kavanagh Q.C. and Inspector Morse). Tom Oakley (Thaw) widow has lived alone in a town since his wife and son died, and now he has landed with an evacuee named Willaim Beech (Nick Robinson). As he gets to know this child, he begins to develop a friendship. Until Willaim's mother (Annabelle Apsion) wants him back. After Tom was worried that William didn't contact him, he went to London to get him. In the end, Willaim gets his home with a loving family (or dad). This is an excellent film during World War II. It was nominated for the BAFTA Lew Grade Award, which won the National Television Popular Drama Award. John Thaw was number 3 on the 50 biggest stars of the TV. Very good!
