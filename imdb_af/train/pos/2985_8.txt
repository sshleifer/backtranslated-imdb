The whole point of making this film, one of the earliest and best international color releases of the film opera, was to make it more accessible to the masses. And it was great to do this. The general public will not be silent for a love story about two young exotic lovers in ancient Egypt if it is played by the typical 300 pounds over 40 tenor and soprano with the vocal equipment to sing the glorious music properly. Hence the visual replacement of the beautiful principals (a young Loren, attractive Della Marra, and a brand new Ms Maxwell) who make the story much more credible, so those who are not familiar with the plot or the music have a better chance getting into the beautiful arias that may not otherwise be. Overall, an enchanting introduction to one of Verdi's great works. I remember it when I was in high school and it aroused my interest in opera, a form I was not so familiar with. I still see this movie fine and will highly recommend it to those who can accompany the good music, accompanied by better than average footage. Luciano Della Marra was an exception to Radames, and unfortunately the public did not appear in any other films.
