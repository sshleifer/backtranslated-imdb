Okay, I'll admit it - I'm a goofball and I love a silly comedy every now and then. Having seen more movies of Kurosawa, Bergman and Truffaut than virtually anyone on the planet, I still have a soft spot for a dull comedy that doesn't seem to be sophisticated but just funny. A few such films that come straight to mind are MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL, UHF, STARTING THE REVOLUTION WITHOUT ME, STRONG BREW and the Bill and Ted movies. They all have no snobs, but just a zombie or professional film critic can't keep them. <br /> <br /> While BILL & TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY isn't as wonderful as the original Bill and Ted movie, it's still nice. Also, unlike the original one, it actually looks improved with repeated viewing. I remember not having loved the movie for the first time - possibly because the other movie made such a high standard for the laugh. But every time I see it again, I'm amazed at all the great moments - especially those of the Grim Reaper. And by the way, this mower is about as different from Bergman's in THE SEVENTH SEAL as you can! In addition to lots of laughter, this movie contains some excellent music - one way that it is actually better than the first movie. The coastal anthem at the end is good, but so are the rest of the hard rock songs - provided you are not an old killjoy like De Nomolos. Great views for children and adults.
