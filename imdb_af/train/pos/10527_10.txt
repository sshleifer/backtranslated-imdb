This is one of the best movies I've seen for years! I'm not a Gwyneth Paltrow fan, but she's great like Emma Woodhouse. Alan Cumming is wonderful like Reverand Elton, and Emma Thompson's sister Sophie is hysterical as Miss Bates. And watch the beautiful Jeremy Northam as Mr. Knightley; what a man! Who said you needed sex and violence in a movie to make it good, Emma never saw. I think that's what separates it from so many others. It is nice. <br /> <br /> Looking for a movie that you can watch with the whole family or watch a romance for yourself, look no further. Emma is that movie. With a beautiful setting, great costumes and a great role play (called the beautiful Jeremy Northam?), Emma is a perfect ten!
