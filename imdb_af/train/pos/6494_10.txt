This is undoubtedly the best documentary ever produced. It gives an accurate and epic depiction of the Second World War of Poland's invasion in 1939 until the end of the war in 1945. <br /> <br /> Honestly, this documentary offers views of both sides of the conflict that gives a very human face to the war. At the same time, tactics and the importance of fighting are not overlooked. There has been a lot of work in giving a detailed picture of the war and especially the high, low and turning points in the allies. Being a British-made documentary, this 26-series focus is mainly on Britain, but Russia and America's contribution is not being scaled down. It's just one such advantage of such a series. <br /> <br /> Another worthy mention is the score, the music and the whole feeling of the documentary is one of unrest, struggle and perseverance. Like a movie, this series leaves the viewer in no doubt about the hardships experienced by allies and Germans during the war. This is a highlight at the end of each episode, which is dropping the rough of the Second World War. After all 26 have been watched, the viewer is left with an extensive knowledge of the war and surprised at how much we owe to members of the previous generation.
