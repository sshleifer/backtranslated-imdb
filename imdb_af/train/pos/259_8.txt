For a Danish movie I have to say that this is a very good movie. <br /> <br /> It's in a class of its own, but it has an international potential. <br /> <br /> The movie has a great budget and is known as well-known Danish actors, and some newcomers, who play very well. It can be watched by anyone who loves adventures, and a little ghost movie. <br /> <br /> Don't be afraid, be excited!
