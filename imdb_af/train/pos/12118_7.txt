When I saw that this movie was just 80 minutes long, I thought we were in trouble. The condensation of the giant W. Somerset Maugham novel into a movie that climbs in an hour and a half looks like a disaster waiting to happen. But you know, the movie is not bad, and it even drives a lot of what the book resonates so much with its readers. <br /> <br /> I heard that many movie buffs complain that Leslie Howard was a wet noodle of an actor, and he was, but I can't think of anyone more suited to the role of Philip Carey than play a wet noodle, because that's definitely what Carey is. Howard plays it well, which means you want to shake him and beat him repeatedly on his head, then finally take him out and buy him a spine. <br /> <br /> Oh, and then there is Bette, like the girl with whom Carey is obsessed and who brings his world around him. I didn't know what Mildred's attraction in the book was on earth, and the film remains true to that detail. But as played by Davis, she becomes the most fascinating character in the story, and if she is nasty and unlikely, she is at least the most dynamic person on the screen at any given time. Davis's show here is credited with changing the screen's acting, much like Brando's almost 20 years later when he "Stella !!" shouted. In that little-known Tennesee, Williams plays, and it's not hard to see why. Davis is intense to the point of scary. She does not bother to tolerate any sympathy of the audience, and she makes herself look ugly and most ominous. Her appearance when Carey soon goes into the film to find her death or nearly death of an anonymous disease (though not much caring to hide the fact that it is an STD) is shocking. Of course, this movie spread out just before the Production Code came into effect; If it was made a year later, you could bet things would be a little different. <br /> <br /> Yes, much of the novel, and many of its most interesting parts, are left on the cutting room floor. , and the story is really about Carey and Mildred and not much else. I found it to be the least interesting and boring part of Maugham's novel, but that is the part that gives the novel its title and seems to be the part that readers still draw. It seems to me to be a wise decision on the part of the filmmakers they chose to adapt the novel as they did. <br /> <br /> Degree: B +
