he is the actual daffodil and manipulator; Kathryn Morris is sympathetic as a victim, Anne Marie Fahey, but in the beginning it is a bit too much for the victim. We are sorry for the situation, but are disgusting at the same time after seeing his victimization of several other women (including Rachel Ward). <br /> <br /> The sad part is where she actually gets help with her self-esteem issues, and Capano actually killed her psychologist. Very hard to believe, but it was based on a real story. <br /> <br /> There is a cameo with Olympia Dukakis (excellent) as Capano's mother. All in all, an interesting story because it is based on a real murder, and you will want to read Ann Rule's book to get the accurate details. 8/10.
