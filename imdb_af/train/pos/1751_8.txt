The 40-year-old virgin is about Andy Stitzer, a 40-year-old man working in an electronic store and not much of a social life and very uncomfortable about women. Some of his co-workers at the shop invite him one night and they discover that Andy is still a virgin, so they plan to help him lose his virginity. One day in store Andy meets a woman named Trish, giving him her phone number and finally Andy, working enough courage to go with her and they really start to love each other, but Andy is still very uncomfortable when It comes to sex and he'll have to tell it, Trish, to his embarrassment if he can actually get up enough to tell her before things get uncomfortable. The 40-year-old virgin has good direction, a good screenplay, good comic performances throughout the role, good filmmaking and good movie editing. The movie stars and are co-written by Steve Carell, who does a very good comic breakthrough and his writing for the film is also very good. I was very pleasantly surprised with this movie. It is sweet, funny, entertaining, fun, enjoyable, smart, benign and good time. This movie is as good as this year's Wedding Crashers, and both films are two of the best comedies I've seen in a while. The 40-year-old virgin really shows a lot of talent and it is well used and works as a comedy and a romance and it is sweet and fun. One of the greatest surprises and one of the best comedies of the year.
