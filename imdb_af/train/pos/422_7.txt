"The Plainsman" represents the case law of Cecil B. DeMille in its most inaccurate and unfit manner. It proposes parallel sites for no less stars than a commitment such as Wild Bill Hickok (Gary Cooper), Buffalo Bill Cody (James Ellison), Calamity Jane (Jean Arthur), George Armstrong Custer and Abraham Lincoln to respond, although Lincoln in reality Lincoln was. Already dead when the story takes place. The Mille always drives a dangerous proximity to the truth, but just as easily jumps from it into unspeakable spectacle and display. The film is an attempt to curb Custer's last stance with a heap of fiction that is loosely based on people's lives, which have already been the product of manufactured goods and legends. Truly, this is the world according to DeMille - an enthusiastic in the annals of entertainment, but a beautiful camel's relic according to today's standards. TRANSFER: Considering the vintage of the film, it is a moderately attractive transfer, with often clean whites and extremely solid blacks. There is a considerable amount of film grain in some scenes and an absence of it in other moments. All in all, the image quality is somewhat inconsistent, but is it never bad or all good? just a little better than the middle of the road. Age-related artifacts are kept to a minimum and digital deviations do not diminish. The sound is mono, but beautifully balanced. <br /> <br /> EXTRAS: Forget about it. It's universal! BOTTOM LINE: If pseudo-history is painted on celluloid, this western is compelling and fun. Just his characters and story with a salt grain? in some cases ?? a whole box looks more appropriate!
