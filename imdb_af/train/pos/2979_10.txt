There really isn't much to say about this movie. It's rough, but fun. <br /> <br /> Plotskets (From IMDB) <br /> <br /> _____________________________________ <br /> <br /> Two losers from Milwaukee, Coop & Remer (Parker & Stone), find out a new game that play basketball with baseball rules. When the game becomes a great success, they, together with a billionaire's help, form the Professional Baseball Club where everyone is paying the same and no team can change cities. Coop & Remer's team, the Milwaukee Beers, is the only team that stands in the way of major rule changes that the owner of the Dallas Felons (Vaughn) wants to set. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The Acting is pretty good, as there are not very big stars in this movie. Although I'm not a big fan of 'Southpark', Parker and Stone do a great job in their first real movie. <br /> <br /> There are so many funny moments in this movie. I can't get close to calling them all. It never really leaves it, and they don't try to bring in a rough drama to make it more serious. <br /> <br /> And my favorite aspect of this movie: The Soundtrack. It's wonderful. I especially like Reel Big Fish, like 'Take me on' and 'Beer'. Very understated. <br /> <br /> Overall, a rough, but very funny, movie. 10/10 <br /> <br /> James "Black Wolf" Johnston
