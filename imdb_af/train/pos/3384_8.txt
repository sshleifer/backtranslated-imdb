My Review: 8/10 <br /> I love this movie a lot. Compare mindless film today (just action and special effet and nothing new about ideas), "Soylent Green" asks something that no longer exists today: To think. <br /> <br /> Well, that wouldn't be great. surprised one day one eats "biscuits" created with human body. With everything happening on this planet, and seeing how people are so indifferent to everyone, this kind of future is possible. <br /> <br /> Sure, this movie is getting a little old, but the idea behind the movie is real. Rich in Paradise, others in hell. Well, luck, today they are TV and idiot like 'Reality Show'. <br /> <br /> TV is a good washbrain. It is a pity to see that human intelligence does not progress like technology. Since writing all stops. <br /> <br /> If you like the reality show, this movie is not for you. If you believe all the politicians as well. If you don't like it, ask yourself a question about now and the future, never look at this movie.
