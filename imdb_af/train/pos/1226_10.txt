They filmed this movie on a long island, where I grew up. My brother and his girlfriend were extras in this movie. Apparently, there is a party scene where they all drink beer (which they told me was colored water, tasted disgusting and were very difficult to hold over and over, especially in the funnel counters). Yet, none of us ever heard that the film was released in any form. Of course, it never came out in the theaters and it is known as never having been released on video and I'm probably not released on DVD. However, it seems to be seen by some, though probably very few. So there must be something. I would definitely like to buy it for my brother, but there is no way to find it anywhere. Does anyone know when / where / how this movie can be purchased? And what format would it be?
