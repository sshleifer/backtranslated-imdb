Director Otto Preminger reunites with his Laura stars Dana Andrews and Gene Tierney in this rough and ready-to-waste movie noir: Where the pavement ends. This film is complete with a well-written crime story with interesting characters, unexpected turns, and clever dialogue and a dazzling appearance with great camera movements and dark and keen film noir lighting. Dana Andrews stars as detective Mark Dixon, part killer and part cop, who has a reputation for being physically difficult with criminals. When one case sees Dixon looking for suspects and answers, he becomes much more involved than he wanted. <br /> <br /> Dana Andrews is great in his role - tough and edgy, Andrews' Dixon is ready to beat anybody's heels when they get on his bad side. He is the perfect film noir anti-hero - he is not very nice, but we still have him root. Gene Tierney does a solid job in her role, as much as it is, a lovely shoulder for Dixon. There may not be too much of Tierney's role, but she will certainly, in addition to what others can do, smear every member of the audience with her friendly smile, gentle manner and shine in her eye. The supporting role play is also not bad - Karl Malden is the most memorable, step in and gives a good supportive performance as Lieutenant Thomas. Where the pavement ends is Laura, but it's a big movie noir filled with great characters, story and photo.
