I was recorded on DAN IN REAL LIFE from the excellent reviews and the thirst for a well-written Dramedy - thank you Peter Hedges. And as Steve Carell stars in the movie, you know you're going to find an audience like in LITTLE MISS. SUNSHINE, a performance that is very entertaining and rewarding. WHEN REAL LIFE WAS THAT PROMISE. <br /> <br /> The movie is so real to many families worldwide who have lost a member and still have gone with their lives looking for something that will give them the magic back. before their loss. With Steve Carell and the wonderful Juliette Binoche, their relationship was so beautifully finished and written that their scenes were so real to their characters and their travels. The movie, sets and story THEN made in REAL LIFE to remember while facing the holiday.
