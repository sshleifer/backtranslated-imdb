I never bothered to see this movie in theaters, though I remember hearing the name over and over again. I watched it this week and what a pleasure. For some reason I expected it not to be very good, so I was completely surprised when I sat down and then found myself. I read many other comments from the other user and it impressed me how many people are talking about her fighting in the ring, but what was wonderful about Diana is that she is a real fighter in life. All she has to do is find her place where she is who she is and the ring helps her get there. A very intelligent story and I am surprised that this is Michelle Rodriguez's first time - an excellent job she did. Adrian and her coach were also very good. <br /> <br /> This movie is a bit rough around the edges, but it doesn't matter in the slightest. The story, the will and the performances are far heavier than any mistakes (it usually comes with indie movies). A compelling depiction of a girl who finds herself standing and triumphing over her circumstances and a K.O. for Michelle Rodriguez!
