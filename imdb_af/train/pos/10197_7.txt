Well, it's a long year and I'm reviewing the final movie for 2004. Panaghoy Sa Suba (Call of The River) placed second in the recent Metro Manila Film Festival. As expected, it didn't do so well at checkout, as it was too artsy for the common filmmakers, especially since MMFF is the season where many families go out to watch movies. <br /> <br /> Watching a movie that wasn't in Philippine or English was quite intriguing to play on the screen. I thought Cesar Montano did a good job as well as a star and director. His great vision and creativity really helped this movie. He was also very effective as the star and could express a wide range of emotions needed for the film. Also good performance was young actress Rebecca Lusterio. She did a good job portraying Duroy's younger sister Bikay. I hope to see her in many more film projects in the future, perhaps in other genres. I think the fact that this film was in her local dialect really helped her. <br /> <br /> Some of the camera shots in the movie have been very well done. The scenery has been breathtaking, even though I feel it would be quite different if it were a lesser effort. <br /> <br /> In terms of the story, I feel that the authors could go further into the lives of the smaller characters in the movie. I will definitely not shout about the story of this movie.
