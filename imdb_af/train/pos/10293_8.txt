"Bruce Almighty" will win the Academy Awards with a record 14 Oscar! It will surpass Titanic as the highest gross movie of all time! Jim Carrey's illustrations will be on such a high level that he will announce his presidential candidacy for the 2004 White House playoffs. Almighty then! These large-scale fantasies will only emerge if the filmmakers (including Carrey) possess the powers of God. The same condition is the most important ingredient in Carrey's new laugh riot `Bruce Almighty '. Carrey plays Bruce Nolan, a television reporter who is so obsessed with being the chief anchor that he keeps God in total debt for his own counter-temp. God, played by Morgan Freeman, gives Bruce the 'Gift of God' (his powers) to challenge him if he can do God's work better. Of course Bruce is "snatched away" with his newly found happy faculties and uses them selfishly. Carrey is back in his usual almighty comic form in 'Bruce Almighty'. Jennifer Aniston was not "sensitive" to Bruce's friend. However, my premier kudos goes to director Tom Shadyac for not keeping the dog out of the house for # 2, and showing us the most hilarious doggoned bathroom scene of all time! "Bruce Almighty" is not the most in-depth Carrey movie, but it is still an almighty exhibition of 'Carreyism'! **** Good
