"Now in India's sunny climb, where I used to spend my time as a soldier in the service of her Majesty the Queen ..." so is the famous poem written by Rudyard Kipling. This is the literal basis on which the movie "Gunga Din" is based. If you are happy to watch this legendary Classic, you will enjoy movies as they use them to make them; for the mere pleasure. From the script of the established novelist and poet, it is a story of a humble Indian native called Gunga Din (Sam Jaffe) who works as a regimental being during the British occupation of India during the 18th century. His greatest wish is to become a soldier. The water boy is part of a British Calvary threatened by the death of a notorious blood cult Kali, the "Thuggee". Three specific soldiers stand out in this company noticed for their bravery and companionship. First is attractive and debonair, Cary Grant plays Sgt. Archibald Cutter. Next is Victor McLaglen as brave Sgt. MacChesney and finally there is flamboyant Douglas Fairbanks Jr. as Sgt. Thomas Ballantine. All three and their fellow soldiers are surrounded by a lot of mountain strings led by their fanatic leader, the 'Guru' (Eduardo Ciannelli). In the midst of the war shows, the brave water boy is hoping to earn a place in the army by playing a bug he has found. A solid story for an old black and white movie that needs little fanfare for anyone who wants to enjoy a classic. ****
