Sure, this movie wasn't like it. 16 blocks, inside the man, an American haunting. etc. <br /> <br /> But it was a wonderful mystery that could happen to anyone of us. I found this movie very good and scary. <br /> <br /> I live exactly where they filmed This movie "San Pedro, California" And we have true stories based on incidents of this movie. <br /> <br /> I don't know if you've heard of the famous boat in the long beach "Queen Mary". Well, that boat is haunted. I believe in sprouts, illusions and parallel, or you spell it. is real. everyone is there own universe. <br /> <br /> The mind is a powerful thing. <br /> <br /> I recommend watching this movie. it is wonderful and not bad. <br /> <br /> For those who consider it a 1. They don't understand the movie. its meaning. his plot, his view. and how bad the sea can be for every one of us. <br /> <br /> Ty. <br /> <br /> Victor
