I love Paul McCartney. He is the greatest of all times in my appearance. However, I couldn't afford a ticket for his concert at the Tacoma Dome during the Back in the US tour. I was upset to say the least. Then I found this DVD. It was almost as good as being there. Paul is still the man and I will enjoy it for the coming year. <br /> <br /> I have one complaint. I'd like to hear from Hey Jude. <br /> <br /> Also Paul is not dead. <br /> <br /> The single biggest concert DVD ever. <br /> <br /> ** *** out *****.
