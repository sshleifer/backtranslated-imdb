There is indeed much to complain about this movie version of Molnar's mystical play. Farrell looks good in his title role, but his reaction reading, honestly, stinks. It also suffers to a great extent from being credited as the first film to make use of back projection. The sets seem ominous. <br /> <br /> There are, however, two major strengths in this show: although the dialogue readings decrease, visual performances are perfect. Rose Hobart, like Julie, is little remembered today: mostly for Rose Hobart, in which Joseph Cornell cut off the programmer EAST VAN BORNEO to just let her shoot: credit Melford's handsome visual direction of the original. Her great beauty and simple (though solid) performance help restore the damage to the ground-bound sections of this movie. <br /> <br /> However, one of Borzage's themes is the mystical power of love, and it is the handling of the heavenly divisions that make this great, from the coming of the heavenly train to the journey to the "hot spot" ". H.B. Warner's performance here is, as always, perfect. <br /> <br /> So we have a faulty but very interesting version here. I think Lang's 1934 version is better, as well as the heavenly scenes in the Henry King version of CAROUSEL, the water-down musical remake. But I still really enjoy this version and think you should give it a chance.
