Not sure why it doesn't play in Peoria, but it's a very funny, clever British comedy. This is at the end of the swinging sixties. Peter Sellars is fantastic as the rich, forty-something serial womanizer. The perfectly delightful Goldie Hawn, who plays a 19-year-old American girl in London, is initially Sellars' catch of the day. But the urban TV food critic can't stop him from falling for the dizzy American blonde. <br /> <br /> Humor, pathos, great writing, strong performances of the lead and supporting cabinets. <br /> <br /> It's a good movie, and the best gag is the last line. <br /> <br /> Try it, you'll love it.
