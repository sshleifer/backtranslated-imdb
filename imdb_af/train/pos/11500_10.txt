If Mulder was looking for his real dad here, he was Darren McGavin, the first X Files, sorry that it was only one season long, the producers of this show did not know that they had a classic craft and in 1993 Together, Chris Carter came up with what I call the sequel to the Night Stalker, The X Files. Both go down as classics, my opinion is that the two shows are the viewers on a level of experience that only comes once, and that in the X Files years later Darren McGavin should appear, as agent Arthur Dales who is our two favorite hero help, s solution cases. Thanks to the man I think so well done, Chris Carter, who held a forgotten TV show in the form of David Duchovny as Darren McGavin, if it wasn't to watch the X files and that the particular show I've never known of the night. Stalker.
