That overlooked an 80 soundtrack. I think John Travolta sang some of the songs, but in the movie it looks, it all seems to personalize everything that was 80's cheese. Clearly, movies that rely on mechanical bulls, bartenders and immature relationships are in style. The best was his mean Texas accent. Compare this with Friday lights. I suggest you watch Cocktail and Stir Crazy to really start the dumbing of the movie. Also, as a side note Made in America with Ted Danson and Whoopie Goldberg is a terribly bad movie. I was so shocked to realize I never looked at it. Another strange movie of this genre will include Cadilac Man with Robin Williams. Just remember all these GREAT stars played great roles in these CHEESY movies. Tom Cruise, Richard Pryor, Robin Williams and John Travolta
