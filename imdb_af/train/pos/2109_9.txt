I managed to watch it a few times as I thought it was a dumb, juicy, dated romantic comedy. Well, it's a romantic comedy, and maybe a little dated. However, this is not too sentimental, as it touches on the themes of office politics, adultery and loneliness. You think you know exactly where things are going, but there is an element of unpredictability that holds your interest, and not everything seems like you expected. But there is enough white and charm to touch the most impressive synika. If you meet someone who doesn't like this movie, you should seriously consider how well you know it.
