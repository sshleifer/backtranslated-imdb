"Who loves the sun" works through a solid subject with enough grace and grace not only to keep the story, but also often hilaries. It's been a while, because I found such a thorough, thoroughly enjoyable film. <br /> <br /> The movie is beautiful, with a view to beautiful scenery and tranquil landscapes. The peaceful imaging contrasts wonderfully with the tension between the very human, very defective and yet very nice characters. Due to the excellent role play, all five big players are wonderfully interesting and dynamic. <br /> <br /> I recommend "Who loves the sun." It is a very funny movie that looks at the pain we can inflict on each other and the incredibly difficult but equally rewarding process of forgiveness.
