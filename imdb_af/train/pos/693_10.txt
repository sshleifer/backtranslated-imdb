It's an almost-action-less movie after Jack, an insomniac, while going through hallucinations, being visited by dead friends, being thrown from a building, and for the most part, can't tell the reality of hallucination. . br /> <br /> Dominic Monaghan, like Jack, is truly credible. Confused, and scared, but listless and sometimes, without accepting what he sees, we follow him and try to sort out what he sees and find a way to sleep. Imagine a talking dog (another hallucination) and children suddenly appearing in Jack's bathroom and bedroom, without any explanation as to how they got there (more hallucination) and you have an interesting, sensible overwhelming 43 minutes. And the shower scene is enough to get any Dom fan back for more.
