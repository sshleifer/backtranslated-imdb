This movie probably never got a blip on the radar screen, but it has quite a bit of quality. It's pretty realistic, but you think, "It's just a movie." Duvall and Close depict people, and you'll never even realize they're now big-name actors. It seems as if the jerk in this story is a bit too old to chase Eugene's friend, but I think it's possible. The child seems unlikely to travel from Montana to Nevada, but I think it's possible. You may think the family problems in this movie will never happen in your own family, but I think it's possible. I remember Glenn Close saying something like, "You think the work you're doing is the hardest part of your life, but it's not."
