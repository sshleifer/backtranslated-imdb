Since Keifer Sutherland plays my favorite character in the history of the TV, it was a finished conclusion I go to the movies and spend $ 15 on this. I also think this applies to Eva Longoria supporters. <br /> <br /> The movie revolves around a leak that a mystery agent plans to kill the president. As the investigation unfolds, it seems the only probable candidate is the highly decorated Pete (Michael Douglas). Pete goes on the fun, fleeting style, to seek the truth. <br /> <br /> It's solid, but certainly not spectacular. A decent throw, a decent story, but it made me feel a bit empty, but you can definitely do much worse.
