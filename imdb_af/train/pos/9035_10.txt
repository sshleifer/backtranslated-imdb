The play in this movie was wonderful. As an amateur rocker I found very few mistakes. As a human, it touched my heart and soul. Looking at the actors, you would think they are the real characters. Laura Dern, a favorite actress of mine, left nothing out of her show. The young actors playing the Rocket Boys showed talent beyond their years, especially young Homer. Homer's father inspired the eternal love / hate relationship between a father and son so it really felt. If you don't get a lump in your throat or shed a tear if the first successful rocket goes up or when father and son reach it, check your wrist (you may be dead).
