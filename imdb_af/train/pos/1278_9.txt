"The Last Big Thing" is a wonderful satirical movie that makes pop culture sardonic swear to the point of humorous self-design. The characters are so interesting and fun to laugh at / sympathize with. What leads me to an introduction to the characters I liked best ... <br /> <br /> Simon Geist is a late 30's / early 40s man called a pop culture-driven editorial magazine " The Next Big Thing ". Thing is, this magazine doesn't really exist, and it's just an excuse for Simon to come near actors by questioning them, just to make them stupid and make them foolish to buy them in the pop culture . His life-in-female friend, Darla, also writes a magazine (actually), dealing mainly with her and Simon as well as her and her father. Darla is a true loving (or tolerable) character, depending on how you regard her muted neurotic behavior. Magda is a prostitute, the character I liked best. Brent is a flat character with not much for him, just like Tedra, the music video queen for a lot of B-rated rock bands. Yet, these characters weave a very interesting web together. And these movie questions all the motivation people have for what they do and why they do it. It's a great movie and I suggest you see it if you're in indie / art house style. Mark My Words! <br /> <br />
