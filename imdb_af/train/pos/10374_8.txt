I just sat through a very pleasant, fast 45 minute ROLL. <br /> <br /> Role is about a country boy, Mat (Toby Malone) who has dreams of becoming a Sports Star. Mature trip to the city and taken up by his cousin George (Damien Robertson). Well, that was the plan anyway. George is involved with a gangster, Tiny (John Batchelor), and makes a delivery for him. Needless to say, Mat is dragged into George's world. <br /> <br /> I thought it was wonderful how Mat George gave some measure of morality and respect while George Matteer learned how to relax and enjoy life a bit. Toby and Damien were well merged and did excellent work. <br /> <br /> Every character in the movie complemented each other well, the two policemen were great. David Ngoombujarra brought some great comic relief to the movie. Tiny played a lovely gangster who reminds me of one of my favorite characters 'Pando' by Two Hands. <br /> <br /> One of the other things I liked about Roll was that it showed the cities I grew up in and lived in for 20 years, Perth and Fremantle. It was good to see where I grew up, especially the old Ferris wheel. <br /> <br /> This Rocks a Rolls
