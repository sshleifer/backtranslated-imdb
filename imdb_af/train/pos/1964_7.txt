I cannot accept the negative comments of other reviewers. They are too critical, perhaps because they have been trapped in the past. I would like to see a comment from someone who has never seen Basic Instinct 1, maybe someone very young? I left the movie, feeling that I was not guarded by the IMDb reviewers. 14 hours later I still try to find errors in the plot, but I can't think of anything serious. My advice to all is for yourself and your own mind. <br /> <br /> This follows a similar pattern to Basic Instinct 1, but the plot is less confused. It still made me wonder, but in a more satisfying way. Sharon Stone is as sexy and angry as before and carries her 48 years very well; it remains her determining role. David Morrisey was satisfactory although he was not Michael Douglas. Of the supporting role, I especially liked David Thewlis as the police detective.
