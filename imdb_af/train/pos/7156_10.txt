Holes is a wonderful movie. I love it and it's one of my favorite movies. This is one of the few flashes produced by Disney that is not cheese. Holes are generally a very cool movie. I wish Disney would make more photos like that. Holes is indeed a rare race of Disney flashing shows that are cool. Don't get the wrong idea, I don't mean bad mouth Disney, but most things are aimed at kids and it's OK. Children also deserve their entertainment. But Disney is guilty of calling on the teenager's audience and they usually fail. But not with cavities. It's the type of movie anyone of any age can watch and enjoy and not even think it's wheat. Really, this is the kind of movie that can even enjoy many young hats, as there are characters in it that they can go about. <br /> <br /> Holes do a great job of being a blend of good family entertainment, but not too cheesy and a bit on the edge. I hope Disney takes more risks and makes more edgy flicks like this.
