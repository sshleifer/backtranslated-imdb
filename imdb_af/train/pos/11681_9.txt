Many of the reviews and comments I read about this movie say it's a rather old movie and performance by Clara Bow. Although the storyline was quite typical of Clara's later silence, I find it rather heartbreaking and incredibly fun. Clara plays a happy Hawaiian girl who won't stop at winning the man she loves. Never think this man is married! Clara's lack of modesty was shocking in the day, but I believe it lends the movie's sweetness and general fun. Although it is definitely not a brilliant storyline, this movie is a good idea of ​​Clara's ability to make the audience laugh.
