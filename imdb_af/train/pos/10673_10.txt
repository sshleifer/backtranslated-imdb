Hello to all the people who have seen this wonderful movie, it's sure you wanted it as much as I wanted. I love the songs as soon as you see the show that you can sing as if you were part of the show that sings and dance. dance and sing. the song ONE is a musical song of all time, and the props at the end with the mirror. It's so, you have to look at this one.
