Bromwell High is nothing short of brilliant. Creatively written and delivered perfectly, this tearful parody of a student and teachers at a public school in South London literally leaves you with laughter. It is vulgar, challenging, witty and sharp. The characters are an excellent caricature cross-section of British society (or more accurate, of any society). Following on from the escapees of Keisha, Latrina and Natella, our three "key players" for a better term, the show is not ashamed to parody every conceivable subject. Political correctness flies in every episode from the window. If you like shows that are not afraid to make fun of every taboo topic imaginable, Bromwell High will not disappoint!
