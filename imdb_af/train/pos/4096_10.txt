Perhaps it is my and my distorted ways, or the fact that I tend to have a very sick mind, but I randomly rented this movie a very strange night and to my surprise I enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> Yes, I read the synopsis on the back of the DVD box and read that it was banned for 25 years and figured out. I was prepared for anything it would offer. I was clearly deceived after I saw it. Well, all, to cut a long story short. I can see why it was banned, not just for such explicit sex, but for beestiality. <br /> <br /> Of course, as it is freely based on the classic fairy tale of Beauty and the Beast, a personal favorite of mine, it tells the story of a girl's sexual awakening about a dream about a Duchess driven by an all-that-hell-that-thing-like animal with enormous erection and a considerable amount of ejaculation. Of course, the animal he wants, and the duchess, decides that she likes it and continues in the forest. <br /> <br /> But that's not all. Oh, there's so much more! <br /> <br /> Not only do we get inter-specific sex, but there are also bulging horses, the babysitter who is bowing down and getting dirty with the slave when she doesn't spoil the bed to get her. Satisfaction and the daunting girl masturbating with rose petals. <br /> <br /> Creative and enjoyable, but it took a while for my dad to talk to me again after watching it after I went to bed ... I was 15. Words of advice when I watched this movie: make sure you are the only one who knows you have it and watch it closed with the curtains. It can be fun, but I doubt there are other porn movies like this.
