Totally brilliant. Powerful and appealing. The most compelling documentary series ever made about war. It shows a strong contrast to the often gung-ho attitude towards World War II that the media exhibits. Rather than choosing to scream about the horror of war, let Sir Laurence Olivier's quiet vote to get the right images of war: bodies everywhere, explosions, scared civilians and soldiers, broken men, indifferent politicians, bugs that has thousands of food lives, the suffering of the innocent. Most of it really brings home what mankind is capable of when all normal rules of "politeness" are removed. There is something distinct Hobbesian about man in a true state of nature. He will return to a more precious form that is capable of having crimes that will shock and fascinate for another 60 years. Perhaps there is a sequel called "The century at war" for the twentieth century, was actually the age of horrors. I feel it is an irony of great magnitude that it has taken an event that caused the death of 50 million people to produce such a compelling and excellent series like this.
