9/11 is a classic example of cinema verite, a kind of realistic documentary, in this case New York firefighters, as they are fighting against one of the extraordinary events of world history. It's all small, unobtrusive, handheld video cameras, often betrayed by the poor quality of most of the filming (and by the director, Naudet's hand wipes the screen regularly.) <br /> <br /> In this movie, most of the firefighters - Tony Benatatos, the rookie (or 'probie', in the NY firefighter) - fire chief Joseph Pfeiffer (who later found his brother) and a few others. There are studio interviews with most of these people throughout the film, just to emphasize the personal, reflexive nature of the events. The build-up is fairly dramatic and well done, especially the Fire Brigade, with some useful swish pans and some kind of dialectical editing of the rather limited film work (just like Rob Reiner's few good men). Tony looks proud. <br /> <br /> The view and camera angle are usually of the firefighters who are interesting and there are some excellent footage inside the lobby of WTC1 while Pfeiffer and his team plan what to do next - it's classic cinema verite. There is also the hectic, haunting sound of the occasional human body collapsing on the outside. It is then that an increasingly abandoned fire chief Pfeiffer realizes that his task is desperate and probably hopeless - and that is before WTC2 collapses. You need to give Naudet credit to know which faces to film and at what moment. <br /> <br /> The sound of the neighboring WTC2 crash is so terribly sad, offensive and terrifying that you realize what an ordeal it is for firemen From the lobby, it seems, feels and sounds like the end of the world and the poor firearms look so confused and scared. You hear a tremendous mess, tremendous whirlpool - like that of a giant monolithic animal slowly falling to the ground after being so deadly wounded. The neighborhood tower collapsed, but the fire team left in WTC1 is unaware of this event. Where is the communication? <br /> <br /> This film is fascinating, but the narrative is amateurish and should be avoided - clues like "it was really a day like no other" or Naudet's regular sayings like "you could see" fear in everyone 'eyes' and 'I knew Tony was freaking out'! The movie is actually just one long video diary. There are no pictures of the buildings on the building where the firefighters are away. Imagine that this movie is mixed with CCTV recordings of some of the rooms that are higher or the news coverage of the day. The effect will be greater. You can even combine this story with that of Mayor Giuliani and perhaps the famous Cornishman Rick Riscorla, who was literally many stories to enter the hero. <br /> <br /> I don't see much of a propaganda element in this movie, as some reviewers suggest. This movie is not a triumph of will, by Riefenstahl. A while later, the firefighters draw the American flag over a nearby surviving building overlooking what the Ground Zero has become. Approximately? <br /> <br /> There are also a few moments of dubious camera work; For example, who holds the camera when the two brothers Naudet are reunited with the fire brigade? Is it staged? <br /> <br /> There is an excellent finish, much in the traditon of excellent French director Alain Resnais (Hiroshima mon amour), with two strips of light reflected in the water.
