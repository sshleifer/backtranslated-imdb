Soft, small, almost insignificant. Polanski finds the invisibility of his characters and makes something huge. In front of and behind the camera he creates one of the most uncomfortable masterpieces I would have liked to see and see and see again. It never leaves me alone. People, even people who know me well, thought / think there was / is something wrong with me, based on my appeal, whether to say, commitment to Le Locataire. They may be right, I don't know, but there is something irresistible in Polanski's darkness and I didn't even mention the humor. The mystery around the apartment and the previous tenant, the mystery that takes him over and of course us, I. Built by winners of the fine Oscar award, Melvyn Douglas, Shelley Winters, Jo Van Fleet, Lila Kedrova. For anyone who loves movies, it is compulsory to watch. One, two, three, many, many views.
