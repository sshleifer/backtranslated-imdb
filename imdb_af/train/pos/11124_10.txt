THE SOPRANOS (1999-2007) <br /> Number 1 - Television of all time <br /> <br /> Everyone thought it would be a stupid thing not going past a pilot's section. The Sopranos has become a cultural phenomenon and is widely accepted as one of the greatest television programs of all time. <br /> <br /> James Gandolfini plays the mysterious New Jersey crime boss, Tony Soprano, accompanied by a star cast. Edie Falco is wonderful as the worrying, loving middle-class mother; Tony Sirico is great as a superstitious, greedy burial woman who is often very funny. <br /> <br /> While the show is often criticized for the negative stereotype of Italian-Americans as mafiosi, and to some extent unmistakable, I can see so much positive of the show. The portrayal of strong family values, friendships, love and compassion; Can it be present in a rough television program about gang members? Yes. Other burning issues are discussed, such as terrorism, social inequality and injustice, homosexuality, drugs, etc. It's not a shallow, dull performance about tough guys and violence. It has so much more. Many of the issues we see on the show are very real. <br /> <br /> The writing that was pretty good has so successfully tackled the current problems and managed to destroy them within the characters' lives, making the whole thing more interesting. <br /> <br /> Credit has to go to David Chase, who created an excellent television cat and James Gandolfini for imagining the most complex and mysterious character of television. <br /> <br /> Simply exceptional. <br /> <br /> 10/10
