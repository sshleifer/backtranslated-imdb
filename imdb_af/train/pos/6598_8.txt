I saw this movie when I was in Brazil. I have found it difficult to really understand Brazil's culture and society because it has so many regional and class differences. Seeing this movie in Sao Paulo itself was a revelation. It shows something of the everyday life of many Brazilians. On the other hand, it is sometimes a bit too dramatic. And that's the only negative comment I have on this movie. It is sometimes too much, too much sex, too many murders and too much cynicism for one movie. The director can make some things a little more subtle, which will make the movie more effective. <br /> <br /> In spite of this, I like the movie and the way the story unfolds itself. The characters are complex, and many like real people. Not beautiful American actors and actresses with many cosmetics, but people who can be ugly and beautiful at the same time. This makes the movie realistic, even if the story is not so convincing.
