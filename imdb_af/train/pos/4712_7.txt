The jokes are obvious, the guy is corny, and the characters run characters - but I can't stop laughing at his highly entertaining movie. No matter how many times I see it, I still get a kick out of this one, and I strongly recommend it to all lovers of senseless entertainment. It contains many quotation moments, and of the best eye-glasses I have seen to this day. If you had a bad week and you need a chuckle, rent this one on the way home Friday night to start your weekend.
