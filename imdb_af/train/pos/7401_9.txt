I found it very interesting that the film actually managed to bridge the gap between my own American culture and that of the authors, that is, Chinese. It becomes a story of values, and causes the viewer to revalue their own choices in life, and loyalty to institutions. Surprisingly, it has succeeded in doing it in a gentle, light-hearted way, which is only threatening to the status quo of you. I enjoyed the movie and would see it again if I could.
