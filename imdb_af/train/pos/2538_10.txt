There are so many good things to say about this "B" movie. <br /> <br /> "B" may be in connections, but not in commission. It's about the best of his genre I've ever seen. A Grade A effort by Universal. The writing is done well, imaginatively and without error. Writing Credits: Howard Higgin's original story & Douglas Hodges story, John Colton (script). Director Lambert Hillyer handled the complex story and story sites very well. No skimming on the many extras and places. I loved Beulah Bondy (Jimmy Stewarts mother in "This is a wonderful life." The five head, Frances Drake is a beauty and has handled her part with grace and pathos for her Karloff man. Lugosi was also right I think it's the best part I remember seeing him in. As I said, there were so many good things: the African discovery of the Radium "X", the melting of the stone images ((somewhat reminiscent of the Ten Little Indians In And Then There Was No (Agatha Christie) (the Barry Fitzgerald version)), the glowing of Carlof in the dark, Karloff's mother played Violet Kemble Cooper with elegance, and because of all these virtues, I believe in the science that depicted it of a good work of art.
