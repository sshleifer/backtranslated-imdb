Despite its budget constraints, it's a good movie, proving that effort and imagination can overcome the lack of cash. The opening, in which cave paintings seem to show how some dinosaurs at least survived in the age of people, is a nice red herring. Then a meteor comes into a lake and causes heat, which in turn causes the hatching of a frozen dinosaur egg (perhaps the cave paintings suggest that this is not the first time such a thing has happened). When the prehistoric animal appears, it is a well-animated Plesiosaur that soon causes disappearances in the local environment. Good, so it's not Jurassic Park, but it's still true entertainment for monster movie fans.
