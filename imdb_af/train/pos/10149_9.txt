A sweet funny story of 2 people crossing paths while preparing their weddings. The ex-cop writer and the public school teacher fall in love with each other in this great New York area, even though they marry others. Maybe it's a bit, because the "partners" are both type A personalities, while our protagonists are much more relaxed. Not something heavy, but it made me smile. And hey for the guys - sell the Natasha Henstridge corner, and the gals - they sell the juicy romance, everyone wins!
