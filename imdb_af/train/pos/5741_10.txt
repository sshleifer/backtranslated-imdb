One of my favorite movies I've seen in Seattle. Tom Hulce was wonderful, without words she could convey feelings / thoughts. I actually sent Mike Ferrell a donation fee to help spread the movie. It is good. System says I need more lines but don't want to give up suddenly. I was in Seattle with Hulce and director, a writer I think and Mike Ferrell. They spoke about the words about an hour. Not really a dry eye in the house. Why Hollywood is still stupid, I don't know. (I actually know, it's our fault, see what we look for) Well, you get what you pay for guys. Get it and see it with someone special. It's a jewel.
