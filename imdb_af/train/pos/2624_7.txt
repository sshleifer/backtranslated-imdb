In this film we have the wonderful opportunity to see what happened to Timon and Pumbaa in the movie when they were not shown. It is very! This movie even goes back to Simba and (presumbably) just after the birth of Kiara. <br /> <br /> Completely true to the first movie, "Lion King 1/2 (or Lion King 3 in other places)" is a funny, entertaining, exciting and surprising movie (or prosecutor if that's what you want to call it). <br /> <br /> While Timon and Pumbaa watch a movie at the cinema (with a remote control), Timon and Pumbaa have an argument from which point "The Lion King" They will start watching, as Timon wants to go when he and Pumbaa come in and Pumbaa wants to go back to the start. They have a very fair compromise to watch the movie of their own story. This is what awaits. It starts with Timon's first home. <br /> <br /> For anyone with a good sense of humor who enjoys the first movies of any age, "Lion King 1/2"! :-)
