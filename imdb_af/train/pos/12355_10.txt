I can understand those who do not have this movie. <br /> <br /> First, those girls aren't Geisha, but brothel tenants, and one who doesn't know the difference won't understand half. of the movie, and certainly not the end. It is a complete artwork about the woman's life and needs in this era. Everything is important, and definitely the way they dress, about the movie means more than words. For those who thought it was a boring geisha movie, I would suggest reading a little about this society before making a conclusion that is so true. This is Kurosawa's work of life, and I'm sure the director understood the silent meaning of Kurosawa's piece to the right intellectual series.
