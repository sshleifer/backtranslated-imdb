Richard Linklater's beautifully focused mix of youthful romance and Paris travel guide is one of the romantic films of the 90-year-old ideas. Julie Delpy turns in one of the decades' most engaging performances as the Parisian lass, spending a day with a stranger on a Ethan Hawke train. The dialogue (and there are oodles) is sometimes winding and exaggerated, but this portrait of two young wannabe lovers who make a romantic, intellectual and spiritual connection with each other is full of wonderful, entertaining and informative moments.
