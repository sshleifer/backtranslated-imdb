Those who only remember Mr. Sir Peter Ustinov as Hercule Poirot or a professional raconteur will do well to find out this beautiful late-60s satire. Ustinov stars as a convicted blackmailer (we only see him in his last day in jail where he prepares the prison chief tax return), which, due to the future being in computers (through a fine identity theft) ) as a computer expert and infiltrates a US multinational. <br /> <br /> In addition, Ustinov (who wrote the script), like Maggie Smith, is uncommon as an accident-sparrow-dolly bird. Bob Newhart also presents an entertaining performance as a suspicious executive who has designs on Maggie Smith. In addition, Karl Malden is satisfactorily sloppy like Ustinov and Newhart's wife boss. <br /> <br /> What do I especially like about this movie? Not only is it a well-thought-out 'caper movie', but it is also a ticking little love story. Ustinov and Smith are very convincing, as the two wrong things stumble in love (the whole scene in which the cards are involved is particularly effective.) <br /> <br /> So, what's wrong with it? Well, the writing is no longer computer literate than most movies (it's almost not at all), although it captures the feel of the late 60's great iron's calculator quite well. There are also some small plot glitches that you probably won't see until the second or third show, but I consider it a little niggles. <br /> <br /> As I said, it's a movie that is worth looking out for, and once you've seen it, you'll want to see it regularly at regular intervals. <br /> <br />
