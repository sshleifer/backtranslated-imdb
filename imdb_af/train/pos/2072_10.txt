I was about thirteen when this movie came out on television. It's far better in action than most movies ever since. Martin Sheen is excellent, and while Nick Nolte has a small role, he also offers excellent support. Vic Morrow, because the villain is wonderful. <br /> <br /> When Sheen tests the water in his '34 Ford (COOL) along the mountainous highway, it's spectacular! <br /> <br /> The end is great. <br /> <br /> I'm disappointed with the low voice it received. I think the younger generations are more interested in many of the rubbish that come out today. <br /> <br /> Good taste unleashes the masses!
