Hidden Borders - more than fanfiction - it is well thought out and organized series that keeps the world of Star Trek alive and growing. From a fun little fan project to now a well-known net series; Hidden Borders has a little something for every astronaut fan in it. In the Late Star Trek: Next Generation / DS9 and Voyager Timelines Hidden Frontier addresses topics and issues that are used in other Star Trek series with fixed stories, using well-developed characters, plot and story bows. Star Trek Hidden Frontier has taken social context stories that Gene Roddenberry did not bring to the screen and showed the development of characters in long-term space missions - the real things happening in the immediate vicinity, as well as exciting spatial wars and conflicts. Sci-Fi addicts know and love. Done in a "Green Screen" studio; Hideaway Boundaries bring a cast of ordinary people on the screen and in your hearts. The big ensemble role players play well together and lovingly give their time and energy to the project. Advanced use of green screen technology, props, costumes and costumes work to make the Hidden Frontier worlds of Star Trek fun and credible. Hidden Frontier went where little stairs went into the world of science fiction and thrived as they arrived. Hidden Frontier offers a great bonus feature of a thoughtful website, with interesting discussion forums, access to creative, production and acting staff and a fun weekly chat. I recommend you take the time to load and watch.
