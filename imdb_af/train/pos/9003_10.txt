<br /> <br /> I think it's not the best movie ever made, but I made it the same in 10 stars. Mainly because of my feelings at the end. All the people around me and I were simply touched. It's something you don't often feel. We all become a bit cynical and tired of sentimentality, lazy manipulation or preaching in modern movies. The story of the film centers on Jane a young woman in the last stages of EMS and the friendship that grows between her and Richard, a man on the brink of a break. It could have been such a dull and dignified piece so easily, but it is so humorous, human and lacking in sentimentality that it will completely conquer you and chances are a good movie. <br /> <br /> The acting of Branagh and Bonham-Carter is wonderful, especially the last one that is always credible and strong in its role. The chemistry between the two also highlights the movie. <br /> <br /> The title comes from Richards's masterpiece, a plane made of junk and its old paintings. Flying here is a symbol for both Richards and Janes that lead life to the limit so that one can continue and the other can face the end. <br /> <br /> A beautiful and funny movie I would recommend to anyone. don't let the subject leave you.
