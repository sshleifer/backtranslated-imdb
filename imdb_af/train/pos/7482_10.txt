"Vanilla Sky" was a wonderful movie. Or rather, "Abre Los Ojos" was well thought out. I watched the movie one night, excited about what was coming. I was not disappointed. By the end of the movie I was uncomfortable. I couldn't get it out of my mind. The whole idea of ​​it just blew me away. The end was more of a surprise than Shyamalan could ever do. The plot line was also something that kept me going through and through. The throw, fantastic. It was a wonderful movie. The kind of movie you can watch again and again and always find something new. I saw it four or five times and I always find something new. It's a movie to interest you forever.
