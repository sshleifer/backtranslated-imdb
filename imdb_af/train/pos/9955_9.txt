See this movie twice at community shows and really loved it. I work in the Jane Finch community and feel that the film really captures the essence and flavor of the community - grit, determination, exuberance, creativity, in your face with a dose of desperation. The writing, dialogue and acting are solid and I really found myself in the story of the young woman, Raya, struggling to pursue her goals and not lose herself in the process. Large dance series and not just bodies that move smoothly and with electricity, but the camera also moves with great fluidity and intelligence. All the characters are multidimensional - not quite good or bad and the women's characters are wonderfully strong. It's a movie that has a strong beat and celebrates the unspeakable spirit of youth, hip hop and communities like Jane Finch.
