This 1958 movie I have not seen for a long time and enjoyed Kim Novak, who plays the role of Gil Holroyd, who is a real witch. He has a Queenie Holroyd, who is also a witch, and Gillian also played a brother war called Nick by Jack Lemmon. When Gillian puts her eyes on Shep Henderson, (James Stewart) who is busy with a girl, he will marry; Gillian performs some witchcraft with a cat and changes his mind about his intended bride and then becomes very much in love and falls in love with Gillian. The story tells that a real witch can't fall in love, blush or cry, and it starts to prove a big problem between Shep and Gillian. So Nick and Aunt Queenie decided to do something about this situation. Great movie to watch over and over again and a great classic movie from 1958.
