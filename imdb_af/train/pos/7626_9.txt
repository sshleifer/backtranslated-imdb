I loved this movie since I first saw it in 1979. I'm still amazed at how accurately Kurt Russell Elvis portrays, exactly how he moves and the expressions on his face. Sometimes it's scary how much he looks, acts and talks like the real Elvis. Fortunately, it is released on DVD, so anyone who waited can finally get an excellent quality full-length movie. I heard the rivals saying there are some ambiguities, or a few things left out, but I think John Carpenter just had about two and a half hours to work on and was shown on television. (just two years after Elvis's death!) he did a good job with it. I haven't really seen an Elvis movie that even comes close to this one. Highly recommended.
