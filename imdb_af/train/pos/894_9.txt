These "Lost Son" and "East Condors" are my favorite Sammo Hung movies. The Vetdraak is fatter in this outing than he was in Condors, but he is no less sure than director or actor. He is at the very top of his form and delivers a devastatingly brutal action that boasts half a dozen incredible sequences and also manages to tell a compassionate, sweet love story. Love and romance are not the director's priorities here, but they serve as curious additions to the action and ensure that viewers do not hit the quick button between the physical clashes. <br /> <br /> The opening scene, which contains a funny light-sable, sets a solid but deceptive tone. A sequence in which Sammo's pedicab is chased by a car is beautifully staged and sown with a sharp, comical tone. The fast and furious stick battle between Sammo and Lau Kar Leung is a model of spectacular choreography and sharp, excellent direction, and easily one of the best of its kind. The movie's violence is slowly saturated until eventually the climatic conflict comes, we are subjected to some of the cruel deviations ever seen in a Sammo production. The director / actor's assault on Billy Chow and a house filled with angry, threatening opponents is a bottling, physical punishment. <br /> <br /> Terrific at every level and one of the best martial arts movies ever made. <br /> <br /> Great count too.
