This movie tells an incredible story with history and compassion. From the careful descriptions of the crime scenes to the mental health of the chief investigator, you will be enchanted. It is an absolute must-see for anyone interested in criminology. Interpol relationships and how the agencies work together are also wonderful. Not done too much. I recommend it to anyone who is also interested in Russian history. How the police work with the political party it was ... This is really fascinating and frustrating. The settings are beautiful. It was a while since I first saw this movie. It does not reduce its impact. Not too dramatic or graphic, it leaves enough for the imagination, well, you will see.
