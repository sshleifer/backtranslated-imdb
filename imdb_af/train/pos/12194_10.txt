Surreal film noir released shortly after the "real" genre definition classic "The Maltese Falcon," "Double Disclaimer" and "The Postman Always Rings Twice." Welles movies should not be evaluated against others. He plays through different rules. In fact, he was playing. It starts where other femme fatal films leave, so the vaguely logical (but interesting) whodunit is adorned with a display of Wellesian scenes (typical fast-paced), dialogue (very "boiled" philosophy) and unusual acting (good Hayworth supposedly one-dimensional) ). Welles "genre" may mean "formula", but he seemed to use "mysteries" as background for his "entertainment".
