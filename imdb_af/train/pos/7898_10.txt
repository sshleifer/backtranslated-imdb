This movie had terrible reviews, but because it was unfair and critics usually didn't get an indescribable movie, I thought I'd try it. Unfortunately, this was largely right in this case. <br /> <br /> The movie has just an uncomfortable feel, which is the best. The kind of feeling impossible to describe, but it's not a good one. To confuse things further, the writing is a boring, aimless thing that is only vaguely interesting. <br /> <br /> The extremely talented Thurman drives only through this mess, which barely impacts. Hurt and Bracco try in vain to add something to the film with enthusiasm, but there is nothing in the script. It might be less embarrassed for them if they just chose to drive and go over like Thurman. <br /> <br /> However, one thing that the "valued" film critics did not mention is that the movie is actually. quite funny. Whether it's moments of accurate satire or a few scandalous strange moments, such as when the cowgirls involved storm them off their farm, with the smell of their unwashed ... ahem ... front bottoms. <br /> <br /> Due to the Chortles playing throughout, I would not recommend this movie, there is entertainment to have and watch. Even Cowgirls. Get the Blues is worth something else.
