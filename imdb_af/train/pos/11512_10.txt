When it was originally tested in America in 1972, 'The Night Stalker' is the highest rated made-for-T.V. film in history. Based on Jeff Rice's unpublished novel, it revealed how a fearless investigative reporter named Carl Kolchak (then Darren McGavin) discovered the existence of a vampire in contemporary Las Vegas. When it arrived on British television four years later, it didn't have the same impact, but my friends had it at school on Monday morning, as I was. We all agreed that this was one of the most exciting things we saw. <br /> <br /> I didn't know about the existence of 'The Night Strangler' until it arrived nearly a decade later. I.T.V., who selected the Kolchak movies, apparently decided to pass the spin-off series; They felt that 'Barnaby Jones' Buddy Ebsen was in the forefront, and anyway viewers could confuse 'Kolchak' with 'Kojak'! For years, my only source of information about the show was an article in Fangoria magazine. I couldn't even buy the Jeff Rice novels. <br /> <br /> Then something wonderful happened. In 1990, B.B.-2 exhibited the show as part of a Friday series of the night devoted to the supernatural called 'Mystery Train', hosted by Richard O'Brian. 'Kolchak' rubbed his shoulders like 'The Brain Eaters' and 'Earth Vs.The Spider'. The opening titles were finished, Kolchak's whistle removed and the closing credits ... well, there was nobody. <br /> <br /> The first episode tested was "Werewolf". I can't say I was too much impressed but stick to it and I'm glad I did. <br /> <br /> I really wish I saw it in 1974. My 12-year-old himself would have loved it. Creepy, humorous, exciting, no wonder it fired Chris Carter's imagination. <br /> <br /> Of course, the show's biggest asset was McGavin. Unlike the recent Kolchak, the original was an everyman figure, eccentrically dressed, rather conservative. He was for the supernatural "Columbo" for crime. The late Simon Oakland was also wonderful as Kolchak's bad-ridden boss Tony Vincenzo. The scripts overflow with wonderful, dry white. I found myself enjoying the program more for the humor content than the horror. When the twenty episodes ended, I felt. <br /> <br /> A few years later, the X-Files merged and filled the gap - but to some extent. I wanted to return to Kolchak and Vincenzo. I am glad that the show was never revived. Without Oakland it wouldn't have been the same. <br /> <br /> I have the Rice books now and read them several times. I was very surprised when Stephen King anointed the first (in his book 'Danse Macabre') because it was as good as he wrote. <br /> <br /> Well, so some of the monsters were barely state-of-the-art, but what? The new 'Kolchak' completely missed the point of the original. What you don't see is sometimes more scary than you do. <br /> <br /> Best Episode - 'Horror In The Heights' Worst Episode - 'The Sentry'
