What always missed the Matrix story was how things came into the real world. Don't say more, because this part of the story covered most of the bases. What was really interesting was how political it was, perhaps even a cheap shot at the current presidential administration. Fascism and violence were the only things one could think of in the battle against the robot order, which was meant to be nothing but servants of mankind. What I also found interesting was the use of fear and how it continued through the idea of ​​the unknown. We as humans tend to fall into that trap often, so the lack of logic and thoughts overtakes us because people can't believe the opposite. Well represented and composed, this is a true will for how illogical people can be.
