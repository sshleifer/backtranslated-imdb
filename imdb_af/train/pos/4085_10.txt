If you were born around the time this movie was finished and had a liberal / open-minded household, I am probably in the early 80's that you were first introduced to step on your parents and dirty movies or extreme dirt. look. movies. You know, not 100% pornographic, but rather an alchemical mix of real drama and pornography, or that you sneak into their collection and into the plastic rectangle representation of such a movie in a big dryer called a VHS appears. You had to be very quiet and ninja, but still have slight heart failure when big pop sounds were made when you push the tablet-like buttons out of fear to be discovered. Whatever the case, such films are sent in the rear, waiting and waiting to be reunited with such visual art. Needless to say, this movie fits the previous description in a "T". Many people will comment on the extreme sexual nature of the film, but perhaps because I'm desensitized, I become more impressed by the subtleties. Was the creator with us at deeper levels of human carnality and what can be considered a real abomination, interracial relationship, embracing masturbation, voyeurism, or it may be desperate for social status to the point of murder, pedophilia / homosexuality, or the suppressed sexual nature of social elitist women in the 18th century France? Who can say, but in spite of Mr. Borowcyzk's taste for lively, raw sexuality is the "norm" for his works, I would say, this film is indeed talking to the viewer at a deeper level about bestial fleshness. As soon as I learned it, the story became much more interesting than the greed of shock and for that it is worth checking out.
