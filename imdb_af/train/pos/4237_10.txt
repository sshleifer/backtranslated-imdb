Charleton Heston wore one, James Franciscus wore one, but Mark Wahlberg didn't want to wear the traditional lingerie. I hope nobody throws him as Tarzan. Linda Harrison wore a bikini in the first 2 Planet movies, but Estrella Warren barely shows fission - her hair is always in the way. Tim Burton could have given this simian-saga generation and the adults in the audience something to watch. Even the cuddly Helena Bonham Carter never comes out of her costume that looks like a big curtain. She is cute, but all the love stuff is limited to horrible looks and a bitter kiss at the end. As in Artificial Intelligence, discussing but never delivering intersection species between robots and humans - The monkey's monkeys indicate inter-species romance between humans and monkeys, but only hints. Lisa Marie is the only monkey who dares to be sexy. This movie has three great actors Tim Roth, me. Carter & Paul Giamatti, chewing the landscape as a trio of monkeys and they are fun to watch. Superlative make-up (a certain Oscar) costumes, sets, music make this the summer movie of 2001.
