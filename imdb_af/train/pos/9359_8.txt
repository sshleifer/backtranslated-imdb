The feeling of this movie was wonderful. Adam Sandler's performance was very inspiring. Since he played a very rattled and fragile character, he took his ability to the limit and really worked the role. His character was very interesting. I can see myself writing for this movie and not half that interested in the part that Sandler made me. For someone who plays mostly comedy roles, he has taken a serious role with what his own attributes and inputs were. I especially had the scene in which Adam and Don's characters drove the motorized scooter around the city. I was introduced at the moment because it looked as if Don was one thing Adam did to get away from it all. With his video games, music and many other things he does to make him think of the past, his scooter with his headphones looked at his car, like an escape from his mind. This movie is definitely worth the watch.
