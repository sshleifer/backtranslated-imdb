This film illustrates the worst part of surviving war, the memories. For many soldiers, men and women, returning home may be the beginning of real trouble. I am reminded that my father and his brothers returned from World War II. For one of my uncles, the war was never over. He survived the D-Day invasion, something similar to the first 20 minutes of Private Private Ryan. For him the memories not only lived but tortured him. He became an alcoholic, like several of my cousins, his sons. Go ahead 60 years and place the soldiers in another war, in another country, the result is the same. When I saw it at the KC Film Festival, I was reminded that there is something about war that never changes. The idealistic young men and women are not spared the emotional torment of what happened in Iraq. And especially if you are against the war, you will get away from the soldiers with more compassion and try to do what they believe or said. <br /> <br /> The tagline of the Vietnam War film Platoon says it all. "The first victim of the war is innocence."
