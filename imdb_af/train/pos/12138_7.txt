Several features of this movie date immediately. The sound is rather slim and one realizes what great progress has been made in sound reproduction in the next few years. The language of the dialogue is quite beautiful and unnatural, and the acting is still reminiscent of the transition of stage techniques. <br /> <br /> Bette Davis always gives a strong performance in all her movies as she does in this early era. of her very successful career. However, I feel that the cockney accent somehow doesn't fit the facial expression. I think it's the supposed cockney accent that doesn't make me true. <br /> <br /> Somerset Maughan likes to love human relationships of great dramatic intensity that will please all filmmakers. As in so many of her character roles, Bette Davis can switch from a beautiful seductive woman to a flutter of fierce hate. Leslie Howard is well-cast as the withdrawing English artist with a foot that is urgently looking for a partner and makes a bad choice in a shocking little waitress. <br /> <br /> By the end of the film, the young doctor meets his true love in a busy street. They cross the traffic completely unaware of a multitude of horns and whistles shouting at them. This scene is perhaps meant to be funny, but I find it ridiculous in this other, very serious movie. It is likely to be laid out to send you home with a smile on your face. And as far as we can see (and hope for) it is a happy ending.
