Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey is the sequel to Bill and Ted's excellent adventure. Their fake journey almost goes straight to the first movie, and do just as well from a job if it's not better to entertain the viewer. <br /> <br /> The plot is an evil person of the future, trying to kill Bill. Ted uses evil robots that look exactly like Bill and Ted. Once the robots kill Bill and Ted, they must kill with the grim reaper (dead) and normally return their lives. <br /> <br /> The play in the movie is, and even thought it was a bit strange. Sometimes, especially Bill and Ted's conversations, this is a good movie. The wannabe rockers probably made another good movie. Add it to you next time
