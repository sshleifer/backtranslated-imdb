All good movies inspire some directly to video copycat flick. I was afraid the "Gladiator" wasn't really such a movie, because I didn't see a movie that looks something different on the new release platform for some months. Then I saw the full moon's latest offering, Demonicus. I'm a fan of Full Moon's Puppetmaster series, and Blood Dolls, but have never seen one of their non-killer pop movies. Anyway ... Demonicus chronicles what happens to a group of campers in the mountains of the Alps. One of the campers, James, finds a cave with old gladiator artifacts, and feels concerned about removing a helmet from a body and trying it out. He is taken possession of, and as the demonic gladiator Tyrannus, he is obliged to kill his friends to revive the body, who is the true Tyrannus. <br /> <br /> Granted, like many Full Moon movies, it has little or no budget. Sometimes the editing and direction was so amateurish that I wanted to swear that I had looked at the Blair Witch project. The efforts to cut off limbs and heads remind me of a Monty Python skit. The weapons, though apparently, really look plastic-y. It literally seems to have been filmed on a weekend by a group of friends with a digital video camera. Granted, there is nothing wrong with such films, but do not hire them and expect a technical masterpiece. There also seems to be attempts to give research for the writing, because although Tyrannus does not act much like a gladiator to the end, he speaks at least Latin. Actually enjoy this movie. Not as much as a killer pop movie, but the full moon still delivers! The only thing that disappointed me was that there was no Full Moon Video Zone!
