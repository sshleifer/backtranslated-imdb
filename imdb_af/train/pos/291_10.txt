Zombie Chronicles is not something to shout about. This is clearly not an award-winning film, but it is an entertaining B movie directed by Brad Sykes. The acting is bad as the cheapest movies, but it makes it more entertaining, the zombie makeup is cool and effective, especially with the budget, the gore is also big and rough. The movie is like a zombie version of Tales. From the Crypt, as we get two stories about zombie encounters in the forest, the stories are nice and let you especially guess the first story. Zombie Chronicles is much better than some low-budget zombie movies out there, if you love a low-budget B-movie or cheap-made zombie movie, watch Zombie Chronicles.
