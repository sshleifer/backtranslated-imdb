It's just one of the best versions of Dicken's classic story. The script follows the story originally written by Dickens and follows a perfect balance between a film atmosphere and a dramatic atmosphere. Viewers who like some sort of format will find enough of the story chosen in their selection style. <br /> <br /> George C. Scott brings a wonderful realistic approach to the character of Scrooge and is very convincing in character development. fueled by ghost visits. I found that he could win me to the point where I sympathized with the old misery, something that is rarely done in other versions. The wonderful work done by the supporting actors adds greatly to this production, which is simply the most enjoyable of all the Christmas Carol versions I have seen.
