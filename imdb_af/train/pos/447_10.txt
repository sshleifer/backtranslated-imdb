This is one of the best movies. This is one of my favorites. A movie with good acting. The story is very sensitive and touching. Good camera also works. <br /> <br /> The names of actresses and actors are not at the top of the American Star list. However, they give equal or better performances than the top of the list. <br /> <br /> It is so nice to see a movie about true love, romance, friendship, without enduring someone having to kick their way to save the world. <br /> <br /> If you don't like this movie, you have no heart or feelings. Then check out a sports movie. There is no death or horror here. See the movie. It's a must. TH
