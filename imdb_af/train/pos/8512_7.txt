I can tell you how bad this movie is. I was in the movie and I haven't seen it yet, but I clipped the idea that someone was actually paying to see me drunk. Particularly considered what we did that year. The thing is, they probably have edited it over. Especially the scene where my roommate sniffs the tits of a Mexican prostitute (they must have been chasing him). We have a few come and go, but I can't really remember that. I was the MC in a few scenes (of what I was told.) What I can tell you is that everyone has avoided the camera crew because whoever wants to be remembered as the guy who threw or the girl is her tits showed the world (or the girl who lost the loser his virgin.) Overall, the journey itself is crazy, but people are different from the camera on them.
