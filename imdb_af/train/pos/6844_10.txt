"Dressed to Kill" is Brian DePalma's best movie, an absolute thrill of excitement, humor and style that remains unbeatable today. DePalma has a rap in Hollywood, as most people claim to be defeating Alfred Hitchcock. He does not. Hitchcock can only dream of what DePalma shows in his thrillers. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the original uncut version of "Dressed to Kill" is no longer available on video. The current copy released by Goodtimes is the Jack Valenti-approved R track. But some copies of DePalma's original track still exist. This is the one distributed by Warner Home Video, in both a green cardboard box with Angie Dickinson on the front, or in a black clamshell case with the theatrical posters on silver lining. This is the one you can get if you can get a copy. I have the green one and this is one of my precious possessions. <br /> <br /> Anyway, back to the story. Dickinson plays Kate Miller, a sexually frustrated woman by dr. Robert Elliott (Michael Caine) is treated for her obsessive fantasies. While on a trip to the museum (a true tour de-force for DePalma in terms of camera work and tension), <br /> <br /> Miller was recorded by a stranger. You can pretty much guess what happens to her as the ads and goat art give away the story. But there are some complications. A hooker (Nancy Allen) is the only witness of the murder. Kate Miller's son Peter (Keith Gordon) is a teenage genius determined to solve the crime. And dr. Elliott's answering machine has a certain message about it ... about a missing razor ... <br /> <br /> I don't spoil the movie for you, as I described above, takes place within the first half hour and DePalma's biggest surprises are reserved for the last hour. However, this movie is explicitly enough for Valenti (head of the MPAA) to claim cuts in the film. What surprised me is what cuts he wanted. Several tracks in the openings and one or two oblique screens and some of Nancy Allen's dialog (Valenti wanted to change "rooster" to "bump"). This is a movie that is very violent and bloody, but the objections are sexual content. I would like to hear Valenti's explanation on how to see two women in a loving scene in 'Lost and Delirious', somehow damaging to a young thought like Arnold Schwarzenegger people with a chain rifle. It's just not fair. <br /> <br /> What makes "Dressed to Kill" so good is that it's not just the technical credits first prize, but the performances are also very good. Michael Caine, who was in many times at this time, gives one of his best performances as the doctor. Angie Dickinson is better than usual, possibly because she has a strong role to play here. Nancy Allen adds to her series of appearances that have captured her as one of the most underrated and overlooked actresses in the world. Keith Gordon is wonderful as a genius and I loved all the inventions of her. <br /> <br /> DePalma is one of our best directors who has never received the recognition he earned. The recent joke of the AFI 100 Best Thrillers list has shown that very few people actually know what a thriller is. If they were to open their eyes one day, they would see that DePalma had set his career in excitement and was actually the best craftsman. It's even better than "Psycho". It is a pity that very few know it. <br /> <br /> **** out of 4 stars
