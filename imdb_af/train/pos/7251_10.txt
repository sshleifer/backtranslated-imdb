I saw this movie only once about 25 years ago, and to this day I've always told people it's probably the best movie I've ever seen. Since there was no oral dialogue and just thought dialogue, I found that the movie was surprising and I found myself holding my breath so I couldn't make a sound. I would highly recommend this movie, I wish it was available on DVD.
