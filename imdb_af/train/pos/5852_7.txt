It was the first PPV in a new era for WWE such as Hulk Hogan, The Ultimate Warrior, Ric Flair and Sherri Martel. A new talent opportunity had to be printed. And all this starts with Lex Luger, a former NWA World Heavyweight Champion who is given a title shot against Yokozuna. Lex traveled across the US in a bus called the Lex Express to inspire Americans to accuse him in trying to beat the Japanese monster (who was actually Samoan) and get the WWE championship back in American hands . As such, there was much anticipation for this game. <br /> <br /> But every good PPV needs an undercard and it has good things. <br /> <br /> The night started with Razor Ramon who defeated Ted DiBiase. in a good game. The story that goes through this was that DiBiase picked up on Ramon and even offered him a job as a slave after his shock loss to the 1-2-3 child at RAW in July. Ramon, angry, then played with the 1-2-3 child against the Money Inc team of Ted DiBiase and Irwin R Shyster. To settle their differences, they were both one on one match, DiBiase vs Ramon and Shyster vs The Kid. Razor was able to establish his side of the deal after beating a Razor's Edge. <br /> <br /> Next, the Steiner Brothers put the WWE Tag Team Titles on the line against the Heavenly bodies. Depsite's intervention of Jim Cornette, the body manager, who hit Scott Steiner in a throat tennis racket. They could win the victory in a decent match. <br /> <br /> Shawn Michaels and Mr Perfect Since Wrestlemania IX were injured when Shawn Michaels Perfect confronted Lex Luger after his loss. Perfectly, Michaels then cost the Intercontinental Championship when he diverted him into a title match against Marty Janetty. Michaels won the title back and was on the line against Mr Perfect, but Michaels now has a strong ally in his corner in his 7 foot guard Diesel. Micheals and Perfect played an excellent game here, but it was Diesel who proved the difference maker, pulled off the ring and dragged him into the steel steps to win Shawn by counting out. <br /> <br /> Irwin R Shyster averted the loss of his teammate earlier in the night, easily responsible for the 1-2-3 child. <br /> <br /> Then came one of the big games of the night as Bret Hart was prepared to fight Jerry. Lawler for the title of undisputed king of the WWE. But Lawler came out with crutches and said he was injured in a car accident earlier that day and that he had arranged another opponent for Hart: Doink the Clown. Hart and Doink had an appropriate match that won Hart with a sharp shot. He was then jumped by Lawler. It bought WWE president Jack Tunney on the ring, which told Lawler he would receive a lifetime ban if he didn't struggle with Hart. Heart destroys Lawler and wins with the sharpshooter, but Hart refused to abandon the hold and the referee reversed his decision. So Lawler is called the undisputed king of the WWE. The game was followed by Ludvig Borda who destroyed Marty Janetty in a short match. <br /> <br /> The Undertaker completed his long rivalry with Harvey Wippleman. He started in 1992 when the Undertaker defeated the Wippleman's client Kamala at Summerslam and continued. when Wippleman's youngest monster destroyed The Giant Gonzales Taker at the Rumble and then again at Wrestlemania, with a decisive victory over Gonzales here. Gonzales then turned on the Wippleman and set him up after a poor game. <br /> <br /> Next, it was time for six man-tag action such as the Smoke Gunns (Bart and BIlly) and Tatanka beat The Headshrinkers (Samu and Fatu) and Bam Bam Bigelow with Tatanka Pinning Samu. <br /> <br /> This brings us to the main event with Yokozuna, flanked by Jim Cornette and Mr. Fuji, who puts the WWE title on the line against Lex Luger and it was all on board. the Lex Express. Lex came out, but Yokozuna took control. However, Lex came back as he could avoid a banzai drop and then the body threw Yokozuna before knocking him out of the ring. Luger then attacked Cornette and Fuji because Yokozuna was counted out. Luger won a good game !!!!! Balloons fell from the ceiling. The heroes have all come to wish him the victory. Yokozuna may have retained the title, but Luger proved he could be beaten. The only question was, who could beat him in the ring and get that title from him?
