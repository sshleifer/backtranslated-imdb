Super Mario 64 is undoubtedly the biggest game ever created. It's so addictive that you can play it for hours without stopping for a break. I've beaten the game 4 times, but I've never gotten 120 stars ... (I became 111) ... but I hope to finally reach it. Although I didn't play this game officially before I was seven years old, I liked watching my sisters play it. Now I'm 13 and still playing it, erasing games and restarting. <br /> <br /> The graphics are incredible for an early N64 game. The game is addictive. The controls are good. The levels are difficult but not impossible. The Bowser battles are challenging. <br /> <br /> I'd like to tell you more, but why don't you get it for yourself? Get rid of the X-BOX 360, PS3, and the Wii and find a Nintendo 64 and play this great, amazing game.
