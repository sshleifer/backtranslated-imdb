I saw the "Grudge" yesterday and wow ... I was really scared, a good thing. I love horror movies, and I really liked this one. There were so many 'surprises' scenes (what is the English word?) That made you jump into your seat. Although too much audience screaming made it hard to laugh. I think the frightening scene was ... on the bus, when the face flickered at the window or when Yoko walked without her chin. The make-up is also very good. Sometimes you can really see it was there, but it was still a freaky look at the scene. The boy was indeed very good, so cute without makeup and so scary. The next time I hear a crackling sound, I'll probably feel pretty scared ...
