"I'll take you there" tells of a living man who loses his wife to another and finds an unlikely ally in a blind date. Unlike most romantic comedies, this little indie is mostly a situational comedy with Rogers and Sheedy, with little emphasis on romance. A kind of road trip flick with lots of fun and some striking moments keeps moving, staying fresh, and is a valuable look for indie lovers.
