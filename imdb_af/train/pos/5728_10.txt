I went to this movie that expects an artistic and terrifying movie. What I got was scary. It's a horror movie at its core. It's not like other horror movies where a haunted house just haunts and gore. This movie doesn't even show you the majority of deaths that show the fear of the characters. I think one of the best things about the concept is that it is not just the house that haunts it in the house. They are being pursued, no matter where they are. Office buildings, police stations, hotel rooms ... etc. After reading some of the external reviews, I'm really surprised that critics didn't like this movie. I will see again this week and am excited about it. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 10 stars because it did what a horror movie should be. It scared me from the side.
