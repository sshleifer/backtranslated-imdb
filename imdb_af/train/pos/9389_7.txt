Red Rock West (1993) <br /> <br /> Nicolas Cage is pounding in a deadly crime without even knowing it, and the dominoes lead to increasing danger, adventure and misadventures in wild lost American West of the 1990s . Red Rock West is often brutal and sometimes hilarious, and Cage pulls the mixture down with its usual sardonic white and cautious ease. <br /> <br /> Is the plot over? Yes. Is Dennis Hopper ideal as a crazy, almost similar killer? Yes. Does the Cage Live A Chance? Well, you have to look and see. It never stops, and it surprised me for the first time when I saw it. On the second show I was surprised at how well it stopped, how well it was built and how fussy and funny it was. <br /> <br /> Director Ron Dahl (who also helped to write) is more famous for his TV work, but with Rounders and this film he shows a handsome hand with sensational plots. It is saved by its humor and caricature in its own way. The bar is sloppy, the police are doubtful. And don't miss a really inspired cameo by Dwight Yoakam as a truck driver.
