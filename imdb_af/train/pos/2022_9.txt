The only complaint I have about this adjustment is that it was slaughtered. Things just mentioned in the novel are displayed on the screen for some strange reasons. Did they think the audience would be too stupid to understand if they didn't do everything right? Other than that, it's very good quality. All the actors do wonderful work that brings their characters to life. For the shallow women out there, it's worth watching, because Toby Stephens and Gilbert are the sexiest thing ever. If I were Helen, I would have conveniently forgotten. I was still married the moment I looked at him. <br /> <br /> Kind of a spoiler - The end scene is a funny turnaround of what happened in the book.
