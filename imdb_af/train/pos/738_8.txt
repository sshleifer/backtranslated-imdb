And it is in itself a great rock'n'roll movie. No matter how it developed (about to be a movie about disco), it eventually acted as one of the ultimate films in which children want to pop out, but the principal is in their path. Think back to the rock'n'roll movies of the 50's in which the day is saved when Alan Freed comes to Chuck Berry to prove that Rock & Roll Music is really cool and safe for the kids. Tuesday Weld gets a new jersey for the dance. Going to the 1979, repeat the same plot, but throwing DA RAMONES, which no one then realizes, will be one of the most influential bands of the next quarter (and then the compulsory DJ guest, The Real Don Steele). Also cast all the elements of a Roger Corman-made comedy mining film, except for the two-day shooting schedule, some of the well-known Corman repertoire players such as Clint Howard, Mary Wournow and Dick Miller (since "Emmer van Blood"), and you have one of the big broken movies of the day. One of the few films that deliberately uses and gets rid of cheesiness. I showed the new DVD to a friend who could just see how it was through a stoner-induced haze at the walkway, and he agreed it was one of the big movies to watch drunk, not least for the lovely front ladies and great Ramones footage.
