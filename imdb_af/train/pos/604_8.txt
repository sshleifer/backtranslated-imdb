On the approach of his centuries, Saura has teamed up an unprecedented wealth of talent from the Spanish performing arts community to create this distinctive love song for their homeland. The twelve impressions of the suite are presented without a hitch in a sharp environment, so the power of each display can explode before Saura's camera. Creative use of large flats and mirrors, moving across the set, combined with screens, shadows, fire, rain and rear projection, adds delightful dramatic effects to the varied choices of song, dance and instrumental performance. Albeniz's photos appear throughout the program by connecting the passion of the music to his great creator. Saura excels all Spaniards on the stage of the beautiful elegance of elderly flamenco dancers in traditional costumes for children who dance joyfully with their instructors.
