A great suspense movie with tremendous slow camera work adds to the drama making it a surprise to watch and enjoy. Director writer Brian de Palma does a super Hitchcock imitation (many have called it a "ripoff") with this movie and the 2.35: 1 widescreen DVD is a requirement to fully appreciate the camera work (and various scenes with people hiding on each side that is lost on formatted-for-TV tapes. <br /> <br /> The back of the movie, at least to anyone who has some moral standard, is the common scam of all characters, including the policeman played by a pre-NYPD Dennis Franz (who has her here!). <br /> <br /> The opening scene is still shocking with a rather long shower scene of Angie Dickinson who is quite explicit , even 25 years after his release, the film has several erotic scenes in it like Dickinson (if it's really her close-ups) and Nancy Allen is not shy to show their bodies. <br /> <br / > There is not much dialogue in the first 20 minutes and no bad language until Franz enters the picture after the murder not. The first 36 minutes are sounding and although it is clear who the murderer is, it is still very good fun and fun to look through, especially for men who close the naked women.
