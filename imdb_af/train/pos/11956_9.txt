I will even say a few shades of Hitchcock ... this is clearly better than MMM, which is regarded as a guilty pleasure by some or not most Woody fans. By the way, did you know that Annie Hall was considered a murder mystery? Anyway, Woody repeated some relevance in the movie comedy with this one. The plot turns are nice and stiff. I will say that in the first 20 minutes or so, some of the actors are a little in a hurry to deliver their lines, but to hold on. Scarlett Johansson proves well thrown into the Diane Keaton-type role, and at no time are there uncomfortable moments between her and the much older Woody. No one can imagine a more perfect actor for the role of Peter Lyman as Jackman.
