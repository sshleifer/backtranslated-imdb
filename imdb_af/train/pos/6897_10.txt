It was released on DVD a few years ago in France - I wish it would be released with English subtitles again. Don't confuse it with a remake with Penelope Cruz who gets poor reviews. Gerard Phillippe is a farmer who is told by a fortune teller that he will marry the king's daughter. He went down to join the army and went to war. However, his love is for Gina Lollabrigida in an early movie. I won't spoil the end. Gerard Phillippe died a few years later at a young age, a huge loss to him.
