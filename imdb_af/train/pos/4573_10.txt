Daniel Day Lewis is one of the best actors of our time and one of my favorites. It is wonderful how much he throws himself into every character he plays to make them really. <br /> <br /> I remember, many years ago, we had a feast in our house - the friends came, we sat around the table, eating, drinking the wine, talking, laughing - with a good time. The TV was on - there was a movie we didn't pay much attention to. Then suddenly we stopped talking and laughing. The glasses didn't sound, the forks didn't move, the food was getting cold on the plates. We could not take our eyes off the screen where the young cripple whose whole body was against him and only had control over his left foot, picked up a piece of lime with his foot and what ever happened, has just tried write one word on the floor. When he finished writing that one word, we all knew we were not one, but three triumphs - the triumph of a human will and spirit, the triumph of the theater that the movie like this on and the triumph of an actor who did not act, but who became his character. <br /> <br /> Jim Sheridan's "My Left Foot" is a sounding, unimaginative bio drama about Christy Brown, the man born with cerebral palsy in a Dublin slum; who became an artist and writer and found love for his life. <br /> <br /> I like every day of Day Lewis's performances (I have mixed feelings about his performance in GONY), but I believe his greatest role was Christy Brown in my left foot
