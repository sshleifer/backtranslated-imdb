In the funeral of renowned British journalist Joe Strombel (Ian McShane), his colleagues and friends remind him how hard he was while looking for a kick. Meanwhile, deceased Joe reveals the identity of the London tarot card assassin. He cheats the Reaper and appears to the American student of journalism Sondra Pransky (Scarlett Johansson), who is on stage in the midst of a wizard's show of sorcerer Sidney Waterman (Woody Allen) in London. He tells her that the killer is. aristocrat Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman). Sondra is dragging Sid in her investigation and looking for evidence that Peter is the murderer. However, she falls in love with him and questions like Joe Strombel are right in his lap. <br /> <br /> "Scoop" is another good Woody Allen comedy outside of Manhattan, actually in London. His ironic and witty lines are simply fantastic, and I laughed a lot at his fate of hero in a country where people were driving the wrong way. Sid Waterman is very funny and Woody Allen is in an excellent form as a comedian. But his current muse, Scarlett Johansson, of whom I am a big fan, has overworked and annoyed in many moments, and included her accent in a histrionic statement. Her character is absolutely stupid and debauchery, and I was disappointed with her performance (probably for the first time in her filmography). But this supernatural comedy is still a hilarious and valuable entertainment. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Scoop ?? O Grande Furo" ("Scoop ?? The Big Scoop")
