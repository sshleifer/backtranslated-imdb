What can I say about this movie? I've seen it a few times since the first time I was about 6. I saw the English version and it was done very well. It's a good movie for all ages, but it's more aimed at children. I love the childlike humor and appreciate it. If you haven't seen it, try renting a copy, you won't be disappointed!
