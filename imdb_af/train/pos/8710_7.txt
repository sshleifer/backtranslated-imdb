I remember this show from Swedish television. I was just 7 years old and it scared me unnecessarily. <br /> <br /> I would like to see this series and see if it was as good as remembering though I suspect my tastes and demands have changed. br /> <br /> Although released before stranger and an abundance of other space thrillers, I suspect it has its roots in scary films from the 50's and the political climate of the 70's. Thinking about it, it was a real sci-fi, a movie trying to discuss scientific and political questions about who we are and what we are. The term sci-fi has since become pale and becomes the term for any film that has space ships in them.
