The main problem of the first "Vampire" movie is that none of the characters was sympathetic. Carpenter learned of his mistake and this time uses a nice vampire hunter and a charismatic vampire. The female vampire Una is definitely the coolest vampire since Blade's Deacon Frost. Unfortunately, while there are some good concepts like a cool, slow-motion restaurant scene (why didn't Carpenter use it any more?) Is this movie nowhere as good as it could have been. I expected to see strong vampires in action and at least one longer lasting nice choreographed battle order (for example inside a city) and left somewhat disappointed. As "Los Muertos" progresses at a faster rate than its predecessor, it still drags a bit in some areas (though nowhere else as "Vampires" did). Much like "Vampires", but this film's climax near the end is not very intense. <br /> <br /> Most of the above may sound like "Los Muertos" is a bad movie, but it's definitely not. It is generally enjoyable and is among the better entries for the genre. It's also not an original Dracula remake (like almost every other vampire movie out there) and it's also not an unwise action spectacle like Blade II. It simply could have used a little more excitement. <br /> <br /> I would like to see a third installment by Carpenter, but this is unlikely to happen. <br /> <br /> SPOILER WARNING The end was too predictable. Una had to get away - this would have made the movie quite unusual.
