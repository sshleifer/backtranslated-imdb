I've never talked to a movie before. I watched this movie with my girlfriend last night. I read comments and said this movie was with you. Do this. It's almost 24 hours and I'm still completely affected. This movie asked me to question my own self. How can I compare myself to a character like Ben who is totally selfless. I loved this movie. I like movies that guess me and wonder. I feel two emotions predominant, happiness and sadness. A wonderful, good movie and a lot of sadness too. I wanted Ben and Emily to be together, but eventually they were forever. If you haven't seen this movie, get it and watch it. Just make sure you have no distractions. You will see every nuance in this photo. One for my library.
