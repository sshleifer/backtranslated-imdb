I also saw it at a show last night. I was totally blown away by how much better this movie was than I expected. Not many movies can combine dark comedy and present-day drama and it won't fall apart. <br /> <br /> I won't bother the plot again, because I think the less you know about this movie. But I will say that Adam Sandler's performance was really refreshing and real. He was funny, and much more funny than most of his most recent comedies. Don Cheadle was always credible. <br /> <br /> This movie isn't funny like Borat or Billy Madison, but it has a good fit about it. I'd say 90% of the audience laughed at most of the movie. Midway through the movie slows down the drama end of things and does a very good job of tying it all together. <br /> <br /> I also thought it was really cool, how to get the whole black friend / friend they chose to ignore it and focus on relationships themselves.
