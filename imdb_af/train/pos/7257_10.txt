The reason I say it is because I wrote the script and knew very little that it was made until I was asked to watch the movie. I wrote it for some producers who sold it without telling me. Because Alan Dobie was a friend of mine, I heard about it. I first wrote a first draft, so I was understandably worried when I heard it was on the floor. I asked Peter Collinson, through my agent, if he would like me to do another concept. I also asked if I could see my original script because I lost it. I was too late to tell. So I did the only thing I could do under the circumstances and pulled my name down. I had no idea what they could do on my script. Then I was invited to see the finished movie. I was so impressed that I asked for my name very quickly. It's a beautifully crafted piece, from a hastily written first concept, I expected to be asked to do more work on it; Maybe if I had it, it wouldn't be that good. Would I like to see my original script again if anyone knows where it is? I would also like to see the movie again, I only saw it once in a visiting theater in Soho.
