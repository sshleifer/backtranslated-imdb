Well ... Vivah is pretty good, but typical Sooraj Barjatya's movie. It shows different aspects of Indian families, wedding ceremonies, etc. The movie is more than good, but not very good. <br /> <br /> The big plus of the movie is direction, music and Shahid and Amrita's play especially the last scene). The movie starts with a common factor of the Indian movie --- A girl is not neglected from her stepmother. Story is the movie is a bit general, but it's good, good enough to make the movie a blockbuster. <br /> <br /> The downside is a general story of Bollywood film. Overall I would say it is twice the movie to watch, if you want to see typical Indian family values ​​and of course love!
