I watched this movie after seeing it on Broadway. I love the Broadway musical and I love the movie. I watched the movie as if it wasn't related to the Broadway show. I am an avid reader and have seen how most books happen when they are changed into movies, so I developed a philosophy very early. Assume that the movie will be based on the book (or musical in this case), but that while the story line is similar, it won't be the same, it will be different, so watch it. <Br /> <br /> I danced 12 years before making a choice. I was a good dancer (choral work in local productions like a child, etc.), but I wasn't super talented. However, I was super talented as a shoulder. I was told by my dance instructor and coach (who I spent a few months a year on his farm from the state) that I had to make a choice when I became 14. That I had to get up to dance two and four hours and five. days a week and drive 3 hours a day 7 days a week .. and dedicate to one or the other. So I love dancing and I love this movie and many other ballet and dance movies. I just chose to watch this movie for what it is, it's a good movie about raw emotion and human interaction. It's about the power of anticipation and sadness when you really work hard to get something you want and you just don't get it. I love the movie. I love the Broadway musical.
