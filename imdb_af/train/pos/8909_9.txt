It's a pretty well-known one, so I won't get too deep in it. The basic story is about two teenagers who find out about a slim alien blob of goo coming to Earth via the meteorite. Human contact with this slime ball burns through flesh like acid. It also absorbs human bodies that grow it. No one believes the teenagers (Steeve McQueen and his girlfriend) and when they finally do, it seems that the blob can't be stopped. It's really well done for its age and unlike many other 50's, the pace is pretty fast. The story is very unique to make it a must see for any fan of old sci-fi and monster movies. If you can dig the gooey gore of the 80-year-old abomination, you must also approve the remake of '88.
