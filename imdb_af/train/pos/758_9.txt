I knew of this as a similar program like Jackass, and I saw one or two episodes on Freeview, and that's the same, just more extreme. In fact, three Welsh guys and one crazy British block were brought by love for skateboarding, and a complete disobedience / masochistic pleasure to harm themselves and their health and safety. They had eaten, eaten crisp-covered pizza, jumped into nettles, naked paintballs, jokes on the smaller man while they were sleeping / snoring, stunts in a workplace, e.g. army, cowboys, and much more insane stunts that cause bruises, bumps, blood and vomiting, perhaps not just for themselves. Mr. Then Dirkton (who is the British one), who practically does not do many physical things, and with an OTT laugh, and Pancho (Mike Locke) who does a lot, more popular for short, fat and lazy. It was number one on The 100 Greatest Funny Moments. Very good!
