Well, I finally got caught up with Rock 'n' Roll High School, 'nearly 30 years after it only became a midnight movie sensation in 1979. (Latecom I'm, I'll probably only this summer's new documentary "Patti Smith : Dream of Life Somewhere around 2040! And no, the movie doesn't even feel dull, and yes, it was worth the wait. It's a very high-energy comedy that has many great music and some surprising moments It tells the story of Riff Randell, pleasantly played by PJ Soles, and the struggle she and her fellow students pay for Vince Lombardi High against their new oppressive chief, Miss Togar. (Danny Peary, in his book "Cult Movies" , describes Mary Woronov's performance as a "Eve Arden." A typical teenage years versus Foundation Story line is lifted here with some absurd humor (those explosive mice, that giant mouse, the Hansel and Gretel saddle monitors) and a few exciting songs Riff is of course the # 1 fan of the original ke punk band The Ramones, and the band make a baker's dozen of his greatest songs in the course of the film, including five at a concert that is a total blast. Indeed, the face of Riff who's furiously dancing to "Teenage Lobotomy" at this exhale can be the picture's funniest moment. And the initial appearance of Joey, Johnny, Dee Dee and Marky in their Ramonesmobile, and later singing a jet song, "I just want to do something", is quite exciting. The film ends with an explosive confrontation that I, every one of the high school's wet dream can imagine. Fun stuff indeed. On a lace note, the Ramones were one of the hardest bands I've ever seen. Therefore, I was very amused to note that the DVD for this film comes with optional English subtitles for the hearing impaired. How many aging punks out there need these captions, I wonder ....
