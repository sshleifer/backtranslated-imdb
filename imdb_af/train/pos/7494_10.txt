Mysterious murders in a European village seem to be the result of the VAMPIRE BAT horde that bothered the horrible community. <br /> <br /> This surprisingly effective little thriller was created by Majestic Pictures, one of Hollywood's poverty-driving studios. The low production values ​​and rough editing add to its ominous atmosphere and give it an almost expressionistic quality. Overall, it makes the viewer feel trapped in a bad dream, suitable for such excitement. <br /> <br /> Although the ultimate explanation for the horrible crimes is pretty ridiculous and not given the proper plot development, the movie boasts a good cast. Earl Lionel Atwill gives another of his typical fine performances, this time as a doctor doing scientific research in an old castle. Beautiful Fay Wray plays his assistant in a role that requires her to do a little more than look beautiful and horrible. Dour Melvyn Douglas appears as the confused police inspector who is also convenient, me. Wray's boyfriend is. <br /> <br /> Maude Eburne, who can be very funny with the right situation, steals most of her scenes as Miss Wray's hypochondrial aunt. Elderly Lionel Belmore plays the town's dreaded mayor. And little Dwight Frye, who is always remembered for his strange roles in the FRANKENSTEIN and Dracula films, is the best here as a bat lover.
