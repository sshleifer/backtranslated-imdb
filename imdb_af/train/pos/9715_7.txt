Here's the skinny, it looks much older than I thought it was. But it's still cool. The bike mechs are cool and the story works for the most part. There are a few character issues that I hope to work out through part 2 and my biggest complaint of everything that seems to be a MACROSS beat. Not just the animation style, but several character designs. For example, all the girls in this movie look like LYN MINMAY or MACROSS. The mechs look similar to MACROSS as well as the other characters. It's really not made for small children, it has graphic violence, nudity and graphic sexual content. To make a long story short, I give this cool MAKROS knock-off 7 stars.
