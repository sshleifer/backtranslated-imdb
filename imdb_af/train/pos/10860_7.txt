It's not as violent as I expected. The violent scenes are becoming more brutal and effective. <br /> <br /> There are many turns and turns and stitches and double crossing throughout the movie makes it difficult to know whose side is a particular character. <br /> <br /> The plot is tailored with good dialogue and character development and gives an interesting picture of the operation of the Triad gang that follows. /> <br /> The violence when it comes is brutal, no guns or special effects martial art scenes. It is credible in your face-to-face violence and for all the dialogue you are never allowed, forget that the Triad is a violent criminal organization. <br /> <br /> The ending is surprising, but thoroughly consistent and credible.
