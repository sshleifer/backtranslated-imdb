Based on a true story, this series is a jewel of its kind. The slave who becomes queen by capturing the heart of the most powerful man in the village. <br /> <br /> In the diamond mining town of Tijuco in Brazil, the diamond commander - appointed by the king of Portugal - is the ultimate authority. The young and beautiful Xica da Silva grew up in the relative security of his home, deciding to sell her in a whorehouse in the village, refusing to admit that a black maid could be his daughter. In a desperate attempt to save herself, Xica steals the diamonds collected by the diamond commander for the king who intend to use them to escape. The king's army, however, gathered the next day to collect the diamonds, and when the booty came loose, the diamond commander was diverted into chains, expelled his family and thrown into the street with only the clothes on their backs. Martin, the diamond commander's son, swears revenge. However, Xica and the other slaves are being sold at an auction, and Xica ends in the house of the Sergeant Major, an old man who just bought her to beat her. However, in the town of Tijuco, the new diamond commander, the elegant and relentless Joao Fernandes, comes. Immediately hit by Xica's beauty, he manipulated the Sergeant Major to sell her to him. And so begins a love story filled with danger, intrigue and passion, between a deliberate nobleman and a smart maid who rises one day, becoming queen. <br /> <br /> The series is filled with rich details of the era's beliefs, superstitions, politics, fashion, etc. etc. And it really does manage your attention for every minute. Sometimes funny with a sarcastic and dark humor, full of excitement and unexpected twists. "Xica da Silva" is definitely a must. I wish I could buy the whole series on DVD.
