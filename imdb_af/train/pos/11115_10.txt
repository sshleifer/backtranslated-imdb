I believe Sopranos is a wonderful show because of all the supporting characters in it. I've bought all the video so far and are waiting for the rest to be released. In all 42 episodes so far the best one is definitely episode 3, Denial, Anger, Acceptance. This episode is about my favorite character of all time in The Sopranos. His name was Brendan Filone. He was killed because he hijacked the wrong truck and accidentally killed a truck driver. Brendan was wonderful because he was actually one of the few characters who actually stood against Tony and his gang. In the end, he finally shot the eye while taking a bath, and this is my favorite stone ever in the history of The Sopranos. Brendan Filone is # 1 for me. And my # 2 most favorite character was ever Matthew Bevilaqua, who was killed after killing Christopher Moltisanti. Tony and Pussy shoot at Hucklebarney Park after they catch and torture him. My # 3 most favorite character is Sean Gismonte, who was killed after the shooting, Christopher. And finally, my # 4 most favorite character is Chucky Signore, one of Uncle Junior's henchmen. He was killed by Tony on a boat. All the wonderful characters are dead. It's the only bad thing about Sopranos. All the cool guys are always killed. You know what would be good for changing the Sopranos? They must have an entire episode where they show all the dead supporting characters in hell and they all try to torture Chris, Tony, Uncle Junior, Silvio and Paulie because they have to abuse their revenge. Brendan Filone will hit back !!!!!!!!! 1
