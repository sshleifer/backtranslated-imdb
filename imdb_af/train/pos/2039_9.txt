First, I want to point out that people who criticized this film made sharp mistakes. Anything that has a score of less than 6/10 is clearly nonsense. <br /> <br /> Creep is an absolutely fantastic movie with great movie effects. The actors are highly credible, the narrative thinking and the horror and graphic content are extremely disturbing. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of mystery in this movie. Many questions arise when the audience is revealed to the strange and fiery creature that makes habitat in the dark rotten tunnels. How was 'Craig' created and what happened to him? <br /> <br /> A great movie with a big chill factor. A movie with so many unanswered questions and a movie to be appreciated with others like 28 Days later, The Bunker, Dog Soldiers and Deathwatch. <br /> <br /> Look forward to more of these great movies !!
