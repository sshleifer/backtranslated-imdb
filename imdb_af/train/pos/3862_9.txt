Since I'm always looking for something new and unique, I watched this movie online. I thought it would be just another "B" direction film, but I was amazed at the acting of the two main characters. All the actors in this movie were very competent and well-directed. The plot was also wonderful and unique, with an excellent morale for the story. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely not for anyone looking for a sex skirt, Dumb and Dumber or blood and gut. It's a wonderful flickering movie that shows some grim realities of life, along with the kindness of the human heart and just enough frivolity to keep it interesting. <br /> <br /> I would prefer this movie to many "A" I even saw a huge number with high cash earnings. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie.
