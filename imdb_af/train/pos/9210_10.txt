I feel it is one of the best movies I've seen, I'm an older male and most of all westerners. I like movies that are at least partially based on facts. If I'm not wrong, it's such a movie. I also like revenge type movies. It also qualifies there in my opinion. Some of my favorite parts of the movie were the opening scene with the flute and the abrasive shot. I thought the scene was a bit overshadowed, but had no effect on how I felt about the full movie. I've seen what I think is a continuation of this movie in a gun smoking episode. I also enjoyed it. I recommend taking the time to watch this movie, I'll see it again. I also felt that the romance parts of this movie were played well. I thought it was so out of character for Randy Travis to play a villain, but I always enjoy his acting.
