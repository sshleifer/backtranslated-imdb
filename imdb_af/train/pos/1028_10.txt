I must say, from the beginning, when I watched the Stargate movie, I wasn't blown away, and nothing was like an average movie, with lots of potential, though the movie wasn't that bad. Like other science films such as star wars or strangers, which if you are a sci fi fanatic, you will admit that one of those two titles is wonderful, although I'm not as hardcore sci fi as some people, I don't remember one reel from one of those movies, I'm not a big fan of wearing star wars T-shirts, if you've seen me, I'd look like an average person for you, ah get a little out of the point here , my point is that the one you don't have to be a hard core sci fi fan to keep this huge series, which unfortunately ended after 10 incredible seasons with no drop in its quality as it came to its end in 2006 <br /> <br /> Although I didn't have much of the movie, I was looking forward to the first season in 1997, and I told you that the special effects are just one of the great things about the series. , the chemistry between the characters just threw me away the special effects, as good or better than most sci fi shows running today. I have to admit that I would never have been in Sci fi if it wasn't for stargates, and my dad, who actually got me into science when I was like 6 and I'm glad he did, otherwise I would not I have seen the brilliant performances like SG1, which, in my opinion, is the benchmark for almost all sci-fi series and movies. Basically, if a new sci series isn't better or as good as SG1, it's not worth watching. basically it's the best sci fi show to date and if you don't see it, you have no idea what you miss!
