This movie was absolutely wonderful. The pre-partition time and culture has been beautifully recreated. Urmila gave another brilliant show. What I really admire about this movie is that it does not resort to Pakistan bashing running in movies like Gadar and LOC. With the partition as wallpaper, the movie does not lead to political issues or focus on violence or what is right and wrong. The film always focuses on the tragic story of Urmila's life. Her fragile relationship with Manoj Bajpai is excellently portrayed. The film actually shows how the people, both Hindus and Muslims, suffered from this partition. The theme that there is only one religion is actually common in this movie.
