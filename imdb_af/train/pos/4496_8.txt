To put it simply, I enjoyed this movie. The reason for my interest and enjoyment was not related to anything other than the subject itself. I heard stories from my mother and grandmother about how North England's workers' lives and attitudes were used (as they are experiencing) and this is an interesting representation that apparently represents faithfully what they told me. In particular, the paternalistic but remaining father who "knows" what is best for his family along with his stubbornness when this paradigm is challenged. (There is not much change!) <br /> <br /> People who have seen the play will probably be disappointed with the movie because the story is not easily distributed across the media. In a sense, however, the film is a historical document and I personally enjoyed it, even if it was just because it conveyed a social phenomenon.
