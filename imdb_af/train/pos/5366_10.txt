I'm sitting here November 2006 and I can't help ripping over this movie yet. Arnold's best movies came over a 4-5 year team. Running Man, Predator, and Total Recall (1990). All 3 is wonderful. The cute one by Arnold in this movie will make you laugh more than one occasion. I find the play in this movie surprisingly good as in Predator and Totall Recall. They did a good job of making the screens futuristic as it would happen in 2017, but you can't help but in the 80's style they cut the men and women in the crowd and the regular television controllers in the Running Man studio we all know in 2006 is on the way out with the rise of flat panel and HDTVs. Also, the computer graphics of the "The Running Man" show show intro will not look like this in 2017. Yet the storyline is absolutely fantastic. Not once during this movie did I want to get up and not care for the end, this is something I often do with today's movie. I really think Arnold's play is much better than what he gets credit for. Now I wouldn't have elected him governor, but it's California for you. Buzzsaw, Dynamo, Fireball, SubZero are also fantastic "stalkers" and I find the producers are not trying to overshoot the battle scenes. When the stalker died, he died. It doesn't take 20 minutes each. The stalker scenes are fast and entertaining, but they don't try to overdo it. I give this movie a 10/10 and it comes from someone who doesn't enjoy many movies. If you get the right actors and the right story, then the futuristic graphics that you want to see in 2006 aren't important or necessary.
