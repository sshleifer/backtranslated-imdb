Ang Lee likes to light up in a movie, catch action, capture characters and capture the hoof, as they come out. It is an ideal approach to keep the haphazard end game of the American civil war through the haphazard actions of a young militia, uninformed or in mind. The film seems to be about forming personalities, maturity and relationships. Lee also shows the beautiful panoramas of the middle-south as a silent character, which remains the strife like a hardy parent. <br /> <br /> James Schamus's script is probably the standard carrier for this movie; On the other hand, a number of well-appointed performances carry it admiringly. Jeffrey Wright's name alone can carry this movie for me. He is brilliant here, but in a slow burning role. Instead, we are treated with very good (if not revealing) performances by a large, often recognizable ensemble. <br /> <br /> A noble, optimistic movie. One to see if you don't want the harder, more bittersweet Cold Mountain or the Claim. 10/07
