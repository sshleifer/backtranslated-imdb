I'm curious about what Beckett's gun uses in the movie, and also the caliber of the bullet he's supposed to fire. If it is loosely based on Carlos Hathcock's cut, I suggest it is a 7mm. round. I'm also curious about the gun itself. He also commented on the final Sniper movie about the gun that the Vietnamese man had used to him that belonged to his father. Beckett mentioned that he thought it was the best sniper rifle ever made. I would like to know which gun it is. I know this particular gun was made in World War II or before. I just couldn't look enough and watch the movie to identify it. <br /> <br /> Hathcocks killed, his longest shot was 1.47 miles and he had 93 confirmed victims and killed 14 unconfirmed. After his wounds were slightly healed to be burned in Vietnam, he spent the skills they needed in the field to spend the rest of his USMC career teachers. His sniper career is still mentioned to our brothers and sisters in the USMC. I got his name from my friend who is a former Marine. Any information will be good.
