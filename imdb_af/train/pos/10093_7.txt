A beautiful shop girl in London is wiped out of her feet by a millionaire tea plantation owner and soon finds herself married and lives with him at his villa in British Ceylon. Although based on Robert Standish's book, this initial setting is strongly reminded of Hitchock's "Rebecca", with leading lady Elizabeth Taylor clashing with the imposing head of staff at home and (almost immediately) her own husband, what still under the thumb of his deceased-but-dominant father. Taylor, the latter replacement for a sick Vivien Leigh, looks creamy-smooth in her high-fashion wardrobe, and her performance is pretty strong; However, when one man, Peter Finch, starts drinking heavily and hitting commands on her, one can rather think of his dedication to him masochistically (this feeling also hinders the end). Yet, the film offers a rag for soap buffers: romantic drama, a travel book, interpretive dance, elephant stomp and a perfect timely outbreak of cholera! *** of ****
