But unfortunately due to real issues, it will almost certainly never happen. Joe Bob's comments on the sub-B movies he sifted are available on the internet, but they do not capture his twang-bent delivery. It was a real hoot. Today Joe Bob (real name: John Bloom) is confined to the complementary features of such classics as "I Spit On Your Grave" (with what some exploitation fans call the greatest gang rape on all time film) and Jason X, one of those most afflicted on Friday the 13th successors of all time (the series was never the same as leaving Paramount). All I could think of when they canceled it was: "Damn, where will I get my rubbish, blonde jokes and horror trivia every Saturday night?" Does that mean I have to get a life now? Unfortunately, it does. But there will always be a place in my horror hungry heart for "Monstervision." Live the Drive-In!
