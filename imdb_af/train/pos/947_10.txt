and possibly closest to the Dickens story line. Although I find the young Ebenezer difficult to look at (whose idea was that hair, surely it could have done better!), Scott does an amazing job as Scrooge. His delivery of some of the Dickens lines eventually brought me to life. Edward Woodward is everything we expect and more of the Spirit of Christmas gift. I find G.C. Scott's Scrooge is much more of a credible miser than the more recent version by Patrick Stewart. The scene Christmas when Scrooge realizes he didn't miss it is enough to convince someone that Scott knows how to counteract too much. He's phenomenal here. Almost the entire cast is incredible. The Tiny Tim in this version of The Christmas Carol is a bit difficult to look at, almost too sweet. Yet the music and the scenery make it a must see every holiday. Enjoy it!
