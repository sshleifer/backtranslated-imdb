Now I had the pleasure of viewing the infected man when he held back on TV in December 2000. <br /> <br /> An infected disease expert (William Hurt) loses his family when an unknown disease enters his home and kills them. Now a few years later he is now in Russia or a place. I'm not sure where exactly, everything I know is somewhere in that area. Anyway, due to budget savings at an infectious disease laboratory, they are forced to retrench most of their workers. One of them, a disgruntled security guard named Joseph Muller (played Peter Weller, best known for his role as the indestructible Robocop), goes in there and demands that they give him back his work. He needs this job because he is divorced and he needs it to pay for child support. So he goes inside, a fight breaks out, and some things are slapped, dangerous things. It is soon discovered that Muller is infected with a lethal pathogen. In fact, it's so deadly, one drop of his blood will kill a person in seconds. Soon the word comes out and the disease expert (Hurt) is reported to investigate and later collaborated with an American reporter. Now Muller is determined to come home to see his wife and son and will stop nothing, even if he has to infect the entire Russian population. <br /> <br /> Now, as I said earlier, this movie is much like Falling Down. We have a disturbed person (Weller here, Michael Douglas in Falling Down) who will do nothing to achieve that goal, even if they have to kill some people in the process. Next we have a hero-type person (Hurt here, Robert Duvall in Falling Down) who are both sympathetic and determined to stop the antagonist. <br /> <br /> Infected Man is actually a very good movie with a good story. line and some very good performances. <br /> <br /> 8/10
