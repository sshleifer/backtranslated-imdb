EA showed us that they can make a classic 007 agent and make you feel in the 60's world. The graphics of the game are outstanding and the voice recording is very professional. I got this game April 2007 (two years after the release) and I'm still impressed with the game. It is a pity that EA will no longer make 007 games. <br /> <br /> I give this game 10/10 for the levels it contains, especially the "consulate" level. I would recommend this game to anyone aged 13 and over. The only thing I didn't have in the game was the Russian boat level, it was too much pressure. Overall, I love the game a lot!
