Loopy, but smart and formidable mob boss Vic (an excellent performance by Richard Dreyfuss) is released from a mental hospital. Several of Vic's co-criminal cohorts, including the fleeting Henchman "Brass Balls", Ben London (a glamorous manic and exaggerated hammie depiction of Gabriel Byrne), the smelly Jake Parker (a perfect smuggler Kyle MacLachlan) and a brutal rival "Wacky" Jacky Jackson (a neat turn by Burt Reynolds) is trying to bump Vic. Meanwhile, the retired and confident hit Mickey Holliday (well played with low key confidence by Jeff Goldblum) caught him in the midst of all this deadly glory. Author / director Larry Bishop brings a totally intense, peculiar and original idiosyncratic sensitivity to this wonderfully dark and deadly spooky comedy about betrayal, loyalty and ruthless ambition that is dangerous. The victim has a field day with the colorful grotesque rogues gallery of mere amoral and treacherous hoodlums: tough tough Ellen Barkin, sultry moll Rita Everly, Henry Silva as Vic's trusty right-handed Sleepy Joe Carisle, Gregory Hines as philosophical smoothie Jules Flamingo, Diane Lane as Vic's lovely, mistress Grace, Billy Drago as the smarty Wells, and Christopher Jones as the brutal rubbing artist Nicholas Falco. Bishop makes the most of his juicy secondary role as lethal and laconic assassin Nick. Billy Idol is a refugee, Michael J. Pollard as the unlucky Red, Joey Bishop as mortar Mr Gottlieb, Rob Reiner as a keen driver and Richard Pryor as Jimmy the Gravedigger. Byrne's beautiful insane duet with singer Paul Anka on "My Way" rates as a definite play. An exciting and amusing climatic Mexican stand-off tickle the funny leg too hysterically. Frank Byers' clever cinematography, outrageous swampy dialogue, Earl Rose's jazzy cocktail lounge score, and a choice of vintage swinging golden age soundtracks enhance the surprisingly exceptional charm of this incredibly entertaining one-time Curio.
