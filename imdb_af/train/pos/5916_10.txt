I watched the movie Ralph Bakshi (Wizards, Hey Good Lookin) one night ago at www.afrovideo.org, and I saw nothing racist (I'm not stupid). I admit that the character designs are a bit rough and inexplicable today, but I think it is a satire and a very, very urban narrative of the old Uncle Remus stories that the Black American culture created up to the main characters and the blatant nod to "The Tar Baby" and "The Briar Patch." This is not a story story, but I think of cultural icons created by black Americans, and I am a white woman who reads and loves the stories. And I also found it an interesting time-capsule view on the black culture in Harlem, New York, in the 70's. <br /> <br /> Well, to get the feast of this movie: This movie is a live action / animated movie, which starts with live action with a fellow-named Sampson (Barry White) and the Preacherman's (Charles Gordone) hurry to help their friend, Randy (Philip Michael Thomas), escapes from jail, but is stopped by a roadblock and comes in a shooting with the police. While waiting for them, Randy reluctantly listens to co-escaping Pappy (Scatman Crothers), as he tells Randy's animated story of Brother Konyn, a young newcomer to the big city coming out of the dark to rule over all Harlem . You know, for me Rabbit, Bear and Fox are animal versions of Randy, Sampson and the Preacherman. An abstract compilation of stylized animation and vibrant action footage, the film is a graphic and judgmental satire of stereotypes commonly found in the 70's? racial, ethnic and otherwise. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is another good Bakshi movie; and should we eat such a movie under the rugs? Do as if they never exist? hmmm ... I think it'll be sorry; I think we should look at these movies, and learn about what is happening from now on, just how far we come from.
