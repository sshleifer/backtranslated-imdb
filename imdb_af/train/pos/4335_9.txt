Oscar-caliber performance by Peter Falk in an Oscar-caliber-written role. I loved the nuanced, balanced exploration of a prolonged marriage - how often do we get it in movies, after which the movie ends when the boy and girl come together? It's a movie for adults, a complex view through the eyes of all parties - man, woman, son - how each one has adapted to one another in the past and grows in the story. In addition, it gave me about 10 major gastric juices, and I'm one of the people who usually sits uncomfortable when the rest of the audience laughs. It was one of the few really funny movies I saw. Big, original jokes.
