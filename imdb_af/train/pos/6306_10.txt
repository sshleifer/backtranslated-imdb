Idiotic hack crooks, a baby, a safe, a plan and a baby. Add them all and you'll get the best comedy you've never heard of. <br /> <br /> Even with a few star force (at least a-minus ... okay, b-plus?) this movie has very little publicity. <br /> <br /> But that doesn't diminish his genius. <br /> <br /> Great writing, solid delivery and a credible group of characters. Some really classic lines, and a fun twist to the end. <br /> <br /> It's not a rounded "Nutty Professor" comedy. It's low life bad guys. They speak low-life bad old language and they do low-life bad old things. But they do it for you entertainment and entertainment, and they do it well. <br /> <br /> One of the best comedies I've ever seen.
