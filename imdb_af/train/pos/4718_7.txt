This film was made in Hungary, I think. Anyway, the countryside is beautiful, the people playing the farmers were quite fascinating. their horse riding is great. I have more in indigenous people, farm life, and how heroically they tried to hide Brady from the evil Nazis who were looking for the parachutists. They even sacrificed their lives in many cases. Brady's young orphan was a sweet kid. You will be amazed at the drive I think, and the action to evade the Nazis. It is entertaining and comical in some spots and very tragic in others. Ladies are handy, because you will eventually be destroyed. I own it and have watched it several times. in other words, not just a movie. it is a custodian.
