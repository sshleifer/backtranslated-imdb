Those who know who knows the Kelly legend and hope that this movie will be an accurate portrayal of his life can be disappointed with the creative license taken with this movie (eg Naomi Watt's character has never actually existed Not), but if you watch it purely as a piece of entertainment, it keeps pretty good. Ledgers' performance in the title role is pretty solid, with the mantle of the best film of the film. (Even though it's not hard to see the previous Ned's, Yahoo Serious, Mick Jagger and former Carlton champion Bob Chitty include a good soccer player, but a poor actor. Some spot shooting in the area where I live, Bacchus Marsh outside Melbourne, as well as Clunes & Ballarat.
