In 2054, Paris, Avalon, a computer-generated system, controlled the city and when a young woman was kidnapped, detective Karas (Craig) had to go against Avalon to find her. <br /> <br /> Renaissance is an excellent combination of film blended with a conceptual futuristic story that sets the screen in a shocking shepherd with a noir-themed ideology and conceptual montages that entertain a lot. <br /> <br /> Pixar are the animation masters. Their numerous Oscar winners are endless from the beautiful Toy Story to the mystifying Wall-E and so any company or director has a real challenge to beat them. However, Renaissance is not a film aimed at the young audience, and like the Persepolis of 2007, a strong and mature approach to the genre of animation brings an older and more challenging movie to its targeted older generation . <br /> <br /> In 2005, Robert Rodriguez released a shockingly brilliant noir Sin City that released the full use of green screen with a brilliant black and white filming film with the strange color questions and a year later , Christian Volckman adopted a similar approach with this equally visually masterful film entertainment stroke. <br /> <br /> Volckman's picture, however, is full of animation, but it doesn't look half-realistic, most of which is strong 1 hour and 40 minutes running. The faces of the character are well portrayed and in particular this film should be the best ever for the use of shade. The fact that we never know whether its night or day is irrelevant when we just look in the rocky faces, as the shadows blend over their expressions. It is almost a clever use of pathetic error, and is also fine-tuned. <br /> <br /> For anyone who has seen Persepolis, you will have come to the conclusion. It's one of the best-targeted animations ever made for the simple screen. but highly conceptual artistic style by Marjane Satrapi <br /> <br /> Renaissance is likewise on terms with that picture and in many cases it is with stronger graphics and a darker tone to reflect the mood. One place in particular when Karas appears from the darkness is beautifully shot. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around a stubborn and nose political government that holds tables on every citizen. The run of Paris is down to the mysterious Avalon, which we almost can't see enough to get a being from its true domination. Renaissance manages the story of a tired police effort to save the mysterious woman, and then we see Craig's tired and boring police effort rescuing while struggling with other elements. There are many things wrong with the dissertation, not to mention the tired, offensive cop routine is old, but there are many adrenaline and feathery scales between characters to keep it alive to a wonderful shot, shocking last few stages.
