It's a movie that has everything, the dashing hero, the beautiful girl in distress, the noble figure with the tragic mistake, and a wonderful wonderful robot. Forbidden Planet has maintained the special magic over the years and does not lose its fragrance with repeated views (although the sexual appeal of youthful Anne Francis greatly contributes to the score). <br /> <br /> Film fans will portray young Leslie Nielsen, who is the handsome and heroic commander Adams, although those of us who are capable of comedic roles may be a little surprised by his appearance in a serious role. The distinguished and noble Walter Pidgeon is also a well-known player as the scientist with a secret (Id). Other supporting cast deserves a nod, especially Warren Stevens as the good and inventive "Doc", and of course the charm of me. Francis, as mentioned above. <br /> <br /> This film was an early pioneer in the use of electronic music, in the 1950s, no less. The credits call them "tonalities", but those of us who try to combine the early versions of the Theremin device will recognize the ominous and haunting pikes and screams that are sometimes used in the soundtrack. Yet, it adds to the image of the exotic and alien landscape of the mysterious and banning world of the Krell. <br /> <br /> The special effects were also fairly arrested. I remember my fear as a young man waiting for the next manifestation of the invisible "Id" monster, and when it was finally visualized in one battlefield, it was wondering and astonishingly literally on my toes. The magic of the math is fully exploited in the most daring scenes of the Krell Scientific complex, as the characters lead their way through the various labyrinths and corridors, led by the enigmatic dr. Morbius. <br /> <br /> I remember some feeling jealous that Dr Morbius would have such a cool toy in the form of Robby Robot. The persona of Robby is very charming and in some ways looks more human than some of the other characters. Viewers of follow-up programs such as Twilight Zone and Lost In Space will recognize the recycled Robby stick in some of the episodes, though I remember never having had the "Robbie" personality. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that I did not fully understand the complexities of the plot until I was old enough to understand the various references to Freudian psychology and the danger of the hidden and We normally carry contained fears and anger, which we have worn in, but we have, through will, trained to destroy and control social code compliance. Although the key to the story seems to be obvious, it is unknown (or perhaps deliberately overlooked) by Dr. Morbius, until it is pointed out by the clear commander Adams, what dr. Morbius forces himself to confront evil. It gives me another goose bump when Commander Adams Dr. Morbius repels the Krell machine with a superior intellect, which opened the flood gates of his subconscious mind for the power of the Krell machine: "Artificially enlarged. It consciously still has the power around the Big Machine. but your subconscious is made strong enough. " <br /> <br /> Forbidden Planet is probably my favorite sci-fi movie ever, and remains timeless and classic for its carefully crafted story and amazing on-screen visualization and realization.
