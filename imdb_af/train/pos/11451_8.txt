A very engaging documentary about Scottish artist Andy Goldsworthy, whose work consists mainly of ephemeral sculptures made of elements of nature. His work is made of rocks, leaves, grass, ice, etc. It is blown away when the tide comes to the beach or the wind blows on the field. So, most of Goldsworthy's works don't really matter, except photos or movies of what they were. Now one can argue that Goldsworthy's works are a reflection of deaths or words, but it's not easier to say that what he's doing is just fine art. And at a time when the stereotype about artists is that they are mostly bitter, pretentious, often mentally unstable people living in remote urban settings, Goldsworthy seems to be the opposite: a stable, unpretentious, family-oriented person who loves nature and live in a small town in Scotland (of course, I'm sure these are the same reasons why some people in the art world avoid being fluffy or superficial).
