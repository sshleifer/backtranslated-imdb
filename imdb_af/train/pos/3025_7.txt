Bacall does well here - especially because of this, it's just her 2nd movie. This one is often overshadowed by two major successes: "To have and not to have" (1944) and "The Big Sleep" (1945), both mating with Humphrey Bogart. Granted this one is not up to date with the other movies, but I think of no fault of her own. I think there were some flaws in the fact that she portrays a British farmer's lady. No accent whatsoever. I think all the strange accents were distracting. Boyer was definitely not a Spaniard. It was difficult to keep straight in which country people came from. <br /> <br /> I really liked the black and white cinematography. Voting is used to have a great influence. I especially like the fog screen. The lighting also has a good job of adding to the plot and tension. <br /> <br /> Bacall is just beautiful. Not only does Boyer fit the romantic lead for me - so he and Bacall together were a bit strange. Not good chemistry - and certainly no Bogie and Bacall magic. But I still liked a lot of this photo. There is great tension and it moves well enough. I must say that I found the murder of the girl very brave for this period film. <br /> <br /> Katina Paxinou and Peter Lorre stand out as supporting role. Paxinou as the hotel keeper is totally ominous and angry at her portrayal. Her one scene where she laughs masculine like Mr. Muckerji leaves after she has exposed her as the child's killer, is very disturbing. Lorre also does pretty well in his slender, snake depiction of Conteras - a sleepy coward until the end. Wanda Bendrix also does pretty well to portray the child Else - especially since it was her first photo and she was only 16 at the moment (although she looks much younger). It turned out that she was later married to Auie Murphy, who was apparently a short-lived, stormy marriage.
