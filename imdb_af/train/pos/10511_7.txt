"Emma Woodhouse" Gwyneth Paltrow (Shakespeare in Love, Duets) has nothing to do with herself, but paints, goes with her friends on her wagon and says hello to people in town, and tries to fit, make everyone she knows. I think there were no movies, no television in those days, and the girls have nothing to do but gossip. I wish she had read a little more. I love Gwyneth and think she's a lovely young woman. She is talented, and in "Emma" one has the privilege of singing Gwyneth. I look forward to seeing "Duets", where she is supposed to sing. She is brave to speak English to all native British, including Emma Thompson's sister, "Miss Bates" Sophie Thompson (Four Weddings and a Funeral, Dance at Lughnasa). "Elton" Juliet Stevenson (Truly Madly Deeply) was considered one of the most promising actors in 1991. Gwyneth is part of the American film clerk, but none other than the daughter of director Bruce Paltrow (St. Elders) and Tony Award Winner Blythe Danner (The Myth of Fingerprints). She will hopefully be for a really long time. Happy us! I like Emma and recommend it too. This is one of those old stories that are still accurate these days. Favorite Scenes: Emma sings and plays the piano. I especially like it when she sings a duet. Favorite Quotes: Mr. Knightley ": Emma, ​​you didn't ask me to contribute a riddle." Emma: "Your whole personality is a mystery, Mr. Knightley. I thought you were overqualified." Miss. Bates: "It left us speechless, quite speechless, I tell you, and we didn't stop talking about it."
