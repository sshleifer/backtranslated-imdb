Everyone, my name may be weird, but there was nothing else! <br /> <br /> Any way, I've never seen anything like that, so it was crazy! Of course this is a good thing. It's a humorous interesting movie and my absolute all-time favorite thing is how they mix other things together! Like the little chicken, the fish pretended to be King Kong and Runt the pig and said, "Twice beauty that killed the animal," War of the world scene and more. Walt Disney Company did not lose its contact, perhaps not for this one. Also, how did they make it look like they were watching a movie and it was like a home cinema. <br /> <br /> However, some parts do not fit. As in the original lion king, Timon and Pumbaa were not with Simba when he struck Scar? In this movie they are not! They fought back against the hyenas. Ther is more, the reason why Pumbaa is not so confident is because he is pushed by the other animals and also, it's just Timon, Timon, Timon. Anyone realize that only Timonn's story was told, while pumba had only flashbacks? <br /> <br /> But apart from that, it's a BIG!
