This movie has everything, action, fighting, dancing, bull riding, music, pretty girls. This movie is an authentic look at Central America. Believe me, I was there in 1980. Many oil money, many women, and very honest guys. Sorry, they're all gone now. The movie is basically just another boy met girl, son lost girl, boy gets girl back, but it is redeemed by the actors and the music. There is absolutely no movie with any better music this movie is, and it includes American Graffiti. It's a movie I see over and over and never get tired. Every time I see it, I'm young again, and it's time to go out. The only reason I just gave it a 9 is because you can't rate a movie zero, I don't feel you have to vote in 10.
