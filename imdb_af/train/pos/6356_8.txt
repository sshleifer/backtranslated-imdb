I thought the Grinch Stolen Christmas was a pretty good movie. It wasn't terrible, and it wasn't nice either, but it was nice to watch. I felt like Jim Carrey was a bit annoying. They made the Grinch look like a special educator, when everything he needed to be was evil and ominous, yet he was slowed down. I thought the landscape, when it was not inside the Grinch cave, was beautiful, and there were a few areas where I laughed. But most of the time I thought it was just annoying. This movie could have been so much better if they changed the Grinch's personality, and they included even more laughable, because most of the humor wasn't funny. . I like how the Grinch stole Christmas anyway, but it's not something to be excited to see.
