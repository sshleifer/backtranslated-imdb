This is the best picture about baseball, as Redford has destroyed the natural road. Dennis Quaid and Rachel Griffiths lift the screen up with a big story and a role that was really enough to get you into their lives. <br /> <br /> Laughing with dreams, in reality, the American Dream drops after 9.11 with a real story about Devil Ray's middle-aged grace, Jimmy Morris. Australian-born actress, Rachel Griffiths, plays a native West Texan better than a lot of Texans I know; and Dennis Quaid was perfection ?? throw as the wannabe, gonnabe and humble winner with so much psychological baggage as the average viewer in the audience. It really is. The on-screen chemistry works. If you like baseball heart warmers, you'll love this movie. The ingredients for Americana and Apple pie were all there. My popcorn has become the 'a la mode'. <br /> <br /> And hey: buy the CD! The music rocks and carry the story wonderfully! Syncing words and music pushes the story forward exactly as it belongs, an area that disappointes me more often. <br /> <br /> Criticism: I would have given the baseball to someone else. But Quaid has something to teach us everything about character and heart. St Rita and the nuns were a nice decoration, but they never really found their place in the story to open and close them. A little long. Appreciate every minute in the last analysis. 8/10. <br /> <br />
