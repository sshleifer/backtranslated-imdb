I saw this movie last night at a special movie in Nuremberg, and it was wonderful. I have to admit that the original music composition of the cellist and percussion / xylophone player influenced the sphere of the film, but the film itself also forced the portrayal of the tragic Nibelungen saga. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in silent movies or in the Nibelungen song, I recommend this movie. The costumes were fantastic and creative, the sets were cute and exotic, and the play was dramatic and breathtaking (typical of a bad movie "tragedies"). Unfortunately, I didn't see the first part of this movie duo about Siegfried. The story of this second film begins after Siegfried's death, when Kremhild (Gudrun in the Norwegian versions of the story) began planning her revenge against her brothers. <br /> <br /> I also watched this movie in German; I am a native English speaker and have a basic German knowledge. It was difficult to read the "subtitles" (what do you call them in silent movies?). Due to the old German writing, I advise that if you see it in German, you make sure you can distinguish your "k's". , "f's" and "s's" in old writing. :)
