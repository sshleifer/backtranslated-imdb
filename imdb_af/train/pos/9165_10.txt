It must be the best fit I have ever seen, this is my favorite and I think it is very close to the book. What really makes this a must see though is the deciding factor of the two main players. The wonderful Timothy Dalton is the best Rochester I saw on the screen breadth and tragic, while Zelah Clarke is the perfect combination of power, courage, shame and gentleness as Jane. The story (as I am sure most people know) is that young and ordinary Jane Eyre is a teacher at a charity school for girls in the 1800s who advertises her as a governor in the newspapers. She is presented as the post of governor at Thornfield Hall's large mansion to lead nobles the young ward of the mysterious and respected owner Mr Rochester Adele's ward. As the months go on, he falls in love with Jane and puts in a few situations to try and see if Jane is in love with him as he is with her. But there's another secret that is still waiting to be discovered at Thornfield Hall. And when it is, it is slightly devastating. It is a moving and well-maintained drama with beautiful places and beautiful costumes, plus as I have done before, especially from Zelah and Timothy.
