Tarzan and Sy Mate, the second of MGM's Tarzan photographs, count a year after the events of "Tarzan the Ape Man". Fortunately, Tarzan and Jane lived in the jungle, and Harry Holt (one of the first film expeditions) returns, this time accompanied by the inferior Martin Arlington, seeking the ivory from the tomb of the elephants. Of course, a variety of dangerous and exciting adventures take place along the way. <br /> <br /> The first movie made everything romantic - the jungle, adventure, romance itself, wildlife and even death. The second movie still has a lot of romance and lots of wonderful action sequences, but a more serious tone is under the action. The characters dare ask questions like: What happens if Tarzan happened? What would Jane do if she were stranded in herself in the middle of the jungle and had to work herself? Although it is probably the questions that real people will ask in this situation, it creates a degree of gloom that is not always as fun as the original-to-wind governor. <br /> <br /> One of the most enjoyable aspects of this movie is the growth we see in Tarzan and Jane's relationship. Tarzan speaks a lot of English, but he clearly learned some new words from his partner. In addition, their love for each other really bled, and we feel they have spent a year together in the jungle. <br /> <br /> Most people consider "Tarzan and his partner" better than the original "Tarzan the Monkey Man". Personally, I liked the first movie a little better. The main reason is that the relationship between the Harry Holt & Martin Arlington team is not as good as Holt's relationship with James Parker (Jane's father) of the original. The Mr. Arlington character could have worked as a big movie killer, but he plays the hero for far too much of the movie. The movie can never decide whether we want it or hate it. (I also don't want to give anything away, but in one of the screens where we should clearly hate him, Jane never finds out about the events, so the end isn't quite as satisfying as it could have been.) All these opponents However, it is relatively small, and it is still a good movie. <br /> <br /> Like the first movie, Tarzan and Sy Mate have wonderful action scenes, wonderful game material and one of the screens all-time greatest romance. If you liked the first movie in the series, it's definitely a sequel to watch.
