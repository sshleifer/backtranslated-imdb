De Sica became one of my favorite directors, but this one was a hit and miss for me. A ludicrous idiot youth becomes the leader of a community of illegal settlers in a deserted area outside Milano. It is a detailed and sparkling story of the innocent poor, complete with evil capitalists and faster happy police. But it slowly develops into a magical fantasy story, as the boy is wondering that Toto is developing unlimited superhero powers. I had it with the ever smiling Toto after ten minutes, and when the magic took over, I left in the dust. There were so many beautifully orchestrated shots, so many good characters among the settlers, that I kept thinking it was a waste. The film was no longer serious about its material. The link between neo-realism and fantasy is more like an experiment of the "see-what-we-can-do-ma" kind as a fully developed piece of work / art.
