... but I enjoyed this show anyway. I read some of the comments that previous reviewers had to say about this show, and I have a hard time completely destroying all the criticisms in my own head (except one: the show was naughty; this program was ANY but anniversary ). Many of the things people do with this exhibition are on the money: pretentious; forced; overwrought; Desperate for attention; self-satisfied; annoying narrative. But you know what? I really liked it. It was different, it was original, it really did have TRIED; and it made for all the minuses. The show was bright, verbal, fast, witty, interesting, fun to watch ... you know, it was only once a week, I could take it once a week and look forward to it and enjoy it. I'll mourn her past. But I think nobody will bring it to life again.
