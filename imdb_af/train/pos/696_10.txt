Surprisingly well done for an independent film, An Insomniac's Nightmare paints a spectacular picture of what it would be like to suffer from insomnia. Wonderfully well written and directed, it creates the atmosphere of a dream, as the viewer is taken into the life of a mess through one night. <br /> <br /> With Dominic Monaghan as Jack we see everything he sees as the long hours of a lonely night trek. The narration is almost hypnotic, and some of the opening lines are impossible to turn away. Fascinating and slightly disturbing, it shows how someone with a lack of sleep balances on the brink of common sense and insanity. <br /> <br /> Turning around and turning around every corner, an Insomniac's Nightmare is extremely challenging and engaging. It is highly recommended.
