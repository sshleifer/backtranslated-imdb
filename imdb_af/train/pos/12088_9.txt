Hardcastle and McCormick are a great TV show. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's predictable, like The Dukes of Hazzard, Hunter, The A-Team, etc. etc. <br /> <br /> This show is just good clean television. The relationship between Hardcastle and McCormick is quite amusing. They regularly take an episode to each other, adding a lot of humor to the show. It contains almost every episode several car jacks, but who doesn't enjoy a good car hunt? Especially at the Coyote! <br /> <br /> I just wish they had clean television like this today, I highly recommend it!
