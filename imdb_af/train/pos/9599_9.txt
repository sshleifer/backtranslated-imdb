I watched this movie at the Santa Barbara Film Festival, and there wasn't a dry eye in the house. It's amazing not only to see what a great person Darius is, but how admirable the rest of the team is and at such a young age. <br /> <br /> It also made me think how disgusting MTV was, and how to get an opportunity to engage and inspire positively, they refused. Show you if they really care about the youth and their viewers. <br /> <br /> It's a wonderful and hearty story of true story ... Take your tissues, but it's great to see how caring and inspiring youth can be today.
