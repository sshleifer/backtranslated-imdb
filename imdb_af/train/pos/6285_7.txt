What's in a name? If the name Jerry Bruckheimer expects it to be filled with action. <br /> <br /> In producer Bruckheimer's latest movie, Gone in 60 Seconds, it's about the name. With character monkeys like Kip, Sway and The Sphinx and cars that have been individualized by names such as Diane, Sue and the elusive Eleanor, it's just the non-stop action that keeps you from just playing the game. <br /> <br /> Not a deep manuscript, but it is a great tool for action like Nicolas Cage, such as Memphis Raines, along with Angelina Jolie and Robert Duvall, coming out of his job retirement to his brother's save life by stealing a list of 50. exotic cars in one night. A repetition of the 1974 cult hit, this movie may not be destined for the same cult status, but it is entertaining. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, it's the action that keeps you from watching the scene. Although loaded with stars, none of them has an outstanding performance, including a very poor performance by one of my favorite up and coming, Giovanni Ribisi. Even Jolie, who comes from her recent Oscar victory, is just a sign of love interest with virtually no screenplay. <br /> <br /> Can a series of beautiful cars and caravans get involved in a good movie? I think so. The film is a pleasure to watch and although one particular scene takes you into the kingdom of unbelief, the action is uninterrupted and the tension is compelling. Just be careful of other drivers fighting for a pole position while leaving the theater. <br /> <br /> 3 1/2 out of 5
