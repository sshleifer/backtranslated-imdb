It's a good movie I don't think, get enough credit as Saturday night fever or Smear in John Travolta's career. He plays a man who falls in love with a girl but is too shy to acknowledge her feelings. Instead, he wants to get involved in mechanical bullying because he thinks it will show his masculinity. Although it was made in 1980, it is still timely today. The great country music soundtrack is great. 10/10
