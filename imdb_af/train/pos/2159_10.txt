Firstly, there is no way the remake can be so good, because Japanese society is very different from ours and plays such a big role in this film, as explained in the opening story. It adds to the humor as well as the warmth of this movie. There are many different supporting characters / personalities. Everyone is part of making this movie wonderful. This movie is full of comedy which in any case is not vulgar like most of today's "brutal comedies." Still, you can still laugh out loud. The reality is in real life, you don't have a choice of who you work with or go to school with ... etc. This film really highlights it and shows that natural things in humans can overcome small differences. Not to mention, it makes for a great sub-plot and lots of humor. It's a story about dance that actually has a story, and a good one about it. There are some retreats that aren't out of place, but actually support the main story. Actually a well written film. The dance is also good. I'm a fan of any movie with any kind of dance, for that aspect. However, this film goes beyond any other with dance, in the fact that it is a story. First, it is just about dancing in Japanese society. Highly recommended. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10.
