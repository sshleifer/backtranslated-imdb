Since musicals have both been out of fashion and are incredibly expensive to make without all the talent needed to make one under contract with a studio, I doubt we will ever get a real story from Enrico Caruso. <br /> <br /> But if everything was in place, it was no coincidence that no Hollywood studio had tackled the task before Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer under contract Mario Lanza. No one else could have done it, I doubt it will ever be tried again. <br /> <br /> And why should it. I think Enrico Caruso himself would have been happy about how his song was portrayed on the screen. For his voice was his life, his reason to be on earth. <br /> <br /> To say that freedoms have been taken with his life is to be modest. Caruso, like the man who portrayed him, was a man of great appetite, but with much more self-discipline. He had numerous relationships with several women and had two illegitimate sons who are not in this movie. <br /> <br /> His contribution to the recording industry is being treated as almost an afterthought. He was shown to a recording studio once in his life. In fact, he started registering right around the turn of the last century and along with Irish tenor John McCormack for RCA Victor, the recording industry made it. <br /> <br /> When Caruso and McCormack were up, you almost had to inherit a ticket to see that one of them was alive. But many immigrants Italian and Irish families had a phonograph and a record or three of one of these men. That's why both became legends. <br /> <br /> What the movie has been is a beautiful educated operational arias done by Mario Lanza, a taste of what he might have become if he were the discipline of a Caruso. stick to the opera. The Great Caruso won an Oscar for sound recording and won nominations for costumes and set designs. <br /> <br /> Mario himself helped to popularize the movie with an RCA Red Seal album of The Great Caruso songs. Unfortunately, due to contractual obligations, we couldn't get a real cast album with Ann Blyth, Dorothy Kirsten and Jarmila Novotna. <br /> <br /> Although Blyth sang it in the movie, Lanza helped a big hit of The Loveliest Night of the Year further popularizing the Great Caruso. <br /> <br /> Looking for a life of Enrico Caruso is not. If you are looking for a good artist who sings during his career, you should not miss the Great Caruso.
