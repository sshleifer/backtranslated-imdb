Doctor Feinstone is a dentist. He has a beautiful wife and a large house with a swimming pool. He discovers that his wife is with the swimming pool doctor. He realizes that everything is clean behind. His patients are being tortured. ... Corbin Bernsen is brilliant as the corrupted dentist - he is completely credible. There are surprisingly few, but the scenes of dental torture are rather nasty and grotesque. Highly recommended. "The Dentist 2" is also worth checking out!
