If Arthur Askey's thought turns your mind off, don't worry, you can still see and love the Ghost Train, like the equally wonderful Back Room Boy, it's just a damn movie to be sunk by. a single performance, even that of the main actor. Personally, I like Askey, maybe it's because I'm in his world, rather than unreasonably expecting me to come into mine, which is a mistake that makes too many people. The ghost train is so intense atmospheric that you could not see it, without being surprised by the deep, dark world you are transporting to it, it is immersive in a way that few inexpensive and cheerful flag-bearers have succeeded early '40s and it's a movie I can imagine that few people have ever watched once. The role-play is exceptionally good, maybe Linden Travers lies a bit thick, but against the backdrop of a lonely railway station in wartime, she can hardly play and not stand out. The unfortunate passing of the lovely Carole Lynne broke the last link we had with this amazing movie earlier this year and now it's really in the past, but wait patiently for us to play.
