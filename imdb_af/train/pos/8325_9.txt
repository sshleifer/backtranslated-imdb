I loved the idea of ​​this movie the moment I first saw a trailer. Einstein has always been one of my heroes and the image of him as the friendly, playful, slightly mad genius was enough to see me the movie. The extra spice of Matthau and Einstein made it even better. <br /> <br /> The story is pure fantasy, but beautiful. A car mechanic falls in love with a beautiful woman, who seems to be Einstein's cousin. With the help of four Fairy Godfathers of Physics, Ed begins a quest to win Catherine's heart. Throw a jealous fiancé (depicting the worst experimental psychology) and Eisenhower in the mix, and you have pure fun. <br /> <br /> The film is filled with great character and beautiful sweet and daffy performances. Walter Matthau plays Einstein as a naughty imp; cupid with a slider. Tim Robbins is great if Ed and Meg Ryan play a step above their normal rom com level. Stephen Fried is a delight as the "RRRatman" and Ryan's fiancee; who does not have a single romantic leg in his body. <br /> <br /> The movie has fallen under most radars, but it is a beautiful treasure that is not obsolete with repeated views. It features top-notch writing and performances and is a gentle treat in a less than soft world.
