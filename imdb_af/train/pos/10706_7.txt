This is a good example of a movie that is worth looking at despite its low rating. The story is tempting and it doesn't take long before the chemistry between Nicole Kidman and Ben Chaplin draws your attention. The acting is first class and the characters are well represented. Sometimes it feels that the director can't decide between drama and romantic comedy. Ben Chiller's depiction of the law lasting and shy English man with porn S.M. magazines hidden in the bedroom create many moments for the laugh! Just like the look in Nicole Kidman's eyes when she offers John his first taste of intimacy over a long time ... Other times, actors and especially Nicole Kidman give this comedy a dramatic spectacle.
