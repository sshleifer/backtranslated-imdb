I thought this movie did a good job. It wasn't as creative or original as the first, but what did it expect. It was a lot of fun. The more I think about it, the more I like it, and when it comes to DVD, I'm going to be very proud of the money, every last cent. Sharon Stone is wonderful, she is always, even though her movie is terrible (Catwoman) but this movie is not, it is one of those movies that will be underestimated for his lifetime and it will probably be a classic like 20 yrs. Don't wait for it to be a classic, watch it now and enjoy it. Don't expect a masterpiece or something to touch and soul to just let yourself out of your life and get involved with them. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie is entertaining and I recommend to people who haven't seen it, because what the critics and the box office say doesn't always count, see it for yourself, you never know, you can just enjoy it. I type my hat on this movie <br /> <br /> 8/10
