I thought this movie was very enjoyable. I watched this movie with my wife before I had my first child. That's why I didn't just consider it as family entertainment and enjoyed it quite thoroughly. Many of the reviews seem to indicate that this movie is not a landslide, there were no unexpected plot changes and the movie was predictable and boring. Of course, if these people look at this movie that expects them to have a religious experience, they will be disappointed. It's just an animated movie; nothing more. If you want to see this movie, just to sit back and entertain yourself, you won't be disappointed. Eventually, it's definitely not the best movie made by Disney, but it's entertaining and I don't understand the bad reputation it received.
