"Secret of the Lens" is perhaps a nice campsite everyday favorite of mine. The best and funniest of Kajawari Yoshiaki, who is known for plowing anime and sleazy hentai-ecchi anime. I wish he had done more like this. <br /> <br /> My favorite scenes are the psychedelic CG sequence, the parts where Lord Helumis blows his failed henchmen, the party riots that cause Bill (one of the funniest scenes) and when my favorite character, Worsle appears . <br /> <br /> Check it out. <br /> <br /> WARNING: This is not for serious sophisticated Anime fans!
