I just saw it at the 2003 International Film Festival in Vancouver and it was funny like hell and a little surreal. Occurs in Toronto, where these two losers live in this downhill home in the middle of a highway system. David Hewlett (PIN, CUBE, CYPHER) and Andrew Miller (CUBE) are as good as the two losers who want the world to go away. The acting, dialogue and writing are great, and the whole movie looks good for such a low-budget movie. Director / Author Vincenzo Natali was present at this show, and he was so intelligent and down-to-earth. This man is so resourceful with these wonderful stories that work so well within small budgets, this puts huge budget Hollywood crap to shame!
