I love this movie. It's funny, funny, violent, surreal, played in a crazy head, and certainly not your usual comedy. <br /> <br /> If you don't find the movie amusing, I think it's just not for your taste, so it's hard to write a review. <br /> <br /> For reference, Some other comedies I love are The Big Lebowski, The Princess Bride, and Zoolander (the one I just had the second time). There are others, but my taste is definitely for the unusual, and I'm willing to accept that most people just don't tend to keep that kind of thing. I do not apologize for an unusual sense of humor. At least I have one. <br /> <br /> The scenes and characters of this particular movie are good together, the verbal humor is hilarious, the situations are intriguing, the acting is very good (as you would expect from the cast), although the acting claims what is made by the screenplay by the script is not particularly high. The overall package makes for fun, funny, alert but violent entertainment.
