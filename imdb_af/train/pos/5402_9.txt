Hitokiri (which is roughly translated as an assassination), a / k / a "Tenchu" translated roughly as "divine punishment", shows Hideo Gosha at the top of his form. Don't miss this one, or Gosha's other classic, Goyokin! Not just one of Gosha's best films, Hitokiri is one of the best samurai / chambara movies ever made, and perhaps one of the best Japanese movies ever performed. <br /> <br /> Be warned, all the complicated Plot details in Hitokiri can be a bit difficult to follow for those who are unfamiliar with the Japanese history of the 19th century. Yet the underlying human drama is clear and open to all viewers. As per the Gosha norm, Hitokiri offers another variation on its traditional theme of "loyalty to the gentleman" versus "doing the right thing". However, Gosha develops his favorite theme with so much sophistication that it's really the movie to watch (along with Goyokin, of course). <br /> <br /> I suppose it breaks as follows: If you want a simpler, more action-oriented story, you might see Goyokin. However, if you want a more thoughtful, overall dramatic drama, see this one. <br /> <br /> (OK, OK, essentially, the historical background is a massive leap of power between many different Samurai tribes who either work (1) to reform, but retain the Tokugawa Shogunate, and (2) those who are trying to install the emperor Meiji as the supreme ruler of Japan. Of course, those clans working for "Emperor Meiji" were less interested in the "reform" of Japan than their own clan in the "new world order" Ironically, the entire feudal system has been officially abolished as one of the first reforms of the Meiji government, which are ironic twists like this - Gosha's great irony - making the whole plot bittersweet. > <br /> What distinguishes "Hitokiri" from Gosha's other movies is Gosha's adult sense of cinematography. Each shot is well crafted, and (like Kubrick's Barry Lyndon), every frame of the movie can hold its own as a silent composition. Of course this is typical Gosha. Hitokiri really stands out with a beautiful backdrop, including (as in Goyokin) many sounding sea areas. Just look at the opening order and you're addicted! Don't make a mistake, it's not an English period: Hitokiri is extremely violent (don't say you're not warned). <br /> <br /> What else, except cool camera work, makes Hitokiri out? The performances look (for me) a little more subtle in this one. Katsu Shintaro (from Zatoichi / Hanzo the Razor celebrity) is in a star performance than the confronted protagonist / antihero, Okada Izo. Katsu manages humanity to a character that looks more like wild animals than villain. Throughout the movie you are never quite sure if you are engaged or raised by Okada's character. At the same time, Katsu's portrayal of Okada's cruel hunger for respect, and its later pathetic redemption efforts, seem so humane that you can't help but feel empathy / sympathy. Of course, after Nakadai Tatsuya saw the tortured hero in Goyokin, it's good to see he play such a ruthless villain in Hitokiri. He's just perfect, there's nothing more to say! <br /> <br /> As a final note, perhaps more interesting to be buffs than accidental fans, don't miss the last screen appearance of Mishima Yukio not right-wing ultranationalist novelist who herself committed suicide for the Japanese crowd military personnel he abducted in 1970. He had a film about his life and work by Paul Schrader. It's actually a good job to make the honorable (for an assassin) Shinbei Tanaka.
