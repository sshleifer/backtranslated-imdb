I looked at Cold Case because of the real life experiences depicted. This one was very close to me and touched me deeply, so beautifully handled, thank you, Merideth. All the characters are well-developed 3D especially Coop. The material is still difficult to approach, the US is far behind the developed countries of the world. Only this kind of honest real-life experience and treatment has an impact on the population. Of course, not everyone sees the same things, but I am cordially told that 3/4 of the men who interviewed 30 people chose the same as 10. You reach the tough one - I'll keep the best episode forever. "Place for this episode. Please continue with chances and thank you very much.
