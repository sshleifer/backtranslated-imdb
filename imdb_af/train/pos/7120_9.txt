Most of the war films made in the US during World War II were great to watch, but suffered from serious gaps in realism because they were produced more for propaganda value to increase spirits at home than anything else. I don't beat these movies, as many of them are still awake. But because they often do not have realism, they are prevented from being really good movies. A perfect example was the John Garfield movie air force - in which a B-17 took almost half the Japanese air force almost one-handed! Pride Of The Marines, however, is a welcome departure, achieving high marks to depict a true story in a fairly accurate manner. When I first saw this movie, I thought it wasn't a real story, because it was too unlikely to be true. However, after investigating further, I found it to be true of the incredible story of two men who have done so much to earn the Medal of Honor. This is one case where real life was too incredible to be true!
