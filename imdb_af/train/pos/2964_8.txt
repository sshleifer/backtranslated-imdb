BASEketball is a very funny movie that delivers drama, which usually makes the movie a lot more funny, comedy material that is more than a shit in your pants, and a pretty good plot despite being the classic slackers. the evil rich man. And the only thing I didn't like about BASEketball was that that kid wasn't really in the movie, but if the kid wasn't in the movie, some of the funny scenes wouldn't have existed. If you have read any pro reviews about this movie, they all exclude because basically all the judges didn't like this movie. BASEketball is a great comedy that everyone gives what they want.8 out of 10.
