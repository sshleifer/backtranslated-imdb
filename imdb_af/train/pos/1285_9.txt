Frustrated Deputy District Attorney George Maxwell (a good performance by George E. Carey, who also produced this picture) can no longer stand his nightgown, cute wife Edith (a perfect bitchy Anne Bellamy). Worse still, poor George is having a newborn baby sun and a capricious lesbian teenage daughter (greasy brunette Sheri Jackson). George has an adulterous fling with a beautiful, seductive and generous swing hippie babysitter, Candy Wilson (beautifully played with sexy aplomb by nice blonde knockout Patricia Wymer). Complications occur when George finds himself caught by bitter Julia Freeman (a beautifully poisonous twist by Kathy Williams). George wants her psychic bachelor Laurence Mackey (a frightening Robert Tessier, who is here to jail.) Director Tom Laughlin (Yep, the same man portrayed by Billy Jack!) Excessive glamorous feminine nudity, sober softcore sex and cruel violence, as well as making the whole game uncomfortable with the 60's youth culture and connecting the plot in a stiff 75 minutes run, ensuring that this movie doesn't welcome her A particular highlight is when Candy invites her coarse friends over the Maxwells House for an impromptu basement, with smokers, smashing rock music, and of course hot naked guys, Robert O. Ragland's funky score hits the gnarly place. Fox's sharp black-and-white cinematography adds an extra eager edge to the cruel, messy action, best of all, this movie is a wonder same showcase for the extremely charming and curious pixie Patricia Wymer, who positively lights the screen with her sweet, vibrant personality and captivating beauty. A total trashy treat.
