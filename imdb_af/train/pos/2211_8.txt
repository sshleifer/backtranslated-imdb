I don't watch much TV, except for the office, weed, entourage and e! S soup. I think I like this show in good company. <br /> <br /> I love exploring the pop culture that gives this show. Soup also helps me keep abreast of what people in the office are referring to when they talk about a Sanjaya or Heidi Montag (sp.). <br /> <br /> The best part is that Sop extracts from the highlights of these shows, which are usually the funniest or most controversial moments (see, most people are addicted to watching American Idol because of the freak show that the auditions are). That's why most people claim to look. And that means I don't have to suffer from the other 98% of these hidden talk shows or "reality courts" for one sober "funny" or "shock". The only reason Sop does not get a 10 is sometimes the sketches are not so funny, and in a rare event, the comments are not always on one another. But they can't all be homeless, or Soup wouldn't be on E. <br /> <br /> Joel's fast-paced white and Soup writing team (including McHale) makes for a great show. I enjoy the laughter and comments of the crew outside the camera. Even when they're blatantly obvious, it's hilarious because it's forced. Of course they are ironic. And that's part of what makes this show funny.
