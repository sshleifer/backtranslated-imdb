Again, it seems totally illogical to me, at least, that "Arthur" earns only 6.4 out of 10 possible. Steve Gordon's one-shot masterpiece is the totally "unlikely" if not quite "impossible" mention of many different elements. The fact that he succeeded in making alcoholism laughable rather than tearing tragically is in itself wonderful. That he gave Dudley Moore his best role, and every other movie element in it, his optimal impact, including the score, seems to me patent and egregious. I challenge ANYONE to put this movie and don't laugh out loud. But almost a third of his audience apparently succeeded. Well, I found Gordon's effort, ridiculous and loving, and the facilities of Geraldine Fitzgerald's great aunt and Stephen Elliott's murderous father-in-law absolute jewels of background characters. Even the black driver managed to escape dismissal, and late sniffing Sir John Gielgud was ready to accept his fee, but wrong to fulfill his role. "Arthur" makes no attempt to "under-tooth," much less rationalize, the plague of "alcoholism" (hey, iFit is not drink, these are other drugs of choice, including meth, and addictions are merely symptoms, not targets) see simply in his own crazy way.
