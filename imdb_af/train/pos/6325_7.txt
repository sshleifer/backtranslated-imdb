Not only is this movie entertaining, with excellent comic acting, but also politically interesting. It is made at the end of the Soviet Union, but divides the Soviet mentality through and through. The story is set in the early days of the Soviet Union, and it assesses the rationale behind the revolution in cultural and practical terms. Of course, by the late 80's and early 90's, the bizarre strings of Soviet society are already relaxed, but the ideology and mentality are still alive and ready and ready for some well-deserved deconstruction. Fortunately, all these deep philosophical comments are wrapped up in a funny and entertaining package! <br /> <br /> Jur
