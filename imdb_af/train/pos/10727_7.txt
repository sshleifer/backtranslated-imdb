This is a family movie, which for some people is an automatic switch off. It seems that too many people don't want to see movies that aren't loaded with the failure of arms and legs, free violence and enough scouts to fill the New York phone book. This movie is not one of them. It's clich√©, it's formula, but it's also fun. It doesn't ask you to think, it doesn't require you to accept the movie as reality. It's just what a good movie should do, that's two hours willing, and enjoy the adventure. The throw is good but not excellent. As another commentator pointed out, the John Williams sound was excellent as usual. And the fact that much of the film was shot in Huntsville at the real space camp made it even more credible. <br /> <br /> It was ironic that the original release of the movie was delayed for a few months due to the Challenger Shuttle disaster, which played a major role in the original theater opening, but the movie eventually helped to focus the dreams of many young people back into space and the possibilities that lie therein. So sit back with your children and prepare to enjoy.
