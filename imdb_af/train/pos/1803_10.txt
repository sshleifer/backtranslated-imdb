My dog ​​recently died, and it was a movie I loved as a child, so I had to see it to encourage. <br /> <br /> (Beware of Dog, I mean Spoilers.) This movie is not It's not just for kids and it's far from ordinary. It was established in 1939 in New Orleans. Firstly, the dog was not portrayed as an extra family member in this movie, but as an adult with his own intricate life. <br /> <br /> In the Beginning, Charlie is not too different from his dishonest and cruel business partner, Carface. He is money-driven, greedy, and just shot dead, as he calls in the beginning of the function. The difference between Charlie and Carface is that Charlie can learn and be willing to listen to others; Anne Marie and his sidekick, Itchy. Carface won't even listen to the thick, ugly dog ​​with the big glasses closest to him. <br /> <br /> Carface is trying to kill the hero because he wants 100% of the profits in their business and will not only get 50% - a highly unusual way of dying a German Shepherd mix. It is also eaten by a prehistoric size alligator that eventually saves your life because you can sing, highly unlikely whether you are a dog or not. It's a cartoon and that's why it's logical here. <br /> <br /> Carface's method of revenge is by murder, while Charlie believes success is the best revenge, financial success it is. After surviving death, he began using a business through Carface's finance source, a highly talented girl who has the ability to communicate with animals. They win a lot of games, and Charlie tells her he will give the money to the poor. Tip: Charlie and Itchy live in a junkyard and are therefore poor. He uses the money to his casino / bar / theater, and not the other "poor". The reason Anne Marie has the ability to talk to animals is that she has compassion and she listens well. She teaches Charlie ethics by showing, lying and stealing his gambling. Charlie tries to fix it by buying her dresses. She added the ethics that his business needed while Charlie did the management, and Itchy provided construction. <br /> <br /> Carface uses violence and property damage to tear Charlie's business, which is unprotected by government. Charlie loses everything and everything he has left is this little girl. In the end, he had to choose between her life and his own. He first grabs the safe from self-preservation and puts it down when the girl starts to sink. Both the girl and the watch were sinking, and he had to choose which one, and he chose the girl. <br /> <br /> Much of this movie focuses on a person's ability to learn in time. and a child's ability to handle the natural appearance of the death of their pet is to never let anyone die! The watch symbolizes his life, and the watch seems to be submerged and stopped. All the deaths were suggestive, even to the villain. I haven't cried so far in this movie, and I got so much more out of it that I had to write it down and share it with you.
