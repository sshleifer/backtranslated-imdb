Brilliant adaptation of the great interior monologues of Leopold Bloom, Stephen Dedalus, and Molly Bloom by Joseph Strick to recreate the innovative portrait of Dublin on June 16, 1904. Blood day - a day to celebrate. Bravo director Strick, scriptwriter Haines, as well as director and filmmaker in creating this masterpiece. Gunter Grass's novel The Tin Drum filmed by Volker Schl√∂ndorff (1979) is another fine film adaptation of interior monologue that I favorably compare to Strick's film. <br /> <br /> While there are obvious Dublin landmarks in the original novel And in the movie there are also recognizable characters, though with different names in the novel. For example, Buck Mulligan with whom Dedalus lives, seems to be a prominent Dublin surgeon. <br /> <br /> This film for all its excellence is made even more rich by additional views. <br /> <br /> June 15, 2008 Brian invinoveritas1@AOL.com
