Made in the same year as "Vertigo", it is an equally staggering movie, but in a much lighter vein. It's in an enchanted New York in winter: Kim Novak is a witch who throws a game over James Stewart, but is rather trapped. The interesting side light is that Novak's rival is played by Janice Rule, who played the part of Madge in Picnic on Broadway (the part that Novak would make famous on film).
