This movie is wonderful for several reasons. Harris takes a very uncomfortable documentary and makes it a relevant social commentary. Groovin 'Gary is a small town child (supposed) very much loved for his many impersonations. When he decides to play Olivia Newton John in a local talent show (for whom he is very passionate), Gary's actions show he is in conflict with the conservative social environment in which he lives. This causes him several justifications for his actions so that people will not think he is actually a transvestite or other social publisher. In the second installment, Harris uses the battle between Gary and Beaver in a beginner's attempt to make a story from the original documentary. The third and final installment for the trilogy is truly wonderful for Harris's extreme sensitivity to the subject. Unlike the second installment, "The Orkly Kid", Gary shows up as a real upset. He struggles to get acceptance within his own community. His mysterious passion for dressing like Olivia Newton John even divides him from the people who already see him socially. The film is portrayed so realistically that it lends itself to many responses like reality. Certainly, one can see Gary as a ridiculous pathetic character, but can also identify with him as an obliterate.
