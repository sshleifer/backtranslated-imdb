There are moments in the movie that is so terrible, your teeth hurt. But to know that there were only a few weeks left for the Code movies to be harmless and soft, Paramount raced it into production before innuendo and style lessons came. Vanities are so horribly anti-feminine that it's nice. As Kitty Carlisle sings, women are shown with price tags insulting a Bronx hooker. They come from mussels (cut, cut, cut, cut) in postures of absolute submission. Minions of the law, so stupid, they can't get the door, get to look up their skirts and snicker. Barefoot girls are uncomfortable in giant cacti (Can they be a source of hallucinogens, perhaps?) While listening to "Sweet Marijuana" and watching blood fall on the chest of a choryn. <br /> <br /> Sure, Carl Brisson learned his lines phonetically and doesn't seem to have any idea what he says. But it's all worth it, as Norma is steeped in the show while no one is watching. <br /> <br /> The moment of this fragile fluff takes the point of the whole exercise seriously. Join it now with a NU charter and prepare to justify the entire Hollywood machismo slide between body blisters. <br /> <br /> At the same time, Toby Wing is the icing on the cake. And Duke Ellington doesn't hurt either. <br /> <br /> One has to walk to the Memory Lane.
