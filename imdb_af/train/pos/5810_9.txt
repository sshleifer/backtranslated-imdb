Mr Michael Jackson is an artistic phenomenon. His short movies, that is, music videos, are simply the best. I don't care if I get a healthy sci fi function from this guy, but I care to get a medley of his crazy dancing, screaming, cool crowd choreography, and some bits of CGI and animation. There should also be some uninterrupted videos. Everything I mentioned is here. Stupid plot and over-the-top "vanity justify" is not a problem when I witnessed Mr Michael Jackson in action. For me he will always be the ultimate king of music videos (not the "king of pop", which sounds moronic, especially to us, Russians, because "pop" sounds like the Russian word for "asses" and MJ is definitely not " king of asses "). I can watch his best music videos again (which are artistically beautiful) and I never get tired of them. <br /> <br /> My first impression of this movie was "What is it ...?" (pieces of different videos, some drawn images, disturbing jumps from one theme to another, the absence of a coherent plot line, some kids moving around, etc.). But if I looked at it to the end, I could say it was wonderful and really nothing like anything else shown on television today. What I also like here is that it never shows harmful material and can easily be watched by children. <br /> <br /> Michael Jackson would be very poor in the music videos. Even the best classic videos of other artists cannot come very close to the energetic hyperbola of MJ musical insanity and artistic quality. He knew how to get the audience from different ages and he knew how to keep a man with moral principles. <br /> <br /> When I get a proper DVD release with Mr. Watching Michael Jackson videos, I know it should be earned. even if some tracks have already appeared in another previous version. "HIStory I", "HIStory II" and "Moonwalker" are all fantastic, but only "Moonwalker" is more like one movie (with a solid "Smooth Criminal" theme, "paparazzi" topic and some strange spoofs and twists). <br /> <br /> Not to be a fan of MJ, I can still give this "movie ... like no other", a sturdy 9 out of 10 (I've been hit by Smooth Criminal for sure) and my Big complaints are the following: Initial segments of the movie could have been dropped while the main "MJ anti-drug campaign" had to get more "shooting-mad insanity and tension" and of course there had to be more "moonwalking". Thank you for your attention.
