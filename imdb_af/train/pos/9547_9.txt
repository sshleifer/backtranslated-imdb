This movie is the first movie experience for several people in the cast. All are experienced actors and have played in various TV shows and plays. Sahan Gokbakar is a well-known comedian in Turkey. It's strange to see him in excitement while at the height of his comedy career in Turkey. This film is Togan Gokbakar's first long shot and almost the first experience as a director.
