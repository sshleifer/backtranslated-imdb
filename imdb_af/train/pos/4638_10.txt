I saw this movie when I was in Israel in the summer. My Hebrew is not fluent, so the captions were very useful, I did not get lost at any point in the movie. You tend to get used to subtitles after about 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> This movie blew me away !!!!!! It depicts two of the most prominent Middle Eastern taboos today: a homosexual relationship between an Israeli and a Palestinian. It allows a person to enter both contexts of the conflict simultaneously. The dilemma, the emotions. The movie climbs into a tragedy when anger and anger drive one of the lovers to one extremist side! an absolute must see !!
