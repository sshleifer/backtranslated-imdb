This documentary version follows the lives of Big and Little Edie Beale, a mother and daughter, who lived as resluses from their mid-1950s to the end of the 70s in their family home in East Hampton. By the time the filmmakers find them, the house falls apart, and the women, one 78 and the other 56, share an awkward room. The older Edie Beale is the aunt of Jackie Kennedy Onassis and the younger is her first cousin. The women were originally evicted from their home because of his apostate condition, but Jackie sent them money for repairs so that they could stay there. <br /> <br /> Sometimes this movie can be exploited, since no woman seems to be in the best of mental health, but at other times the movie is hard to watch. "Little" Edie blames her mother for her current condition, and her mother burns back that Edie will never be the success she thought she was. "Little" Edie often trapped in the past, focused on choices she made decades ago, and likes to show photos of her youth, where she was clearly a beautiful debut. Her mother looked more thankful for her fate, to live out the rest of her life in terrible circumstances. There are definite hints of the glamorous life that both women led, of the pictures a happy family shows, to the great portrait of the older Edie next to her bed. From what we see from home, most of the rooms are empty, the walls crack and fall apart, and "Little" Edie feeds on the attic for the racoons to rest. And of course there are many cats running around. <br /> <br /> In his heart this documentary is incredibly sad. Although no woman is particularly depressed by their fate in life, the villain in which they live is terrible. It is not clear whether there is even running water in the house, and you get the impression that they are essentially abandoned by their family. <br /> <br /> But as a documentary, the film is a wonder to watch and highly recommended.
