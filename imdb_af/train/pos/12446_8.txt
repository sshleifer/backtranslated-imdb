After hearing about Modesty Blaise before, but never reading a novel or a cartoon, my wife and I liked the movie a lot. It has, in a fascinating way, provided a good introduction to the character and her background. <br /> <br /> Although it has a few flick elements, it is much more an intimate game, excellently written. Unfortunately, this is also where a major drawback of the movie is revealed. An intimate game lives on the capabilities of its actors and unfortunately only half of the cast is delivered. While Alexandra Staden did an excellent job as Modesty Blaise, her counterpart Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau - like the villain Miklos - did not. Smiling his plot as if it were an extended toothpaste commercial, he failed to build an atmosphere of anxiety that would make the movie a masterpiece. The supporting role-play is similar in some way, from some stereotypical gangsters and conclusions to proper performances by Fred Pearson as Professor Lob and Eugenia Yuan as Irina.
