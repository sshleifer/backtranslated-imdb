There are two things I like about Elvira, and they're both bigger than she is and they keep them covered: her white and her talent. A movie is the best thing to show how funny she can be or how she recommends attention. Seems like a combined clone of Morticia Adams and Anna Nicole Smith, she inherits a distant family's estate only to discover that she really is the heir of the occult. The comedy in this movie is the best thing about it, but it could have been very scary and chilling. It is mostly a campfire with so many bad horror movie references in it, such as the riotous or the helmsman who walks out and stumbles on her heels. My favorite part is when she uses her wonderful endowments to break the chains that have locked her in the cemetery. The end is juicy sweet as if written by the Bradys, but the Las Vegas action at the end seems too eager for this type of movie.
