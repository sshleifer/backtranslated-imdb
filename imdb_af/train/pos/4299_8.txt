In your video store you can find this jeweler. <br /> <br /> The human condition in modern times LA. No exaggerated drama, just a collapse of events that can happen to any group of individuals over time. <br /> <br /> Help you understand the joys and despair of urban life. <br /> <br /> The direction and cut are top class. Cinemas and music are very much following the mood and situation. And the CAST !!! <br /> <br /> Excellent decisive and excellent acting. No one out of place or character. <br /> <br /> And it's NOT really as much a downer as you would expect. I gave it 7 out of 10. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen it, DO!
