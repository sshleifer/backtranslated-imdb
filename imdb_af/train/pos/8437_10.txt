*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** Well, since I'm a big H: LOTS fan, maybe I like the movie more than ordinary people want. However, this movie is still excellent. It had many surprises, and it added even more to the series. While I was sad that Bayliss had changed into a killer, the overall feeling I felt was satisfied.
