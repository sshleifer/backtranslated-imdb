Like the Jeffersons, Good Times was one of the classic American sitcoms never broadcast in the UK. It's not in the 1970s a decade where I haven't been born yet. <br /> <br /> But like most fans of the show, I watched a few episodes on You Tube, and then I loved it. <br /> <br /> The Evans family is led by James and Florida. Two parents end up trying to meet, and despite their lack of qualifications, encourage their children, who have their own aspirations in life to fulfill them and take their chances. James was the strict but loving father, who did not dare in the discipline of J.J. Michael and Thelma. While Florida, on the other hand, was a fair, friendly and considerate mother and loving woman, although in many ways equivalent to James, her attitude towards parenting and family values ​​from an African-American perspective. <br /> <br /> The kids were just as lively and entertaining as the parents themselves: JJ was an aspiring artist with a goofy personality and a crazy sense of humor, who would often wear colored outfits and who "DY-NO-MITE" catchphrase is so contagious and known as Arnold Jackson's "Whatchoo speaks" of Willis? " of Diff'rent Strokes. Michael was the smart alec, who became a lawyer, while sister Thelma had her own dreams and hopes. Her oral association with JJ was mostly hilarious, just like the love / hate relationship between brother and sister, played very well by Mike Evans and Bernadette Stanis. <br /> <br /> Over the seasons there were a few cameo performances, especially of Janet Jackson, Debbie Allen and a young Gary Coleman as himself! I actually prefer Good Times to say The Cosby Show, which was an 80's show, because a) I chose the Evans family about the Huxtables, both in terms of a) characterization and b) because I felt that it was serious and tackled difficult social issues in a way that resonates with many viewers. It was a comedy, but it was also a social commentary aimed at highlighting the lives of the working class, African Americans in the 1970s. The Cosby Show attempted to provide the mainstream audience in a candy coated way, as the Huxtables are portrayed as black people who easily associated themselves with an American American culture. We would associate Whites, while Good Times in contrast was much more 'edgier' and it was not afraid to address realistically themes such as drug abuse and child abuse. I actually found that while The Cosby Show might be fun to watch at times, it didn't have a bit of sassiness that Good Times had and made it cooler and cooler. <br /> <br /> The show saw the Shark during the last seasons, as it continued after John Amos's character, James died in a freak accident (in fact, it was known when John was releasing the good times well And so his character's death was written as it was on the show. Without John the show suffered and unfortunately it lost a lot of charm. <br /> <br /> Still, for a sitcom, Good Times typed all the right boxes. If they only showed it in the UK in the 80s. As is certain, as JJ would say, "YOU-NO-MYTH!" <br /> <br /> My rating: 8 and a half
