From life in (some) colleges. Of course, there are artistic licenses, but some of what you've seen in this movie continue in some colleges. <br /> <br /> I went to colleges in Southern California where the races were almost hanging around. It's funny because it's schools that have racial unity, equality, and so on. Want and I can honestly say it's there. But the thing is when the class smokes, or when they just keep waiting for the class, they (students) just seem to be moving around with people of their own race or ethnicity. Is it bad? Not really. Everyone needs a sense of participation. But like the school document of one of the schools I attended, I wrote about it, "we must all try to get along with other ethnicities and get to know them." Otherwise, you create your own segregation. <br /> <br /> Racism certainly exists in one of the schools I attended. One day somebody talked about some campuses about the glory of the Aryan race and had some of the racist organizations' symbols. Fortunately, nothing happened like the incident in the movie where the young Caucasian man went down and started shooting at a multiculturalist event. <br /> <br /> I can only hope and pray that nothing will ever happen. <Br /> <br /> So is "Higher Learning" too dramatic? Exaggerated? Can be. Is this the way you are down? It depends on where you went to or after school. The races where the ethnicities just hang around with their own do not happen. Minus the Hollywood exaggeration, the races came very close to my home.
