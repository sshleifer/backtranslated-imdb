In September 2003, Jonny Kennedy, 36, died. He had a terrible genetic condition, namely Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB) - which means his skin literally fell to the smallest. His body covered in bad sores and led to a final fight against skin cancer. In his last months, Jonny decided to document his life and death with filmmaker Patrick Collerton. The result was a film, the first broadcast in March, which was an exciting, confusing and challenging humorous story of a single man. The film was not a celebration of a full life. Produced and directed by Patrick Collerton and first shown in March 2004 The Boy Whose Skin Fell Off has become the most talked about documentary of that year. It attracted nearly five million viewers and to the screen, the public donated more than half a million pounds to Jonny's charity, DEBRA. A Jonny Kennedy Memorial Fund was set up to raise another half a million to ensure that Jonny Kennedy left a million pounds of heritage.
