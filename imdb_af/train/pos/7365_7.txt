I've touched it a lot as Spike and Heaton stay together through this movie not to say there's no betrayal on the way. I thought the chase was set aside. The relationship between the two was the foreground I think. I already guessed that there were such gay intentions of Heaton. My favorite scene had to be the little bit that Heaton and Spike held in the swamp and Spike walked off. I usually thought Spike wasn't coming back. I must say that if it wasn't for our film studies that teachers let us see, I'd probably never have seen it. Overall, I thought this movie was pretty good and I would recommend it to any person who is a fan of British made movies.
