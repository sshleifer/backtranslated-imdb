Peter Falk is a diverse and perfect actor. The movie is well written and the play looks like real life. For all Columbo's lovers, this is an excellent piece of work. Because it shows what a talent Peter Falk is. He does not play a detective, he plays a retired carpet seller. By the time the credits start rolling, you want to see it again. The interesting part of the movie is that the message will apply to every person who views it; the depth of his pertinence will be the only thing that varies. It is a pity that the liberals in Hollywood only promote smudge and skin because it is the type of film that people in the business should be proud of. It will be a good movie to change into a live play.
