This is my favorite movie ever. I watched it at least 10 times and I cry every time. My family advises me not to see it, so I won't shout. I think I love being a true story written by Antwone, just as much as I like the movie. In addition, the acting is perfect and the actors were perfect for their role. Denzel Washington is one of my favorite actors. But this is my favorite movie he has done so far. I took care of a little boy who was also born in prison. He was the most precious boy I ever met. He is now adopted by a wonderful family who fought for him for almost two years. I saw this movie while the battle was still going on and its future was uncertain and I am so happy that it is safe and loved. And I'm so happy Antwone is happy and has found his family. <br /> <br /> I'd like to know more about him and how it has been since his family. I just can't say enough good things about it!
