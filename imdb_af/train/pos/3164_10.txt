I can't believe we no longer have the 70's. I've had 8 seasons of the 70's show !! I absolutely love it !! I lie in bed every night and look at several episodes before going to bed. At the end of a long busy day, it is nice to kick back and have a good laugh before going to bed. I was so sad that they took the show off the air ... at least we still have the re-runs !! I hope and pray that they will come back with at least a reunion ... As maybe when Donna completes college and we finally see her and Eric is getting married !! Wouldn't be great !!! It will be even better if they continue for a few years!
