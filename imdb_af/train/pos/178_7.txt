"Protocol" is a hit-and-miss picture with Goldie Hawn as a bustling cockle waitress who saves the lives of a visiting Arab one of a murder attempt one weekend. The woman immediately becomes a celebrity and gets a new job for the US government. Will the corridors of power in our country's capital ever be the same? Hawn is excellent as usual, though "Protocol" is not as funny as her best movie "Private Benjamin". But it's still a good movie, and I laughed a lot. <br /> <br /> *** (out of four)
