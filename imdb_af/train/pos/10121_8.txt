While it's not as wild and out-of-way as some of Takashi Miike's later films, it's a very good crime drama. <br /> <br /> The basic story is the story of a policeman of the Japanese policeman with Chinese parents trying to pick up an upcoming Chinese gym. Complicating things is that his younger brother acts as the lawyer for the villain and his gang. The film is actually much more complicated than that with various complications that keep both things interesting and distract from the central narrative point. It is this complication and a one-hour loss in the film that makes it less than a good movie. (This is a very good one.) It is definitely worth seeing especially if you don't have a noteworthy pace. /> <br /> A word of warning, the violence when it happens, is explosive and nasty. There are also semi-graphic depictions of gay sex. If it's not your cup of tea, be careful. <br /> <br /> 7 or 8 out of 10.
