This movie is very well-behaved by virtually all the role-players, a gripping story with a cold end, good music and excellent footage without meaningful special effects. It is interesting to note that, like so much science fiction, its predictions for the future are unlikely to appear as early as suggested. This is not to say we are still out of the woods, but 2022 is of course too soon to be in this state. It shares this because of a fairly illustrious list of science fiction classics: "1984", "2001: A Space Odyssey (compares its space station with our International Space Station) and Isaac Asimov's" I Robot "(positronic brain had to be invented in the 1990s).
