Can't imagine a better movie than this <br /> <br /> Hey, before you all go "Chick Flick" on me. I am a very strong and male, Macho Man, who thinks it was one of the better movies of the past 20 years. <br /> <br /> The acting was great and the story was wonderful. It is wonderful medicine for the heart and soul. The acting could not have been better or the movie threw better. <br /> <br /> I knew that a good time that Mercedes Ruehl, along with Holly Hunter, Joan Plowright, Lady Edith Evans, Sissy Spacek, is one of the greatest actresses ever to appear on film. And of course, Cloris Leachman (also in this movie) can actually exceed me in the oblique magnum of her talent and the various roles she has seen over the years. That was at least an Amazing Cast. This movie was like a book you can't lay down, and when you've reached the last page, more ... more. I can't understand for my life why this movie here on the IMDb is only 3.9. <br /> <br /> The appreciation here is absolutely wonderful to me. Or maybe not. Perhaps I understand it so well and it makes me very sad. It makes me so sad that movies like "American Beauty" "Las Vegas", "Sexy Beast" and "Fight Club" ratings of the cards emit popularity when in reality they are at least an "R" rating ... R it for "garbage". Hey, I realize there are many different stories in this world for many different audiences, but this is a sad comment when this beautiful, powerful ... extraordinary, focused, directed and written film seems to be looked at. . <br /> <br /> Of course, it was also at the Academy Awards .... How sad. And how predictable. My summary is that if you want to see a powerful, happy, sad, beautiful story? look ..... prefer preferably this movie ...
