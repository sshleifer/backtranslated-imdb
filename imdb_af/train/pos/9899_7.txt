I have seen several victims over the past few years and have always found it a pleasant slasher movie with a strange sense of humor, but I never knew it was filmed in the UK and I never knew that actor playing Marty Rantzen. (Simon Scuddamore) commits suicide after the film is released. I think I saw it while watching it last night that the actors' phrasing seemed rather strange to Americans, and some of them were not very good at hiding their English accent. <br /> <br /> All that both are the story of the class night, Marty, who's joking jokes from his classmates, and one day, April Fools Day, he gets by one Caroline Munro (yes, " a teen) lured and humiliated big time on film. Of course, the coach catches the gang at work and they all get a powerful workout to punish them, but not before some of the guys abandon Marty a joint, which he tries to smoke in the chemical laboratory, but full of something that makes him sick and as he walks to the toilet, one of his classmates slips in and places a chemical that reacts with something that Marty mixes, resulting in a fire and spilling a butter nitric acid which leaves poor marty. burnt and very scarce. <br /> <br /> Ten years later, the same gang is heading for their class reunification at the good old Doddsville High, which is strange and inaccessible, but thanks to its ingenuity, they are able to come in and find the place seemingly abandoned ... except there is a room where a banquet and drink are laid out and so eat, drink and be naturally. Of course, they will soon die. <br /> <br /> The gang is knocked one by one by a figure in a master's mask, but can it be Marty? They don't know, they realize he's either working in a loony bin or IBM, they're not sure which one. But whoever it is, makes quick work of them. Especially nasty is the girl who takes a bath to rinse blood from her from one of her classmates whose innermost beating around her while drinking poisoned beer. She is the victim of an acid bath which I think was one of the parts originally cut in the tape version, as it was extra nasty when I watched it these days. I can be wrong, but I do not believe it was on the tape. <br /> <br /> Anyway, there's a bit of a spinning end, and it also contains footage that isn't on the tape, I believe. There was also a bit of the front nudity, but it was also cut out, but I didn't really see if there were other bits on this uncut version, probably so, but it's been a while since I last saw it has. <br /> Anyway, if you're a fan of 80's flashes, then grab the new release DVD because it's a fun little kid with a good atmosphere and feels like it. 7 out of 10.
