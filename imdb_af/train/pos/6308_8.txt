Foolish, hilarious, tragic, sad, inevitable. <br /> <br /> A team of off-and-out teams with an "experienced" rogue to raise themselves from their poverty. Great idea ... if you ignore the screwup factor. <br /> <br /> Nice to see that George Clooney makes something really funny for a change. The casting is perfect and the perceived standards are very high. Although it can be said that the motley crew are not new, I think this movie handles it in an interesting and unique way. Sufficient so that it stands out from what has gone before. <br /> <br /> Well done guys.
