This is the latest addition to a new wave of educational documentaries such as "The Corporation" and "Fahrenheit 9/11." The commentary is clear and uncompromising, just like the stunning film style of this well-crafted feature. The film succeeds in giving a powerful sense of how unstable our world is, taking speed to an environmentally sustainable future - speeding the frightening beauty of our quest for progress. <br /> <br /> Actually, a remarkable achievement to be seen by everyone who cares for the world we leave our children. Bravo! <br /> <br /> NB - this is also the only movie (of 8) at the Varsity theaters (Toronto) with a stick tag that reads ... "To arrange group shows please contact .... "... a further test for the popularity and importance of this jewelry. <br /> <br /> My bet ... an academic awards nomination for the best documentary. <br /> <br /> OB101
