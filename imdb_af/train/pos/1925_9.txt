It has to be one of the best comedies on television right now. It takes the pure sweet idea of ​​a show that revolves around a close family, making it a fairly realistic but funny representation of a typical family, with brothers and brothers and brothers, brat brothers, overprotective fathers and bimbo sisters . I'm almost surprised it's Disney! <br /> <br /> To his credit, '8 Simple Rules' knows a comedy and doesn't try to be anymore. Too many shows (eg 'Sister, Sister' and 'Lizzie McGuire') just think because his main characters are teenagers, then they have to tackle social issues and eventually lose their humor by getting too hard. This is a trap 'avoidance of 8 simple rules'; It has some problems (such as wiping out the school), but it does enjoy it while you are doing it. In fact, the only time it really was serious was understandable when it thoroughly dealt with the tragic death of John Ritter and his character. <br /> <br /> And I think, though John Ritter will be sadly missed, as he was the reason. The show made its point, '8 Simple Rules' can still do well if it remembers its humor and does not make Cate's dad a second version of Paul Hennessy.
