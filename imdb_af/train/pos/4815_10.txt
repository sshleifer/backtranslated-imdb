It's on my top list of all-time favorite movies! This is a fantastic and informative film. It was historically interesting and wonderful to watch! I thought Emily Blunt's performances were fantastic and Rupert Friend was a fantastic Albert, the best actor was chosen for Albert. The costumes were beautiful and the settings and scenes like the opera house were wonderful and detailed. I just loved it, everything! I loved the childhood scenes when she was "bullied" by John Conroy. And where her mother says she must step with an adult. Another one did the authors! They made this fantastic manuscript! <br /> <br /> It deserves the awards they received. (Oscar and Baffa for Sandy Powell, for costume design.) A BAFTA for Best Makeup and Hair, an Best Performance Academy Award, Best Performance in Costume Design, Best Performance in Makeup. Broadcast Film Critics Association Award for Best Costume Design, also nominated for Best Actress Emily Blunt. CDG for Costume Design Excellence for Film - Period.
