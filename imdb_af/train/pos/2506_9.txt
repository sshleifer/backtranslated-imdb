Moon Child was one of the more symbolic films I saw. What I really liked was the illustration of immorality / mortality, and the barriers and guidelines of life. The movie shows much of the vampire Kei that has the power of immorality and its benefits. Whether it's supernatural abilities or eternal life, that's what people usually want. Moonlight shows the pain and disadvantages of immortality, as the feelings of loss affect virtually all the characters, especially for the main characters Sho and Kei. The meaning of the title 'Moon Child' reveals when the film comes close to where it is clear that everyone is a moon that shines and leads others. I personality is as nice as the movie depicted. The film's weaknesses lie in some parts of the acting and special effects, as it made the film less authentic. The scene where character Toshi dies could have been more powerful and realistic if more authentic emotions were placed in the acting. Some scenes with special effects like rifle shots may also have been more authentic without making it look too much like an action video game. The sparks that came out of the guns appeared too fake and I think it could have been eliminated or fixed. Still, I think Moon Child should be a movie that everyone should consider watching. The symbolic ideas and images that the movie brings out will easily be accepted by everyone and may interest many viewers. It's quite a thoughtful film and also entertaining to watch.
