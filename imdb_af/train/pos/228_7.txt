"Convicts" is very much a third kind of movie. All the dialogue and character interaction that comes from it comes from the long devolution of a late southern day. And further, the life of his main character, Soll (Robert Duvall). <br /> <br /> This is the first collaboration of director Peter Masterson and author Horton Foote. Six years ago, they collaborated on "The Trip to Bountiful", a movie that almost resembles action packed over this one. Masterson is not necessarily a good director. In fact, he's just barely enough of this side. The slow pace leaves a lot of space for the movie Toyomichi Kurita, which penetrates the film with the right sense of fragile light and heat. <br /> <br /> Being essentially a filmed play, with little in the way of editing or affirmation, it all comes down to acting. As for me, there are no mistakes here. Robert Duvall and James Earl Jones, two of the best American actors (both born in January 1931), create characters that are truly real, not interested in anything but life. Lukas Haas, a young actor I was familiar with "Testament" and "Witness", plays a character much like his other early roles. He is quiet, withdrawn, slightly scared and sad, somehow. These are qualities that seem natural to him. <br /> <br /> Perhaps a title like "Convicts" is an insignificant service to this movie. This title, along with the opening scene, seems to be a picture of a much more western type of picture. If slow stage productions don't interest you very much, you'll also want to convey this one. Otherwise, this can be exactly the movie you wish they had more often. <br /> <br /> Enjoy.
