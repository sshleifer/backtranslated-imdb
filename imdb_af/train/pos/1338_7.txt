The year 2000 was a bad year for Indian movies due to lack of quality and imagination by film directors. Unlike Mohabbatein and Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai, nothing exhibited. CCCC had a lot of misfortune due to the financing of the film because it did not really know what the movie was about, good advertising and advanced ticket sales for the film around India and abroad. The only information given was that it was a thriller. The film was released in 2001 and the film was surprisingly good. The main plot is about surrogacy and is well handled. Salman and Preiti give a good performance where Salman doesn't actually take a shirt. Rani plays Salmans wife, but it is a slightly less demanding role compared to Preiti who plays prostitute who eventually becomes the surrogate mother. The three leaders confirmed, after Har Di Jo Pyar Karega, they had a solid screen and chemistry (apparently). Excellent, Salman Khan plays an important role in the film as a successful businessman and is sorry to be used as a wannabe comedian in his other films, as he is properly underestimated in the Mumbai film industry. of the films he chooses. Rani's character doesn't know Preiti is a prostitute to the end ... it is loved by her and the rest of the family ... the rest you need to find out, because it will ruin the movie if I told you. The songs are all well depicted, especially dekhne walon and the main title song. The other supporting actors are doing a minimal but fine effort as Salmans loving family. Abbas Mastan produced a hit and treated the film topic tactfully. I say it's going to look or hire what you prefer!
