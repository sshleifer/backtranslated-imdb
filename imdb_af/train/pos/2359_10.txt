I think if you ask most JWs if they want to expect a miracle because of their faith, they will find that they are not. I know I don't. What you'd rather find is that they believe the promises Christ made from a resurrection. So, even if the worst happens and we die while remaining on our integrity, Jehovah can fix it. <br /> <br /> It's really a simple question: is God really for you or does it just believe it? If he really is, and you trust him, you will follow his directions, no matter what the short-term outcome may be. <br /> <br /> I had a heart attack over a year and a half ago. One in my family was terrified when she saw the words "NO BLOOD" in big letters over my chart. I argued with her that if I were in a position that only a blood transfusion would save my life, would it be a good time to rage, the only one who could return me when the time came? She didn't find it. God is just not enough for her. Sorry. I wish she could have the comfort that gives a strong faith.
