Returning the Jedi is definitely the most action packed series, and is a good conclusion to the Star Wars Saga. With Han Solo being jailed by Jabba the Hut and the Empire, who is building a new star, the rebel alliance is confronted with an uphill battle on the dark side, and only our favorite heroes can break it down. <br /> <br /> The opening order, at Tatooine, we see Jabba's palace, a pit of slavery and scum, and a new home for Han Solo, like Luke and the gang preparing for his salvation, and with Luke's Jedi forces they have the edge. <br /> <br /> We also see a tremendous triple battle at the end. Han, Leia and Chewy fight it on Endor, desperate to protect the shield protecting the Death Star. The Rebel fleet, led by Lando, fights with the Imperial Fleet while waiting for the shields to go, and Luke has a final jump with Darth Vader. An epic end to a Classic Saga, and it's just the pace of the first two. <br /> <br /> 10/10
