Well, Tenko is without a doubt the best British television program ever, the performances, the directing, the decisive, the tension, the drama ..... everything is fantastic about it. <br /> <br /> Although the show fell a little later in his last season, this end-movie picked up the threads and carried a wonderful story for fans of the show and newbies. I can't recommend this movie anymore, find it and watch it. But I recommend watching the series first, because the first two seasons are even better than this fantastic movie. <br /> <br /> A striking (10/10)
