This film is definitely a strange love story. Although this film may not shout much, Nicole Kidman wears the film on its own. The rest of the wheelchair can be easily forgotten, although Ben Chaplin does a good job of Hertfordshire Life with shots from St Albans & Hemel Hempstead center depicting the true essence of the area. What looks like a regular episode of the popular British TV series "Heartbeat" will soon become an avid gangster escape action movie. Nothing truly memorable happens in this simple little movie and therefore ends up as pretty decent weekend entertainment. A good one to watch, and if you like the hero John, thirty is lonely something you might identify to identify in his character.
