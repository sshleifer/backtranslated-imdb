I am collecting at least a few people who watched TCM on Sept.2. If you knew Hedy had to change her name to avoid being associated with this movie when she was in the US. It was a big scandal and I think that the original release in the US was so crippled by the censorship that it was virtually incomprehensible. I watched because I have just seen a documentary about "bad women", actresses in the USA's premieres censorship set up early in the 30s. It looked to me as if they had escaped with more than Hedy's most "sensational" shots in "Ecstasy". In fact, Hedy looks positively innocent in this, according to today's standards, and it was nice to see her early pristine beauty. It was a nice, lyrical movie to relax. I love what it was: a simple romance. I watched it after I pre-empted it during a sleepless early A.M. I'd love to see the first release released for comparison purposes in the US.
