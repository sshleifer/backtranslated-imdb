I'm a pretty big fan of most of the movies based on Stephen King's books. This one is one of the most frightening and most memorable. <br /> <br /> I've just been looking for about the tenth time and I still find it heartbreaking as well as scary. <br /> <br /> The scene where Gage is on a certain collision course with the monster truck is one that stands out. And the "No Fair" spoken by little Miko Hughes near the end is a touch of brilliance. <br /> <br />
