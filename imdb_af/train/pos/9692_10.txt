I don't know who can find fault with a silly human and funny movie like this, with lots of delights for your heart. I enjoyed it every minute and guessed the end halfway through the movie - but it didn't disappoint me at all. It will not only affect your heart, but it is such a good family-friendly movie - we need much more like this!
