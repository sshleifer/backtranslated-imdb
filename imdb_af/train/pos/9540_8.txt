Most of the feedback I heard about Meatball Machine was pretty mixed. A couple even say they think it sucked. Well, for the people I say, get some f @ ckin imagination and go yourself. It was a very entertaining movie. <br /> <br /> The story begins with this mechanical error that somehow turns its hosts into this Gwar costume search, dodged Necroborgs. Ultimately, you learn that these mechanical flaws also attach a little parasite to you, which can then control your actions due to the hot wiring of your nervous system. Unfortunately, for two lovers of lonely young adults, they are crossing roads with the mechanical fault, and before you know, transformation takes place and blood is sprinkled. Is there a way to stop the transformation? Maybe a way to prevent this mechanical error? Why are the Necroborgs fighting each other? Can the two desperate singles express their feelings to each other and do the nasty things? Just one way to find out. <br /> <br /> Enter the Meatball machine. I was very careful because of the mixed reactions, but it was a great surprise. A few unanswered questions, some that sometimes acted and a slightly confusing end are the only weak points I can think of. Of the anime it feels, to become the parasites themselves characters, and even to the low budget feature, this movie becomes the right point much more than it misses. With a constantly evolving story that is interesting enough to ask yourself questions, mixed with cool makeup effects and bloodshed, it's one flick fan of bizarro / horror / Tetsuo / platter fans to watch. 8 outta 10
