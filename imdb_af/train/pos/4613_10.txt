This movie has one of the baldest plots I've seen. For me it is so wonderful! Fred Gwynne and Al Lewis are very good at what they achieved in the original Munsters series. While there was less slapstick, they still worked wonderfully together "comedies". I wish Yvonne De Carlo, like Lily, would have had more plot engagement. She showed that she could do comedy in the original series, but it was mostly wasted in this movie. This movie also stares at the big Sid Caesar, but unfortunately he has no interaction with Gwynne and Lewis. I think some better work could have come out of it.
