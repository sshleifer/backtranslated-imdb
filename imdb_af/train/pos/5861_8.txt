Overall, I totally agree with Ebert's review. In a sense, I feel I shouldn't even comment because it's so much a veterinarian's movie and I'm not a veterinarian (I was a resistor). The mistake is that Martha is poorly underdeveloped and does not act consistently. My guess is that Stephen Metcalfe himself is a vet and spent too little planning time on her character.
