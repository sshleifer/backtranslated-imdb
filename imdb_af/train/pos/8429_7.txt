A summary (though repetitive and rather didactic) analysis of exploitation and despair in a situation where there is no way forward, where the attempts to make yourself feel better by violating and laying down who is among you, the only option. But even here, in this wild desert of lost dreams and no future, not working, reaching out to something or someone to comfort and share with a simple act of love, give a little reward, even if it does only presently portable by reliving memories of the past. <br /> <br /> Although there is little real violence on the screen, it's a hard and brutal movie about the small disposition of repression (political and personal) that doesn't make for easy entertainment. Obviously it is based on a play, with a small role play, a broader expanding relationship with the general social and political environment, probably helping the film reach a wider audience.
