Director Brian Yuzna had an uneven career in the horror genre, creating masterpieces such as "Return of the Living Dead 3" or "Bride of Re-Animator", but at the same time he did terrible movies like "Faust: Love for the damned "or the mediocre" offspring ". He is apparently better in the seat of Producer, where his work Stuart Gordon's films are excellent. <br /> <br /> The Dentist is one of his fewer jobs as a director, but the low profile has the benefits of the film and his lack of pretensions makes it a very enjoyable experience. It tells the story of dr. Alan Feinstone (played beautifully by Corbin Bernsen), a successful dentist who one day discovered that his perfect life wasn't really as perfect as he thought when he discovered that his beautiful wife (Linda Hoffman) had a relationship with the pool boy. This event disturbs his mind and puts him in a deadly spree if he takes revenge on the world because he's so dirty. <br /> <br /> The point of departure is very well handled by Yuzna, as he takes us on a ride to Feinstone's day of revenge. What makes this movie different from most slashers is that we are not in the victim's perspective, we follow Feinstone because he is the main character. We see how he goes from a respected profession to a soul murder in a day. Yuzna manages to give the movie the exact amount of tension, but adds a good dose of dark humor that really helps the film. <br /> <br /> Most of the premise's success is a Bernsen's performance as Feinstone. At the same time, he can make you feel sympathetic and hate towards him, and the subtle humor his character has is another aspect that helps the film. The rest of the movie is not that good, and I think their sub-pairing will hurt the movie more than it should. A remarkable exception is Ken Foree, as the detective tries to catch Feinstone. While his portion is quite small, he does a good job with it. <br /> <br /> With a dentist as a killer, scams are expected, and Brian Yuzna delivers good SFX in the right amount. It's good to see that he doesn't go over the top as he usually does, and I dare say it's a highlight of the movie. It has nothing less and no more the exact amount of gore expected. Yuzna limited himself to his general excess and the result is good. <br /> <br /> While not under Yuzna's best-known films, I'd say it's one of his best. Sure, it's not classical material as its masterpieces, but it is a movie that is entertaining and never tiring or boring. It's a simple movie with a low budget, but for what it is, I think it shook. 10/07
