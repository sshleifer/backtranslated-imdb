It must be the best movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Combine stunning cinematography with beautiful acting and a gripping plot, and you have a masterpiece. <br/> <br /> Dog Bite Dog grabbed me at the edge of my seat during a few scenes, which were in tears in other horrors and drowned me in my own tears to the tragic end. <br /> <br /> The film left me deeply impressed. These are shockingly violent scenes that are sharply tilted with the gripping and soft love screens. The movie is not to be found, it's Cat III (nudity) rating; There is no naaktonele, and the 'love' scenes do not even include kisses or 'make'. <br /> <br /> The message this movie has presented to me? All people, no matter how violent or cruel they look, have a soft side. Edison Chen does a great job playing the part of the murderous Pang. <br /> <br /> I rate this movie 10/10. It's a must-see.
