Diagnosis Murder is one of the only programs I regularly watch on TV. The way all the main characters have something in each of the episodes makes it so different from today's performances where they focus on one or two people per episode and all are moved to the side. The way the brain's brain works is also so unclear that you never really know what it is, and if you think you're doing, you're wrong. Diagnosis Murder has tackled a variety of topics, not just. In the cases, but in each of the characters, personal lives. Everything about racism and adoption, terrorists and technology. <br /> <br /> Like old people? I'm 24 !! I don't think I can be classified as old. <br /> <br /> I just want to know when they will release all 8 seasons on DVD (not NTSC) so I can see them all in order. They seem to do so with many other programs of the same era, so they can get it fast!
