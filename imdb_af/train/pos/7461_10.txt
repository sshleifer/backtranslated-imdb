Comparable to Fight Club, The Matrix, A.I., Sixth Sense, among others. This film approaches the psyche in a way never before done. The first 30 minutes build an interesting love story between Diaz-Cruise-Cruz. The rest of the movie is good, confusing, you will choose more each time you watch it (I watched the movies to see it 3 times)
