When "Girlfight" came out, the reviews praised it, but I didn't come around to see it. I finally saw it when released on video and understood the glowing reviews. <br /> <br /> The movie opens in a high school in the middle of a ghetto. We are quickly introduced to student Diana Guzman (Michelle Rodriguez). She has a bad expression on her face, and any idea of ​​Princess we can get from this expression is soon confirmed when she comes into battle. As Diana gets into trouble here, we meet her dad, an aggressive type in his own right; Clearly, we can't blame Diana for her attitude. <br /> <br /> But then the movie really comes up, like a new thought in Diana's mind germinating: boxing as a way to escape this grim existence. Her older brother has already been boxed, but her father is unlikely to approve. Only Diana herself can decide what to do. <br /> <br /> Just the first few minutes I identified myself as being in a very gritty, non-Hollywood movie, but the short appearance of John Sayles in a supporting role. confirm this. Even before they come to any bokeh scene, you feel like you're facing the ugly life that Diana lives. And if they finally come to the main story of the movie, there is no return. <br /> <br /> All in all, I definitely recommend this movie. I will admit that using boxing as a way to show someone is trying to make something of himself has been a cinema for years, but I still think they did. a good job with it. In fact, this can have brought the genre to its mark. Very good. Too bad Michelle Rodriguez wasted herself in Hollywood movies after this one.
