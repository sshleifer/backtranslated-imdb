Robert Jannuci, Luca Venantini, Venantino Venantini, Alicia Moro (two stars from the City of Living Death. I wonder what Luca is doing today, probably a lawyer or something like Bela Lugosi Jr. or David Hennessey, there is a child from dark shadows, who wants to forget dark shadow. Anyway, in the Thorn EMI video there is no music about the opening credits ... but the music is great when it comes ... with the Italian movies the movies are not as good as the music ... my favorite scene is with the boy with the robot arm, followed by one-person Alien through the desert. Alien says why are you following me. Tommy answers because I like it ... Alien answers how are you going to tell Tommy West, then Alien says well, I'm going east. After a while, the theme that is playing in the background, Alien looks up and sees Tommy sitting on a rock and sitting on a pet hamster. Tommy looks up and tells Alien what has taken you so long ... I like this movie ... It touches my heart. The boy with the robotic arm needs a daddy and Alien is set up to be Tommy's father in the desert. . . Oh yes, they also need water. . . not the road warrior (MAD MAX 2), but a dull western / nude movie with a boy with a robotic arm and Alien and Trash and some other good guys with an average chick with an iron claw and CRAZY BULL that looks like Wez in the Road Warrior. . . On Sunday afternoons on Canal 57 (Philadelphia, PA) I will come home and find it. . . often. . . too often. Crazy about it. 10/10
