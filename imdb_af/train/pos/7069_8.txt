It was said that Deanna Durbin invented teens. This first movie was one of the best. The humorous story presented a beautiful 14-year-old Deanna, a little beauty with a beautiful voice, than the "Miss Fixit" in a divorced family. For plot summary, see other IMDb entries, but quickly Deanna and her two older sisters plan to go to Switzerland to prevent America from returning their father. With an excellent supportive role, especially Barbara Read and Nan Gray as the sisters, good direction and editing, the film succeeds even in the subsequent views. Deanna's three songs are only "Il Bacio" of the classical repertoire, but if she sings it in the police station scene, the film's place in history is assured. At least it was for this viewer who was beaten to both Deanna and classical music at age 15. One of the very nice things that occurs throughout THREE SMART GIRLS is the glimpse of the drunk that stretched his neck for a last look at Deanna as the police surprised him! One unfortunate consequence of the success of this film was that the following writers for Durbin vehicles were locked in the "Miss Fixit" theme that quickly became obsolete. Deanna never did herself. Her stature as an actress is more doubtful than her charisma, which she certainly had. It seems to me that, like many other movie personality, she has replaced "naturalness" for the histrionic ability she lacks. The fold worked well for 21 movies.
