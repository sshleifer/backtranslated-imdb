Obstacles seem to be one of the series that has been lost. After the transfer in the early 80's and one repetition, it has since been sunk without trace. It's a crying shame. <br /> <br /> I watched it originally when it was transmitted on Sunday afternoons in the Southern TV region and it was classic tea time. Although I do not remember much of the program, a few things are in my mind. Most important were the memorable titles. The sad flute music associated with the attempt to escape across an Eastern European border and the subsequent car accident (and the scene left me with a lasting love for Mercedes models as they used a Merc 200). Although not clear at the beginning, the solution to the series was in these titles. <br /> <br /> The plot of a young music student trying to unravel what really happened when he discovered he was adopted has turned and turned, but Barriers was a surprising 'adult' childhood drama. Benedict Taylor was excellent like Billy and it was a pity he didn't do much more. <br /> <br /> It was a quality drama, much overdue for a DVD edition and I hope I get the chance to remind me of it in the future. <br /> <br /> A popular memory from my childhood
