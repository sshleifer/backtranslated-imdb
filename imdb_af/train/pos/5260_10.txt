Yes, it can be goofy and may not look as funny as many high-budget comedies out there, but this movie is really hilarious when you really look. Tim Meadows always turned me off funny from the Saturday Night Live show. Every time he would do this character on the show, I burst to laugh. So after seeing it play on Comedy Central, I decided to check it out one night. All in all, I was very impressed with this movie because it wasn't meant to win Oscars or to be comedy of the year, but it entertained the Saturday Night Live fans who love the Ladiesman character. This movie is also packed with very high quotas for the coming year.
