I don't give a movie or a show ten very often, but this show touches a nerve in a way that has no other display. I found the whole series on mysoju.com and thought the prospect looked interesting so I looked at it. I was not disappointed with what I saw; I was moved. This story stays in front as the main characters move us through the screens. Koyuki's thoughtful Sumy Iwaya shows us human nature, as she wants to avoid problems. Nobody really wants to put their soul in front of a perspective partner. Instead, she replaces a man, played by a lovely Matsumoto Jun, as a pet. This pet is like any other creature we would consider a pet. The difference; He can return the same way, because Momo is a man, not a dog. Being treated like a pet, he responds to situations in which a dog can react. She spends time with the new boyfriend, Momo becomes jealous. That's when she realizes that her pet is not just a pet, as the sexual tension between the two becomes thick. Momo is a dance producer. Her thinking changes slowly as we begin to get a glimpse of his own thoughts. Matsumoto takes us from a character who is initially two-dimensional, up to two-dimensional when we see he is a dancer, to a three-dimensional character when we see him as a man starting as a man, not as a dog no. In my opinion, it is worth looking at this story just to develop this character. Plus Matsumoto plays Momo with so much tenderness that you almost wish you had one too. Not wanting to think about the future and how their relationship will change, but as Momo (the name she gives him if one calls his new puppy)? we both knew it wasn't going to last. Look at this show with an open mind, it's worth it.
