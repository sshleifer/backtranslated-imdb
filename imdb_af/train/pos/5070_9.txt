Recently, I was looking for the newly released Wide Screen DVD from FLY AWAY HOME and came across an interesting title I have never heard of GRAY OWL. The fact that it was a Richard Attenborough movie caught my attention (he is responsible for such fine films such as GANDHI, CHAPLIN, and SHADOWLANDS). I noticed that the script was by William Nicholson (author of SHADOWLANDS). This "Special Edition" was full of interesting sounding material and the price was just under $ 10.00 - so I snapped it and bought it. WOW! What a beautiful movie. Pierce Brosnan stars as Archie Gray Owl, a real life hiker in the 1930s, who came to love and work the wild countries of Canada to help protect them. Brosnan (who played in a James Bond movie) gives a shady, warm, powerful performance like Annie Galipeau as the young woman who loves and influences his feelings for the country's creatures, especially the beaver. A good score by George Fenton (The CRUCIBLE) and beautiful photographers by Roger Pratt greatly contributes to the effectiveness of the film. AND the extras on this DVD are something else! Includes two shorts made in the 1930s with the real Gray Owl as well as audio commentary by Attenborough and Producer Jake Eberts; 2 featurettes; and many other fine PLUS options for those who have access to a computer with DVD-ROM features. GRAY OWL is released directly to DVD in the United States - a fact that Richard Attenborough writes to Hollywood's lack of interest in spreading something that is not loaded with violence and sex. It's a movie that not only informs and entertaines, but allows you to consider something. I had a very warm feeling at the film's conclusion - and a whole new love and understanding for beavers! GRAY OWL is a very fine movie - worth checking out! This is one that I look forward to sharing with others.
