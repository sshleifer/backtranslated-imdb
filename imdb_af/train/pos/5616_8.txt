What can be said, really ... "The tenant" is a first-class thriller that is done with equal amounts of tension and full blown paranoia. It's a complicated picture - every detail seems to be included for a reason - though the plot rarely makes sense, and much of it is never addressed objectively. That is why we are left with the increasingly unstable Trelkovsky (Polanski) - a gentle Polish man who got a flat because of the previous tenant's suicide - to guide us through a world of rising fear and uncertainty. After a residential heating party thrown by a group of avid colleagues, Trelkovsky comes under increased, seemingly inexplicable investigation by fellow residents in his building; The rest of the film chronicles his mental decline and gives us a thorough understanding with David Lynch's later efforts. "The tenant," however, is more brother and sinister, messing with unexpected comic relief, good performances, and a really haunting score. It's a better movie than described, so try it.
