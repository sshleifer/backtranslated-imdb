As a fan of the first Lion King, I definitely look forward to this movie, but I knew there was really no way to be as good as the original. I know many Disney fans are vigilant for the direct-to-video movies, as I also have mixed feelings from them. <br /> <br /> While watching The Lion King 1½, I was trying to figure out what my own view was about this movie. Will I be so devoted to The Lion King that I will nitpick on some scenes, or will I just accept this movie as just another look at The Lion King story? Most of the time I adopted myself. <br /> <br /> The Lion King 1½ definitely has his cute and funny moments. Timon and Pumbaa stole the show in the first movie and definitely earned a movie centered around them. People just love these characters! My favorite parts of the film include the fitting of Timon & Pumbaa, which takes care of young Simba and the surprise ends with some great comos. <br /> <br /> I could have done jokes without much of the bathroom, as the real reason everyone bowed to baby Simba at the start of Lion King 1. I think those kind of jokes are for the younger ones (which after all The target audience is, I don't think many kids are really worried about Disney's profit margin not directly to video films. <br /> <br /> But I would say that I was somewhat annoyed when they directed scenes from the original movie to this one. tied movie. I'm just too familiar with the original that those scenes stick out like thumbs up. Something would be different with the music or the voices that would just lead me. <br /> <br /> As far as music is concerned, it wasn't bad, but didn't expect classics to come out of this movie. At least LK2 had the nice ballad, "Love Will Find A Way." Regarding the voice work, it was well done in this movie. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella have always done a good job, and even new role-players, classic comic actor Jerry Stiller and Julie Kavner (known as Marge Simpson) have also done a good job. You can even enjoy even more of these great voice talents by watching the Virtual Safari on CD 2 of the DVD. This feature is definitely a lot of fun! <br /> <br /> All in all, The Lion King 1½ is not a perfect movie, but it's cute and entertaining. I think many Lion King fans will appreciate and appreciate what it is - a fun, light-hearted look at the Lion King masterpiece of our funny friends' perspectives. <br /> <br /> My IMDb rating: 7/10. My Yahoo! Degree: B (Good)
