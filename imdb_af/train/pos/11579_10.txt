This film is a masterpiece that is a story of a young woman during the war, and it really doesn't happen just like the movie, but it's a wonderful story. I was impressed with this movie, the play and the story movie because it is a real story, it makes me feel like I was there and I feel sorry for the choir director that Maruschka Detmers is playing, because who wants to end life in this way. I recommend everyone should watch this movie, especially the little ones and the mother by learning this movie. This movie can be compared to the movie soldier of orange or any true story that happened in WW2.
