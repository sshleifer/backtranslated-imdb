Many of the classic films of the late 60's did not retain their ability to disturb the audience. "In Cold Blood" did not lose an ounce of its power. Made extremely well-made, but forced the viewer to think. Some have not only complained about the movie, but of Truman Capote's source "non-fiction novel", that the central message is impeccable. It may be true, but it is certainly a case where the lack of ambiguity does not detract from the film. His refreshing, especially in view of today's simplistic and manipulative moral dramas, to see a film with a convincing political voice that is not afraid of the audience to consider its point of view. To be honest, I'm not sure I agree with the movie's central message, but I admire its pride. <br /> <br /> Even if you disagree with the anti-death sentence, there is plenty to admire about the movie. The action of the two leads is great. Scott Wilson (still one of the most underrated actors ever) chill as the nihilist leader, one who uses his charisma to hide his weaknesses. Robert Blake is also different than the more submissive of the two and the one with a conscience. Of course, his character has a reason, but is afraid to go against Wilson (there is a good amount of homoerotic subtext on his character's part). The cinematography is fantastic, slim, but neat and really gives the impression that the viewer is watching a documentary. Add another classic score to Quincey Jones and you have a masterpiece. (9/10)
