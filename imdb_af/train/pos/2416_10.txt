yes, it's a bit of a silly movie, so if you are looking for an oscar show, forget about this one ...... but if you love John Candy's humor, it's a must-have see. We lost John Candy before making enough of his big brand comedy, and he's just better off in one movie: airplanes, trains and cars (with Steve Martin). Excellent support performance by Eugene Levy, perhaps his best work ever as the hot-tempered Sal DiPasquale. Also good acting by Richard Libertini, Alley Mills & Pat Hingle. You should see this obscure and out-of-print movie if you are a John Candy or Eugene Levy fan.
