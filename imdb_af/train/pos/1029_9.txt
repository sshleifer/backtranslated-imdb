I would have ranked the series a perfect 10 for outstanding and consistently high quality story and character development, not for the last season of Season 10! <br /> <br /> The last episode of the 10th season "Unending", where (it will definitely look like) the Asgard was murdered in a very hectic, unconvincing and insecure way, left me in disbelief! <br /> <br /> From the extremely rushed end of the series, it is clear that many of the story bows were originally scheduled for at least one season. My guess is that they quickly accelerated these stories to position the Stargate SG-1 franchise for the two upcoming direct-to-DVD moves! <br /> <br /> Unless the Asgard returns in a future SG-1 movie (with a very good explanation of the "apparent" extinction), I think the fans are deceived with poor clearance clearance. ! <br /> <br /> Poor end to an otherwise brilliant sci-fi series.
