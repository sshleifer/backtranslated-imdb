I loved the way EARTH was made. His photography is incredible, it has to be an interesting challenge and Patrick Stewart's voice is perfect. In addition, his music and audio editing are aimed at an in-depth experience that you don't want to miss. You are really on a journey to where you will probably never end up with yourself. <br /> <br /> Although I was initially surprised by the audience's hearing, seeing our animals in their daily struggle for survival, I sometimes couldn't help laughing at myself. Nature simply looks too impressive to understand. <br /> <br /> But rather than the need to laugh, I left the theater with a profound question: "How many 200 years of industrial revolution can natural systems that were here destroy thousands and thousands of years?" br /> With this question in mind, you will understand how I felt bitter and powerless after I saw EARTH. I had the immediate need to change the world, to help all these animals in their struggle, to withdraw the changes we have made over the past few centuries and to stop global warming (all that is not a NGO activist is not!) ... <br /> <br /> Immediately I visited the site mentioned at the end of the movie to see what I could do to our fantastic planet (and the polar bear) to save his depressed fate. . (www.loveearth.com) <br /> <br /> I was a bit disappointed to find no direct answers to my questions there. Still, it was very interesting to find out more about the film and the battle that its crew had gone through. <br /> <br /> I hope that reducing my energy consumption will. I don't know how to reduce the distance, that the polar bears have to swim to reach land before they drown or attack animals. They can't beat their exhausted condition. <br /> <br /> An inspiring movie is that, but I didn't feel the theater very happy.
