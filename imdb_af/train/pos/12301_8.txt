It is a bit crazy, but I tapped both TCM, this German version of MGM's Anna Christie, and the English ... but I had to see this one first because I heard that many people thought it was better as the English version. <br /> <br /> Without seeing the other one, I can't compare it, but it's an excellent early talkie anyway, with a straightforward display by Garbo. She looks very pretty in this movie, her face shining right through, especially when the cameraman William Daniels gets those beautiful close-ups from her. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere of the movie looks different from the usual MGM material on This era looks very much like French or German expressionist films from the thirties, and it was right by a good French director, Mr. Jacques Feyder, who directed Garbo in "The Kiss" in 1929. <br /> <br /> Theo Shall is excellent and gives an absolutely happy performance as Anna's darling, the hard-boiled, tough, sailor, who is just a child in the human body. Hans Junkermann also gives a very good performance, like Anna's alcoholic father and Salka Viertel, as a good old cheap floozie. <br /> <br /> All in all, because it's the only movie you can hear Garbo talking in a foreign language ... "All the other movies she did in Sweden or Germany were during the Silent Era. <br /> <br /> Serious Flick.
