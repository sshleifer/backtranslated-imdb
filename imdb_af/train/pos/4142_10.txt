VETTY DRIVES THE BUS is simply the funniest, most original and entertaining piece of work I have ever had to see. <br /> <br /> This movie is by no means Hollywood standards, or even that of a straight video-fluff comedy with the lead terry "hulk" hogan, in terms of camera work, editing, acting, budget or something otherwise. <br /> <br /> What this movie does, however, is a very original and enjoyable story, and it is done by people who like to make it and the enthusiasm of the whole role-player really has all his budget and acting failures break through. <br /> <br /> This movie proves you are not "You don't have to make a big budget or decent actors to make a good movie. All you need is some original ideas and a passion for what you do. <br /> <br /> The best movie ever. I don't care how you get it, rent it, order it, steal it, load it, see this movie. <br /> <br /> Now I just hope they make a DVD version.
