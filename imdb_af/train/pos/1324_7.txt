You sit there for half an hour and look at a story, believe it all, then watch another half-hour of the same story completely unraveled ... and then again. Brilliant. <br /> <br /> One of the most exciting films at the San Francisco International Film Festival is a documentary. I don't know - unlike Andrew Jarecki's "Capturing the Friedmans" - there was something like Anna Broinowski's "Forbidden Lie $" ever. It contains, exposes, defends, reveals and asks everything about Norma Khouri, the author of "Honor Lost," the award-winning and lambasted 2001 bestseller of honor killings in Jordan. <br /> <br /> What is very incredible and what makes the movie so exceptional is that this "exposure" of Khouri is made with Khouri's full participation. <br /> <br /> For the initial part of the movie, Khouri presents her story about the alleged homicide of a friend of her in Amman, the story of the book. She sounds completely credible, convincing. <br /> <br /> Then her story was pulled apart, exposed by extremely credible and convincing people, such as women rights activists in Jordan, investigative reporters there and in Australia, where Khouri lived for a while. <br /> <br /> Khouri returns and denies the accusations and takes a successful lie-detection test in the process. There is another segment of devastating exposure - not specified here because it will reduce the shock value ... and then Khouri comes back and looks at the accusations (not all, but the essentials in the book's case). /> <br /> And the Houdini action continues, with the round to round this heavyweight, seesaw prize fight, surprised after surprise - and there is no "happy ending" in the sense of the resolution. Brilliant.
