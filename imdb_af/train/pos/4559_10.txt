My older sister was born in March 1985 and has cerebral palsy. In her 22 years of life she saw nothing but the walls of our home and her school that are also busy with other disabled children. I'm the bat of everyone's jokes because my sister is disabled, and I still think up to now that nobody is, or will ever give a damn about her and her condition. Then I saw this movie. <br /> <br /> I knew what Christy's family was going through. but they were happy. Christy could talk, he could communicate, and he had artistic skills. My sister can walk, but she can't speak a word, and she can't use her hands to do anything, but to grab things. but this film made me realize that there were other people in the world like my sister, and the end (to tell the truth) made me cry. AND I HAVE SEVEN SHAWSHANK !!! This movie is seriously underestimated, and it shouldn't. This movie tells people something. that people should be proud of their own lives. Think you can't write well? this man wrote with his foot. do you think you are not attractive? This man was rejected by many girls because of his condition. not the fastest runner? christy can't even get up. <br /> <br /> My point: Parents of young children, I suggest that your children see this movie with you so they will know next time when they see someone on the street in a wheelchair, they are not staring at they are like strangers. My sister has millions of styles, and it breaks my heart to think it's still happening to many people. This film will teach people that people who do not look normal are also people. 10/10
