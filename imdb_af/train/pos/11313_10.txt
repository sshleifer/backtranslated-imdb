Gino Costa (Massimo Girotti) is a young and attractive drifter who arrives in a road rod. He meets the young, beautiful and disgruntled wife Giovanna Bragana (Clara Calamai) and her old and fat husband, Giuseppe Bragana (Juan de Landa), owners of the bar. He deals with his mechanical skills through food and accommodation and has a relationship with Giovanna. Both decide to kill Giuseppe by forging a car accident. The relationship between them is influenced by the conviction and police investigation. This masterpiece ends in a tragic way. The noir and neo-realistic movie of Luchino Visconti is outstanding. This is the first time I've seen this version of "The Postman Always Rings Twice". I loved the 1946 version with Lana Turner, and the 1981 version, where Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange have one of the hottest sex scene in the history of the theater, but this one is definitely the best. My voice is ten.
