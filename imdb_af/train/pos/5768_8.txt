A crash at a nuclear power station causes a majority of people to become deadly, rock-faced, zombies, which of course go on a creepy rampage. Some handful of uninfected people are doing their best to survive this terrible ordeal. Director / co-writer / producer Todd Sheets shows a pleasant, sincere love and passion for a lively and horrific horror card: he keeps an unceasingly funny pace throughout, fills the screen with wall-to-wall action, and fortunately the terrible dialogue holds to a pleasant minimum. In addition, Sheets definitely doesn't make the glorious graphic and over-the-top platter: this photo delivers a nice truck's moth, thaw, lots of stomach mix, one man has its heart ripped out and even a good impalement on it. a tree branch. Pages earn bonus points to keep the tone dark and nasty at the literal bitter end. For example, almost all the main characters become pregnant as a zombie chow. Granted, this movie has its fair share of the flaws: the turbulent editing, several hamsthist attempts at pathos, and the largely horrible acting of a rank-no-name cast, leave a good deal to be desired. Top thespic honors go to the beautiful and beautiful Kasey Rausch for her exquisite portrayal of the inventive Daria Trumillio. Frank Dunlay also does well as a solid running veteran, Ralph Walsh. Best of all, Sheets' definite understanding of an infectious snake's intentional head-length momentum and clear affinity for the horror genre, keeps it a total blast to see from start to finish.
