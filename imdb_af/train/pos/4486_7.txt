SPOILERS <br /> <br /> Tom and Jerry are a classic cartoon, with a flawless idea, and almost every short is a gem. While I have to say that it is definitely an inferior short compared to the other classic Tom and Jerry pants, there is no way to hate this cartoon. Certainly, it is understandable to say that this is one of the worst of the first Tom and Jerry episodes, and I can say that I agree, but the fact is that all Tom and Jerry episodes are big, but some are just better than others. Well, it will fit in "other". <br /> <br /> Here is the plot of Fraidy Cat. Tom listens to an old scary radio broadcast, and gets scared easily. Jerry sees how scared he is, trying to scare him even more than he already is. He creates scary dilemmas for Tom, and Tom gets scared of his mind, and his life. Jerry then puts a sheet over a vacuum cleaner and controls it, and the vacuum seems to be a ghost. Tom finds out that Jerry has done all this and pursued him. Tom then accidentally bites the house girl. In the end, Jerry ends the scarecrow after seeing his reflection in a trophy. <br /> Overall, it's far from the best Tom and Jerry out there, but it's still a fun and entertaining time. It makes me wish there were more cartoons like this. The slapstick and gags in this that reveal to Tom and Jerry are as good as ever in this brief, but it felt like something was missing. It feels slower than most Tom and Jerry pants. Anyway, it's a good short that doesn't quite meet other Tom and Jerry cartoons, but it's still nice. <br /> <br /> 7/10
