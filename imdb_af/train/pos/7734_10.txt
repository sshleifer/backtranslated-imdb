I saw this movie a few years ago and I have to say that I really like it. Jason Patric was perfect for this strange role he played. The director? I don't do too many things about him ... and I don't "The screenplay is good, that's for sure. In just a few words I have to say about this movie, which is strange, strange, even dark, but it's a good one. I saw it a few years ago and never seen it since. I want to see it again and again. I know I'm not going to be sick to watch it. The scenes, the atmosphere, the actors, the story ... everything is fine. The movie should have been longer. . I think 120 minutes should have been perfect. I was hoping for a part 2 for this movie. Bad, it didn't happen. Jason Patric: You're the man! very good movie. the end. :-)
