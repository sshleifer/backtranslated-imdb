Although I didn't like Stanley and Iris like a movie, I admired the play. Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro are wonderful in this movie. I wasn't always a fan of Fonda's work, but here she is delicate and strong at the same time. De Niro has the ability to make every role he portrays in acting gold. He gives a good performance in this film and there is a wonderful scene where he has to take his father to a home for the elderly because he can no longer care for what will break your heart. I wouldn't really recommend this movie as a great movie entertainment, but I will say you won't see much bite.
