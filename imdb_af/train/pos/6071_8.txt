No matter how hard I look, I'll never get a better movie version of "Othello". If you love Kenneth Branagh's wonderful masterpieces, "Many Ado About Nothing" (1993) and "Hamlet" (1996), I'm dead, and you'll find Oliver Parker's Othello also irresistible. Laurence Fishburne worked in several beautiful roles during his career. He was very frightening in "Boys n the Hood" (1991). I have always regarded his wonderful role of Furious Styles as his greatest achievement. Of course it was good before I saw it. <br /> <br /> He plays the role of Othello and he is probably in the most difficult role of his entire career, but he does a fantastic, fantastic job. Ir√®ne Jacob is absolutely charming Desdemona and Kenneth Branagh are simply phenomenal in a most fascinating role of the story's sloping, manipulative villain Iago. Wonderful "Othello" is part of the absolute elite among Shakespeare's ingenious works. It deals with his favorite topics: curvature, envy, fraud and jealousy. This movie adaptation is definitely one of the best movies I've seen based on William Shakespeare's plays.
