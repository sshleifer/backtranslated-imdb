An entertaining kung fu movie, featuring acting, plot and fighting scenes a cut above the average hooded sock. All those role players are similar characters and skilled martial artists. Alexander Fu-Sheng's proto-Jackie Chan comedy loss is fun to watch, and his tough companion shows extraordinarily impressive skills. For me, the film's only spectacular error is the size of the cast. Sometimes things get a little confused like the movie clips and change between different subplots, and some of the characters are not as completely spread out as they would like. <br /> <br /> But a kung fu movie must first be judged on the quality of the action, and Shaolin Temple definitely delivers that score. The movie climbs with a high-body battle that each character can show his skills against a worthy opponent. <br /> Overall, Shaolin Temple is a pleasant low-budget kung fu movie. Not to the quality of a good Jet Li movie, but definitely a look for fans of the genre. My rating: 8/10. <br /> <br /> Misc Notes: The 1987 Warner Home Video release I saw was (predictably) duplicated and had no full cast & crew credits.
