"Happenstance" is the most New York-based Paris movie I've seen since the cat's way (Chacun Cherche son chat). <br /> <br /> Last year's movie has now been released to attract attention. Audrey Tatou gets for "Amelie," his French title is more suitable: "Le Battement d'ailes du papillon" than in the summary of chaos theory as a controlling element in our lives. <br /> <br /> Tatou's play here is less annoying because she flashes just that shiny smile between her unfortunate adventures and because she is part of a large multi-ethnic ensemble, so big it took me long to get out sort the characters, especially because some of the cute guys and older women looked at me and fantasized some of the characters they had to do so I wasn't sure if they did it or not. <br /> <br /> But I loved how urban the coincidences were, from immigrants to pushing nests, pushing, hanging cars. <br /> <br /> Both subtitles have parts of a dialogue at once. <br /> <br /> (originally written 12/8/2001)
