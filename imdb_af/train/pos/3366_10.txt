Ettore Scola, one of the most refined and great directors of our world citizens, is not yet available on DVD ... (this is summer 2001 now). Secrets to Protecting the Thoughts. <br /> <br /> This great classic has returned to the theaters in my hometown, thanks to a Sophia Loren summer retrospective, and to see it again on the big screen after all this on a video tape ... it's a real gift. <br /> <br /> To avoid criticism, try a point: I took my hesitant, younger brother with me to see this movie. He has never seen the movie and "doesn't like that Italian Oldies." Like all the others in the theater, he was amazed by this miracle. Even during the final titles, the theater remained completely silent. <br /> <br /> This SPECIAL DAY is really special. A wonder of refinement. And a big loss if you haven't seen it yet
