I didn't expect the highest caliber of movies with Joel Schumacher to target this one, so I was surprised that TIGERLAND wasn't a total waste of time. <br /> <br /> In technique, it is often derived from SPARING PRIVATE RYAN with the shaky camera work, grainy shots, the movie occasionally running like a sprocket --- all the techniques that Speilberg used to make his movie seem more realistic, but ultimately more distracting than anything else. <br /> <br /> But unlike SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, the emotional component wasn't that bad, as the characters in this movie look more like real people and the story is less confronted, not so packaged in the American flag no. (Speilberg gets a "F a subtlety"). <br /> <br /> In addition to the first part of Kubrick's FULL METAL JACKET, this is the most realistic depiction of the boat camp I've seen in a movie, so I think it's worth watching. <br /> <br /> It's not a good movie, but it's not a bad movie either.
