I love this movie !!! Pressure rain came out the year I was born and it has had my heart since I can remember. Prince is so strict in this movie. Last night I went to a special show of Purple Rain and it was like a concert. I was happy to see some true fans, because this movie is so undervalued. It's really one of the best movies of all time. The music is untouchable. The film is about "The Kid", played by Prince, his family is dysfunctional, his band is the hottest act in town, and he looks at the Apollonia, an aspiring singer. There is no doubt why purple is my favorite color, because I can thank the "Kid". So if you haven't seen it, then you have to breathe. It's a classic - 4ever!
