I came to the end and I almost screamed, "No, no, no, no! It can't end here! There are too many unanswered questions! The involvement of the dishwashers? Mona's disappearance? Helmer's coming? "zombie"? Was Little Brother saved by his father? And what about the head ??????? "Oh no !! Then I read that at least two of the governor members had passed and I have to say, I know this will probably not be true for Lars von Trier's vision, but I will pass past replacement actors just to see the end of what he had. planned! Granted, it will be hard to find someone to play Helmer as the character deserves. Helmer, the doctor you love to hate! I think I still have a more self-absorbed, unaware, self-righteous character on the screen! But I could overlook a change in actors .... I just need to know how it ends!
