More TV movies should be made like this. I saw it back in '93 when it was first on TV. Helen Hunt and Steven Weber were both fantastic, delivering very eager and realistic performances. Weber was especially good, in an exceptionally creepy and understated performance as the child molester / killer. This film really increased my respect for Hunt as an actress. The director also directed "Hoosiers", which was somehow both formative and exciting. But the direction in both of these works has the same strong, simple realism that is so attractive. If you want TV movies that aren't predictable and filled with over persecution, see it if you can. The side story about Hunt and Fahey's case is also appealing without detracting from the main story.
