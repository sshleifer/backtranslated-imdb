This cool wonder superhero game pays proper tribute by staying true to the comics. Of all the wonder superhero games that were so weak with poor graphics and games, Spiderman improves in both sections. It also features the voice of Stan Lee, the creator of Spiderman comics. <br /> <br /> As you would expect Spiderman to do everything a spider can do. He does more than spin webs. In fact, he uses them as weapons and shields. When he doesn't use the web in battle, he also pushes and kicks. Spidey has his hands full when he battles Venom, Rhino, Mysterio, Scorpion and Dr Octopus to name a few. Search Captain America in a cameo. <br /> <br /> Most of the levels are challenging, but some require patience to beat. The only complaint about this game is that it is so short and can be completed within three hours. If you're a real wonder superhero fan, this game is for you, but don't expect long gameplay. Good luck in "Spiderman 2." My evaluation: 9 out of 10.
