Otto Preminger's noir classic work almost as a flip side of LAURA ... while the movie was flashy and contained the sound of Clifton Webb, this movie was very fucking. Dana Andrews is a less than good policeman who inadvertently kills a man to hold onto the girl's father. Preminger keeps things moving with a quick clip so it can fall into logic, easily overlooked. Andrews is pretty good (much less wood than in the past) and the beautifully beautiful Gene Tierney is wonderful! Creepy Craig Stevens plays the unfortunate victim. WHERE SIDEWALK ENDS IS A MUST SEE and a fantastic companion is for Preminger's equally lousy WHIRLPOOL (also with Tierney).
