Don't be fooled by the stupid title people, it's a nice ride! A true successor to Tetsuo the Iron Man and Ichi the Killer, start this jewel with a bang and lay the bark on thick until the credits roll. It seems that strangers take over people's bodies and turn them into war machines, which are then used to fight each other in a twisted game to entertain their species. The winner of the battle eats the loser alive. It's mostly for plot, but what cares when the gore is so good? I have no idea how many buckets of mucus were used, but it's disgusting to see. There is an interesting and effective use of stop movement when takeovers are underway, and loving care is taken over the entire creature and makeup effects. The CGI is a bit limited, but it doesn't really detract from the overall quality at all, at least for me. It was truly a fun and twisted movie that deserves much praise, and really earned its place in the pile of Cult Classics. Find it and see, you won't be disappointed!
