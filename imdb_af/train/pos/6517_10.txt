I'm afraid it was a movie you should actually see to get something out of it. I am not a mindless movie like ..... LEATHAL WEAPON PART 58 You know the one where Riggs is really crazy? It's not a movie that's almost the same because it's a start. You can run anywhere on the phone doing what ever and enjoy it in any way. I've noticed in the past that most people who don't like this type of movie are the ones who will do the most, but watch a movie and then slam it because ..... why don't they get it or understand it or what happened. <br /> <br /> DO NOT HAVE YOUR DOGGY THIS FUTURE!
