The brilliant thing about Withnail & I is that it doesn't catch up long, and life can go with all its other connoisseurs in any way. Freebird is something for those who have probably never considered higher education and just went straight to work on 15/16. I know some of the broad skins stuck the knife in this movie when it came out in Cinemas, but I saw it at a packaged house in Hailsham and everyone really enjoyed it. I grew up in the Dean's forest and it returned me straight to my mushrooms and days (had some great friends - hate to think what they have been up to now - probably the local council). I've watched it on DVD a few times and even though I see the movie as an old friend who will stay forever as part of my collection (how can I watch this movie and the Dambusters - don't look right) to the second half of this movie and I think the social interaction scenes with the locals are brilliantly done. I like the combination of the three main characters and there is really a beautiful writing along with some very quirky lines and I dare say a good reproach to integrity. I tried to get the soundtrack, but it was not released (shame because it is a cork). Someone told me it was originally a stage game, not quite sure how it worked, but I'm sure it's fun. I like the little Shakespeare touch / references in the whole movie (see also the Dylan Thomas ref) and like all the gems, there will always be little things to discover, like the final scene that Easyrider nods as They start their next trip. All in all a truly unpretentious piece of movie entertainment (love it!)
