Neil Simons plays the same. The Odd couple tell the story of best friends, Felix Unger (Jack Lemmon) and Oscar Madison (Walter Matthau) who eventually share Oscars' massive bachelor path after Felix tries to kill him. <br /> <He had a great drive with his wife about his obsessive compulsive streams and strange phobias and sent her a suicide telegram. She calls Oscar and lets him know what happened. Fillix appears on Oscar's during his weekly poker game with their friends. Vinnie (John Fielder) Murray, policeman (Herbert Edelman) Roy (David Sheiner) and Speed ​​(Larry Haines). After splitting the hysteria, Felix agrees with Oscar. <br /> <br /> The rest of the film focuses on how these two are so completely different characters. And as if we were to see Oscar Felix's real peculiar and unique habits and neatness, and if Felix could say that Oscar was such a slap and his depressed attitude to everything. Really a movie about two complete opponents living together and the joys, highlights, lows and necessity of the friendship gift. With the big play is an intelligent and very funny script and the great Monica Evans and Carole Shelley as the British devil sisters who invite Oscar. left for a double date. <br /> <br /> This one is guaranteed to make you laugh, every line is priceless and Jack and Walter are great with good chemistry. Also in a successful and equally funny TV series with Jack Klugman like Oscar and Tony Randall as Felix.
