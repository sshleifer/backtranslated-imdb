So often a group will come together for a reunion concert just to find that they can't just get it together. Not so here. This concert is only brilliantly brilliant from start to finish. Of course, these three musicians came together and plotted and planned what was needed to ensure that it wasn't just nostalgic bash to satisfy someone's ego. It goes without saying from the beginning before they even step on the stage. Many faces in the crowd were not even born when these guys first performed. From the first song they catch the old magic that Cream, 3 men, 3 instruments, was no fuss. Clapton, according to his own acknowledgment, said he had to stretch himself for this concert because there were no keyboard, synthesizers, etc. so we could see him at its best. Ginger Baker shows why so many drummers today speak of him as a kind of dromguru. Jack Bruce just great. They really managed to put together a piece of magic that will follow the test of time for many years. This one is a 10 for me.
