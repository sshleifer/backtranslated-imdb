Stoic and laconic soldier Sergeant Todd (a fine and credible performance by the ever-reliable Kurt Russell) is plunged into a deserted remote planet after he contemptuously and arrogantly Colonel Mekum (delightedly played by Jason Isaacs's smarty hilt) Todd and his fellow soldiers replaced with a new advanced breed of genetically modified warriors. Todd joins a peaceful retreat community of independent outcasts and defends this community when the new soldiers arrive for a field practice. Director Paul W.S. Working from a clever and challenging David Webb Peoples script, Anderson shows a cold vision of a dark, cold, and hard-to-reach future, while maintaining a funny fit and tough, eager tone throughout. In addition, Anderson maintains moving moments of humanity (Todd's struggle to come into contact with his previously suppressed feelings is truly poignant) and stretches the moving action scenes with frost-roaring gusto. Russell gives a strong and impressive almost pantomime depiction of Todd; He carries a lot of emotion without saying much and instead plays the majority of his actions through his body movements and facial expressions. In addition, Jason Scott Lee's assistant innings as brutal rival soldier Caine 607, Connie Nielson as compassionate Sandra, Sean Pertwee as friendly Mace, Jared and Taylor Thorne as dumb young boy, Nathan, Gary Busey as cunning, seasoned veteran Captain Church, Michael Chiklis as the whole Johnny Pig, and Brenda Wehle as the sensible mayor Hawkins. Better still, this film makes a profound and meaningful statement about the spiritual cost of being a ruthless soldier and the importance of intellectual power over physical power. David Tattersall's sophisticated cinematography, Joel McNeely's thrilling orchestral score, and the prosperous special effects, enhance the overall sterling quality of this superior science fiction / action hybrid outing.
