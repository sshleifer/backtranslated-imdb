<br /> <br /> In 1970, after five years of absence, Kurosawa made what would be its first film in color. Dodes' Ka-Den is a film that hangs around many intricate stories that take place in a small Tokyo slum. <br /> <br /> The title comes from the sound a mentally handicapped boy makes, as he thinks he is operating a train. We learn more and more from the people in the small community, the two drunks women sell because they are not happy with those they have. The old man who is the center of the town helps a burglar who tries to rob him. The very poor father and son who can never afford a home, imagine them imagining themselves. By the end of the film, the stories all come full of circles, some remain happy, others are sad. Because it was Kurosawa's first color film, you can see that he is using it and showing it to his advantage. Maybe too much. This movie goes in many different directions and it is difficult to establish and enter. But don't get me wrong, Dodes' Ka-Denne may not be the best of Kurosawa, but come from the best director of all time, it's much better than 99% of today's movies.
