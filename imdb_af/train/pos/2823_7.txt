MGM was unsure how to market Garbo when she first arrived in Hollywood. Mayer had a lot of faith in her and her appearance in "Torrent" justified it. She didn't speak a word of English, so she had to find it difficult to work, but Ricardo Cortez didn't make it very easy for her. <br /> <br /> The source of the title is the Juscar River that flows through the wind. a sleepy little town in Spain. Leonora (Greta Garbo) hopes one day that her voice will bring great hassle and happiness to her struggling parents. Leonora and Don Rafael (Ricardo Cortez) are in love, but he is under his mother's thumb and cannot agree to accept his marriage. Meanwhile, Dona Brull (Martha Mattox) has expelled Leonora's parents from their home and they send Leonora to Paris and hopes to give her a chance to promote her singing career. Leonora notes Rafael and insists on remembering his promise and coming with her. His mother is furious and forbids him to go - so naturally he throws in her request. <br /> <br /> Years pass. Leonora has a new identity - she has become La Brunna, the toast of the Paris Opera. Rafael came out just like his mother wanted. He runs for the office and is a "safe" young girl, Remedios (Gertrude Olmstead) who is a "whore" heir. Mack Swain plays her father. Leonora decides to visit her old house, and I agree - why didn't she help her mother. Her mother is still living in the family's home, working as a diskvy and taking in laundry. Leonora and Rafael meet but Leonora is full of laughter. Garbo is so wonderfully beautiful, it's hard to believe he's happy with Remedios. <br /> <br /> The dam bursts and the stream flows over the village. Leonora's house is in the path of the raging river, but when Rafael tries to save her, he finds that she is fairly safe. They set their romance on fire again. There is a "horizontal" love scene in this movie, very similar to the one in "Meat and the Devil". <br /> <br /> Dona Brull spreads gossip about how Leonora really has her wealth and Leonora's mother believes her and tells Leonora to go. Rafael meets Leonora just before she starts to tour America. Again he plans to go with her, but again he leaves her. He spends so much time listening to other people who are destroying her reputation - "what is she going to do for you but dragging you down". The irony is that she only secured a top state job for him if he came with her. They meet again, years later - she is as fresh and alive as ever - he looks older than his years with mediocrity. <br /> <br /> It's definitely a good movie with a positive message to follow your heart. <br /> <br /> Lucien Littlefield does a good job as Cupid, the hairdresser and Leonora's old and loyal friend. <br /> <br /> Highly Recommended.
