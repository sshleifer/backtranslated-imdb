I saw On Demand the other night at midnight, without knowing what to expect. I heard about this movie, but never really heard any opinion about it. <br /> <br /> I have to say, I was impressed with what I saw. I was actually provoked in some parts and I definitely remember several times in my seat. <br /> <br /> The Blob was scary looking. Now I look in a pot of jelly and wonder if it will hang on my hand. <br /> <br /> Steve McQueen was really good as Steve Andrews, the lead star of the movie. I also liked the old man from the beginning. <br /> <br /> For a 50-year-old horror movie, it was very well done, even according to today's standards. <br /> <br /> 8/10.
