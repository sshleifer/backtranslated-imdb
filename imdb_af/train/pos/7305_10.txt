In 1978, a phenomenon began. The release of John Carpenter's "Halloween" got people around the block to realize the evil Michael Meyers is. The critics loved it, the world loved it, it was imitated and one of the greatest films in film history. <br /> <br /> Plot: 15 years after a murder occurred, four friends (all females) are babysitting (and having their boyfriends) on Halloween night. After escaping from a hospital the previous night, Michael Myers returned to his hometown to stole these people. He killed 3 of them quietly and subtly. He's not talking. He walked slowly. He hides .... <br /> <br /> Only one of the friends escapes after being saved by Dr. Loomis (Michael's pursuer and doctor). <br /> <br /> There is one reason why Halloween works so well. . Simplicity. We don't know where Michael is, we don't know why he's killing, and he's scared us. They are the only reasons we fear. <br /> <br /> John Carpenter wrote and directed the movie. He builds unbearable tension throughout the story and frightens us so that sometimes we can't look. And the climax is really scary. <br /> <br /> As a terror it is essential. It's terrifying and well behaved. It's also mysterious. Michael is a force, not a man. A power that cannot be denied. <br /> <br /> The persecutors focused too much on Michael and his "history". This movie focuses on the fear of the unknown. Maybe that's why this thing is a masterpiece.
