Of the three remakes on W. Somerset Maughan's novel, this one is the best one, and not particularly because of what John Cromwell brought to the film. The film is a glimpse of the breakthrough of Bette Davis, who, like Mildred Rogers, showed the movie industry she was a star. Eventually her struggle with Jack Warner and his studio fought generously. <br /> <br /> Mildred dominates the movie from the start. We realize from the start that Mildred doesn't care for Philip and never will. She shunned her contempt for this kind of soul that fell in love with the wrong woman. He will be humiliated again by Mildred, and again, since she makes no bones about what she really is. <br /> <br /> Poor Philip Carey, except being disabled, is a weak man. If he tries to cling to Mildred, she rejects him. This is when Mildred comes back to him, if she is weak and defeated, he emerges, overcomes his own dependence on this terrible woman who stole his will and his masculinity. <br /> <br /> Bette Davis gives a fantastic portrayal of Mildred. It was one of her best roles and she ran away with it. Her aversion to the kind of Philip is evident from the beginning of their relationship. When she told him she was rinsing her mouth after kissing, it was one of the most powerful moments in the movie. Leslie Howard underperforms Philip and even makes him look weaker. Frances Dee, Reginald Denny, Alan Hale and Reginald Owen are seen in small roles. <br /> <br /> It's Bette Davis show and don't forget it!
