If you're investigating UFO facts, this video is very important. The "meat" of the video is Buzz Aldrin's comment. He is without a doubt the best of America. Committed to being objective, honest and factual in his reports. Many American astronauts of all time have reported some kind of contact, or UFO observation, and there are videos of some of the missions. At least something has happened which requires further objective continuous investigation. I think Buzz Aldrin's evidence shows that other worlds are interested in our progress. Like all alleged documentary videos, this one may be diagonal, but it contains further information and opinions of a perfect American hero. They don't come together every day. So, the fact that some people are not interested in details should not surround you to view this video. If nothing else, it is interesting and I advise you to have an open mind.
