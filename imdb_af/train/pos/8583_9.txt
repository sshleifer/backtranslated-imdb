The Korean War is called America's Forgotten War. So many unanswered questions were buried with the 50 thousand men who died there. Sometimes we are treated to a play or movie dealing with distant, ghost-free cemetery. Here is perhaps one of the best. It is called Sergeant Ryker. The story is of an American soldier called Sgt. Paul Ryker (Lee Marvin) chosen by his commander for a top secret mission. His job is to weaken North Korea and provide its services against the United Nations. His cover is so successful, he proves invaluable to the enemy and gives Major rank. However, he is captured by the Americans, trialed as a traitor and explorer. He said he was ordered to fail, unfortunately he learned that his commander was dead and had no evidence or proof of his innocence. He was found guilty and sentenced to hang. But his conviction is doubted by Capt. Young (Bradford Dillman), his prosecutor. Dominant commander general Amos Baily (Lloyd Nolan) of his doubt is being awarded a new trial and if found guilty he will be executed. In addition, the courtroom drama is like the movie that includes Peter Graves, Murray Hamilton and Norman Fell as Sgt. Max Winkler. Korea was a distant place, but the possibility of condemning a Communist and hanging him hit the house very close in the 1950s. Because of its better writing and powerful message, this drama has become a courtroom classic. Excellent look and recommend for everyone. ****
