I saw this movie the other day when I rented it, and I thought it would be just another movie with a girl trying to prove a point, but Diane joined boxing because she wanted to. I thought this movie was good. I gave it an 8/10. That's how good it is. Plus a movie with Michelle Rodriguez is always good. Even if she's just six.
