Rushed by a secret, Ben Thomas (Will Smith) is looking for salvation by radically changing the lives of seven people he does not know. Once his plan is set, nothing will stop him. At least that's what he thinks. But Ben did not plan to fall in love with one of these people and she is the one who will eventually change him. Will Smith is back with director Gabriele Muccino, after the life-inspiring film "The Pursuit of Happiness". "Seven Pounds" is another life-changing movie experience that not only reminds you of their previous collaboration but slow but inspires you in the end. Will Smith is also the producer again with some of the others. These movies are very realistic, depicting a common man's life and his struggle through life. Seven pounds may have taken time to get its real momentum, but just after half an hour of the movie, the movie is all to rule your heart. Also, this movie turned a few twists, which made the viewers guess. Director Gabriele Muccino is the winner again, with his emotional but inspirational message. He really makes all the characters of the movie really, that people will actually find them in the movie. Along with the director, Will Smith is another winner, with his outstanding acting skills. Again, the duo of the director and the actor works as a charm. There are also other talented actors in the movie who did their part properly. Rosario Dawson, brain beauty, that's what she can be called. She looks pretty and does her part very well. Barry Pepper gives good support to the film and Woody Harrelson does the same, though Woody didn't have much screen time (would have been good if he had more). You won't easily forget this movie. Look at this movie and change your life. Top-class theater!
