"Read my lips" tells of a strange symbiosis that develops between a simple, social maladroit female office worker (Devos) and her workplace pupil, a rough exon (Casel). As the film eats this unlikely duo into their senses, they are swirled into a cold fusion of thoughts. Everyone uses the other for their own selfish reasons with an extraordinary outcome. Good stuff for anyone in character-driven films with strong psychodramatic undercurrents. In French with easy to read captions and good translation. (B +)
