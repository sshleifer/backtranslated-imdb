A family (ma. Patricia Clarkson, father Jake Weber, son-Erik Per Sullivan) goes out for a family gathering in a remote home in the middle of winter. They accidentally hit a deer while driving there. This appeals to some of the locals - especially Otis (John Speredakos) and things are slowly (VERY slow) wrong. <br /> <br /> I was expecting the worst when I started looking. Most of the reviews for this, on this site, are extremely negative. Well ... I disagree. First, it's not a horror movie. The horror doesn't begin until the last 30 minutes. It plays more like a family drama with horror elements thrown in. At that level it's pretty damn good. <br /> <br /> First, the bad things: The tempo is too slow; Jake Weber is a horrible actor; AWAY TOO MUCH FALSE DREAM ORDER; the wendigo rare figures in the movie and the clear view we get from the wendigo end up laughing. <br /> <br /> The good stuff: Pretty good dramatic script; Clarkson is excellent as the mother; a little good direction with ominous sound effects that are a bit scary; a pretty explicit hot sex series between Clarkson and Weber (actually needed for the integrity of the plot!); fairly good acting by Sullivan (only 10 at the time!) and Speredakos and a completely unexpected tragic end. <br /> <br /> I think a lot of people are getting annoyed with this movie because it is a horror movie - what it is. So, if you can ignore it, I think you might like it. I give it a 7.
