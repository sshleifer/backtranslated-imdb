I found this movie to be charming. I thought the characters were evolving as I watched, I cared for these people. This is a period I believe happened during the depression. A single mother, known as the village chief (she has reason to be), puts an advertisement in the newspaper for a man. Christopher Reeve plays an ex-con that happens in town looking for work. He sees the ad and he goes out to see her. She hires him. I really had a few chuckles because their relationship progressed because I found it easy to put myself in their shoes. Everything went like this. He needs the job so he doesn't want to upset her. And she needed his help, but didn't want him to prevail. They dance to the fact that they really need each other. Things start to warm up to ..... the big blow. I won't spoil it by telling what happens. But the point of the resolution is perfectly wonderful. I found that the story is very credible for the time it takes. I think it's one of the better "relationship" stories out there. Maybe the younger generation won't "get it", but if you are over 40, you think you'll like it. And if you liked Christopher Reeve from "Somewhere in Time," you'll love him too.
