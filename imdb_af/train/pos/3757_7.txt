As with a lot of guys at school, we have to give it a thumb. Even the Grim Ripper made us smile. These two strange things made me laugh, Bill and Ted were the dumbest but the most beautiful in the whole movie. It's much better than the first one. And yet, for some reason, I feel it's missing something. Something big. Something important. Made a better home and friends. No, I want to say better villains. Use clones instead of robots. I gave it a 7 out of 10 because of those two robot darts. <br /> <br /> The Grim Ripper, don't be scared, he's not the deadly kind, it's funny. When he falls out of the air, I divide a stomach. Splat, I'm not sure about those strangers. What were they? Scientists? Not at all.
