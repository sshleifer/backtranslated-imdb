What we keep going on - or at least I feel the writer wanted us to stick in early is our desire to know if Martinaud did the dirty act. Without spoiling, of course there is a red herring and a twist. But then we discover that it is the story of Martinaud's imperfections and his difficulty in dealing with them. When there is the revelation, we begin to make him sympathetic and sorry, because as the story progresses, we are made to think he is the sick, perverted pedophile we keep in mind. One of the things he has to deal with is the distant gap he and his wife have, even if they live on the same roof. Of course, these problems give their disconnection in the shocking final of the movie. <br /> <br /> This movie claims your patience and it certainly put those at rest in the back of teenagers. Of course they were heckling because they were not partial to "central location" movies. Although there is a little travel, when we get to the forest and the beach. And we realize that Gaul is not as clever as we are made to think he is. <br /> <br /> The Inquisitor is 5/5
