Philo Vance (William Powell) helps to solve several murders among the rich after a dog show. <br /> <br /> I usually hate too many crossed secrets (like this one), but I like this movie. It moves very fast (just 72 minutes), is beautifully directed by Michael Curtiz (he uses tons of camera tricks that only accelerate the narrative), has a very ingenious storyline (including a solution for a closed room story that was just incredible) and has a very good role. <br /> <br /> Powell is very suave and big like Vance - he doesn't seem to act - he's IS Vance! Mary Astor is not given much, but she adds class and beauty to the production. Everyone else is also very good, but best of all is Eugene Pallette as Detective Heath. He is a very good actor with a very distinctive voice and some of his lines were hilarious. <br /> <br /> Basically, an excellent 1930s Hollywood murder story. Worth to see. <br /> <br />
