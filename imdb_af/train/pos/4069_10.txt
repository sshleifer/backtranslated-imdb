Listen to the soundtrack right now, the images come back with a brightness that makes my longing for a dry eye very strong (to be able to type it). I've seen it twice, and I have to be ashamed because I've only seen it * twice. <br /> <br /> I've seen Miyazaki & Studio Ghibli movies, and they're always nothing short of masterpieces. (except perhaps for Nausicaa, which was even too early in the non-cut version, compared to the neck-plus-ultra-manga). However, their power sometimes becomes their weakness, because they tend to get naive / positive (Chihiro), or, with more nuance, a little too explicit / moralistic (Mononoke). At least, compared to, for example, the other Ghibli master Takahata (Grave of the Fireflies / Only Yeast / Raccoon wars). But not this one. <br /> <br /> In Laputa, Miyazaki throws all the brilliant storytelling that narrators of stories have gathered and made perfect over the centuries, combined with a bit of morality, but nicely interwoven with not only a completely transcendental atmosphere, but also with the humor and entertainment of for example Totoro. Each main character is perfectly portrayed with their doubts and fears and their attributes that help them overcome problems. The pacing is so perfect that I don't know anything except a black hole that can exert such gravity on your whole being. The story stands out as an action movie with mysteries emerging, but when the girl falls out of the air, unconscious, floats and kicks the main theme, you get a glimpse of the great mystery you are about standing to uncover, but the story then and gradually settles on a number of meticulously selected scenes of action and tranquil beauty, building on an unforgettable climax of melancholy, hope, beauty, like days of gloomy gloom, finally the horizon A clear morning, because the road knew, saw the distance ahead, but smiled at the mere fact that it could get a glimpse of it. <br /> <br /> It's like an explosive white light in your skull that than through the time the credits start rolling, you've kept your eyes dry and your mind numb, you need to see a therapist. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that technically minded, more recent Miyazakis may be more overwhelming, I remain his undisputed masterpiece. If you take a second to realize that it was repaired in 1986, you can only conclude that Hayao Miyazaki is a genius like a star that appears only once every 200 years. Of course this has been suggested before, but for me it is his only film that can fully illustrate the simple fact. If you miss it in your lifetime, you will die with a big gap - it will be a pity as the coffin is the same.
