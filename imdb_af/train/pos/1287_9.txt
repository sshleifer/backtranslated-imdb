"Let's Bowl" started on local television in the Twin Cities. It came late at night, something that you would be inundated while navigating to the 7th bottle of Hamm's. <br /> <br /> Even the ads were manufactured locally, with Wally outside Grumpy's Bar, with a microphone and stubbornly nervous - "Agh ... over to you, Steve Sedahl." Not sure why, but one always made me laugh. <br /> <br /> There was a bowling competition envisaged to settle a dispute between two bowlers, but the game was secondary to the comments and clips. Sedahl played it straight, against balanced by Rich Kronfeld's bizarre and hilarious "Wally Hotvedt." Highlights include segments such as "How to throw an old bowling ball" and "Tips on Dating", where the duo "date" a few hookers and Wally ends with the bitter complaint: "I could have done it myself!" <br /> <br /> Another segment - which did the duo on their days - stripped Steve in the beer, spiked out of the fridge, while Wally struggled to climb the cliffs at Taylor's Falls, in his stiff dressed. light blue jacket and excessive headphones. Hilarious! <br /> <br /> Wally's remarkable commentary on "league bowlers" and his struggle to apply the correct euphemism to various slits were also highlights. <br /> <br /> "Let's Bowl" was picked up by Comedy Central. and had a few good moments, but the network never really knew what to do with it, it did in the early days and emphasized the bowling competition. It was never the point of the show. The constant advertising interrupted the flow and the later characters (Ernie, the Pig, Butch, etc.) were more distractions than anything else. The whole thing forced and kind. Even Jon Stewart let us out on the daily show - (not enough lamb, funny jokes?) - a surprising treat for a performance that earned much better. <br /> <br /> How often do we come? come together in the world of modern television, a locally flavored mix of comic genius and total crap? The networks share the "total crap" cold, but it's a sad thing to watch them kill such a dark, weird, funny ginger like "Let's Bowl." <br /> <br /> Here's the hope they'll put it on DVD.
