German private TV is badly known for copying Dutch and? of course ?? American formats. Well, in the case of Edel & Starck, the xeroxing has gone as far as the basics: Screw Ball. <br /> <br /> You can't play screw ball comedy? Don't look Edel & Starck. Seriously. If you expect another lawyer's drama thing similar to Law & Order or something, you're going somewhere else. (Or look right and order because it's pretty brilliant about what it does, but I'm going out.) E&S is funny, often speaks of thought-provoking themes, is funny, romantic, funny, funny and witty. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I was very upset that the authors did not perform better after the series's final. And my cynical nature must review itself: private German television productions. German residents will understand what I'm talking about. <br /> <br /> In short: See it. I don't have the faintest that English synchronization is, but hey, it's worth German just to see their four seasons. Pseudo-happy ending included.
