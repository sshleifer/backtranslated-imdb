It's a great family program with great role players. It's a nice break from the reality show. There is nothing else like that on television at the moment unless you consider Joan or Arcadia as similar because it also has a teenage main character. Anyway, Clubhouse is worth a look, because Jeremy Sumpter gives the main character (Pete Young) a kind of delicacy and naive that is attractive without being sweet and cuddly. Dean Cain, Christopher Lloyd, Mare Winningham and Kirsten Storms make the rest of the leading role players, and each one is immense in their role. I really like Kirsten Storms as Pete's sister Betsy; She is quite a pill, but she still cares about her mother and brother, though she hates to show it. It may take a few episodes to really find the legs, but Clubhouse is easily one of the best shows to come together in a good long time. Make sure you did it!
