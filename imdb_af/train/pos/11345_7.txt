That's why I still have nightmares. <br /> <br /> This terrifying film (a musical) was considered suitable for children in the 1970s. <br /> <br /> Leaving a boy on a magical journey to an island. The mayor of the island, Pufnstuf, allegedly a dragon, who looks more like a newt with my conjunctivitis, and a witchcraft player, is targeted by a witch (Billie Halliday, who was considered a little good at that time) ). <br /> <br /> The whistle is being restored to an 'interesting' witch convention, with the witches having a gay age. The boy then carries on as a 'fairy' to restore the flute. <br /> <br /> Not suitable for children.
