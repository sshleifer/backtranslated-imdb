Personally, I find the movie quite a good watch. It describes the real situation of triads in Hong Kong and gives the viewer a look at how triads are organized. <br /> <br /> Not only that, it also shows the viewer how Hong Kong police control the triad situation and why the police are not just going out and dreaming out. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is rather violent due to the gangland methods of murder and torture. Nevertheless, the film remains true to the real world, so the violence on the screen is just a reflection of what really happens. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to any Triad / Mafia movie fans. Another good look will be Dragon Squad. That movie has more guns than this, because in this movie there are more knives than guns (I can't remember seeing a single gun).
