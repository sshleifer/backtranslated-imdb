I thought Hugh O'Conor was astonishingly young Christy Brown, and really deserved more recognition for his role. I couldn't believe how well he played the role. Of course, Daniel Day-Lewis was also brilliant. My favorite scene is where the boys play soccer and Christy uses his head to stop the goals and then kick the penalty! Wonderful performances by the two Christys (and others).
