I finally saw this movie tonight after being rented at Blockbuster (VHS). I have to agree that this is very original. Yes, maybe the characters aren't fully realized, but it's not one of those movies. On the contrary, we are treated to the director's eye, his vision of what the story is about. And it doesn't stop. And to be honest, I didn't want it. I believe Sabu had influenced the director of Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels and Run, Lola, Run. But I absolutely loved how the three lead. See the beautiful woman on the street to deduce them briefly. I really need to see these directors' other work, because this movie really made me do it. If you want insight, culture, solidity and urge, go somewhere else. If you want a laugh, camera movement and criminal care, look here.
