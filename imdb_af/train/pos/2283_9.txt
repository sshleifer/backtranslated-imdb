I haven't read the Kurt Vonnegut book it has been modified yet, but I'm familiar with some of his other work and wanted to see how it would be translated on the screen. In general, I think this is a very successful adaptation of one of Vonnegut's novels. It's about the story of a US resident in Germany named as a spy for the US. His job is to enter himself with high-quality Nazis and send secret messages to the Americans via his weekly radio show. But when the war ends, he is condemned as a war criminal but escapes to New York, where several strange plots are waiting. <br /> <br /> If Mother Night has a problem, it's likely to be a little too sentimental at times. But for most of the movies, the skmaltz is kept to a minimum and the very strange plot is performed with skill and aplomb. And there are some fantastic moments of black comedy that include three right-wing Christian fundamentalists and a very high Nazi in a prison cell. Highly recommended.
