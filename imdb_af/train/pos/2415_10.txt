I'm totally addicted to this show. I can't wait until the week goes by to see the next show. It's a good story line and it has the best actors and actresses on the show. I will be tuning every week to see it, even if I'm not at home, I've always set my vkr to the monarch cove. Simon Rex is the best actor on the show. This is exciting and exciting. I think this show should stay on the air and I believe everyone should vote to see it. I saw the very first episode and actually I didn't watch it, but one day I watched life and I decided to watch it because it was up and I love it absolutely and now it's my favorite show. I really mean it.
