This movie goes down in history as one of the big ones, right next to Citizen Kane, Casablanca and On The Waterfront. Someone please convince Leno to do a sequel! Leno and Morita are a comedy duo, like those not seen since Abbot and Costello. The evil that comes from Chris Sarandon, Tom Noonan, and Randall "Tex" Cobb will give you the chills. Dingman's character as the buffoonish chief hearken back to the days of Shakespeare's comedies. And the climax. My goodness, the climax. I won't ruin it for you, but it compares the blast of the Sterster pale. If you can find this hard to find gem, do yourself and your family a favor and buy it right away. I'm still hoping for a special DVD release one day.
