"Secret Sunshine" reminds me of "The Rapture" (1991), with Mimi Rogers and David Duchovny, but this Korean production is a better movie. It portrays super-religious Korean Christians in a provincial Korean city, and the main character's experiences vary with them in the wake of a terrible personal tragedy. Shin-ae is a widowed spouse who goes to Seoul with her young son to the city of Milyang ("Secret Sunshine" in Chinese). She chose Milyang because her late husband (murdered in a car accident) was born there and she felt that she had to make a new start in life in a new place. She does not respond well to the books of the local Christian zealots, one of whom tries to convince her to come to their church and prayer meetings. Shin-ae is essentially irreligious and brushes these people as politely as they can. In fact, she brushes off almost all in Milyang, but some of them are constantly trying to conquer her world, and the consequences are often hilarious. To say more would be to give away the movie, but it should be noted that the performance of the lead star (Jeon Do-yeon) is wonderful. After reading that she won the best actress in Cannes in 2007, I expected her a decent job. But Mrs. Jeon is fascinating and it is impossible to take her eyes off her when she is on the screen. The film is a kind of sad Evelyn Waugh esquire piece of work, which shows how Fate can feel as critical as unnecessary.
