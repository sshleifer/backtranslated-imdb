A standalone feature can now be seen as a work of filmmaking and a video resume. Break, and aggressively promote, twenty minutes of style and enthusiasm to save. But is it good like a movie, or does it just work as a demo piece? Oh, there's the rub. <br /> <br /> The broken is the story of Bonnie Clayton who wakes up after waking up a nightmare of a repeated nightmare by a "sadistic alien and his colorful entourage" (quote from the video box). While she is being held in prison, it becomes clear that her kidnappers know about things she didn't even know of herself. As they questioned her, a black-dressed soldier jumped into their hiding place in an attempt to save her. Mayhem ensues. <br /> <br /> Luckily for us, director Alex Ferrari seems to know what he is doing, or at least he is very good at letting it go. Broken does not suffer from a lack of visual flair, which is particularly commendable in view of its budget and the inexperience of all concerned. What it suffers from is poor and kind of derivative writing. Think Long Kiss Goodnight meets the Matrix, written ten minutes after reading Fight Club. The good news for Ferrari and producer / writer Jorge Rodriguez is that the story elements are easily ignored for the oodles of eye candy on display. Does the plot mean so much in a twenty minutes short to showcase the technical skills of its creators? No, not really. <br /> <br /> Although it would be unfair to me to ignore any negative aspects given the budget and length of the films. Broken is not a classical genre. The biggest problem was that it worked better than a full length. The final "turn" doesn't get enough build up to be shocking. If Ferrari is allowed to fire the event to burn the feature slowly, then plotting elements will look less random and the movie more complete. Here's to know he gets the chance. <br /> <br /> Audio Broken's Dolby Digital 5.1 presentation is the one for no one in the Indian world. I've never heard such an aggressive environment from such a small feature. The Matrix-inspired soundtrack is very rich and deep, shooting stories have a punch, and even the dialogue gets into the surround effects. Of all that is offered on this disc, it is the sound that praises modern independent DVD production. Also included is an equally impressive Dolby 2.0 surround track, which is the standard. <br /> <br /> Extra There are literally hours that the features on this disk can be made. There are so many extras, in fact, that I find it unrealistic to list and describe each of them, while still expecting my readers to continue reading. Whatever the shortcomings that the actual short can have, the DVD is unprecedented in its sources of information. People who enjoy the movie can learn everything about its production, including everything from conceptual art to promotional campaign. Those with the plans to make an indie movie of their own can only learn about everything they need to know about these features. <br /> <br /> The extras are divided into categorical menus. These include: pre-production, production, post-production, short, and casting and crew biomass. From a critical point of view, I found that some of the divisions were fairly short. If they were edited in one featurette per menu option, they would be less frustrating to navigate, as the cursor was the highest choice with each return to the main section menu. Of course this is just nitpicking, but maybe for future DVD publishers, the filmmakers will take my advice to heart. <br /> <br /> It has six sound comments and hours of interviewing and talented people, and despite the consonant sales, their true colors shine through. <br /> <br /> The willingness to share their movie secrets with anyone who picks up this DVD is pretty generous. From the extras I learned which software for editing and effects is most reliable and efficient, what kind of camera makes the most professional appearance for the lowest price, even where to get cheap air force weapons. In addition, I got several alternative options, if I couldn't find myself finding products used on this particular production. Wannabe filmmakers who don't want to read a book on the subject will do well to watch this DVD. Overall, I got the real short of 6 out of 10, but wish there was an option for feature length potential and effort because I got it an 8 or 9 in these fields. I recommend the DVD for its features and as a perfect example of what can be done with just eight thousand US dollars. Those who buy the DVD can see themselves as ghost producers for a bigger project, as the more attention these guys get, the more money the feature length version will get.
