*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> This movie, The Divers, is really interesting. All I knew about it was that it would speak Nazi history, underwater scenes and all people. But I decided to investigate it for one reason, the fact that the story is about a sunken WWII submarine. I have a fetish for German subs, especially wreckage that can be covered. So I was skeptical about the Danish part, but argued that the sub could weigh the part. To know that the North African films are not always so good and not sure of the budget, at least I was skeptical. <br /> <br /> At show I was ... surprised. <br /> <br /> I had thoughts about the actors who were inadequate, to see how some were very young, especially the two main actors. It wasn't a problem, they both did very well. Just like the other actors, who mostly consist of people in their 50's and beyond. It makes for some interesting interaction between young and old, not often seen on the screen. Not unique anyway, but somewhat scarce. And this is all good. <br /> <br /> In terms of Danish language, it's almost impossible to understand. But it was no problem, it had subtitles. <br /> <br /> Another problem was the submarine itself, I suspect there would be indoor shots as well as underwater off-shots from the submarine. After deciding that their budget was slender, I thought it might be good enough, and right at its worst. Once again I was amazed, the outer scenes of the wreck are beautiful and the indoor scene is very realistic. With a fetish for German parts, I knew how the sub looked, especially inside, and wasn't let down. The team did serious investigation. It's all good. <br /> <br /> I suspect more people than myself will see this movie just to see some subwakeful scenes, so I feel I should issue a "warning". The submarine in the movie is not a real model that existed during the war. It is a special purpose sub. But to give you an indication of what to expect, it's a cross between a type VII, type IX, and a Japanese transport sub similar to I-52. It is a good design for God and a beautiful wreck. <br /> <br /> The environment is on a Danish island or peninsula, I can't remember. It's summer and two brothers travel to their grandfather to celebrate the coming summer as they do each year. Their grandfather is a kind of singer. The cinematography is pretty pretty, very nice summer screens at the island docks, some new love, nice scuba diving and a general sense of "perfect". Again, this is all right. <br /> <br /> Plot-wise the island gets a few visitors of the suspicious kind, a meeting of men rents one of the boats, an old mining farmer and his crew. One of the visitors, a man in his 50's, tattooed the German eagle and swastika on his back. The island's senior citizens all remember when a German u-boat sank until the end of World War II and since then there have been rumors of Nazi gold in the depths. The grandfather was one of the young men who searched for the sunken u-boat shortly after the German bodies set fire back in 1945. No submarine was ever found. <br /> <br /> WHAT TO EXPECT <br /> <br /> Key elements are Nazi experiments, Nazi history, treasure hunting, secrecy, competition, teen love, conspiracy and ... a surprise. <br /> <br /> *** WARNING - SPOILER *** <br /> <br /> I didn't expect some elements of the supernatural to appear in this movie and it took me away. Not a huge fan of supernatural events, but it still fits well into the story and makes no problem. It's not like "From sunset to dawn" where everyone eventually comes to vampires. It's a little more subtle. <br /> <br /> GENERAL: Really good movie, I've given it an 8. Some are due to the fact that it is not a Hollywood movie with unlimited resources. I later learned that it had a fair budget and that some of the actors crossed the Danish veterans. But even if it was a Hollywood production, I would give it a 7 or 8. It's definitely worth it. Yes, a child's story in a way, but then a mature story. It has a lot of tension and a great aura of adventure, which I found very attractive. And again, cinematography is really nice. <br /> <br /> / Medusa 2001 <br /> <br />
