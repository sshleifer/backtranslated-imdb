I only saw this movie in a theater in France a year or so ago. It came and went with a little fanfare, but I enjoyed it for the beauty of landscape photography and the fascinating wildlife. (The story, while it's nice, is really coincidental. If you actually thought about it, there wasn't most of what could happen in real life.) I just saw it tonight in the United States on DVD. Again, I am collecting it has very limited distribution. Blockbusters only had one copy of it, and I don't remember playing in Cleveland's art houses. <br /> <br /> On my TV, photography is not that spectacular, though it is still very beautiful. . The wildlife photos are still fascinating. The story of the relationship between the 10-year-old child and the fox is even less convincing the second time you know where it is going. <br /> <br /> Yet, as I said, the story happened. It's a beautiful movie to watch, and if you like wildlife photos, you'll find this fascinating one.
