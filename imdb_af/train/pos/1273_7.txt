A simple movie in the beginning, a simple movie in the end. It does have the ending and pretense cliche, but most TV movies have it in any way. <br /> <br /> Christopher Reeve does a good job as an ex-con / drifter. The marriage between her and the woman he works for feels a little weird, but I believe it is credible for the time it was set. <br /> <br /> Now, I've seen the modified 'TV' version, even though the movie was made and shown on 'TV', I also find it a bit harsh. But I feel if I saw the whole piece, I would probably give it the same rating. <br /> <br /> J.T. Walsh does a good job, not his best role, but still .... a good job. <br /> <br /> 7/10
