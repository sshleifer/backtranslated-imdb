I only saw MURDER AT THE VANITIES in the new Universal Pre-Code set, and I was amazed at how much I enjoyed the vehicle. Most of the other commentators covered the story, a murder mystery within a musical, but I wanted to add some additional notes. Brisson and Carlisle are relatively vague, compared to even most of the minor players, and not one really looks the right voice for what they are singing (Carlisle is a trained opera singer, Brisson is a bit wobble on some of his highs and low note). The great Victor McLaglen and Jack Oakie play well apart, with an excellent timing that rolls the ball between music numbers. Yes, Lucille Ball and Ann Sheridan are Vanity's girls, but let's not forget the beautiful singer Ernestine Anderson in the "Ebony Rhapsody" number. Gail Patrick makes one of her early appearances, which sounds like Eve Arden; Patrick will be the executive producer of the Perry Mason TV series. Then there's Jessie Ralph as the wardrobe lover - you'll also see her in David COPPERFIELD (as Aunt Peggoty) and THE BANK DICK. The music is very good - Brisson presents the standard "Cocktails for Two" in two different scenes; "Sweet Marijuana" with barely dressed Peyote button girls in the background (blood dripping on the white skin's white skin was wonderfully cold); The "Ebony Rhapsody", with Duke Ellington's Orchestra and a bunch of beautiful dancers, both black and white, mixes it up. And I believe it's one of the only early musicals that contain such a mix - and the costumes leave nothing to the imagination.
