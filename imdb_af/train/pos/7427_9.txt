I saw the trailer for this movie in the 70's when I was barely 16 while watching another movie. O !!!! how excited me and my best friend was. we couldn't wait for the month or so until it came. I saw this movie at the theater 17 times that year. I love, love, love it. Kris is so perfect for the movie. He is brash and kinda trashy but also shy and insecure with Babs and it is so engaging to look at it again. If they sing evergreen in the studio and he knocks in with his gritty voice so much different from the perfect notes coming from her, but I always thought it was one of the best scenes in the movie. The way he looks at her and he's so proud. I can see this movie every day. We tried to dress as if I had even the long jersey and cap that was like the one she wore. It came on TV on time and I got my daughters to watch their teenagers and they loved it. Perhaps it's just that I was so caught up in an age when everything was extreme, don't know. The end still tears me today.
