It was extremely low budget (it looks like it was recorded with a home video recorder). However, it has a good plot line, and it's easy to follow. 8 years after she shot her sexually abusive step, father Amanda is released from the psychiatric ward, with the help of her doctor where she secretly has a relationship. The doctor ends her rent a home and buys her a car. But within the first 20 minutes of the film, Amanda killed him and buried him in her backyard. Then she sees her neighbor Richard, looks at him and stops nothing until she has him. She behaves innocently, but to another neighbor, Buzz finds out that Amanda killed that doctor and tried to kill Richard's wife Laurie (it's to Amanda and he gets it in the bath). Then his actions stop so innocent and kill Buzz and later try to kill Richard who she presumably loves and cares. And you have to rent the movie to find out if Amanda dies or not. Overall good movie, reminds me of my life, you know the whole fall for the neighbor and stop nothing until you share it.
