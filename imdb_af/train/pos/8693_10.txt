I was pretty young when it came out in the US, but I signed it from TV and watched it over and over until I memorized the whole thing. To this day I still find myself quoting it. The show itself was hilarious and has many famous characters, from Frank Sinatra, to Sylvester Stallone, to Mr. T. The voices were big and sounded like the characters they portrayed. The dolls were also well done, though a little creepy. I was surprised to find out recently that it was written by Rob Grant and Doug Naylor of Red Dwarf, a show I enjoy very much. As another person wrote earlier in a comment, I was also robbed of this great show by a "friend" who borrowed it and never returned. I wish there was enough demand for this show to justify a DVD release, but I don't think enough people heard about it. Oh yes, maybe I'll try e-bay ...
