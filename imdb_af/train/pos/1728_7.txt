The Wood Horse was one of the first "great" World War II escape stories, telling the true story of Eric Williams and others in their escape from Stalag-Lufft III in October 1943. I really like this movie but had to go through it VHS from Amazon in England and gets it transferred from PAL format to the US. I read the book when I was in the middle of the school after watching some of the movie on TV in the early 60's. The dramatic drama of Peter and John trying to escape from Germany during the war is more realistic than the trait of the escaped portrayed in the Great Flight. This movie is a lost treasure, which should be more available to American audiences.
