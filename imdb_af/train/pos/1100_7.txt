- Jim Blandings (Cary Grant) got a property in the country for his wife and children. He hopes to find the simple life. But building a home seems to be anything but simple. As the headaches and bills began to climb, they laugh too. Will Mr. Blanding ever get his dream home? <br /> <br /> - What makes this movie so special is the three main players - Grant, Myrna Loy, and Melvyn Douglas. Any one of three is able to carry a movie on their own, so when you combine their talents, almost every scene is special. Grant has always been a favorite of mine in this type of role. He's so good at playing the man at stake. Loy is always a joy to watch. The Thin Man films she made with William Powell are almost perfect. And Douglas has become a favorite of mine over the past two or three years. Douglas also appears in The Old Dark House, a particular favorite of mine. <br /> <br /> - The movie is definitely a product of its time. I get a kick from the imagination of a time when you can build a two-story, three-bedroom, four-bathroom home at $ 15,000 a year. Throw the fact that your two children attend private school and you have a living maid and it becomes almost imaginative. <br /> <br /> - For anyone who bought or built a home, many of the situations and predictions are that the Blanding findings are easily linked to today. And that's where the comedy comes. How many people did some of the stupid things the couple do in this movie just to cost more money than expected? - The biggest complaint I have about Mr. Blends are the whole "woman in love with the best friend" subplot. It is really not necessary to make the plot and feel out of place and very uncomfortable as offered.
