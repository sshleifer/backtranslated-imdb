After a long hard week behind the desk, all the pond makes serious decisions, this movie is a great way to relax. Like Wells and the original radio broadcast, this movie will take you away to a land of strange humor and sci-fi paradise. "Captain Zippo is dead in the great Buick charge. He was a brave man." The Jack Nicholson impressions shine right through the alien face with the dark sunglasses and leather jacket, and always remember to watch out for the "donut of the death! " Keep in mind the number one rule of this movie - suspension of unbelief - sit back and relax - and "Prepare to die the Earth Scum!" You just have to see it for yourself.
