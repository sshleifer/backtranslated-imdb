As a young teenager at the time, Airwolf was forced to look for a generation who wanted their "Cowboys and Indians" to have great gadgets and whiz-scared explosions. <br /> <br /> In many ways, the show was mainly Knight Rider in the air: similar cartoon technology, a central character that was essentially a loneliness, and in the concept of one man making a difference. <br /> <br /> But in other important ways it was thematically very different from Knight Rider, Street Hawk, The A-Team and other action shows of the time. For one thing, the starting point of the series is not the desire to help people in need, but by Stringfellow Hawke's possession of Airwolf for substantial selfish reasons (as leverage to try to find his MIA brother, St John). And then there is the dark edge that the series firmly places in an 80-year-old Cold War context, with Soviet espionage and Central American dictators, not to mention the enemy. Certainly, the A-team constantly returned to Vietnam and the team's status as refugees, but it was generally done with a light touch and was rarely central to the plot itself. With Airwolf, the plot was the key to the show and direction of the show - although it was (unacceptably) diluted as the series progressed. <br /> <br /> With the retrospect, the Cold War series is clearly the series, many of the stories are cracked and confronted, and much of what Airwolf does is clearly indescribable, even with today's technology. But it's not really the point. Airwolf was ripe worm, it told interesting stories without relying on the big action series, and it didn't do sugar cover. It miraculously ensured that no one died. Sometimes it failed, but it was incredibly successful - and on a TV budget to start. <br /> <br /> For British readers, DMAX (Sky channel 155) just started (Jan 2008) daily airwolf revivals. Set your Sky + box for this blast from the past - we can even get the reprocessed (and unfortunately much inferior) fourth season, which has never before been shown in the UK to my knowledge.
