This movie I was dead to see. Well, it has so far decided to rent it. It was totally worth it. This movie made me laugh from the beginning to the end. Chris Rock is funny, no matter what movie he is. However, it must be really close to being its greatest. If you look at a family movie, that is, pre-teenagers then it's one you can't overcome.
