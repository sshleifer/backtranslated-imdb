This film has a rotting core of flexible morality, yet a strange sense of justice. So many of the regular Joes among us would love to keep it to the MAN. The "MAN" in this case is represented by several characters. Mr. Keller, who reports Carla to her office. Later, Paul owed 70 to Mr. Marchand the club owner. And then there is Paul's parole officer. There seems to be so much question about this last character's side story. Reviewers point it out as a weakness in an otherwise well-crafted underground game of table tennis between our two main players, rising tit-for-tat until their lives change dramatically. They are seen by every agent of the "MAN". One or both can be fired, killed or captured if they do not do as they are told. <br /> <br /> The movie has a sense of relief at the end. Carla finally gets laid. Her boss is forced to be a while. Mr. Club Owner is a shabby mess in his own bathroom. They get the $ money $. And ... they don't have to worry about reporting to the Parole officer, because his moral weakness leads him to bump his wicked wife into the basement (or whatever police have arrested him). It's a critical subconscious trigger to the lock-rocker that thrills us so hard. Remember that someone else can get Paul's file later to oversee his release; for the moment they are free! They can even get away with it! <br /> <br /> Woohoo ... <br /> <br /> They put it to the man!
