I enjoyed one of the spectacular episodes of every episode of Pushing Daisies this season, hoping that the authors strike will not brutally end the very good performance. Ned is a pie who owns a restaurant in the city center and has a secret talent. Emmerson is a private investigator with his own unique traits such as his love of knitting. Charlotte (Chuck) is the once-dead but-no-longer childhood friend and sunny place of Ned's life. Olive oil is the jealous but good-natured waitress. Oh, and add the dog. Jim Dale brings all the characters along with his wonderful tale of the show. Chuck, Ned and Emmerson with Olive and sometimes the dog releases several murder mysteries, with the help of Ned's special gift to kill people. The show is funny, clean and romantic in a very nice and good way, and I would recommend it to anyone.
