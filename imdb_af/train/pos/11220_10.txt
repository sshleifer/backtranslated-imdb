Aim for the top! Gunbuster is one of those anime series that wrote classic about it. I loved this series completely and to this day it remains my favorite anime. And while it wasn't Gainax's first animated product, it was their first OVA series. <br /> <br /> Primarily starting as a parody of the 1970s sports drama Aim For The Ace (Ace O Nerae!), Gunbuster is counting on steam as a serious drama by the end of episode 2, when Noriko Takaya is forced to revive her father's death, murdered in man's initial encounter with the insect race. Humanity is at war with. It is because of her father's death that Noriko wants to become a fighter plane. But her lack of confidence sometimes appears to be temporary and his fall. Her friend, Kazumi Amano, even doubted that Noriko was chosen as a pilot. However, Noriko coach Koichiro Ota has confidence in her. And he made it his personal mission to see that she succeeded in becoming a pilot because he was a survivor of the battle in which Noriko's father was murdered. <br /> <br /> Other characters include Jung-Freud, a Russian combat pilot assigned to serve with squadron Noriko and Kazumi belonging to Smith Toren, a love affair for Noriko murdered in their first sortie , and Kimiko Higuchi, Noriko's childhood. Kimiko's involvement is also important because while Noriko is in space, Kimiko stays on Earth to live a normal life. And because of the eclipse, Kimiko is usually on Earth, while Noriko is relatively the same age as when she left school. By the end of the series, Noriko is about 18, while Kimiko is in her mid-fifties. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a great anime series to see if you're a giant robot fan. mecha and Gainax animation. If you like Hideaki Anno's other performances, or are a fan of Haruhiko Mikimoto's artwork, give this show a chance. It will grow on you.
