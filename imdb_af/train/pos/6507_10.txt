This series, which is probably the most favorable time after World War II events, is at a value that is far beyond the individual's presumption of criticism. <br /> <br /> The timing of World at War's production in 1974, which is about three decades after the events of the war, allows an accurate relationship of events in a way that is unfinished by the remaining propaganda and slashes. The course of thirty years makes it possible to be backed by an impressive and fascinating panoply of the individuals concerned. It ranges from some of the highest military and political figures to the field soldiers, civilians and such survivors of the death camps as having remained to testify to the unthinkable inhumanities of civilized people. Most interviewed or well-off in their senior years, the interrogated subjects had enough time to reflect on their experiences and in most cases had enough time for what propaganda and zeal they might have in the past to be disposed of. Only the memories of what they saw and what they did. <br /> <br /> The information that these survivors give is remarkably enhanced by the attitudes and expressions they display while they share, giving their stories more and more impact. Such names as Ira Eaker, Adolph Galland, Louis Mountbatten, Albert Speer, Gertrude Junge (Hitler's personal secretary) ... the list is too long to relate. <br /> <br /> Today, within the lifetime of the survivors of this tremendous lesson in the terrible price of political ambition, young people are experiencing the same kind of militaristic and nationalist warfare as a result of World War II. The DVD series we are discussing here should be at the heart of a compulsory school history history, that the lessons purchased at such a terrible cost in those days should not have been wasted, but should be taken to heart by those who did not see the first-hand price tremendously. <br /> <br /> I am almost ready to watch the 11 disk set as I saw most of the series when a local TV channel broadcast it more than 10 years ago. It has lost nothing of my poignancy, and is even more of a wonderful chronicle of some of the darkest days of human times. <br /> <br /> The highest possible rating seems unworthy to apply to this listing. . I think the value of this series is out of line.
