Yes, be My Love was Mario Lanza's skirt for fame and is still popular today. His voice was strong and steady, so powerful that MGM decided to use it in The Great Caruso. Lanza himself thought he was the reincarnation of Caruso. After reading the book by Kostelanitz who wrote a biography of Lanza, he explains that the constant practice and vocal lessons have become the visionary Caruso to Lanza. There is no doubt that Lanza did an excellent job in the story, but the story is not quite true; blame it on Hollywood! For years I sang his songs, and became pretty good until I lost my voice to emphysema / asthma ten years ago. Achieving the High Note of Be My Love is not easy; but beautiful!
