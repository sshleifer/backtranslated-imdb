The film never claims to be anything spectacular like many movies. The movies propose him as a fun and entertaining time. And that's exactly what it was. This is the Korean version of a male. Bring it on. <br /> <br /> From the start you can feel for the rest of the movie and how it will end, but the pleasure is not in the surprise twist. the way the movie is a carbon copy of another. Instead, the pleasure of traveling is how the two remaining "thugs" became men in their own right. That's why the movie is fun and entertaining. <br /> <br /> The camera works, specially, the dolly movements were very well executed. The writing, which was a bit weak, was extremely pleasant in that the characters were not 2-dimensional, but they were full of life and desire. This movie won't win any Oscars, or any DVD blockbuster sales, but a fun look and a fun experience.
