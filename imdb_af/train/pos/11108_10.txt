Well ... easily my favorite TV series ever. Call me a walk-post clich√©, but include violence, mafia, sex, gambling, drugs, etc. In on a show and you already win points in my book. Combine everything with acting that overshadows everything you've ever seen on the small screen, directing what suits the vintage of the vintage and most of the writing that blows the mind (and a few brains a long way) And you got yourself a show that would be pretty hard to compete with. <br /> <br /> Above all, two actors, James Gandolfini as Tony Soprano, and Edie Falco as his wife Carmela ... as for Gandolfini, he adjusts his role in a way that words cannot express , if you didn't see him as Tony, see it now! <br /> <br /> I can continue with every character in the show, the psychic glory, the gripping scenes, etc. but you will not be able to stop me. All I can say is that it's about the only show with Seinfeld. I can watch from time to time and even enjoy it. more.
