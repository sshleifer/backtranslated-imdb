One of director Miike Takashi's best. It's so good it's hard to put into words. At almost fifteen years older than the target audience, it welcomed me from start to finish. <br /> <br /> It is reminiscent of similar children's films from the 1980s in the sense that (unlike today) those movies were not afraid to scare - There are many nasty details here that I initially found, but I soon realized it was nothing more than I had grown up. The film is a compilation of an 80-year-old children's film convention. You call it, it's there: a young boy hero threw himself from his own unhappy / dysfunctional world to another, inhabited by mythical and mystical goblins; an endeavor to save both worlds of evil power; a beautiful heroine, he has a love of; a sadistic henchwoman (Go-Go Yubari from Kill Bill Vol. 1); a leading villain who can draw his evil power from something that everyone in the world can handle. But all these genre conventions get a fresh twist and more depth. <br /> <br /> One of the IMDb reviews begins "Where was this movie when I was a kid?" and this is a sentiment that I wholeheartedly agree with. Even as I watched it, I complained about the fact that I didn't grow up; that it was not part of my childhood like Labirint, Masters of the Universe and, to a lesser extent, The Neverending Story. Those movies, and others like The Goonies, are recalled but never copied. Miike offers us a new approach. <br /> <br /> Poor CGI is a staple of many of its films, sometimes due to budget constraints, but just as often an artistic choice - a desire to present things in a strange way. Here, the CGI is mostly average, only because of budget constraints, yet it does a fantastic job of making a spectacle. The CG effects combine with traditional dolls, animatronics and truly extraordinary make-up to create a world of rich characters (and characterization) that often fall on the visionary border. <br /> <br /> These ranks are one of the greatest children's films ever made. Not for younger or sensitive children though. <br /> <br /> Just jaw-droppingly wonderful. See it for yourself and if you think your children can handle it, show it to them. Let them grow up on the Great Yokai War as a small remuneration for the fact that you couldn't.
