A visit by Hitler in Rome is the backdrop to this gentle story of love, friendship, homosexuality and fascism. Sophia Loren plays the housewife and mother of six children who stay home while her whole family goes to the military parade in honor of Hitler and Mussolini. She must stay home because the family cannot afford a daughter. She would have liked to go, as she is an inventive fan of Il Duce along with the entire housing complex where she lives. <br /> <br /> However, there is one exception. Across the yard, Marcello Mastroianni sits on his chair considering suicide. The reason? He is homosexual and therefore he recently lost his job as a radio presenter. The movie really goes off when these two people meet by chance. Mastroianni is in despair and in need of a friend. Loren, frustrated by her own scammer, misunderstands Mastroianni and, in a masterful shot, directing and playing on the roof of the building complex, offers her body only rejected. The initial shock is soon replaced by her hunger for this man, this anti-fascist, this homosexual, this other world who is so willing to give her everything she desires. <br /> <br /> It's a beautifully crafted movie featuring two of the most talented actors ever. Loren shows here that she is an actress of caliber when it is well directed. It is a simple yet powerful film about fascism, love, ordinary people and most importantly the human condition. Despite his sad end, there is a glimpse of hope in the unbundling, things will change, someone understands.
