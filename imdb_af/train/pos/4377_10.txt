The early to mid 90's was, in my opinion, a highlight for the historical drama. Last of the Mohicans, Braveheart, Rob Roy - all portrayed a distinctive passion and intensity in their respective periods. <br /> <br /> Rob Roy was a unique and intriguing taste of a time and place rarely represented by movies. It really has everything - interesting story, great acting, remarkable dialogue and breathtaking scenery. I was especially impressed with the seemingly true dialogue. I think this is how early 18th century people spoke and behaved. <br /> <br /> Something else that surprised me was the vulgarity that the characters expressed. I found it to be more repulsive and shocking, although it is often more subtle than most found in modern-day movies. The film had a very racial and sexually charged edge. It was unique and probably very realistic in the context of the era. <br /> <br /> The pass was very strict, with barely a dull moment. There were many intriguing and political subplots that made things a bit complicated, yet the main story didn't detract. <br /> <br /> The action was also very well done and gripping. Something I will find remarkable forever is that during the highlight action in the movie, there is no soundtrack. It makes a very exciting, exciting sequence, as we do not point out the musical direction and resolution of the scene. <br /> <br /> Rob Roy always stays high on my favorite movies list. I would recommend it.
