Very good point: "Only an elite couple (the higher classes) will both have internet access and can communicate on an exclusive English-speaking website like the IMDb." Some may think the Internet is not real, but this view really puts the media society and democracy at risk: You are probably right. Even if there are Internet cafes in Venezuela, most Chavez fans will not even be able to rent a computer for half an hour to comment on IMDb. <br /> <br /> Screw your fascist higher-class rich right-wing capitalist liberal intellectual depressions. Probably this is your first time using the internet;) ..
