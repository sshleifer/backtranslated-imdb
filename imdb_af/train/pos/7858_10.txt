TESS OF THE STORM COUNTRY is probably the best film of all Mary Pickford's films. At two o'clock, it was quite a long time for a 1922 movie, but your interest remains about 80 years after it was filmed. Maria gives one of her best performances, sometimes the role looks like a great hit performance with little of Mary the innocent, Maria the little devil, Maria the little mother, Maria the spit fire, Maria the romantic heroine, etc. Often used features of a single film in the past. The film is surprisingly honest about one supporting character's illegal child for 1922 and at one point our Little Mary thought the unconscious mother! If the Academy Awards were around in 1922, the best actress Oscar would be Mary's for the year.
