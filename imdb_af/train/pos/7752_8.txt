Barman just wanted to make a movie because he wanted to. Just as simple as that, and he succeeded. Not only in his purpose, but also in making a wonderful movie, especially visually. He knows how to cook pans, slow-motion rows, tracking shots, crane shots, etc. Use in a beautiful, smooth way. It gives the film a very relaxing feeling. <br /> <br /> The story is about the lives of 8 many different characters who have nothing in common except one thing: a party everyone participates in, which is also the turning point of this movie. The beauty of this picture does not matter how the characters have an effect on each other (compared to a similar, naturally better film such as Magnolia). I just don't think it was Barman's idea. The beauty lies in the various details of experiences that people go through that make or break their lives. Bartender is very successful in telling those little stories that describe little experiences. He knows people ..... and Antwerp. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack of the movie is also excellent, but not a surprise, because we know that Barman is also a very successful songwriter and musician with his band dEUS. The music is sometimes warm and relaxing at the same time, which adds to the sunny, smooth feel of the movie. Other times we hear funky pop / rock melodies that give some scenes the power they need. <br /> <br /> There's only one mistake, and that's the last half hour. Was it the maturity, what broke me? Or were not the last scenes that until then were fresh and accurate than the screens? I can't figure it out. <br /> <br /> All in all, a beautiful sunny movie that lifts the Belgian theater. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10! <br /> <(This is the wind that flows through a girl's hair on a sunny afternoon, which makes her even more beautiful: it's the fresh breeze that lets you relax when it comes to you at a fun party when someone opening the door, it is the wind that carries the perfume of that beautiful girl next to you in the park you met only a week ago, that is the breeze .....) <br /> <br />
