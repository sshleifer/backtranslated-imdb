In the seemingly endless quest to find well-made, well-activated horror movies, it's all too scarce to find one that even hits near the tip. Needless to say, I was very pleasantly surprised when I stumbled upon a US cable network over 'Burned at the Stake' while I was channels. The premise is pretty simple. In 1692, young Ann Putnam (Swift) is the most vocal witness against alleged witches, the negligence of baseless charges against anyone deserving her dissatisfaction. Manipulate her for his own purposes, is Reverend Parris (Peters) who also serves as the court's guide to witchcraft and Satanism. Things get complicated when Ann starts accusing members of the Goode family of witchcraft. Salem (from 1980 or so), Loreen Graham (also played by Swift), began shortly before his vision of the Salem Witch Museum. A strange man in the seventeenth-century ration tries to close her there and the building. He bumps her while strange phenomena involve her more and more. Soon it appears she is in possession of the spirit of Ann Putnam. Unfortunately, further description becomes more involved and will give away too much. Although the film is not action-oriented and probably would be of little interest to many viewers, the performances are good and the seventeenth-century dialogue used in the movie's flashes sounds very convincing. The production values ​​are solid with the possible exception of some special effects. In a side note was the film's technical advisor Laurie Cabot, Salem's official witch. Viewers who appreciate a well-made, atmospheric but understated horror movie can appreciate it. Author / director, Bert I. Gordon, has had a long career in horror and science fiction films and is best known for his work on a number of great story movies and similar works.
