Put the camera on me, is a scary cute movie. This is actually a complex look at the psychology of children and offers interesting insights into the development of adults and artists. On the surface it is a nostalgic look at some home movies made in the 80's by a group of top-class nearby children. One of the film's directors, Darren Stein, has access to a video camera and has taken over quickly as the artistic leader for all the movies. Sure, it's just some cute kids who have fun. But it is also much more. It's a glimpse into a few moments in time as children struggle with a number of confusing issues that we all face in life --- fear, sexual awakening, unrequited love, loneliness, and just trying to make sense Make the mature world that seems to be exploding around us. As we get older, we tend to forget how overwhelmingly the realities of life were when we were little. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie even more valid is watching a young Darren Stein turn to a small general of a movie maker. It is clear that Darren is performing this show and these little movies are his vision, but they are all informed by his friends, their problems, the interpersonal dynamics and the general confusion about the horrors of adult life. Many children make home movies, but I have never heard of or seen children create "small" movies about the holocaust, homosexuality, nuclear war and the inability to fit in and make friends. These kids face and deal with some heavy stuff! <br /> <br /> The power of this movie is the way Stein and Shell draw different screens together, so stiff with the running of interviews with kids --- all now adults and all still friends. It adds a new angle to the movie. How many of us stayed in contact with our childhood friends? These guys have. And many of the problems they have to deal with are two more decades later. <br /> <br /> Among the conflicts - a confession of a loved one reveals a broken heart, a very normal sexual experience for children is still a "tough" subject between two of the men, some turbulent grudges about the dynamics of relationships and there is still a member of this team that stays in control and in the middle stage! It makes perfect sense, as one watches these home movies over the course of a few years. Darren Stein is a director. No doubt about it. <br /> <br /> Stein and Shell take turns talking to each other from time to time and we can't help imagining the inconvenience of looking at the young people's lives. This is especially true for Stein, who has made great use of the entertainment industry as a film producer, writer and director. From the first moment of THE CAMERA ON ME, we can see the rise of a gay boy trying it all out. We also see sides of the artistic mind and personality that are not always "nice" or "caring" - and it is a brave move for any artist to share with an audience. <br /> <br /> There are so many revealing moments, but the most disturbing and complex moments include a movie in which we see a Jewish concentration camp tortured and murdered by a Nazi victim. We discover through interviews and narration that the Nazi is being played by a Jewish child and the part of the victim is played by a pagan. It is a painfully disturbing moment that understands much less of a child in the darker side of fear and the way children work through the horrors of the adult world that is out of adulthood. <br /> <br /> It's much more than some home movies. This documentary captures the pain, beauty, joy and sadness of growing up. Powerful stuff --- and worth seeing! <br /> <br />:
