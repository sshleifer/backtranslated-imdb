Although I haven't seen this mini-series for more than twenty years, I still remember how the balance between character, plot and story of wonderful adventures has passed. The use of special effects was limited to making a more poetic rather than literal story of the story. The two versions I have seen are called (English and French), but the actors do not only speak their own language Italian, so there is a synchronization problem. It doesn't spoil the storytelling. Among the Cast Irene Pappas as Penelope are the most recognizable to North Americans. Recommended to all followers of Odysseus who ever return.
