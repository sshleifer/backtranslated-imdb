Rich, alcoholic Robert Stack falls in love with Secretary Lauren Bacall. He married her and was so happy that he stopped drinking. Bacall, however, loves secretly Stack's best friend, Rock Hudson. And Stacks' nimfomanian sister Dorothy Malone desires Rock. Throw in some complications and the movie goes well. <br /> <br /> Very shiny movie in beautiful Technicolor with jaw fashion and furniture (see Bacall's hotel room at the beginning). Everyone looks perfect and dresses in beautiful, shapely clothes. Actually, it's a soap opera operation with grade A production values. The story itself is fun and some of the dialogue is initially hilariously at the top. The acting of Hudson, Stack and Bacall is not that good, but to see them as young and attractive is fantastic ... especially Stack ... when he smiles, my knees have become weak! Dorothy Malone, on the other hand, is fantastic - she has earned the best supporting actress for her role. She is sexy, violent, dirty and sympathetic ... all convincing. <br /> <br /> Fun, shiny garbage. Don't miss it!
