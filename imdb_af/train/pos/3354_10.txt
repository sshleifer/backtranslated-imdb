This movie is finally on DVD in Italy (completely recovered). I have seen this movie so many times and I actually actually find it (2003) when Italy again suffers from some kind of brainwashing dictatorship (or the US for that matter). I'm glad there are outcasts like the one who played Mastroianni in this movie that can sing out of the voice; Maybe they can teach the Sophia Lorens of this world how to be strong and to fight to be recognized as humans. <br /> <br /> Back to the movie: as most people mentioned here, the play is wonderful, but the sound background is amazing. I must assume that something is lost if you do not understand the Italian language, but I can assure you that the display of machism, the distortion of reality in the eternal radio chronicle of the Hitler visit to Rome can make you tremble! <br /> <br /> A masterpiece <br /> <br />
