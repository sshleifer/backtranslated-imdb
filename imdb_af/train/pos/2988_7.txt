The original with Barbara Stanwyk is only saved by Stanwyk's performance. The story and other performances are too sickly sweet and the movie itself is too dated to really enjoy today. Bette Midler's version is much more interesting. She is Stella Claire, an independent, generous single woman who conceives and refuses her friend (Stephen Collins) or her friend (John Goodman in an underperformed show). She raises her daughter Jenny played so well by Trini Alvarado and concludes that Jenny's father can do better for her and ultimately make a life-changing decision. Through the film there are many laughs, tears and unforgettable moments, mostly between Midler and Alvarado. Marsha Mason co-stars as Jenny's stepmother, although admittedly a very good influence on her. If you like Midler, Goodman or just great movies with lots of emotion, you'll enjoy Bette Midler's version of STELLA.
