I must say the worst part of the movie was the first half hour. I was really confused about who was who. For example, Bill Paxson's character had long hair and had a jacket. When all the men arrived at the camp, it appeared that there was a character that looked like Bill Paxson, but it wasn't. I said where is Bill Paxson? Then there was a guy with his girlfriend. He said she was 21. It was supposed to be a 20-year-old reunion of the camp director (Alan Arkin) most memorable. Later it was the same girl who had interaction and talk about her camping experiences. It does not make sense. She would have been one year old. That said, the movie was pretty good. Kevin Pollak was the nice guy who was always harassed. One man was a complete daffodil, and eventually lost his beautiful friend. Alan Arkin was interesting as an old-camp camp director, admitting he came out with modern youth. The best part was that none of the adult campers were successful in life. None of them had very good careers. It was a very real life. The movie is compared to The Big Chill. In some ways it wasn't as exciting as the Big Chill, but it was much more realistic. So, although the beginning is not promising, the movie has become a pretty good one.
