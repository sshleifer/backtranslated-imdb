In the white balloon and crimson gold, the two other films by Jafar Panahi I have seen, the director surprises the depth of depth in subjects that appear on the surface. In Offside, Panahi's serial comedy tribute to Iranian women who stand for their rights, I don't think he is so successful. Not that what he says is of course not important (and it's too bad that, like every other Panahi movie, Iranians can't see it). But after a while, the film feels a bit flat, and it even feels 90 minutes. But I didn't say I didn't. The actors are all fantastic, and the festival at the end of the film is contagious. But that is not an important job, in my opinion.
