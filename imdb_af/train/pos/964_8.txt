"Yokai Daisenso" is a children's movie by Takashi Miike, but as you might expect, it's probably a bit too dark and scary for younger ones. However, older children may eat well, that is, if you have been baptized in English. <br /> <br /> The story is that of a young boy who left with his mother to stay with his grandfather after a divorce. During a village festival, the boy is chosen as a Kirin rider, a great honor, but with that honor, of course, a lot of danger and adventure comes. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the evil acts are at hand as a woman In a white mini-dress, go-go boots and a beehive, boast an evil Yokai to turn people's grudges and items against them throw. And this evil has revealed itself as a flying city in the form of a monster that heads the city of Rage itself, Tokyo. One very funny scene has two villains who see the monster flying over the city ... say one, "Oh, it's just Gamera". <br /> <br /> The young boy is befriended by Yokai, who is a kind of monster, mostly benign, who took himself away from people, and all the Yokai in Japan worked together to fight the evil. <br /> <br /> In many ways, Miike & Crew has taken the Yokai films of the late 60's / early 70's and become a modern action adventure movie for older kids that also combine some strange mechanical monsters that made Transformers think. The appearance of the movie is great, the effects are entertaining, and some of the humor will just sail across the child's heads, but still older can enjoy it. As for adults, there is not much to love. If you're a fan of Japanese monster movies, you'll enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Cool and fun stuff, sometimes dark but maybe it's just Miike .. and what a wild ride. 8 out of 10.
