<br /> <br /> Have you ever felt watched as someone likes every move you make? Well, just before you decide to break the law, the FBI will always be there. At least this is the feeling you get after watching the gripping but slightly soft crime drama, The FBI story. It traces the roots of the organization of a small desk to one of the most modern facilities in the world (in 1959) by telling the story through the eyes of one of his agents, Chip Hardesty (James Stewart). <br /> <br /> Today, Chip was one of the FBI's and he likes to work above everything else in the world, even his family. The FBI story follows his life by describing what he does as an agent and how to influence one of his personal lives. The film does a spectacular job of showing what kind of issues the FBI is dealing with and how they handle it. The audience gets cockpit Ku Klux Klan riots, goes into hiding to resolve an Indian murder / estate scandal, arrests refugees, saves hostages and helps fight in World War II. He even helped bring communist spies for justice. <br /> <br /> Stewart, in a vaguely complex performance, is stellar (as always) as the slightly neurotic agent she may love a little too much. One of the best parts of this movie is that we see the inner workings of both Chip's family life and his work. We testify that he is suffering from the death of his best friend and then his son. We also see that his wife has a miscarriage, and his marriage has rocky times. Almost all of his personal problems are caused by the love of his work. Vera Miles gives a spicy performance, but it is very convincing, not. She was never a brilliant actress, but there was always something very attractive and attractive to her. Well, maybe it's just me? Unfortunately, none of the other shows is worth mentioning, but the engaging story has been very interesting to me. <br /> <br /> The movie of this movie was impressive, especially the scenes in the South American jungle. The colors all have a texture that really sets the atmosphere of the film. Perhaps most of this movie is Mervyn Leroy's fantastic direction. Every scene was so moist that they just rolled up to tell a brilliant story. It's full of ingenious camera shots, some with a lot of Hitchcockian feel. <br /> <br /> All in all, The FBI Story is a spectacular but obsolete movie. Clicking in for two and a half hours, some viewers can be intimidated, but if you get the chance, I suggest jumping into this one. I enjoyed Jimmy Stewart's spectacular show and the fascinating story.
