Also known as "Trap to Heaven" in the US. During World War II, British Peter Carter (David Niven) airplane was shot in battle, but he survived. He meets and falls in love with the lovely June (Kim Hunter). But it seems like a mistake was made in heaven - he had to be dead! A French spirit comes to get him, but he refuses. He will soon plead his case before a Heavenly Tribunal that he should be allowed to live. <br /> <br /> Sounds ridiculous, but it's actually an incredible movie. The script is good with the actors who played the roles completely straight and it is beautifully aimed - the scene on Earth is in breathtaking Technicolor (I have never seen such beautiful blue sky) and the scenes in Heaven are black and white ! Niven is sometimes stiff, but Hunter is just fine (and very nice) and Roger Livesey is great as a doctor helping Niven. The images throughout are wonderful (especially the stairs and during the final test sequence) and the special effects are really good (considering the age of the movie). There is also a very strange sequence when Niven walks into a completely naked young boy who creates sheep! It's an absolutely beautiful, thought-provoking movie - highly recommended. It remains unknown in the US which is a shame.
