I was amazed at how a movie can both be cheesy and excellent. The Frisbee flying saucer wasn't sensible, especially when it landed, but the special effects the Krell attacked were wonderful for a movie made over half a century ago! In the Middle East, I saw the shades of Islam, when JJ Adams suggested that Alta should dress more modestly and, as an engineer, was amazed at the imagination used for the 'futuristic' gadgets, and gizmos dreamed by the props department . All in all, an entertaining hour and a half, my first time seeing Walter Pidgeon and a chance to see Leslie Neilsen as a 'young man'.
