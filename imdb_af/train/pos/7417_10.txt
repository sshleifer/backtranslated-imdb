This beautiful story of an older son who comes home and learns to love and be part of all the things he has left to get away is dirty and moving. It shows a society that may be strange to us in the Western world, with a sense of family we've lost. The story is beautiful, sad, and sometimes funny and comical. It has a sense of realism that we no longer want to see in our Western movies. <br /> <br /> The play is unusual, as the film progresses, giving it almost the impression that it is not acting, but a documentary of ordinary people. This is brilliant directing and filmmaking. <br /> <br /> Want to see more movies by this director.
