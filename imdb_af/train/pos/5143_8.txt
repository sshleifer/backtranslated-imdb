With fast interference of scenes from crazy people in an asylum, and montage / superimposition of images, and vague, interwoven stories, it's a very difficult movie to follow. Apparently, a man (Masue Inoue) acts as a porter or guardian in an asylum so he can be near his prison wife, and maybe save her. But she was clearly angry, chopped on the floor, with a free expression much of the time and fear, misery and confusion that the rest of the time was written on her face. The filmmaker sometimes moves to her point of view and we see vague images of her on the side of a dam drowning a baby or clinging to a drowning child. She was bothered by something. When the point of view shifts to her or other crazy people, the film maker uses lenses and such things, which shows us what crazy people are seeing and how they react. And the place swarms with crazy people, laughs, hides, and in one case, Fransies dance day and night. At one point the man tries his wife outside, but the night outside the door scares her and she walks back to her cell. Gradually, the man in a nightmare he interrupted in another attempt to steal her, killing the doctor and many workers and laughing and complaining. When he wakes up, he is relieved and the floor mumbled. Some fascinating shots of Japan's life, streets, buildings in the 1920s.
