What a wonderful Barbara Stanwyck movie I saw the other night. "Jeopardy" was fantastic. It was made in 1953 and probably for dual accounts, but it kept me on the verge of my chair. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwyck plays Helen, who with her husband Doug (Barry Sullivan) and son (Lee Aaker) go to an isolated fishing spot in Mexico for a holiday. Man has a fall out of the jetty and the only way he has to be saved is if Barbara drives back to a garage for a rope. <br /> <br /> As she walks in a psychotic killer (Ralph Meeker - one of my favorites) and what follows is a game cat and mouse, because Barbara tries everything in her power to get Meeker to join come back with her to free her husband. <br /> <br /> The movie was so exciting and such a surprise - I didn't expect such a good movie. But I think I should have realized. Is there anything Barbara Stanwyck does, is it something less than wonderful?
