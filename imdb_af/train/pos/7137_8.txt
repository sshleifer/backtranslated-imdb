The plot of GOODNIGHT MR TOM on paper makes us look like a big dose of maudlin, sick sentiment. But talented director Jack Gold is an expert in touching the emotions in the right way, and it rather appears as a compelling, dramatic dramatic drama with excellent production and main achievements. One of the best, if not the best, TV movies of the 1990s, which could have been even more successful if released in the theater. <br /> <br /> Of course, the evacuation of children to rural towns and villages in World War II was a common practice, but in the case of the young boy here was doubly important due to a miserable home life in the British capital. However, the horrors of the war on the front are not being overtaken, and the construction of the film until it is flying, with a misty eye, ends with a sense of optimism despite what has happened before. It is almost (but not quite) worthy to compare with the finale until it is a wonderful life (1946). All in all, a modern classic.
