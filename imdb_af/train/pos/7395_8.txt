Almost the entire movie takes place in a public bathhouse in China. There are no fancy sets, explosions or glamorous people - just fine writing, acting and direction (Hollywood, note!). A estranged boy returns home when he believes his father dies. He is surprised to see Dad look good and go over the family business as usual. In fact, he notices that his father and his delayed brother really forged a close and caring relationship and it soon becomes clear that he is out of the loop! Dad is very traditional and this visiting boy comes from the big city and doesn't really see the value of the old bathhouse. How their relationship changes and where the plot goes from there is extraordinary and credible. <br /> <br /> I was delighted to see that not every Chinese movie is an action photo (such as those of Jet Li or Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon), as I don't particularly care for these fiery movies. The Shower as well as the Spring in a small town are two wonderful examples of good Chinese films about people!
