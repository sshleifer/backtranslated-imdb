Call me stupid, but I absolutely loved the 2001 horror movie, Valentine. It was made so well, well written, well behaved, well directed, etc! Everything about it was wonderful! There were parts that were relatively routine (Lily's death), very funny (www.Bleed-Me-Dry.com), totally awful and gruesome (Paige's death), and just heartbreaking (the first scene). I think the whole actor did a good job, especially the three leaders: David Boreanaz, Denise Richards (both of whom I meet and have signatures of, during the filming of this movie - LOTS of nice people!), And Marley Shelton. br /> <br /> I'm very sick of people calling this movie another Scream clone. This movie is by no means a Scream clone. In fact, this movie runs around Scream. It actually makes SENSE! Scream was also NOT the only film to contain a masked murderer in it. Excuse me, but it also seems as if Scream was also a clone (ahem ..., Friday the 13th, Halloween, and many other scary films also have moderate killers). I also think that the novelty of the cupid-masked killer is brilliant. It is so strange to see a lovely, repentant face doing all these terrible things. Another novelty (nose bleeding) makes for a fantastic end! The end gives me chills every time I see it !!!!! So, even if you didn't have it for the first time, look at Valentine again and give it another chance! <br /> <br /> PS- Keep an eye on my new website (WWW.LOVE-HURTS.ORG)! Coming soon ...
