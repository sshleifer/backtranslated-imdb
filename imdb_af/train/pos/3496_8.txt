I'm surprised how many people give this move less than 7 stars. <br /> <br /> But they just don't understand the movie. <br /> <br /> The story is about growing up in a difficult <br /> <br /> There's a crazy grandmother who wants the best for your grandchildren. <br /> <br /> And there is good reason why so many critics like this movie. <br /> <br /> The reason is because they understand the movie. <br /> <br /> I feel sorry for the low scores that some people have given. <br /> <br /> I wish I could only write a short summary of a movie but IMDb required you to write 10 lines. <br /> <br /> I honestly have nothing else to say.
