Russell, my fav, is beautiful in this movie. But more than that, the film covers a great variety of human passion and sadness. Everything from marriage to homosexuality is addressed and respected. The film makes the viewer realize that tolerance towards other people provides the route to save humanity. Beautiful love story between Lachlin and Lil. I repeat their scene over and over. Anyone who has ever fallen in love will interfere with these people. All characters are portrayed and portrayed in an excellent manner.
