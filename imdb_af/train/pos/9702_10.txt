the town of Royston Vasey is a strange but wonderful place. The characters will only be wrong and disturbing, but the fantastic brilliant writing means it works, and it works very well. Most people know others with a few characters, but hopefully no one knows people with extremes of personalities such as Tubbs and Edward, the alien hate owners of the local store or the pen-obsession Pauline who deals with "dole scum". with little contempt. It was just a few of the foreigners. The TV works consist of 3 series and a Christmas special. There are references to many horror movies, such as the tone man. A more recent addition to the series of works is a film, the league of the apocalypse of the gentlemen, of which I will not say much, but strongly recommend. All in all, the gentlemen's league is a hilarious comedy show with brilliant writing and brilliant bonkers. I will definitely say it's worth watching as you won't regret it!
