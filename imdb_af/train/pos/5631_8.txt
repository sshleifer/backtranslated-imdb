Kudos told Fawcett to take up roles that were considered controversial at the time. To my mind, rape was still a taboo subject in the 1980s, and women's rights and emotions were seldom investigated. <br /> <br /> Fawcett is merely a woman followed, and then actor James Russian. He is sufficient as the obsessed psychopath, but sometimes a little transparent. <br /> <br /> Diana Scarwid has a role, like Alfre Woodard as a housemate. Woodard is worried about the legal consequences when Fawcett, the rape victim, takes revenge on the culprit. The scene where she throws a hot oil braai in Russo is classic, and as the rapist he earns it. She then keeps him in slavery, and the consequences must be confronted. <br /> <br /> A very true story reflecting the emotions and anger of rape victims who have been physically and spiritually violated. Highly recommended. 8/10.
