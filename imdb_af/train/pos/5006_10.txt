I remember stumbling upon this special in 1965, while channel surfing. I've never heard of Barbra. When the show was over, I thought, "It's probably the best thing on TV I'll ever see in my life." 42 years later it became true. There is nothing so wonderful, as frankly surprising as the talent shown here. You can talk about all the superstars you want, it's the best of all! <br /> <br /> You call it, she can do it. Comedy, pathos, sultry seduction, ballads, Barbra is really a storyteller. Her ability to deduct anything from his efforts is legendary. But this special was made in the beginning, and helped to create the legend that she became fast. Despite so far, she fulfilled the promise and revealed more of her talents as she went along. But they are all here from the beginning. You won't be disappointed to look at it.
