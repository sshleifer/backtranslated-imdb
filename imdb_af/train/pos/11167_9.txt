A favorite of mine, this film tells of two factoring New York characters, Steve Brodie (Raft) and Chuck Connors (Beery), both of whom attempt to be the "Main Guy" in the late nineteenth century. <br /> <br /> Brodie (1863-1901) and Connors (1852-1913) were real people, although it is a heavy fictional version of their antics (based on a play). Brodie's legendary (did he do it? This is still a reason for argument!), Jumping out of the Brooklyn Bridge (1886), for which he became known, is about the same time as the Spanish-American War (1898 ) showed. Director Walsh obviously has a great love for the period, so beautifully recreated here, and it includes a wild rumbustious ragtime number of the salmon singer, Trixie Odbray (a young Pert Kelton). Raft is on his slickest as Brodie and Beery show again what a smart actor he was, so hard, big heart, and sometimes Connors gets in the right way. Pretty Fay Wray is the love interest the boys pursue. <br /> <br /> Full life and energy. , "The Bowery" is moving at a fast pace (unlike many early talkies). It's not an easy movie to find, but it's worth looking out for.
