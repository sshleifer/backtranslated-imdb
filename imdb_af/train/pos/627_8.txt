Except for an uncomfortable scene, this refreshing fairy tale has a fun and wonderful undercurrent of adult cynical whispering its way into the audience, as well as a soundtrack that moves this fictional epic powerfully. Apart from one of the Robert DeNiro scenes that doesn't come out at all and gets away with the scene of the rest of the movie, this nice romantic fairy tale has a good storytelling and the strong magic and the fine balance between serious adventure Scenes and lighter spiritual humor are well done. In the updated tradition of the Princess bride, this contemporary presentation of magic and love is fascinating. Eight out of ten stars.
