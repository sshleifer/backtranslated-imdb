Burger X tells the story of Andrei Chikatilo, The Ripper of Rostov, who killed 52 years in mainly women and children. It shows how the investigation by the Soviet bureaucracy was blocked, how difficult it was to investigate the crimes. It does the job in such a brilliant way that it will not leave anyone untouched. In the beginning it might be a bit slow, but it really takes you as the story unfolds. I can only say that, by "The Silence of the Lambs", it's by far the best movie about a serial killer I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It is very difficult to say which actors' performance is beyond the rest of this movie. Stephen Rea is really brilliant as the inexperienced forensic expert in charge of the investigation. Donald Sutherland's performance as his cynical superior, and the only person in the Russian government willing to help him, is as outstanding as Rea. And what about Jeffrey DuMann, the serial killer? DuMann brilliantly created a character that inspires empathy rather than hatred. Yes, he is a monster, but he is also a sad figure, oppressed and mocked by his wife, his boss, his co-workers. He is tortured, ashamed, as well as extremely angry. <br /> <br /> I can only recommend this movie to anyone interested in a well-crafted documentary drama, where the actors are even more important than the special effects. It earns at least 9/10, maybe even more if you ask me.
