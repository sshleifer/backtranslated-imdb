How do you rate this movie with 10/10? I admit that this movie is not very entertaining, but the purpose is not to tell you a story, but history! This is the first 'real' movie of the film's history (`Prince de Galles' was first but it was not technically perfect enough?) And it undoubtedly has a great international value. These people you can see to finish off their workday movie had the chance to take part in a historic moment, to be the first people to see themselves moving! And above all, the shot is a beautiful shot! And it moves a lot when you think of the first people who saw it! What a moment! Historically for science first (because the Lumiere brothers first invented the scientific reasons from the cinematographers) and later for art. A movie to honor!
