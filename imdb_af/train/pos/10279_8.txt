Rich psychiatrist Lindsay Crouse has just published her first novel and feels her job is hopeless to help her patients. A young raid client asks her to help him pay his debt if he really wants to help him get better. Here she gets involved with Joe Mantegna. To reveal more of the plot, a hell of a fun movie would be spoiled and 'House of Games' might well be the best movie I saw. David Mamet wrote and arranged this jewel. It's full of funny dialogue, good one-liners, and enough twists to make you guess until the end. Crouse is perfect if the pushy psychiatrist needs a change and Mantegna holds her as the devil's clever man. And with the exception of a coincidence in the last quarter of the movie, the film is in full control of his audience; and we love the con. <br /> <br /> *** from ****
