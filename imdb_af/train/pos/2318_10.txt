I saw this movie as a teenager and immediately identified with Reese Witherspoon's portrayal of Dani Trant, a 14-year-old tomboy in rural Louisiana around 1957. She feels she will never be as beautiful as her older sister, Maureen (a now seldom seen Emily Warfield), and feel out of place in terms of her conservative Baptist education. Then the seventeen-year-old Court Foster (Jason London), the son of her mother's closest friend (Gail Strickland) next door, is experiencing her first loved one, while the court enjoys her company and intentional spirit. Dani manages to get her first kiss from him, but as soon as he sees Maureen, he falls over her brackets and leaves Dani behind. The sisters' close association is severely broken by the rioting outbreak, which only deepens when the court dies in a tragic accident. The girls are then made to realize how much they need each other. <br /> <br /> Sam Waterson and Tess Harper are just perfect as the loving parents who are trying to balance their daughters' individuality and at the same time trying to keep the family together The beautiful cinematography, and the wonderful soundtrack with Elvis Presley, The Platters and more add to the movie's atmosphere of a simpler time. <br /> <br /> An approaching movie with a timeless message.
