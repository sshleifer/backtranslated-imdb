Jean Harlow and Clark Gable were a good screen saver and it could be their best movie together. <br /> <br /> Yes, keep you Man can be cheese and predictable, but that's not what I love for the movie. I like to see Harlow and Gable together and in this movie they are just wonderful. Obviously they really enjoyed working together and it is part of what makes it such a wonderful movie. <br /> <br /> The witty dialogue, great writing and attention to detail are the other things that make it so good. Movie. I loved this movie for the first time I saw it and on every subsequent viewing I always notice at least one new detail. For me, this is a sign of a good movie. <br /> <br /> The dialogue and writing is better than most movies from this period (early 30's). I adore classic movies, but I admit that most of them are just average and sometimes don't like my interest. Keep your husband one of the exceptions. <br /> <br /> It has a lot to do with the fact that Hold Your Man is a "pre-code" movie. (The Hays code has not been enforced for a year after you keep your husband.) This movie could not be made under the code. Well, it could have been, but it would have been a completely different story. Thanks, the code was not enforced until 1934. Otherwise we would have missed this gem.
