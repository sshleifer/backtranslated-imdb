Anything too long and going over to the end, this comedy is a wonderful, never derogatory or ridiculous look at the problems of a "power man" who wants to wear women's clothing at night. <br /> <p> Julie Walters is nice as always, but Adrian Pasdar is completely credible and steals the movie. He (she) is absolutely beautiful in high heels and his socks.
