I read some of the other user's comments and decided to add one as well. Some of the users are stuck in a 'realistic' type of mentality. This movie was meant to be a 'fantasy' .... a 'what if' movie. It was never meant to be "real" or serious. It was a great pleasure for everyone I knew when it came out - even if it was the tragedy of the Challenger explosion. I was 30 at the time and totally enjoyed it. My young son loved it too! Later I shared it with my daughter, and she also loved it. SpaceCamp is a fun family movie that only has to be fun. All the realists in the world have to relieve or keep watching documentaries or docudramas and avoid any other kind of movie. So sorry for the young people who watched this movie first and then went to the real SpaceCamp (one in Alabama and one at Vandenberg AFB in California) - they had to find the same kind of environment portrayed in the movie and Then let 'letdown' ... I think their parents did not explain the difference between fantasy and reality. Oh good. If you like fantasy fun movies and haven't seen this one, I recommend it! Enjoy it!
