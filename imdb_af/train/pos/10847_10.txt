I'm 60 years old, a guitarist (lead / rhythm), and over the past forty years I've played in four groups. It's all there, the battles, the rubbish, the rotten food, the worse accommodation. , always travel, little or no money, and everyone was drunk or tall. But the clubs, the fans and the music made it all worthwhile! Just like strange fruit! I'm too old now, and the arthritis in the hands and hips no longer means rocking, but for the length of the video it all came back, and that was all there! The birds, the brawl and the drink! And I was young again! It's just like Billy Connolly's voice, God loves the 70's! Rock Forever!
