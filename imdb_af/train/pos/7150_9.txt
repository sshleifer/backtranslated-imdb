What a BIG movie! It is so reminiscent of the wonderful Disney classic family movies of the 60's and 70's. I was so pleasantly surprised, after the past 20 years of absolute detritus, Disney's lively production teams cut out. <br /> <br /> This movie is an absolute joy. The child stars were just like that; professional, quality actors. I am most impressed with the quality of this movie. Sigourney Weaver was a total sycophantic * add hyperboles here. * A brave boys prison camp. Siobhan Fallon was wonderful as the star's mother. <br /> <br /> I will not return the story here, because there is little point to do it again, but the story is great, the direction was extraordinary and the acting quality was fantastic! This work reminds you of what it is like to be a child, without having to struggle or be angry. The deleted scenes that appear on the DVD version are really best left out. They were too hard for this movie and would have taken so much of it. While the abuse in the final product was shown, it was not shown to any degree. That was the best way. <br /> <br /> It was an absolutely enjoyable movie to watch. <br /> <br /> It gets a 9/10 from ... <br /> <br /> The Enemy :.
