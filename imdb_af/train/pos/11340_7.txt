Every child experiences trauma, and each child's active imagination has got the best of them, but for Jake (Anthony De Marco ?? of the upcoming Clint Eastwood movie CHANGELING - which looks like Henry Thomas circa 1982) the combination can be deadly. <br /> <br /> A one-off six-year-old whose imagination kicks in a high gear when he is clipped to his rogue parents Peter (Sean Bridgers, late from "DEADWOOD") and Jules (Brooke Bloom, "CBS: Miami ") Suddenly decided to divorce, release him to his own devices and release a new tenant ?? a zombie in his closet. <br /> <br /> Jake actually gets the seed being planted while playing with neighborhood friend Dillon (Matthew Josten). He gives him a push from the internet of FAQ's zombies. Jake is so convinced he comes out to get him ?? and his family ?? He starts with a plan of action to protect them before it's too late. <br /> <br /> Indie newcomer Shelli Ryan ?? Who wrote and directed? He combines inland drama with horrors of horror, but the former (clever) heavier than the last, with a decent story propagated by fine acting. (De Marco is the scarce race of children's actor, where he is a CHILD and not "acting." All his nuances are very clear of the awkward, shameful, introverted child who may also be very related. I can definitely make Bridgers. His deceitful man empathizes in realizing that he really loves his son, while Bloom has the harder work to build sympathy than the somewhat insufficient mother who is quickly emotional about rationality - it doesn't help Dillon's mother Ruth (Monette Magrath, Laura Dern seems to constantly carry on her implied information to manage a wedge between Jake and his father, and Magrath also has a difficult task to make her manipulative character relatively similar, but in a revealing scene I am not in detail will go but show why she is the way she is (and more importantly how she has influenced her own child). <br /> <br/> The filler's subjective camera is also well-employed (many angles become formed by Jake's waistline or eff etc. skewed; ie Peter's upside-down shot carrying his son in the same position while being fun in the backyard, and editing is relatively flawless. <br /> <br /> Ryan grew up the personal experience based script and also witnessed the first-hand account of a friend who is going through the same situation and how the impact of adult relationships can be harmful if they have fears, anger and stress on their children. Here, the film is very successful in conveying the theme. <br /> <br /> But the abomination support is a little over to say the least, but the tribute to George A. Romero's zombie films is lovingly displayed by Ryan (Jake's mother sleeps in front of the TV as a night of the living dead, causing his own conviction of the undead in their home.The metaphor of a monster acting as a surrogate for domestic violence can be a little heavy-handed, but again the child's fear of something under his bed universal.
