and what a combo. Two of the century's great singers die together in this underrated musical. He writes music, she writes lyrics, and they both work for Basil Rathbone who can't write because his wife died (actually she just got fat!). Best scene is the pawnshop number where Bing is singing an impromptu number while the swing band gets their instruments off the hook. Just wonderful. And it's a rare lead role for Broadway legend, Mary Martin, and she's pretty good. Charley Grapewin, John Scott Trotter, William Frawley, Oscar Levant (again the manic pianist), Charles Lane and fellow fellow Helen Bertram. And who knows Rathbone can be funny?
