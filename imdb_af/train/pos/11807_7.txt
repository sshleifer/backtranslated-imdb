Having seen Dick Tracy in the 6.99 $ bin at Future Shop, I decided to give it with no previous knowledge and a huge fan of Mafia and Crime movies. I was very surprised to see a very fun, smart, entertaining movie with solid performances throughout. The movie moves well, of course, it has a solid performance from Warren Beatty, but the real standouts of the movie are Al Pacino and Madonna. I was delighted to find out that Pacino was nominated for his performance as an over-the-top gangster trying to take down the city. Madonna was big like the girl in distress, she really impressed me and added depth to her performance. If you go with the attitude of watching a fun, clever movie with great acting and a solid screenplay, then Dick Tracy gives a try. I don't think you'll be disappointed. And look for the cameos of Paul Sorvino, James Caan, Kathy Bates and Dustin Hoffman among others.
