I caught a bit of this concert on public television and knew I had to get it. The boys all give the Royal Albert an excellent, often exciting, performance in every respect. Also, no synthetic, no welded lasers and strobes, no grandiose entrance (and an unashamed, serious and appreciative audience, all who left their bottle rockets at home). <br /> <br /> If you're a Cream fan (or if you've just heard of them); if you are a blues fan; if you are a rock-a-roll fan; You won't be disappointed if you watch and listen to this DVD. You will never lose this DVD either, because you will never lend it to anyone. (This DVD justifies selfishness! Tell them to get their own!) This is too good and reusable; you want to keep it within easy reach.
