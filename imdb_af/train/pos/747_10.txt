Although I was born in the year, this film came out and never heard of me until my junior year of high school (1996) when I saw it, and I got totally excited and cried and felt with the characters because I and my friends were them. <br /> <br /> Their hair, clothes and speech were outdated, but the emotions and desperation of each situation were so familiar! I remember remembering how really it was and how I wanted them to make such movies. <br /> <br /> I watched the movie the night after being at a crazy party (not so different from the one in Jay's house) crashed by what we see as the losers on the edge hung from our crowd. A world-class BSc and a responsible mother figure I immediately identified with Jeanie (I was also the one with a car), although I had a bit of Madge's uncertainties that were floating there too. My best friend was a Deidre and her good friend of our childhood was our Annie. <br /> <br /> The scene looks when Jeanie is in school or the one where she and her boyfriend break and then she tells Madge how much she loved him like conversations and situations I personally had. <br /> <br /> Now at the age of 27, I recently saw the movie again and felt a clash of emotions because it was like watching a piece of my own youth (although none of me friends died). I think it's a must see for all girls 13 and above.
