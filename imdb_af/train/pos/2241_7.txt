Another comedy about a spicy little country struggling through the jungle of the modern world for the forties, with only indigenous communities and picking to lead them, is a good entry into the Ealing canon. Terry-Thomas flashes in the lead as usual, as a fearless ministry led to a disaster when a nation he was presumably in control of starting to attract the world's interest, makes Peter Sellers a wonderful romantic lead. Peter Sellers is one of his quieter acts of corrupt politics and Uber suave John Le Mesurier is against a kind of rough revolutionary leader. There is lots of fun, especially the viewer; Maybe not in the top echelon of Ealing classic, but pretty high.
