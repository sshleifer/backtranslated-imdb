I enjoyed this movie. It was funny, cute, stupid, and entertaining. Threw a good role and was really hammered by some critics for reasons I really didn't understand. No, it wasn't "The Drues of Wrath" or "Casablanca" or even "Moonstruck", but it was a pleasant movie. <br /> <br /> Julia was great at playing the psychic 'man behind the man'. The story is a bit stupid to be sure, but it's not a high drama, people. I got an overview of the movie, probably the only good one that got it and then raced into a movie one night. I never heard that it was supposed to stink until I saw it, and I'm glad I saw it. Eventually, the VHS tape bought on the bargain, and I watch it several times a year.
