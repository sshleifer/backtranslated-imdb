This movie is an amusing and totally sarcastic view of pop culture and its producers. I was impressed with the photography that consisted of bright colors and spin-studded institutions, especially if you think it's Zukovic's first large-scale attempt. <br /> <br /> One warning, don't take the movie's message so seriously. It's not for mass consumption (and it's not a compliment). The message is a somewhat stylized post-college, neophyte view of society. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the basic plot line of a fictional zine editor who disguised the 90s mobocracy.
