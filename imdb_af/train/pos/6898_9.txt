It is a tongue in the cheeky movie from the beginning with a voice resort that makes fun of everything French and then delivers a rather naive but very brave hero in Fanfan La Tulipe. Featured by beautiful Gerard Philippe, the young young man apparently predicts the full-fledged Lollobrigida - especially that he will marry King Louis XV's daughter! Problem is, La Lollo soon finds out she's in love with Fanfan ... <br /> <br /> Powered by good sword fighting, cavalcades and other enthusiastic sequences, the movie moves at a fast pace and with many comical moments . The direction is perhaps the worst aspect, but the film is so light and takes itself so seriously that I could not give those shortcomings a second thought. Watch out for Noel Roquevert, a traditional heavy French film, trying to steal La Lollo, persuade himself and give the writing to the fortune teller reading La Lollo's hand! And what a jewel Marcel Herrand is as the megalomaniac and lustful King Louis XV! This is not all: So many beautiful women in one movie make me wish I was in France and on the seat in 1952! The movie may have come out that year, but she's bewitched, cheek, beautiful narrative, impeccable photography and the memorable Gerard Philippe ensure it's still a modern and a pleasure to watch. I would not hesitate to recommend it to my grandchildren, let alone anyone who loves movies in general and swashbucklers in particular! See it!
