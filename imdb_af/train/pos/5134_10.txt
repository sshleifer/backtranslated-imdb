This short was nominated for an Academy Award and I wish it won! Actually, a filmed jam session between some very talented musicians, including Lester Young and Joe Jones, the music is incredible! Hollywood has often embraced Jazz (especially animation, believe it or not), but it is a rare glimpse of film at an improvisational jam. It was added to the Film Conservation List and earned it. TCM runs it regularly as a filler and runs it every March for its '31 Days of Oscar' tribute. From the center to the diaper, swish, nothing else and the shot is so smooth, the just barely moving. Most solid and highly recommended !!!
