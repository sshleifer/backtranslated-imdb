The movie was outstanding despite the NC-17 rating and disturbing scenes. In fact, such things happen like this and so this movie shows a lot of it. It all starts with Maya (Rosario Dawson in excellent performance) whose recent college attendance, everything goes well for her. She meets Jared (Chad Faust in a tremendous performance) at a frat party that seems to be a real gentleman and sweet. He invites her for dinner. They look at the stars of a bridge and they end up at his apartment. They talk and take her to the basement when they flirt with each other. She tried to put an end to it, but he raped her. This incident scares her. She goes to a club with a bartender / DJ Adrian (marvelously played by Marcus Patrick) who sees that she gets drunk and helps before she goes far. They hit a friendship. He also does drugs and Maya also starts using. In other words, she is known in another world. She starts school again and works as TA (Teaching Assistant) and mocks Jared as one of the students. While the students take a midterm, they get Jared false. Jared was trying to talk to Maya, but she still decided to invite him to her place. Will history repeat itself? Or will Maya have a surprise for Jared? You look at the movie. Excellent A. Rosario Dawson portrays the role with focus and endurance. Chad Faust doesn't like being a rapist, but he does a tremendous job as Jared. Marcus Patrick is very brilliant the man who saves Maya and diverts her into a new world. This movie deserves an award.
