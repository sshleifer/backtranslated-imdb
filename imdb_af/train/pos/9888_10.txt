Although this beautiful artwork uses some of the cinematic vocabulary of surrealism, it is actually nothing of the kind. This is a political and cultural allegory of Mexico's post-Columbian odyssey, as even a glimpse of Mexico's history will be. <br /> <br /> Unlike "Like Water for Chocolate", "Erendira" expects the viewer to meet at least halfway so understanding requires a little work. (A good starting point is to see the granny character like Spain: pride, aloof, sad and, above all, weighted with history.) <br /> <br /> The ultimate action of the heroine is dark because the " outcome "of history (ie present) is always obscure, as we are too close to it for honest evaluation. Refusal to release neatly is the only right choice for the director, given the ambitions of the film. <br /> <br /> "Erendira" is beautiful. A great screen experience would be ideal if you could catch it at a local art house or university screening. But if not, VHS is better than never seeing it.
