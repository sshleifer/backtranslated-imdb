*** Don't think it's a devastator, but I'd rather be careful than indifferent *** I never saw this movie when I was little. I was in love with the first time I saw it with my three-year-old daughter. I can see it over and over. <br /> <br /> For the little play that Ilene Woods did in her lifetime, she was a wonderful voice for Cinderella; very attractive; very credible. The music fits perfectly into the movie. The acting was wonderful; love the mice !! You actually hated Lady Tremain and the sisters; they were just terrible. The cartoonists portrayed the spoiled behavior very well. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie, especially if you are love stories. My daughter saw the movie about 25 times and is still excited at the end.
