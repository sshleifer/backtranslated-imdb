I saw the movie for the first time at the BBC on July 27, 2005. For me it was a good interpretation of the person Conan Doyle, and I really wonder what the Sherlock supporters are thinking about. I also think it's a movie for these fans whether they agree or not what is mentioned. You can ask yourself: A. C. Doyle was a strong person or did he ask himself the question. However, he was the creator of the famous Holmes, but how much was it a kind of semi-biography? Nonetheless, I strongly suggest this adjustment, it's a movie you should see - even if you're not interested in the Sherlock Holmes movies or books, watch it, enjoy it and enjoy your own opinion.
