These kind of movies about young teens struggling with their own sexuality were something unique and daring and risky a few years ago, but more and more movies like this have made over the past few years, making it difficult for the movies to really to stick out. <br /> <br /> Also, this film received little publicity, apart from the usual small movie festivals that this little French film presented, as well as the big festivals that always love this kind of small-day films about becoming ordinary subjects. often handled in movies. The film presented in Cannes in 2007 and actually won awards. <br /> <br /> The movie doesn't really come from others, as it's actually tiny if you've seen some similar movies. like this one, but that doesn't mean "Naissance des pieuvres" is a bad one to watch. The movie is definitely a good watch that treats its subject well and tells its story steadily and therefore effectively in a typical somewhat slow French spectacular pace. <br /> <br /> It is an emerging movie focusing on the lives of 3 totally different mid-teens in particular. Sexuality is a big theme within the film, which is handled thoroughly and subtly. This makes the film and its story generally a fairly realistic one, but perhaps a little predictable, as the movie doesn't offer something original enough in its genre. <br /> <br /> This kind of French movie is likely to be scared. from many people because of the reason they probably expect it to be very artificial, with deep layers and meanings. However, Naissance des pieuvres is a very accessible movie for everyone and you really don't have to be in Euro-teen movies to appreciate this movie. It's a lovely and somewhat sensual type of movie, due to its subject and visual approach. <br /> <br /> The film is also made realistic by its actors, who have not had much experience in the movie business, but are authentic and feel within their roles. The strong individual characters give the movie some good themes and good moments. <br /> <br /> A good film about his subject. <br /> <br /> 7/10
