I have to give her a near-perfect rating because the content is really good. As a previous reviewer communicated, I have no idea how this movie itself was found in IMDBs under 100 listings! It's absolutely ridiculous! Other movies - especially those who share the dance theme - can't keep a candle on this one, in terms of the combination of top notch, credible plays and great dance routines. <br /> <br /> From the beginning To complete the underlying story (it's not just about winning a competition) is very easy to divide, and surprisingly realistic. None of the main characters in this one is two-dimensional, and by the end of the movie it is very easy to invest emotionally in them. (And even if you're not the crying type, you might get a bit of a funny eye for the credit.) <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend this movie to dance lovers, and more, to those who can appreciate a pleasant and well-intentioned story. How she moves is not perfect of course (what movie is that?) But it's definitely a cut above movies that use nice faces to hide a half-baked plot and / or dust that has dust. The actors and institutions in this movie make for a very realistic ride that is equally sad due to the wonderful talent of the dancers!
