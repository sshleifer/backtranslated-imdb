Initially, I didn't think Ben Affleck really could make a funny Christmas. Boy was wrong, my daughter invited me to see it with her and I was not disappointed at all. James Gandolfini was funny, I liked a lot of Christina Appelagate, and Catherine O 'Hara was also good, the storyline is what really sold me, I mean, to be with family too, at the table for people you barely see only once or twice a year, and probably you don't go along, you actually need as much alcohol as you can stand to handle Christmas, so I thought the assumption was good there and buy The family with $ 250,000 was a bit on the far side, but it seems to work well for me because it was a riot all the way through, showing the class struggle of the different families. It has many funny moments, including embarrassment on a teenage boy's computer. All in all, I loved this movie and will watch it next Christmas or sooner if my daughter wants to.
