I was also very surprised to see how few people voted on this film, and just HAD to write about it, although my comments are very similar to those already written. <br /> <br /> I love the movie a lot. The wonderful play between Mastroianni & Loren. The way in which the film is told: Humanity and love slowly developing between these two outsiders, and in contrast to the simultaneous and continuous inhuman marching speed of the fascist radio presenter (who is a colleague of Mastroianni's part) and the fans "go to and come from the show". For me, this is a very nice movie about how it is. Perhaps some of you would argue that the anti-fascist "message" was delivered too clearly, but to me it didn't destroy the movie in any way. My voice is 10/10.
