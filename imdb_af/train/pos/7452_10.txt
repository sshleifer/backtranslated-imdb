I'm a big fan of a Faerie Tale Theater and I've seen them all and it's one of the best! It's funny, romantic and classic. I recommend it for all ages. It's great for little ones, because it's good, Cinderella and ideal for adults and teenagers, because it's funny and not over. I watched it when I was little and I still watch it. It has good lines that my family and I quote all the time. The acting is wonderful and it never gets old. If you like fairy tales and romance, you'll love it. I watched many Cinderella movies in my time and this is the best of them all. (Sorry Disney) I recommend this movie and show all the Faerie Tale Theater. They all appeal to all ages and are all unique and very entertaining.
