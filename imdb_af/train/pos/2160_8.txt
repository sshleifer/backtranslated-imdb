This film is about a man who has come across the acceptable convention of success, always trying to be mobile, working hard, so he can be proud of having his own home. He assumes it's all up to life, until he accidentally starts dancing, because he wanted to see a beautiful girl he saw every day at the dance studio while driving the subway home. <br /> <br /> He was initially at her, going to the dance class to just idolize her, but he eventually let him go and get himself into the dance. It finally becomes clear to him that there is more to life than to kill yourself. There is also a set of strange characters who also learn in the studio, who laughs a lot at the movie and a little sense of bond between the stray. There are also revelations of various characters, including the girl he initially admired, giving them depth through their broken past and their struggle to overcome it. <br /> <br /> The dance was also busy at the end of the competition, but it is not the usual story where our undercover comes out by winning it. Instead, there is ruin, revelation and redemption. <br /> <br /> All this makes it a moving and fun movie to watch.
