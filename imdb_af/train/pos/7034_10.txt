Adding all the aspects of the movie --- dancing, singing, acting --- the only one that stands out best in the movie is Vanessa Williams ... her dedication, energy and timeless beauty make Rosie the perfect role for her. Never have I ever seen anyone portraying Rose! Vanessa's singing talent is beautiful with all the songs she performs as Rose and her acting skills never stop me! Her dance is so incredible, even if some people say the choreography was bad - her dance skills are better than ever before! I would recommend this version over the '63 just because I find that while Vanessa's acting is excellent ----- not to mention the fact that Jason Alexander and the rest of the cast are also very impressive (with the exception of Chynna Philips ... who in hell they think when they throw her?) <br /> <br /> All in all, I want to say this version is great and I recommend everyone see this version!
