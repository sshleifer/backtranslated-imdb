It's the funniest thing I've ever seen and I think it's the funniest thing I will ever see. If you don't choke with the absolute hilarity with the laugh, then it's just not your cup of tea. But I honestly don't know anyone who saw what it didn't like. It is now 17 years later and my friends and I still get everything from Goonie Goo Goo to the game, Aunt Bunnie to the ice cream man Ralph and Ed to get out !! There are so many individual and collective sketches of hilariousness that if you haven't seen this movie honestly, you miss one of the best stand-ups ever. Take any of Robin Williams, Damon Wayans, The Dice, George Carlin or even the likes of Richard Pryor or Red Foxx and this will surpass that. I don't know how or where Murphy has his material, but it works. That's what it comes to. It's funny like hell. <br /> <br /> Can you imagine how this show shocked people about Eddie's buckwheat and Rogers used and so on SNL? If you listen to the audience when he cracks his first joke or when he says the F word for the first time, they are in full shock. <br /> <br /> His first time saying he is the F word when he does the tile or mr. T is a homosexual. <br /> <br /> "Hey boy, hey boy. You look mighty cute in their jeans. Come here now, and f @ ** me on the ass!" <br /> <br /> The crowd breaks out in storms of lag. No one was expecting the dirty mouth he had let go. But the results were just fantastic. I've never been with relentless comedy the way I was in this stand-up. In fact, the next time my stomach had so much of a laugh, it wasn't until 1999 when I saw SOUTH PARK: LARGE LONGER AND DISAPPOINTED. The comedy was raw and unapologetic and it was for the jugular, just like DELIRIOUS. I don't think it's possible to look at this piece of comic history and not to laugh. It's almost twenty years later and it's still the funniest thing on the video. <br /> <br /> "I caught your kids last week. And I put the worm on the hook and the kids put the fishing rod back in the boat and hit their heads in the water for two minutes. Gus. Normal kids do not make such a shit as Gus, then they start their head around and the m **** f ***** comes on Met fish, then they look at each other and say Goonie Goo Goo! said, you can believe this f **** a shit! "<br /> <br /> See it again and be prepared to laugh off your freakin! <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10
