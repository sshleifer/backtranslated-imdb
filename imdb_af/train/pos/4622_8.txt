I originally came across Linda Feferman's seven minutes in heaven when I was 14 and worked at a video store and I loved it. I recently watched the movie again and realized it was a lost treasure. The movie stars Jennifer Connelly, nearly twenty years before she will win an Oscar for Beautiful Mind, like Natalie Becker. Byron Thames plays her best friend in the world, Jeff Moran. The movie is definitely a milder, sweeter and softer version of the Pretty in Pink's and Some Kind of Wonderful's of the 1980s. That's exactly why it's so good. It's fair, not forced like those movies, and parents would love to see this movie with kids there. <br /> <br /> When Natalie's Dad departs on a business trip, Jeff convinces him to move in because his home is sucking. With the support of Natalie's friend Polly, Maddie Corman played well, she allowed him. But this movie is not about children in situations and seeing what they can get away from. The three clues are so natural and the writing, surprisingly so honest, is that what is best in their performances breaks the heart. These characters really care about each other. It's a great movie to show for kids who have reached teenage adolescence. <br /> <br />
