I loved this show when it was broadcast on television and bruised when I found out someone was deciding somewhere to be worthy to continue! For years I hung on my copies of this show, which I pasted or had someone for me. It's been up to now. The forces that were eventually decided to abandon this beautiful series on DVD, I finally got my eager hands on the full set. Which brings me to this part; The part about this show is about. <br /> <br /> American Goths are about good verses, angry, basically a fight between Lucas Buck (that's Buck, with a B). He is an evil sheriff of a small town in South Carolina, who manages things as he wants things to be run and keeps nothing to get his way. <br /> <br /> I felt the show was wonderfully written and directed, and Lots of life was still alive. I really hated it when it was canceled, but it seems to me as if I finally find something worth watching on television. <br /> <br /> Gary Cole did a good job as the role of Sheriff Lucas Buck, he just wore the right amount of charm to pull it off. The other actors also did a super job, so I think you can say, even the deciding one was a hit with me.
