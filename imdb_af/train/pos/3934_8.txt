Young Mr. Lincoln is a poetic, beautiful film that captures the myth of one of the most coveted figures in American history. Henry Fonda had the difficult task of portraying a mythical figure while making enough for people to surrender. Perhaps the actors are the best show. See how he stops a lynching mob in one hand. Alice Brady is fantastic in the role of a simple farmer's wife. Most of the last movie plays in a courtroom and there is the only negative thing I can say about this movie. Most adjudicator to spectator characters are given so many humorous lines that derive from the serious hearing that is at hand. But I'm very used to it because the humor is a Ford brand. . Supporting parts by Ward Bond and Donald Meek are very good.
