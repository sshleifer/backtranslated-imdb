A solid B-movie. <br /> <br /> I love Jake Weber. Its understated delivery is refreshing in a time of more than the best performances. I like the relationship between father and son. I like family dynamics. The Wendigo seems silly, but it is a representation of the child's toy and the dead deer. It's a merger like, see? This is a psychological story, not a Freddy slide. Look at it and reflect on your inner child and what the movie might tell you and you'll be fine. <br /> <br /> Nice work.
