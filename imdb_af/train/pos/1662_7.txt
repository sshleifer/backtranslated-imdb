The film of Artemisia can be regarded as treason, or as true artistic license. <br /> <br /> In what documented history, Artemisia Gentileschi submitted to the thumbscrew, and still confirmed she was r *** ed, such as Mary Garrard and Gloria Steinem have confirmed. <br /> <br /> In the film, under another torture, she refused to condemn her lover / offender. <br /> <br /> How can a movie deviate so much from history, but does the human heart still know? <br /> <br /> The answer is not that hard to find. In the film, the director and cast filled a gaping hole in the historical record with the power of imagination. <br /> <br /> This has led to a conclusion that differs from the record. <br /> <br /> So be it. I find _both_ the record and the movie to be compelling. <br /> <br /> In both the movie and (it seems) in history Artemisia was a painter for everything. <br /> <br /> For that vision, in the surprising (sic) film composition, I am very grateful. <br /> <br /> Rarely did I see a movie that forced my eyes so. <br /> <br /> David Broadhurst
