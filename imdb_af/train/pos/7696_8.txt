When "Good Times" was placed in 1974, it was one of the first black family sitcoms. It centered on the poor Chicago-based Evans family and their struggle to end. Most of the early episodes focused on parents, James and Florida Evans, and their struggle to provide the family. John Amos and Esther Rolle were the best part of the show. They were great actors and have good chemistry like James and Florida Evans. They had three children: J.J., Thelma, and Michael. J.J. was the dress-chasing but well-thought-out teenage boy who made up for his lack of subtle artistic talent. Thelma was an attractive, shining girl who constantly insults with J.J. Michael was a nearby prodigy who was well educated on social issues and was destined to become a lawyer. <br /> <br /> In 1976, the producers made a big mistake by dismissing John Amos, who literally killed his character. It really changed the focus, not for the good I could add. The shows started to focus more on J.J. and his buffoon-like behavior that made black viewers angry, as well as Esther Rolle, who left after the next season. Instead of a show that focuses on key African American issues that existed in society at the time, viewers showed what was overloaded with jersey and fat jokes. <br /> <br /> After Esther Rolle left, the quality of the show has suffered even more. Although it was still viewable, it was no longer the great groundbreaking performance it ever was. <br /> <br /> Although Esther Rolle returned for the 1978 season, it became clear that the performance was on his last legs. . All loose points were tied up during the season and the show became quiet of the air. <br /> <br /> First three season: A. Last three seasons: C +.
