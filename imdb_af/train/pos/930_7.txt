I'm sure most people already know the story - the misery Ebenezer Scrooge visits a visit of three spirits (the Spirit of Christmas passed, to come today and still) highlighting parts of his life hoping to save his soul and changing its ways. Dickens's classic story in one form or another has been the test of time to become a beloved holiday favorite. <br /> <br /> As I grew up, I looked at the 1951 version with Alastair Sims, and I believe he was the definitive Scrooge, I was impressed with this release, which was released when I was in high school. George C. Scott plays a convincing and mean Ebenezer Scrooge, and the actors playing the ghosts are frightening and threatening. David Warner is also a good Bob Cratchit. <br /> <br /> This version is beautifully filmed and uses more modern filming styles (for the 1980s) that make it more palatable to my children than the black and white version of 1951. <br /> <br /> This is a worthy adaptation of the story and is one that I see almost every year at some point in the Christmas season.
