The Matador is a witty, dark, humorous and exhilarating melodrama exalted above mediocrity, thanks to two very engaging and serious performances by Pierce Brosnan, who have never been better than here, and the ever-reliable Greg Kinnear who has his best role since Jack Nicholson's gay neighbor plays in So Good As It Gets. A great plus also goes to writing. Smart and occasionally very nasty dialogue is provided by Brosnan and the slow friendship between these two different individuals is completely convincing. The story takes a few unexpected turns and keeps the viewer constantly on the spot. <br /> <br /> Beautiful artistic touch of the director such as good use of music, clever editing and somewhat unorthodox cinematography sometimes makes a nice show to the movie and for a long time you don't know how to label the movie no. But it's also thanks to a very well written script that keeps the viewer (I anyway) on the edge of his seat.
