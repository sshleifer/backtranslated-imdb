I don't know the stars or modern Chinese teen music - but I know a thoroughly entertaining movie when I see one. <br /> <br /> Kung Fu Dunk is pure Hollywood in its values ​​- it is played for laughter, for love, and is a great combination of Kung Fu and basketball. <br /> <br /> Everybody looks like they had a lot of fun making it - the production values ​​are excellent - and modern China looks brighter than Los Angeles here. <br /> <br /> The plot of the abandoned orphan who grows up in a kung fu school to just kick off and then discover superstars as a basketball game (and love and more, etc.) is wonderful - that is fresh, fun and immensely entertaining. <br /> <br /> With good action and good dialogue, it's one to just enjoy - for all ages - and for our money was one of the best family movies we've ever seen. . <br /> <br /> Please ignore the negative reviews and give Dunk a chance. We were really glad we did.
