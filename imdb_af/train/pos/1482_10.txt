The best movie about marriage and family. This is a very interesting reflection for couples who will come to the dangerous and paradoxical fascinating world of marriage and family. This decision can be the better or the worst in our lives and the lives of our children. The right intrusion or help from 'friends' or an officer when we get away. The real role of families: they can help or they can destroy us. The crazy priest who may not be very angry tells what can happen according to statistics and reality. A couple who think of a 'special' marriage lives a painful story in their future own history. <br /> <br /> Who likes contract marriage? No one, after the priest tells their own history ?? if they leave the future in other hands, if they do not know what the marriage is. That the problems are true, that life actually testifies, guarantees, of each one. That the right victims of divorce are children, with real name? Andrea in the movie or names. That the abortion is just an easy exit: sadness, regret and unhappiness will be after abortion. That the state and social security think less of a real problem of the families each time. The gossip of the friends, the infidelity due to weakness and despair of Steffania, because Tomasso lives his life as if he were alone. <br /> <br /> Perhaps someone might think this movie is a pessimistic movie, but not. Steffania and Tomasso, in the deepest of their hearts, love a beautiful marriage and family, if not why do they like marriage? A true and beautiful marriage depends only on the couple: from each of their decisions, from each one's actions in their lives. The family can be a place where everyone loved because he or she is alone through existing ones. The script is wonderful. The performances are wonderful: Steffania and Tomasso, the almost cynical priest! An excellent direction and writing. The colors and the management of the cameras, wonderful.
