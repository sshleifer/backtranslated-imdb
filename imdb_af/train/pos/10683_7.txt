It's a better than average silent movie and it's still worth seeing if you're a fan of silence. However, if you're not a fan of the genre, I suggest you try a few other movies before watching this one. That's because the plot looks pretty old-fashioned and hard to believe in spots. Yet it is still a good movie and has kept my interest. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, a nice lady has incited the wrong man and ran away to marry him. The movie starts five years later after realizing he is really a brutal thief. In spite of this, she tried to make the best of it and not how good life was before this time came into her life. However, the rent is due and there is no money, so the woman is forced to look for work. She becomes a personal seamstress for a wealthy woman whose husband is trying to move a business deal. Unfortunately, the lady they are trying to join a potential customer at a dinner can't make it and the seamstress is paying well to be the man's date. Well, like Cinderella, she cleans well and the man was let down with her! What to do now - given that she is actually married and wants to marry her new fella? Well, see the movie itself to see how it's all solved. I didn't know how they handled the man because it was extremely predictable and clicked. Only when he was out of the way did I admire how the movie didn't give a by-the-numbers final and left the film with a few loose points. <br /> <br /> All in all, a very good movie worth watching, but definitely not good.
