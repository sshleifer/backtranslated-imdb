It is not a love song. <br /> <br /> My one word summary of this movie will be "Excellent". <br /> <br /> It would probably not appeal to the mass film to look public? It's a <br /> <br /> movie that forces you to participate. You can observe, think and question. <br /> <br /> Comparisons can be made with Satisfaction (Topic / Theme) and <br /> <br /> perhaps with The Blair Witch Project for overall filming style. <Br / <br /> <br /> However, this film is unique to both. <br /> <br /> The kinematic effects (solarisation, freezing, blur etc) <br /> were previously seen, but they are mostly used. Effective in this <br /> <br /> movie to support the natural tension of the story. <br /> <br /> The act is raw, threatening and completely credible. <br /> <br /> The right theme of the film is about friendship; the title really does <br /> <br /> clear the game. This is probably not the kind of friendship that most of us have experienced <br /> <br />. It is a love song.
