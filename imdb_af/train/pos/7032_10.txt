My school's drama club will place this show in the spring of 2002 and I can only hope we are as good as this! I recently watched this movie as "research" for my role (Rosie Alvarez), and I just want to say that Vanessa Williams is the coolest! <br /> <br /> Wow! The casting for this movie was straight (with one exception). Jason Alexander, oh my gawd, is there anything he can't do? He was the most wonderful Albert Peterson ever. I especially liked his funny facial expressions and dance during "Put a happy face!" He is so good! Vanessa Williams, as I said earlier, is the coolest. She was a beautiful Rosie, and her transition from secretary to seducer was completely credible. Tyne Daly was hilarious as Albert's stupid mother and George Wendt was wonderful as the worst Mr. McAfee (but I loved Paul Lynde's performance in the 1963 version!). Brigitta Dau cracked me like Ursula Merkle; she really lifted it! And Marc Kudisch was a wonderful Conrad Birdie ... "Struggling!" <br /> <br /> There was just one decisive thing I didn't understand, and as you will see from previous comments, many other people didn't understand. Chynna Phillips as Kim McAfee - what was it? I mean she's really nice and very talented, but ... she looks a little too old for the role. Uh, maybe I'm mad. <br /> <br /> Well, anyway, I recommend this movie. It makes you smile! <br /> <br />
