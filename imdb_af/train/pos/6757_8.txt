Dana Andrews is "Where the Sidewalk Ends" in this 1950's film featuring Gene Tierney, Gary Merrill, Karl Malden and Neville Brand stars. Andrews plays New York City Detective Sgt. Mark Dixon, a bad-tempered policeman who has been in trouble in the past to hit suspects. When a man is murdered at a gambling club owned by a mobster, Scalise (Merrill), Dixon and his partner are investigating. Scalise blames the assassination of Ken Paine (Stevens), who has now left the club after not only beating his wife Morgan (Tierney), but the victim. Dixon believes the victim has earned a lot of money and has been killed by gangsters. He is going to see Paine and doesn't realize he's got a plate in his head about the war, knocking him on the floor and accidentally killing him. Now he has to cover the murder. As a further complication, he falls to Morgan; her father (Ken Tully), who went to Paine's apartment after seeing Paine hit his daughter, was arrested for the crime. <br /> <br /> It's a very good, gritty noir with good performances. The rugged handsome and worn Andrews is convincing as a tough but nervous detective who has to stay one step ahead of his colleagues. The film reunites him with his fabulous "Laura" costar, Gene Tierney, and she looks beautiful as a bad taste model in men who are apparently accustomed to uproar. Little did she know, she still had one on her hands. Ken Tully does a wonderful job as her father, disputing his innocence despite some damning evidence. Karl Malden is very difficult as Dixon's boss. <br /> <br /> My only problem with this well-directed, fast-moving and absorbent film is the end. Pure Hollywood, and I'm in Tierney's place, I doubt I'll respond the same way. A slight criticism of a film written by Ben Hecht and director by Otto Preminger. I didn't find it as awesome as "Laura," but little in this world. If you like film noir, it's a must-see.
