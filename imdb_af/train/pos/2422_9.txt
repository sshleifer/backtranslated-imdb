Yes, it's low budget. Yes, it's one of Candy's earliest movies, but maybe it's the funniest one! John Candy was not so far from his SCTV days in "Going Berserk" and it shows. If you don't crack when Candy tries to help a man with his groceries while he is hand-stuck to an escaped cohort in the process of having sex with his girlfriend, with just the living door that separates them (huh? , watch the movie!), or the way Euguene Levy (the creator of Kong Fu Yu) talks to his mother on the phone, or just the many facial expressions that only Candy can give you, should better monitor your pulse! If you like John Candy of "Only The Lonely", it may not be a movie I will consult with you, but if you enjoy John Candy's SCTV days, this movie is a must see!
