Very lovely pilot. The show series of Tim Burton's better movies ... Edward Sissorhands, Big Fish, Charlie & the Chocolate Factory. The cinematography, the narrative, the music, the external sets, all shouted Tim Burton. There must be a connection, or a strong influence, I just haven't researched enough to know where it is. <br /> <br /> As I saw in the forums, yes, Anna Friel is a poor man Zooey Deschanel. Every time I see her on the screen, I see Zooey. Don't get me wrong, Anna Friel does a good job. Her character is very sweet and sweet and you easily get caught on her. It's more of a distraction I keep thinking. "Why didn't they get Zooey Deschanel." <br /> <br /> Lee Pace also does a great job. I was trying to remember where I knew about him and just watched it. Wonderfalls !!! Large, short-lived series from 2004. If you enjoy Pushing Daisies you should rent Wonderfalls, which is another Brian Fuller creation ??. Hmmmm <br /> <br /> I saw again from Swoosie Kurtz (World According to Garp) and Ellen Greene (Little Shop or Horrors). Two underrated actresses who never fail to do it with their performances.
