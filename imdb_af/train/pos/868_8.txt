What is very French about this movie is the time taken to establish the two leading characters. This may require some patience, especially as it is not "attractive" in the typical Hollywood definition of such. But as soon as the "elevator" arrives, the film jumps forward quickly, perhaps at times too fast. But it's a real rollercoaster ride and if you don't look closely, it's all pretty credible. The kind of movie you know Hollywood would have blown up.
