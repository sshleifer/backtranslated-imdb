First I want to say that Edison Chen is extremely hot and that Sam Lee looks much better than XD! It's probably one of the most original movies I've seen so far; shows a poverty lifestyle background of a Cambodian. The Cambodian (Edison aka Pang) is about to kill people to survive; did it throughout his life. Sam Lee (Wai) has a duty to catch the Cambodian for good. There is a lot of violent action, but there is a good story. The film shows the battle between the two characters; they both beat each other like fierce dogs. Go and watch PPL ... STRONGLY PROPOSED !!! (GO HK FILMS)
