I enjoyed this movie. It was a joy to see a version so close to the vision of Peter O'Donnell. <br /> <br /> Some people didn't like the movie, but it should be seen in the context of the original story that it is. The film used to jump back to show the young Modesty and the events that she had in the woman she became. For the network. For Willie Garvin. <br /> <br /> The pace is a bit slow and, to my liking, not enough tension in today's scenes is being developed. However, it is acceptable to get such a faithful version. <br /> <br /> If you like Modesty Blaise, you'll even enjoy it with his mistakes, if you just want an action movie with motor hunters - forget about it. br /> <br /> It has the feeling of being the first of a franchise, but as I have never seen it, I suspect there will be no more. Unfortunately.
