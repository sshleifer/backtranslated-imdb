This is a movie I never even thought of when I saw my 3-year-old at the video store and grabbed it after I had the cover photo of the animals on Nabooboo Island. We got it and have looked it over repeatedly; In fact, we've rented it a few times. There are very few non-animated movies that my son will watch and pay attention to; what a good change from Dumbo and the Little Mermaid. The acting is outstanding, the songs are compelling, they get deep in your head and you can't help but sing along. The storyline, while specifically about WW2, is timeless in its own way and there is something new to see every time you look. I heard it compared to Mary Poppins, but I think they are two very different movies, both excellent, but somehow my son doesn't have any interest in Mary Poppins. This is one of those movies that children will want to watch over and over, and one that parents will not meet. There are days to watch before noon and bedtime and I don't feel the moaning when he wants to repeat any other movie.
