Don't think of these movies as just another kid's movie - the whole family can enjoy it. It's a weird mix of a movie because it looks like there's a movie in it, but at least it makes sense at the end (unlike modern movies!) It gives you all the elements of a movie (decent plot , good characters - Well, it makes the Muppets, a list of lesser known celebs. * Which movies want to be damp). What is surprising is the fact that it can be a wilderness of emotions, a little sad, some heart-warming, a little funny and some serious everyone makes a pleasant family movie that everyone can watch together. <br /> <br /> * The celebs in the movie are actually top stars of the day, but there is only one true star of the movie and no one dares to shine. Miss Piggy !!!!
