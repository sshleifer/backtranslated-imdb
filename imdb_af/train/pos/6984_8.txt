I was blown away by the imagined Battlestar Galactica, a show that always kept me guessing and brought me to tears more than once. A hardy sci-fi fan, I think I can pick the good stuff from the BS, and that was good stuff. <br /> <br /> As such, when I first heard of the prospect of a prequel series a few months ago, I had a sick feeling in my stomach. I was afraid that the formula that Battlestar had made so successful would be reused in Caprica, which would not work at all. BSG's story, of a sadly dragged band of survivors, caught aboard dilapidated star ships and led by prophetic vision and a series of pseudo-miracles, is perfectly complemented by extraordinary music and better role-players. <br /> <br /> Caprica feels different. Where BSG occurs after the fall of a great civilization, Caprica portrays that civilization in the cold and decadent flowering period. The overall vibe I received from Caprica was similar to that of Minority Report, minus excessive and counterproductive theatricality. In true SCR form, Caprica has already addressed the issues of religious freedom, racism, the morality of God and the nature of the human soul in the first few hours of programming. <br /> <br /> The decisive factor for Caprica is also excellent. Each character is unique and deep, from the obsessive and distant scientist-borne entrepreneur, to his upset and deliberate daughter, throwing each actor and actress into their respective roles. <br /> <br /> So-used music Powerful in BSG also plays an important role in Caprica. Battlestar's powerful drum and sad duduks served his themes very well. Caprica uses a more orchestral sound, which gives the performance of its own, feels completely different from one of its predecessors. <br /> <br /> The new Caprica is definitely its own show, and draws just as much from the Battlestar franchise as it needs. I'm looking forward to the full range.
