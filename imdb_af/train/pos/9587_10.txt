Fifteen years later and Paris Is Burning is still on fire. It's a classic black gay movie, right there with the other honorable black gay movies, The Color Purple and Mahoganoy. This particular work captures underground and subclass (ie, "subordinate") black and Latin gay culture and community like no other work before or after, including all sentimental Harlem Rennaissance gay retrospectives and renderings. They're good, but it's best I say the only "real" movie you'll find on the subject. This is Relentlessy Cunty (the classic home music invention) coming to Hollywood, non-stop, hilarious camp (just as we do it) and deadly social criticism. All this by a white female director (who, of course, should have been a Sister Gurl or Mizz Thing in an earlier life.) I can continue, but I think you now get the point: I love this movie!
