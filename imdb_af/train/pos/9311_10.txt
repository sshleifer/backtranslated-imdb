It was the worst movie I've ever seen, but it was also the best movie. Sci Fi original movies are supposed to be bad, that's what makes them fun! The line, "I love my dinosaur meat well done!" is probably the best quote ever! Also, the plot sounds like something from a pot-induced dream. I can think of it now, the writers wake up after a long night to get up and play dance dance revolution, and put together ideas: Space marines have come to the planet of the stranger, infected with dinosaurs and medieval homes in it. protects a science team studying the planet. Best idea ever! In fact, in line with the complete Sci Fi original movie checklist: Guns Dinosaurs Medieval spaces travel terribly perceptibly <br /> <br /> So look at this movie but don't buy it.
