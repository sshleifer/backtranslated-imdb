It's one of the best movies I've ever seen. It is very good acting by Hanks, Newman, and everyone else. Definitely Jude Law's best performance. The cinematography is excellent, the editing is about as good and includes a great original score that really fits in with the sphere of the movie. The production design is also a factor that makes this film special. For me it is very necessary to beat Godfather, but the fantastic cinematography that is displayed wins this game. Definitely a Best Picture nominee in my book.
