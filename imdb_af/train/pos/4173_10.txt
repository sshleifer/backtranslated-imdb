A kind of road movie in old-fashioned trains in Slovenia late summer province. In the beginning you see someone in underwear pants of black cloth, and when the same young man in his black pants leaves the house with two suitcases, you see that the pants party disappears on a raw flag (apparently his father died). In the train he meets a young lady, and almost without words, but very small gestures, begins a wonderful love story. It's somehow surreal, very poetic and a bit bizarre, with many strange characters and strange incidents. Beautiful photos with love for beautiful detail.
