I have to say that Grand Canyon is one of the most influential movies I've ever seen. I've been watching it a couple of times and I still feel like I've done the first time; that this film in itself can form the entire curriculum of a graduate course in filmmaking. <br /> <br /> Long ago, carts used to promise: "It'll make you laugh, it'll make you cry." It's a very solid and short-handed method to describe what Grand Canyon does. It takes you to the best places in the human experience and the next moment takes you to the gates of hell. <br /> <br /> Much of the movie is played to move back and forth between people close to luck and the same people close to horror. It's always a short step. Just to manage that swing with grace and without making it look, it's exaggerated. This is legal genius. <br /> <br /> Spoiler (kind) comes up. After the audience has moved back and forth through the emotional spectrum, the film throws a curve with a row that does not go from good to bad and back, but instead escalates from an ordinary marriage spit, through a casual self applied knife wound that may or may have stitches, to an earthquake that runs the characters out of the house. In the moment of their relief, forgetting argument, forgot finger, the earthquake survived, a neighbor called out that her elderly man collapsed. The couple jumped to his aid. I was crying when I saw this row. I cried every time I saw it. I'm crying now. It is not sad that it does to me. It is not a particularly sad sequence. What strikes me is that these few minutes were perfect film. It's perfect! Amazing. (End of spoiler) <br /> <br /> There's so much to say about Grand Canyon. It shows relatively ordinary people who experience epiphany, and this makes the viewer experience them vicarious. They are not showy or overblown and there is no long break to investigate the moment carefully. The film is moving at the pace of life. Even when the characters try to make sense of what has happened, they are unsure of what to derive from their experience. <br /> <br /> The Grand Canyon is a very human movie.
