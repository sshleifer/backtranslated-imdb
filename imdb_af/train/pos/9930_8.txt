I'm totally surprised by some of the comments on this forum, and many reviews. I think Tony Scott made a good movie here. Yes, it is highly stylized, flashy and top, but it is very entertaining. I'm happy, at least Ebert and Roeper agree with me :) <br /> <br /> This movie may not be for anyone, but if you are over-the-top, dark humor, cool action and dialogue, you should see it. <br /> <br /> I've seen Scott's Man on Fire, Crimson Tide and Enemy of the State before - all the good movies, but I like this one. It's like a rollercoaster ride, with good soundtrack selections, visual styles and at a time when all movies look like pg13, it's nice to see someone not afraid to show nudity, greedy violence, and have a clear dialogue. <br /> <br /> It doesn't hurt that Keira is super-hot, and even shows nipples in this one, either ...
