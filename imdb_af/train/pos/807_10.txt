Dear Readers, <br /> <br /> The final battle between the Rebellion and the Empire. The Second Star is near completion and when it is finished, it will be punishing the Rebel Alliance. Luke Skywalker, now a Jedi knight, returns from Tatooine with Han Solo and Princess Leia, now announced as Luke's twin sister! They agree to lead the attack on the Shield Generator on the Endorse Forest Moon while Lando Calrissian leads the Death Star attack. Little do they know that they have laid a very ingenious snare and the Emperor Palpatine himself oversees the construction of the Second Star. <br /> <br /> Returning the Jedi is my favorite of the Original Trilogy. It features action, drama, romance, great battles, fantastic acting, wonderful fighting scenes, and incredible music by John Williams. Mark Hamill is now mature in a Jedi Knight, away is the naive farm boy and in his place is a calm, relaxed Jedi determined to save the galaxy. Leia is still cool in this movie, as well as Han and Lando. 3P0, R2, and Chewie do their roles to a T while James Earl Jones is still the biggest villain: Darth Vader. Ian McDiarmid is also an excellent villain as the twisted and cruel relentless emperor Palpatine. The Action Rows of this movie are amazingly incredible and the sword fighting is serious and eager. John Williams's score is still cool and enhances the film through several levels. <br /> <br /> Signed, The Constant DVD Collector
