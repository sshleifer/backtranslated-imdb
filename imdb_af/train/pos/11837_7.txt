It is a wonderful movie in many ways. Everyone in my family enjoyed it. The animation is excellent and easily shows that there are many producers who create films that are so visually brilliant as the Disney Studio. <br /> <br /> One difference from the usual Disney prize is that this Dreamworks movie does not include a slick comedy lighting sidebar. And there are no sudden moments where the characters break into the song. I'm sure a scene at the beginning of the movie wouldn't appear in a Disney movie: the birth of Spirit. But it is tastefully done and is not offensive at all. "Spirit" was a good breath of fresh air. Don't get me wrong. I have loved Disney for years and will continue to do so. <br /> <br /> "Spirit" is another example of a great animated price. As soon as it was over, my kids wanted to see it again. I had the same feeling. I highly recommend it.
