This movie is a real masterpiece, it really is. It's hard to get over such a heart-warming movie, full of fun, laughter, sadness, and a little drama to keep you on your toes. <br /> <br /> A true family movie, Homeward Bound, tells the story of three brave pets sticking out to the Rocky Mountains in an effort to find their owners, following the changes they make and the obstacles they experience. along the way. One of the most wonderful things about this movie is the ability to give animals human personalities - the voice maker is so good. Shadow is a wonderful character, old, wise and brave, and watching as he tries to save Sassy in the river was a very powerful moment. Chance - who wouldn't love a dog like Chance? He must be the most beautiful and dearest puppy ever shown on the big screen. And Sassy is very angry with a cat - she had me in stings when she mocked the keeper; "Here, Kitty Kitty Kitty ... Not on your life, stump." <br /> <br /> There were also many well-made emotional scenes, such as Sassy going over the waterfall (I was really scared of her), shadow falling into the ditch (almost in tears) and then the fantastic end when all three pets come home ... including good old shade! <br /> <br /> A favorite for all time - anyone who doesn't like this movie just doesn't like animals. Rent it or buy it now, and it will leave you with happy memories that will last a lifetime.
