It was the modesty we didn't know! This has been shown and summed up in the cartoon for the syndicates to sell to newspapers! Lee and Janet Batchler were true Modesty Blaise fans given The Dream Job - telling a prequel story of modesty that the fans have never seen. In their audio commentary, they acknowledged that they had made changes in its origins to make the story run smoother. The "purists" should also note that we really do not know if everything she said to Miklos was true because she was "over time". I didn't rent or borrow the DVD like other "judges", I bought it! And I don't want a refund! I watched it three times and I didn't sleep through it! Great dialogue and well-drawn characters I have cared for (even bad guy Miklos), just like in the novels and comics! I can't wait for the next Modesty (and Willie) movie, especially if this "prequel" is a sign of what's coming!
