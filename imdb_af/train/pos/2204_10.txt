I think the movie was kind of strange. In the opening scene one is murdered for no reason. He is not called again. The special effects could also have been better, but I enjoyed watching an older horror movie. This is not the best example of a classic horror movie, but it was still a good movie. I give it about a 5 out of 10 scale.
