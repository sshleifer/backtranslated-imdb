HOLLOW MAN is one of the better horror movies of the past decade. The sub-plot is original and the main plot is even better. The special effects are brilliant and possibly the best I have ever seen in a horror movie. Kevin Bacon again proves that he can handle any role that comes his way. <br /> <br /> Claude Rains shocked the world with the Unknown Man in 1933. Now Kevin Bacon shocked us with HOLLOW MAN. One of the most exciting horror movies ever. The action is intense and the cold fever is true. You may jump yourself if you see it in the dark on a stormy night. The supporting film includes Elizabeth Shue, Josh Brolin, Kim Dickens, Joey Slotnick, Greg Grunberg and Mary Randle. Everyone who does an exceptional job. <br /> <br /> --- SPOILERS --- <br /> <br /> Dr. Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon) and his team discovered the secret to making someone invisible. After animal testing, they proceed to human testing. But someone should be the subject. Volenteering, Caine is invisible. But if his team cannot be seen again, Caine is angry with his condition as he seeks his revenge ... * end-of-life * <br /> <br /> The movie created memorable shocks and is destined to become classic goods in the next century. As a basis for a ghost match in SCARY MOVIE 2, this movie grabs you through the throat and never lets go. The first 45 minutes or so are slow, developing the characters and showing how their experiments work. The second half is exciting and appealing to most action and horror fans. Think of BLUE SEA. Then change the sharks into a crazy invisible man. And then the water changes into fire and explosions. A rehashing of a killer shark movie. Interesting ... HOLLOW MAN gets 5/5.
