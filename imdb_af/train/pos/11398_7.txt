I enjoyed this movie. It was light, beautiful and very colorful. You can see that MGM showed Technicolor. There are hardly any colors that do not appear in this movie. Every scene is full. The choreography was wonderful. Gene Kelly is a miracle. He is so talented. The dance numbers in this movie are all perfectly executed and perfectly designed. He understands that the dances can tell the story so much else. The last part of the film, the great dance series, is very impressive. What makes this movie very special is Gershwin's music. Few American composers had a better gift for melody. I enjoy many of Gershwin's music. It is magical. Ira Gershwin is definitely one of the greatest lyrical writers. He is so greasy and beautiful. It was a highly entertaining movie.
