I only saw it as a child living in East London. The scars of Hitler's Luftwaffe were all too clear and the landscape of the movie reminded us of our street. I remember having nightmares after I saw it. The strange thing is, it's really not dated as considered a piece of social history in movie fiction. <br /> <br /> Apart from a worldwide destructive war, the scale of the machines was very dirty, more Nano technology now, but overall, an excellent and well-crafted job. It was interesting to see how space travel was observed. I would think shooting a spacecraft from a giant rifle would almost certainly kill the astronauts. But many were right. Men crave war, have inhumanity to man. The means of war as a catalyst for development. <br /> <br />
