Dressed to Kill begins with Kate Miller (Angie Dickinson) with a sexually explicit nightmare. She visits her psychiatrist Dr. Robert Elliott (Michael Caine) later for a session in which she admits that she is sexually frustrated and unfinished in her current marriage. Kate then visits a museum and picks up a stranger, returning to his casual sex apartment. Kate is ready to leave, but is attacked and murdered in the lift buildings by a razor-blown woman. Prostitute Liz Blake (Nancy Allen) discovers the horrific scene and sees the killer but manages to escape. Detective Marino (Dennis Franz) says he suspects Liz is the killer, as there are no other witnesses. Liz teams, along with Kate's son, Peter (Keith Gordon), found the right murderer, made Liz's name clear and saw that justice had been done. . <br /> <br /> Written and directed by Brian De Palma I thought Dressed to Kill was a good, solid psychological murder mystery. The script is sometimes measured and slow, but it likes to focus on the character so you really know them. For twenty minutes, Kate only develops as a character before she is suddenly killed, and the movie links it to Liz & Nobody else gets a look. In this way, Dressed to Kill is very absorbent and engaging, unfortunately the character itself is not very nice. I sometimes found the dialogue very funny, especially the dirty talk that sometimes drives Liz out. The motives of the murderers are somewhat likely, but I think you should be pretty much messed up to do anything suggested in Dressed to Kill. It's a good movie, but it didn't make me so excited and I didn't really find a character to root for or like. The movie knocks on an unnecessary and unnecessary turn that ends up not really seeing the point. <br /> <br /> Director De Palma leads with style and visual flair, from the art museum series to a car hunt a whole is filmed immaculately throughout. I can imagine that every shot in Dressed to Kill had a great deal of thought. I felt the movie was a bit flat and unconscious, but nothing made me so excited. There is a fair bit of nakedness, sex and rape with a few bits of gore and violence, Kate's murder by razor blade in the elevator is the highlight, if it's the right word. However, it is not as shocking or controversial as is seen today. Many people will believe you. <br /> <br /> With a so-called $ 6,500,000 Dressed to Kill budget, the glamorous high value of a Hollywood movie is. The New York locations are great, cinematography is good and as a whole it's made very well. I thought the music was inappropriate and was too loud and intrusive. The acting is OK, but despite his top billing I didn't think Caine had so much screen time. Allen was married to director De Palma at the time Dressed to Kill was made. Interestingly, from the four films she appeared in two in De Palma, he & Blow Out (1981) cast her as a prostitute. <br /> <br /> A body double was used for Dickinson, as she initially enjoyed a shower. <br /> <br /> Dressed to Kill is a great thriller that is worth watching, but I didn't think it lived well until it's a high reputation. Good but not brilliant.
