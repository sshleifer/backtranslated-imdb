The beautiful story of Stardust was written by Neil Gaiman (author of MirrorMask) and it's really a good story. I think it would appeal to any Labyrinth, Princess Bride or 10-Kingdom fan and yet it is totally unique and stand alone. And I feel the movie adaptation of this story has a much better end than what Neil Gaiman did in the original novel. I won't spoil it for you. <br /> <br /> The main character, Tristan (Tristran in the novel), is the son of a mortal and a faerie slave who is held by a witch in the kingdom of faerie. The story begins in a village near a wall that separates the magical world of the human world. When there is a falling star, Belistan promises to recover it for a girl he is holding. He is not aware that the star has taken the form of a girl in the fairy tale world and that there are others to her. Three elderly witches wanting to use her heart to be young again, and a little princess. <br /> <br /> It's a very good story. It has humor and magic and beautiful, surreal scenes and visuals. It is beautiful and I feel it can be watched by children and adults of all ages. It's simply magical. This is a true classic fairy tale, as I have not seen in the cinema since the 1980s.
