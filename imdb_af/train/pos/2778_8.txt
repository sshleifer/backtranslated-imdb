I saw it with little expectation and absolutely loved it! Bend it like Beckham is a fairly typical coming-of-year movie about a pretty atypical girl. This is Parminder Nagra's ("ER") outbreak role, playing Jess, a teenager in England who is caught between her traditional Indian family and her love of football (this is our North American football). And even though she is much older than her character, she plays the role perfectly. <br /> <br /> This is a film about friendship - specifically Jess's friendship with Jules (Keira Knightley), her teammate who also goes through family issues, especially with her mother, who has a purple nail polish and a few bows wearing on her shoes, and wanting Jules to be more feminine, wearing lingerie and flirting with boys and fearing sports play means her daughter is lesbian. Jules and Jess like to play the game and have trouble convincing their families to let them go to their dreams. Unfortunately, they both love the same man - Joe, their coach (played by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers). The love triangle causes some tension in their friendship. <br /> <br /> In some places Bend It Like Beckham falls into clich√©s. In others, screens wear too long, and this movie probably benefited from overall stricter editing. <br /> <br /> But it was a refreshingly fun movie about growing up, cultural clash and the love of football. It's about female empowerment, chasing your dreams and supporting your friends. Funny, charming and fun, Bend It Like Beckham is the little movie that can ... and did. <br /> <br /> Excellent. 8/10.
