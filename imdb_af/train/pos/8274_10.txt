This movie is excellent. I found it very interesting. I thought the Wendigo legend was pretty cool. The acting was also good, as well as the costumes, production, photography, directing and writing. <br /> <br /> A very happy family, on vacation, is stranded in the middle of nowhere after hitting a deer. A hunter then appears and is very angry and furious about the fact that one of the deer joints is broken. He then starts the family stable and strange things happen to them. <br /> <br /> See this movie. It is worth the effort. Kudos to the film, crew and filmmakers. Two-inch way!
