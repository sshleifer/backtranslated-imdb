I don't know why some US, Georgia, or even Bulgaria guys have the courage to express feelings about something they don't understand at all. For those who haven't watched this movie, watch it. Don't expect too much or make frames, just because it's Kosturica. Watch the movie without prejudice, try to understand the whole humor - people from Serbia actually married while Bil Clinton bombarded their villages. Gypsies throughout the Balkans always try to help you in any way, LOVE is always. unexpected, pure and colorful, and the Balkans are extremely creative. For those who say it's a bad movie, I can only see that the American's k * t (such as Meet Dave, Get Smart, etc.) is much worse than a sheer, honest Balkan humorous love story film like Promise. The comment must be useful and secondly, the author's personal view. I think the movie is great and people watch it have to respect the director and the story soon to be told. It's simple, but true. It's brutal, but soft and lets you kill.
