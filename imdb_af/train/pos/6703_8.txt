My kids recently started looking at the repetitions of this show - both the early episodes on the N and later on the ABC family - and they love it. (I wasn't aware that the performance lasted beyond the first or second season). I'm curious as to what the overall changes have been. I saw them as "highly publicized", and half an hour of searching Web efforts made nothing but endless remarks on how the early episodes were so much better than previous episodes. (Personally, I don't see much difference - the scripts and themes remain largely the same - but they lose some big people on the way). My daughter placed the DVDs on her wish list, so maybe the country's special features and comments will shed some light on it. I also wish that they made self-referencing humor about the changes - such as 'Boy Meets World' where they dropped the sister for a whole season or so, and when another actor later played on her, they asked her where she was and she says "top" or when the early series awards "Minkus" appears for the high school graduation, they ask him where he is and he says "out there", indicating that the part of the classroom has never been shown through the camera, before saying "Hey, Mr. Turner, wait!" and run screen off (Mr. Turner is another character left) Oh well, maybe there will be an E real Hollywood story about this or something? I was just happy to see Tannie Hilda for the final - she was always one of my favorites - it's too bad, it couldn't be a more comprehensive reunion. (The Zelda candle just didn't cut it for me)
