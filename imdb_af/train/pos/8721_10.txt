Disney (and the wonderful people at PIXAR of course) offers a fun, humorous story, combined with the best computer animation. I admit that maybe the 'faces' of the mistakes were a bit more static than in Antz and they only had four legs (in 'Antz' ses ...). But wallpapers were great and animation was awesome. But let it be a lesson: it was not the computer that made it so successful: it was the man behind the machine, who added the nice little twists I missed in Antz. Of course, some highlights were the "bloopers" at the end (So end it, it's worth it!), Which was very amusing and original. The line "Fully filmed on location" is meant for the more attentive viewer.
