An original uncensored print of this wonderful film was discovered in the Library of Congress in 2004 and was shown in a number of specialized theaters worldwide in 2005. According to recent reviews I found online, the original has all the nastiest dialogue and innosendos intact; They were later either removed or completely shot by the studio before the initial release, to pass the New York State sensors. I also read that a DVD is "expected in 2006" and one can only hope! If we are very happy, it will include comparisons between the two versions. Note that the released censored version was originally available on Laserdisc, which I saw. Stanwyck rules!
