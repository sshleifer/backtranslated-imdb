I was first introduced to "Eddie" by friends of "about the dam" who know I like intelligent humor. I prefer comedians who can be thought of as entertaining like George Carlin and Dennis Miller. In 'Dress to Kill', Eddie gives the same kind of social perception humor that stimulates your thoughts on a topic while dividing your time at the same time. There are a wide range of subjects in this stand-up and they are simply hysterical. The piece about how to decide on Englebert's stage name will let you down! <br /> <br /> Thank you Andrew and Catherine! ... and "do you have a flag?"
