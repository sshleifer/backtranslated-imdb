It appears to be fashionable to rip "Basic Instinct 2" to the point that an important part of the audience (including critics) has found it terrible before it is released. It looks even more fashionable to Sharon Stone, who all like us all, is now fourteen years older, and unlike most of us, it looks quite wonderful. First comment on this movie was so dirty that I had to see myself. In my opinion, this successor is not as good as the original movie, but is not as bad as most comments suggest. Michael Caton-Jones is not Paul Verhoeven, and Henry Bean and Leora Barish are Joe Eszterhas. "Basic Instinct 2" is just an entertaining, average excitement, and besides complementing Jerry Goldsmith's original score, he has little resemblance to his predecessor. Even Stone gives her character a different dimension, creating a lusty, devilish Catherine Trimell, who can perfectly fit among other monsters like Hannibal Lecter. She is an intelligent actress who is not afraid to take risks and can play with her free time at the camp. Unfortunately, it seems she's the main target for those who enjoy it. She became too successful, too much of a main icon, and like all the actors who reached that level, her time came and she is now being destroyed by Hollywood audiences. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is outstanding and gives performances much better than the material earned. David Morrissey is a much better actor and much more interesting than Michael Douglas: his acting is flawless and gives a dense and complex dimension to another one dimensional character. Because he has more screen time and the axis of the movie, he can keep your attention from start to finish. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend "Basic Instinct 2" as a big movie; I just declare my disagreement with most of the comments on this site and my belief that agendas other than the movie itself form the opinion of most spectators.
