Some of the posters look less than grinning because it's not Mark Twain or Rodgers and Hart, but it doesn't matter. You will look long to find a bigger Rodgers and Heart fan than me, but Burke and Van Heusen were not exactly chopped, and they knew Der Bingle there and adjusted some big songs. But Beautiful, Moonlight Becomes You, It's always you, the day after forever, etc. - to fit his highly personal style and here they come with another fine - and dishonestly neglected - ballad, Once And For Always, plus some exciting philosophy-lite entries in If You bump your toes on the moon and are busy nothing to do. The thin plot is not meant to be taken seriously - why does Merlin make it difficult if in most cases it is no longer the other versions? Arthur is a friend / mentor - so if you start to wonder aloud why Sir Lancelot who is sold to historians as signs of knight and fairness metamorphose in a school grounds bully you won't get much fun out of what is essentially a fun movie no. In balance, what makes it, makes so much happiness with it.
