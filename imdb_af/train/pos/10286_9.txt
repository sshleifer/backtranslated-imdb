This movie is great! Although it is funny and entertaining, it is also deep and eye-opening. I'll see it again. Bruce is a man who is dissatisfied with his life. He has a job and a life, but that is not what he thinks will bring him happiness. Bruce is bitter, dissatisfied and cruel that his life should not be the way he intended it. Because of this state of mind, Bruce ends his work and despises God for everything he thinks is wrong with his life. God comes to Bruce and gives him God's powers. Bruce uses these powers to get everything he always wanted. His life is ultimately exactly what he planned to make him happy ..... with one exception. In the process of winning everything, he lost the one person who really loved him. As the film unfolds, Bruce learns that the real change needed in his life was not the circumstances, but his perception of what was really there. This movie was inspiring and deep. If you really pay attention, it forces you to look at your life with a deeply humiliating respect for the fact that much of our time is so much more blessed than we acknowledge. As my wife says, "Since when does anyone know what it takes to make them happy?" and my humble addition, "May we not lose ourselves and those who matter while trying to find out."
