I'm sick of people blowing over Ewoks! True, they are not the best thing that ever happened to Star Wars, but they happened, so handle it! Besides, they are cute, and I don't care if they are marketable. Yubb Nubb! <br /> <br /> This movie always leaves me in tears. It's perfect. The end couldn't be better. I am excited about The Phantom Menace because it will suddenly throw the focus of the whole story of Luke to Anakin. I love how he is revealed at the end - it will be unsolved in any other way. So those of you complaining that the helmet was removed from the Father take a moment to think about it. It is very effective. Father, the man who has hidden behind a mask for 20 years, is finally revealed as a sick man. He is not quite machine - he is vulnerable. <br /> <br /> I don't know how the deciding director chose such good actors in a new hope. They all do so well. They are credible characters. Hamill does an excellent job with his dramatic character development. Fisher is a good job as a female role model (I mean, come on! She killed Jabba even when so many others failed!). Harrison Ford - should I say more? <br /> <br /> The music is brilliant again. It's so much touching and significant when you can choose character themes on different parts of the movie. The best climax is when Luke shouts "NOW!" and jump out to fight his dad in the final battle. John Williams is nothing short of a genius! What a wonderful man! <br /> <br /> The movie already has more meaning for me because of Episode I. I can't wait to see it eventually in the theaters (can I wait ???) and then look at the original again trilogy. <br /> <br /> Bravo!
