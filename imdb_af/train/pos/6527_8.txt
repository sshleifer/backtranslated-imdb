The documentary begins with the perspective of several light years. The traveler moves our galaxy with the sounds of our earthly lives as a space monument to (possible?) Extraterrestrial areas. <br /> <br /> The documentary contains images of Willy Dixen, Robert Johnson, James and J.B. Lenoir. The footage of J.B. has never been published before. The story is of 'blind Willie' Dixon. However, this is done by an actor. The film shows the work of all these early blues men, followed by covers and interpretations by musicians, such as Nick Cave and the bad Seeds among others. <br /> <br /> The death of J.B. Lenoir (John Mayall's song) is a striking event in the story. Lenoir had political involvement and is considered the league of Martin Luther King and peers. His political interests can be found in the themes of his lyrics. <br /> <br /> Blues are found as "THE" native music of America. Blues are the roots and the rest is the fruit. <br /> <br /> The title "Soul of a Man" is after a Willie Dixon song.
