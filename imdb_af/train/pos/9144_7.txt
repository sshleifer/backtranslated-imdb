Okay, this may not be the award-winning film of the year-type film (except the brilliant soundtrack I think won some awards), but it's a great movie about The Kid (Prince / O, take your pick and the events around him in Minneapolis play his music, the music is absolutely fantastic, in my opinion you should own this soundtrack, it is truly a classic and sometimes sounds and feels in a great fashion. play a nice plot, it's worth seeing over and over, especially if you like Prince / O (what I do).
