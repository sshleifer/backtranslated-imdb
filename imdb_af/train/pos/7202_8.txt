Long before "Brokeback Mountain" (about 23 years ago), "Deathtrap" was the first time I had kissed two men on the screen passionately and honestly, I was shocked. I understood it in terms of the plot, and it upset my sensitivity (not much), but it was the first time I've ever seen it in a "mainstream" movie. I thought it was a boring move for his time and had the courage to try it, especially Christopher Reeve, in the middle of his time as PG-rated Superman. Male bisexuality on the screen may have hit its streak with "Brokeback", but it is interesting to note this earlier incarnation.
