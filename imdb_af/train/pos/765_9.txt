I think when "Beat Street" made a national appearance, "Flashdance" came at the same time. The problem with Flashdance is that there was only one break dance scene and the rest was jazz dance and ballet. That was one of the reasons why "Beat Street" was better. The only movie that "Beat Street" can compete with seems to be "Footloose", because both movies have focused on how dance was used by people to express their extreme feelings. <br /> <br /> The Break Street Scenes in "Beat Street" come just before the middle and at the end of the movie. And I loved them all. Almost all the broken sticks were in the panel style scenes: the jackhammer, the torches, the head spins, the suicide, the crazy legs, the mortal, the forward flip, the figure four --- almost everything. /> <br /> Like "The Warriors", Beat Street "has violence related to the gang life in the hip hop world ... but in a much less violent way than the former. The only big fighting scene in Beat Street was when graffiti artist Ramon (who was abbreviated as "Ramo" in the movie) was driven by a rival gangster on the New York City subway ... each other fought the third track and both died from electricity on the rail Well, although the pursuit domain ended tragically, it was better to have died so much as to explode blood from a gang rifle. <br /> <br /> Most of the gangs in the movie were graffiti Related to hip-hop culture and rap music, many rap music appeared in the movie, as hip-hop members use rap music as a distraction for the negative aspects of gang life, even the theme song of the movie, which closed the curtain for the movie was not just a tribute to the hip-hop culture - it was also a tribute to Ramon's death. <br /> <br /> By the way, during the dance scene called 'Tango, Tango', I think the female drummer in the pit band performed by actress Rae Dawn Chong Sheila E made a cameo look.
