I'm not much of an expert on acting or other movie details, but this movie just got me deep. I don't think I'll ever forget it. A special scene (I think anyone who saw the movie knows who I'm talking to) was printed on my brain. <br /> <br /> I also watched the similar movie Lilja 4-Ever (referred to by a previous commentator). It was also very moving, but not quite so straight and cruel. If you are sensitive, you will also bring tears to your eyes, but Anjos Do Sol (Angels of the Sun) can stay with you forever. <br /> <br /> It's very depressing, but I think, no, I hope the movie succeeds in giving more attention to it. <br /> <br /> More people need to watch this movie !!!!!!
