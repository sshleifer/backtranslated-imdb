The critics are stupid. This movie is funny and clever. I loved this movie very much. Why do everyone hate this movie so much. I wish people would love this movie more than they didn't. Ben Stiller and Jack Black are true comedians and they work hard to make this movie. I don't see people out there making movies like them. So people just have to look and not comment. I like this movie. This is OK by all this. There are parts where it has become dumb, but at least they made it. Jerry Stiller will love it because this movie has the acting, just like the show King Of Queens. But it's better than that. I can't believe it's rated so low.
