This movie has a special way to tell the story. At first I found it strange because it jumped over time and I had no idea what was going on. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the story line was simple but still very real and touching. You met with someone for the first time, you fell in love, but eventually got up and promoted a deadly grief. Who hasn't gone through this? but we will never forget this kind of pain in our lives. <br /> <br /> I'd rather be touched because two actors showed good performance to show the love between the characters. I just wish the story could be a happy ending.
