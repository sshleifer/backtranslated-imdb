Diego Armando Maradona was, and still remains, the best football player, who presented the game. Not just an athlete, but an artist. This documentary as the 1986 World Cup will last forever in the memories of every soccer fan worldwide. Because of his tremendous and incredible purpose, he scored against my own country (England). There is absolutely no point in reducing this star. Although I do not endorse Spanish, I can appreciate the Argentine narrator. He actually shouts of happiness and can barely express his emotion. Anything I wrote can be meaningless and difficult to understand, but readers ..... you have to look to know what I mean.
