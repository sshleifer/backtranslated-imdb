This highly-derived movie will entertain many who have not seen some of the more obscure anime movies. I enjoyed most of it, especially after the rather flat opening minutes in the museum (although the pre-title series is very entertaining and includes some of the better little animation). James Garner as the commander and Leonard Nimoy as the king give impressive performances.
