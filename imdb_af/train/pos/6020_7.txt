A beautiful new print of "Zabriskie Point" plays in Paris and looks good in the Latin world. It's time for a complete review of the movie. Let's hope that the new print means a DVD with some insightful "extras" in the near future. <br /> <br /> I remember how ZP looked when it came out and thought it was a clash. This time I was completely rude and would be classified as a near miss masterpiece. The first part of the movie is a late-60s time slot of Los Angeles, then I lived there and Antonioni did a masterful job of capturing the essence of the place. Kudos to production designer Dean Tavoularis who has found incredible places and done excellent work. <br /> <br /> The pressure I've seen runs for 1 hour 50 minutes. It's forbidden for those under 16 (or 18, I can't remember). I suspect there are quite a few recovered footage in this picture. SPOILER - I wonder how much of the desert sex scene was originally cut. What looks today looks rather like current standards. <br /> <br /> There is no soundtrack music for up to 1 hour in the movie. Before we make extraordinary noise such as radio broadcasts, etc. Hear, Antonioni dared to do so. I remember how many were made at the time of the lack of acting by non-actors Mark Frechette and Daria Halprin. This time, Frechette didn't bother me. Halprin is weaker, but gradually improves as the film continues. <br /> <br /> Many of the student riots look like stock material to me. One shot is in a different aspect ratio and distorted by the wide screen. Of course there are real plays, but not so much. <br /> <br /> I'm still trying to find out how Antonioni did some of the shots of Frechette flying the plane. He seems to have done some of the fly. There is no blue screen or double in some shots. <br /> <br /> I hope to return to see the movie a second time. Highly recommended to all Antonioni fans.
