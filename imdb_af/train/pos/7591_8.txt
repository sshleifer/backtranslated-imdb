A mess of genres, but it's based mainly on Stephen Chow's genre mash-ups for it's inspiration. There are magical kung fu, college romance, sports, gangster action and some melodrama for a topping. The production is excellent and the pacing is fast, so it's easy to get past the many bugs in this movie. <br /> <br /> A baby is abandoned next to a basketball court. A homeless man brings him to a Shaolin monastery in the middle of a city, along with a special kung fu guide that somehow the homeless man has, but can't read. The old monk teaches the boy to fall away when he tries to master the special technique in the manual. The school is taken over by a pale kung fu master who is assisted by four miserable monks. The new master is angry with the 20-year-old boy now, because he does not pretend to be hurt by the master's weak push and throw him for the night. The boy is found to throw garbage in a basket from an incredible distance by a man who brings him to a gangster club to play darts. This leads to a great battle, the boy's expulsion from the monastery and the man's decision to change the boy into a college basketball sensation. <br /> <br /> All this happens in the first 20 minutes with most of the events in the first 10 minutes. Apart from the extremely short storytelling, the first problem is how small we get to know the main character into the movie. The man who uses the boy is defined more sharply when the first third is over. The plot does not follow any new land except for the insane action climax of the film. I'm sure you can easily imagine how the wacky monks will end up at the end. The effects, photography and stunting are all at stake and allow for the uninspired plot. <br /> <br /> Stephen Chow has a much better command of plot and comedy writing and this movie will remain in its shadow, but it's not a good reason to ignore it. It's quite entertaining, even with a scatter-shot end. Recommended.
