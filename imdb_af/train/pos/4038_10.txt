This may be the only film that is actually close to capturing the lead role of the late 60's and early 70's American college experience. Go ahead, call another movie that even approaches this one: "Get straight"? "RPM"? This is caricature. "Returning the Secaucus Seven" has its moments, but it is a retrospective film about (self-controlled) individuals more than a movie over time and a place depicted in that time and place. "Drive, He said" beautiful - with subtlety and nuance where it needs to, and a quick kick in shorts where it's the only appropriate way - the anti-concept movement, the ambiguity of grand-college sports (especially when there is a war), the sexual revolution of the period and the general unreality of the day. Believe me, it was so. <br /> <br /> The whole cast deserves praise (like the director of course), but specific praise must be for Bruce Dern, as the basketball coach and Karen Black, the hero is very unusual - except that time - love interest. William Tepper, chairman, also applauds a real applause, both for his perfect capturing of the student athlete of the period and actually playing real college basketball in the movie (remember Anthony Perkins in "Tall Story"? Yikes! ). <br /> <br /> All in all, a classic kind - and the last movie currently in the 6th grade, should comment on ("boring", "repellent" - um, right, sonny, please go back to your Arnold movies). Why isn't this movie available at imdb?
