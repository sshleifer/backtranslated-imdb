Yes, it was a bit low budget, but this movie shows love! The only bad thing about it was that you can say the budget on this movie will not be compared to "Waterworld" and although the plot was good, the movie never really took full advantage of it! Strong performances by everyone and the excitement make it worth watching on a rainy night.
