This film was directed by Victor Nunez who also wrote the script (Ulee's Gold). Beautiful and straight writing, nominated for the Independent Spirit Award, and looking at Ruby's daily life. What we see is a cut in the life of the young woman Ruby. Ashley Judd (Sisters) won the Independent Spirit Award. Best Female Lead for this role. Ruby starts her own life and establishes her own identity. She explores job opportunities, friendships, boys, sex, a typical young adult search. The movie won the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival. As an independent film enthusiast, I chose the movie because of Sundance. I appreciate this type of movie because it doesn't carry Hollywood luggage. <br /> <br /> Although the stories are completely different, it reminded me of Nobody's Fool, with Paul Newman staring. The later film is part of the everyday life of an ordinary man. I like that. The story is nicely told, and all we had to do was sit down and enjoy the story. The only thing I'm not sure about is the title. I'm sure there aren't so many mistakes, and flying in paradise like there is in Florida. As I am allergic to mosquitoes, Florida is not my paradise, I thought about Florida. I get a full red boil. I recommend this movie! Favorite Scenes: Ruby and her friend Rochelle Bridges, played by Allison Dean running on the beach of Panama City, Florida. The sand is indeed very white. I was already there. Favorite Quotes: "Necessity has always been a good excuse." "All the fuss about finding a man is not quite different now, who is going to be and when and why." <br /> <br />
