The Booth puts a whole new twist on your typical J-horror movie. This movie puts you in the shoes of the main character of the story. The director wants you to see what the main character sees and thinks. <br /> <br /> The story is about the perception of the people who work, live and love our protagonist, and how he sees the people surrounding him, an obsolete DJ station stall. The story draws back the layers of the main character like an onion in flashbacks, while the movie runs its course, and from that we learned that things don't always look the same. The film mostly took place in a small, outdated radio station's studio with a very bad history, where the main character was forced to broadcast his talk show due to the radio station in the repositioning process. It is from this limited space that thrives this movie and makes you very claustrophobic and very paranoid. On time, our protagonist cannot determine that the strange events in the old studio haunted or conspired by his associates, or it was all in his mind. What I like about this movie is that the filmmakers see you through the main characters' eyes and make you as paranoid as protagonist. This movie is a very clever, short-lived 76 minute movie.
