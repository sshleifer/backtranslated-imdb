Most people know Paul Verhoeven as the director of very good (and bad) sci-fi movies in Hollywood. But long ago he took out generic thrillers in his native country. The story is a basic femme fatal point of departure, nothing new or tempting. Verhoeven thinks he can make it better by adding in a series of dream sequences, which, instead of defining our main character and his situation, is only used as a way to drive the predictable plot forward. The script was solid, the dialogue helped to soften the effects of the mere story. What really made the movie at least good was a great thing. Jereone Krabbe was wonderful as the "tortured artist", and the fans were also very good. Also, Jan De Bont's cinematography adds at least a bit of life to the film, and helps to make Verhoeven look at least a director. <br /> <br /> 6.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> * * 1/2 / * * * *
