This is the biggest movie I saw in 2002, accustomed to movies. It is rich and makes a beautiful artistic act from these 11 short films. From the technical information (the elected directors) I feared it would have an anti-American base, but ... it's a kind (11 times) personal tribute. <br /> <br /> The worst point comes from Y Chahine: he fails to devour his pride and sees this event as a prosperous punishment. It's really the worst part of the movie, but it shows true freedom of speech for the whole piece. The strangest thing comes from the Mexican almost conceptual film ... I'm still not sure what A. Gonzalez Inarritu meant. The 9 others are perfect (K. Loach, S. Penn, S. Makhmalbaf, ...) or almost perfect (C. Lelouch) and made me smile or cry or even amaze me. I still don't know if S. Imamura's fable really is related or not to the 11th disaster, but it's so beautiful that its final place is deeply 'making'.
