As a low-budget venture in which the filmmakers themselves produce and distribute the DVDs themselves, we may not expect too much of Broken in disk form. And yet, which is noteworthy about this whole performance, is the fact that this edition comes with enough extras to scan a James Cameron DVD and definitely a fine performance. <br /> <br /> With regard to the latter, the only major mistake is that Broken comes with a non-anamorphic transfer. Otherwise we get the movie in its original 1.85: 1 ratio, which shows no technical flaws and looks very much like expected. Indeed, given Ferrari's hands on the approach to joining this disk, you can virtually ensure that fact. <br /> <br /> The same goes for the soundtrack. Both DD2.0 and DD5.1 ​​blends are presented here. Although I am uncertain of what the "original" would be, the fact that Ferrari was involved in both was not considered inferior. Indeed, although the DD5.1 ​​may provide a more atmospheric viewing experience due to the way it uses the score, both are equally fine and free of technical flaws. <br /> <br /> As for extras, the disk is positive. overwhelmed by them. Look at the sidebar on the right side of the screen and you'll see several commentaries, numerous featurettes and various galleries. Indeed, given the way everything is broken down into small pieces, rather than into a long documentary document, there is little to discuss. For example, the "Anatomy of a Stunt" featuret is exactly what it claims, and it also applies to the rest of the pieces. As such, we get coverage on pretty much ever aspect of Broken's pre-production, production and after-production. And although it's better to find it in an easier to digest overall 'make of', we get easy access to any special feature we might want to see. <br /> <br /> Of the various pieces, it may just be the commentaries that need some sort of discussion. Then again, there is also a predictable air for each of the tracks. The one about the actors is too much and doesn't take the movie too seriously. Ferrari's pieces are incredibly enthusiastic about the whole thing. And the technical is good, very technical. Of course we also get a little crossover with what is covered elsewhere on the slides, but in only 19 minutes there are none of these pieces that they welcome. Indeed, a good extra package.
