Ideal for a couple-person drama. Simon is dead, but somehow relives from outside. What he saw there is in the form of empty spots orchestrated to a wonderful score by German avant-garde composer Werner Henze. Simon is being chased by his death, comforted by the death he saw on the other side. His girlfriend tries to keep him alive, but fails to decide to follow him after his eventual death. Many touch and move, deeply psychologist, but a little slow and sometime boring.
