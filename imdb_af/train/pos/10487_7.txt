Save Grace is a great movie with his heart in the right place. Grace was recently widowed and realized her late husband had left her a lot of guilt. She can lose her lovely home and see no other solution to her misery than to start growing marijuana. She lives in a beautiful village where most viewers would like to live and the villagers are all wonderful people who want most viewers as neighbors. There is only one thing wrong with this picture, and this is the way it portrays the effect that marijuana has on its user. It goes without saying that none of the actors or authors of this movie actually smoke the stuff. The way the villagers act after having a joint is ridiculous and just funny. It is in those scenes that white is replaced by English flapper, and it is a pity in a movie that is nevertheless very pleasant.
