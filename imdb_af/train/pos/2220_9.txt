We tend to forget that the master / slave context of recent centuries leads to more than well-groomed estates, driven by large groups of addicted people and a lot of money for white owners. This leads to a group of people trapped in the middle - the offspring caused by slave owners affect their female slaves. <br /> <br /> Some of these children have just become more slaves, and others were free ... but free <br /> <br /> A class formed around this progeny - the genus de couleur libre or free coloreds - and that class was able, to some extent, to own property, to train itself to skill, and to create a comparative dignity. That is, they were not slaves, but they were exploited so far. <br /> <br /> Often, women lived as mistresses to the white plantation masters and men of wealth living in their own homes, with allowances, schooling for their children, and some kind of gentility, depending on their respect preferred to lay on their families. In essence, they suggested themselves to ensure their own prosperity and relative independence of labor - an arrangement called plaque. <br /> <br /> Feast of all Saints is a beautifully written story about the children of one such woman, the result of just as much an arrangement with a local gentleman, and the people who touched their lives both negative and positive. The story was an eye-opener for me, a New Zealander, with no real concept of the black / white lines, let alone the gray area in the middle where the genus de couleur libre vanished. <br /> <br /> The characters are very three-dimensional and are well-rendered in this adaptation of the novel, by Anne Rice. The parts are well thrown, the costumes are great, and the cruel way the lines are pulled out, with the faded areas, is becoming increasingly evident by the conflicts that the protagonists undergo. The genus the couleur libre could not marry the whites, the slaves could not help themselves, and the whites, even the sympathetic, could not face the economic reality to do right by the people they were dependent on . <br /> <br /> I recommend this story, both the novel and the miniseries, to everyone, without reservation. If you cannot handle the truth, you will shrink and crawl through some parts, since one injustice to another is worked out on their color, both by their white oppressors and by their own people. However, keep in mind that this is nothing more than reality, and this story is an absorbing way to learn about it. <br /> <br /> I know it may be sounding, but these miniseries both entertained me and enchanted me, despite the sour taste I found in my mouth at what was going on, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Beware. If it is not read over time, because there is a lesson to be learned from it.
