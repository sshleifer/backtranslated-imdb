It must be one of the best movies to come out of HK in a long time, I was eager to wait to get my hands on this movie just to watch the title. Many fantastic actors in this show and I was particularly impressed with Sam Lee's impossible credible behavior and Edison's portrayal of a killer machine that completely overturned his normal idol image. I would definitely recommend to those looking for an attractive and action-packed movie. However, I have to warn you, it's also an equally depressing movie, because every character in the movie is in some form of death and trouble and struggles to breathe. Think about what life really is about.
