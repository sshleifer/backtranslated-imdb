For my humanities quarterly school project, I chose to do human trafficking. After some research on the internet, I found this DVD and ordered it. I just did it and I still think about it. All I can say is "Wow". It is such a compelling story of a 12-year-old Vietnamese girl named Holly, and an American man, Patric, trying to save her. The end leaves you breathless, and although it is not a happy offspring, it is very realistic. It's incredible and I recommend it to anyone! You really get in touch with Holly and Patric and your heart breaks and because of what happens to her. I loved it so much and now I want to know what happens next!
