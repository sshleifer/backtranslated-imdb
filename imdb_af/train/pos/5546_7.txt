Some say it's the best movie ever released by PRC. I'm not sure about that because I have a good place in my heart for some of their mysteries. I would say that this is probably one of the most unique movies, or any other studio, chief or minor, ever released. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple. The ghost of a wrongly executed ferryman returned to the swamp to kill all those who had killed him as well as their offspring. In this mix comes the granddaughter of one ghost victim, the current ferryman. She takes over the ferry business if the ghost closes on the man she loves. <br /> <br /> Covered in a dense fog and set mainly on the single bogie, it is more musical poem than regular feature film. Listening to the rhythms of the dialogue, especially in the early scenes, they are a poetic cadence for them. Similarly, there is a similar cadence for the camera working as it moves back and forth across the swamp as if it crawls back and forth across the door between life and death, innocence and guilt. The film reminds me of an opera or oratorio or musical object lesson than a normal horror movie. It is a wonderful film production that is probably unique in film history. <br /> <br /> It's not to guess the Lilly. This is a low budget horror / riddle that tells you a neat little story that will entertain you. The story of love and revenge is important here, not the poetic film production. This is especially important (the technical aspects are only window bonding.) If there is real error, it is the cheapest of the production. The mist makes a mood, but it also hides the fact that this swamp is completely on dry ground. The constant back and forth is okay for a while, but even after 58 minutes you wish we could see something else. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong, I love the movie a lot. It's a good movie I wanted, slightly less poverty. It's definitely worth a look if you can.
