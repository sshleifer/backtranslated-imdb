What a beautiful episode for this fine series. This is television excellence at its best. The story takes place in 1968 and is beautifully filmed in black and white, almost a film noir style with its deep shadows and strong images. It's a story about two men who fall in love, but I don't want to spoil it. It is a rare representation of what confronted homosexuals in the 1960s in America. Written by beautiful Tom Pettit, directed by the great Jeannot Szwarc, we move through their lives, their love for each other and their tragedy. By tackling such a sensitive issue, this episode becomes all the more amazing. Our emotions are so torn and on the edge like the characters. Cold fever ran into my spine at the end when they played Bob Dylan's beautiful: "Oh, but I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now," as sung by the Byrds. This one goes far over a 10 and all the way to the stars. Pretty.
