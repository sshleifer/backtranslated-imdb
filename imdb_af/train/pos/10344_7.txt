Melvyn Douglas and Joan Blondell co-star in The Amazing Mr. Williams, a pretty good 1939 mystery / comedy, but forgot, probably because of the incredible movies that came out in 1939. <br /> <br /> Douglas plays a talented police detective who is married to his work while his girlfriend is waiting for a wedding that is constantly being postponed. What is happening in this movie is no exception - he is called to a murder scene just as he goes on the road again. <br /> <br /> Both stars were great for comedy, worked well and often worked together. and help make this battle of the sexes fun. Edward Brophy and Donald McBride are on hand for excellent support. <br /> <br /> As you can read in other reviews, Melvyn Douglas doesn't make much of a woman. <br /> <br /> Be entertained as a little on the long side. <br /> <br /> One of the comments here has destroyed Melvyn Douglas, one of our greatest actors. He literally ran effortlessly through dozens of movies like the other man and the best friend before coming into movies as an old man. He was not lazy, but rather a very hard-working actor (who made it easy) who had a Broadway career simultaneously with his film career. He just wasn't cast as a leading film in movies or had many challenging roles under the studio system. I challenge someone to see his devastating performances in "Hud" and "I never sang to my Father" and call him lazy or referring to his smirk.
