Why didn't it pick up a bag full of Oscars? This is a wonderful interpretation of an often filmed / staged piece. The visuals are breathtaking (especially in wide screen ... the pan & scan shoots this movie's wonderful cinematography and sets really dead). Each frame is a painting. Amazing. The play is almost completely intact, and Branagh's passion for it is evident from the opening titles. No, Zefferelli here, just a storytelling of the way just movie can, but rarely do. Jacobi is especially perfect as Hamlet's murderous uncle: he does not play as a mustache cricket evil villain, but a beautiful politician who allows us to see why only Hamlet suspects false play. Branagh also nails the subtlety of the line between Hamlet's fake / true madness and the burning revenge in him. And the many cameos come very well, all of Billy Crystal and Robin Williams to Gerard Depardeu and Charlton Heston, unobtrusive when sucked into Branagh's vision as I was. An enchanting piece.
