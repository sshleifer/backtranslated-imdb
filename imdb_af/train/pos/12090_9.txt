I saw this movie when I was 10 or 11 years old, alone in the parent's basement on a Saturday night. It was shown on the "Chiller Theater", a regular frightening feature that I considered religiously a young man. Now I have seen many old horror movies, thanks to Chiller Theater, but no one has ever caught up with me like Danse Macabre, a "Castle of Blood". I am now 51 and just last year I was fortunate to find a relatively recent, quality DVD edition of these wonderful stirring-inducing supernatural classics. I thought I'd never see it again. I've been watching it four times, and it doesn't look so tired to me. <br /> <br /> They just don't make ghost movies like this one anymore. Hunted catacombs and crippled cemeteries don't work as well as in black and white back in the day. Anyway, this one has Edgar Allen Poe and Barbara Steele, beautiful shade, cobwebs set in the brand-new ghost castle, restless spirits that reveal their deaths ... and a bad ironic end. <br /> <br /> IMO, this one is there with Robert Wise's "The Haunting", "The Innocents" (with Deborah Kerr), and the more recent "The Others."
