The simple hand-held camera both gives a documentary feel to this movie, and also covers dogma movies. <br /> <br /> Have you ever been bored of the Hollywood policemen with brawny guys getting James Bond orders jealous? Father with the married-living-single-policeman, the divorced-but-family-man, the personified donut and the hard hunter? Ever wondered how the real police work? <br /> <br /> Well, for Germany, this movie shows you. In the north between West Germany and East Germany, the former GDR, a dismissed post office clerk starts her work, fresh from police school. She finds her way around the regular customers quickly and gets used to life as a police officer ... but it's not much fun. <br /> <br /> Other German crime films such as Derrick, Der Alte and so on have dignified officials speak quietly with suspects. These policemen have to deal with the lowest levels of social learning. Good dialogue and realism make it an interesting view even more if you know that part of Germany a bit.
