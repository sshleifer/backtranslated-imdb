Of course, this particular Joe McDoakes short box was inspired by the all-Star Warner Brothers spectacle. Thanks Your Lucky Stars, one of those star-morale boosters of the era. In that one, Eddie Cantor both played himself and a comedian wishing to exclude films, except for his likeness to Cantor. <br /> <br /> George O'Hanlon, who was in the McDoakes shorts, is both himself and McDoakes just trying to get a break in film. As with your lucky stars, a few Warner Brothers have contracted players with a free moment that is inspired by this movie. O'Hanlon has been sent through central decisions for a small one-role in World War I movie, but Lookalike McDoakes gets the message. The poor man is so nervous about his big moment, he begins to think of ways to make his one line. Maybe sounds like a real movie star will help. <br /> <br /> 86 later, the desperation of director Ralph Sanford and patient of Clyde Cook, a British cock soldier, find a niche in the film business for the poor. McDoakes. It is worth seeing this very funny short box nominated for an Oscar to find out what happens to O'Hanlon / McDoakes. <br /> <br /> Both.
