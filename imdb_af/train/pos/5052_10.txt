This is an excellent movie. As a Canadian who grew up with a rural lifestyle, it is very well known, winter, canoeing, hunting, hunting and the like. It is easy to take the familiar for granted, but after watching this movie, it has grown on me several times. <br /> <br /> The story of Gray Owl is known for many Canadian credit to director Attenborough and scriptwriter Nicholson for expanding the story. <br /> <br /> Brosnan well illustrates a complex man, a very good performance. Annie Galipeau is beautiful in her first big role. The rest of the cast is solid.
