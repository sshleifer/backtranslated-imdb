A beautiful postcard from New York. The thing I had the most was to see it with my whole family and not to wait for a stupid toilet humor joke to appear. It never did. My teenagers also liked it. My son to Natasha Henstridge and my daughter to Michael Vartan. My wife and I noticed that we couldn't remember the last time we could sit with the kids and ALL enjoyed something. This film tells a story that feels comfortable but not old or finished. The end came with a twist that we all liked. If you're not just a cynical person and are willing to unfold a story then it's for you. As a guy it takes a lot to keep my interest when it comes to romantic movies and this one did. I recommend it and we need more of these movies to watch.
