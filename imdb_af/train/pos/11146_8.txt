Fascinating downer about a male hustler in New York City forced to live in a condemned building with a crippling man. Exquisitely dark investigation of contemporary moral and social decline, well-directed by John Schlesinger (who never went to work up here) and performed excellently by Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman. Packs quite a punch overall, but the "fantasy" scenes - some of which are played for a chuckle - are slightly intrusive, just like the "mod" drug party. The relationship between the two men is sentimental, but the filmmakers are careful not to get discouraged, and this gives the picture a head start that could not have been with a lesser director than Schlesinger. Originally X-rated in 1969, and winner of Best Picture Oscar; author Waldo Salt (who adapted James Leo Herilhy's book) and Schlesinger also won images. *** 1/2 from ****
