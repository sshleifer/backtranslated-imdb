I grew up in the time the music was popular in this movie. What a great time for music and dancing! My only complaint was that I was a little too young to go to the USO and nightclubs. Guess it sounds like I'm living in the past, (I have wonderful memories), so, what's wrong with that? !!? World War II was a terrible time, except where music was involved. Glenn Miller's death was a terrible sadness for us. This movie will be my favorite. Clio Laine was excellent; what a voice! I don't know how I ever missed this movie. My main reason for this comment is to warn the modern generation of an alternative to Rap and New Age music, which offends me. Please look at this movie and give it a chance!
