Don't let my constructive criticism prevent you from buying and watching these Romy Schneider classic. This film was shot in a lower budget, probably against the will of Ernest Marishka, so he had to pay. For example, England is portrayed as border with Germany. A will of the wisp Victoria and her mother take a vacation to Germany with the buggy ride alone. They arrived too fast. It probably can't be helped, but the castle they rented was for the movie Austria. When she is told that she is queen, she goes to the royal room where the courtiers bow to her, where are the British citizens of the castle for the new queen? Why does ISBN show herself to the balcony to greet her subjects? Low budget! Where, then, is the audience aware of this imperfection? I wonder how the critics felt. Expensive the inn scene, she meets Prince Albert, but ISBN is not excited about it. When you go to the meeting at the inn, you hear music from famous old American civil war, such as "My Old Kentucky House" and "Old Black Joe". What? civil war songs in the 1830s? Is Romy Schneider portrayed as Scarlet? Where's Mammy? May Magna Shnieder also play her? Is Adrian Hoven Rhett or Ashley? What was in Marishka's mind? Well, it adds to the camp. It's unintentional to satirize Queen Victoria's story. This is the only reason you need to collect it or see it 03 11 09 correction Germany and England are connected
