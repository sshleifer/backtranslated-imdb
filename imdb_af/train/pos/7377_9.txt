this movie is virtually impossible to describe. The alternative title "Do not Look Up" is much more descriptive. Like most Japanese theaters, the story is not as linear as American. The story revolves around a director who filmed a story about a ww2 destroyer. The set is ghost (?) By an actress who died during the filming of a TV show in the 60's. the director is the only one to see this show. If you've seen Ringu (director Hideo Nakata is the same) and like it, you'll like a ghost actress. I loved ghost actress much more than Ringu. a very scary and disturbing movie. a 10!
