We are talking about a low budget film, and it is understandable that there are weak points (no spoilers: one sudden explosive expert and one meaningless alcoholic); But in general, the story holds your interest, most characters are nice and there are some original situations. <br /> <br /> I really like movies that surprise you with some who aren't what they want you to believe, and then turn and turn the plot. I cheer up this one. <br /> <br /> If you know what I mean, try also "Nueve Reinas" (Nine Queens) a movie from Argentina.
