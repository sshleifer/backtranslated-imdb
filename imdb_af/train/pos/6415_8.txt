TIllman Jr.'s drama about the first African-American fleet diver (Gooding Jr.), which cuts out all chances and achieves its goals despite a strictly forbidden coach. The screenplay is not bad, a bit extreme, but the direction and acting is the first time, and this film is inspiring and accomplishes what it is supposed to do. I had DeNiro at the forefront, although it is not equal to his masterful work (taxi driver, godfather and all others), it's just as good as his other good performances like King of Comedy or Angel Heart. DeNiro is always convincing and credible here, very good performance, Gooding Jr is not bad, definitely one of his better achievements. --- IMDb Rating: 6.6, my rating: 9/10
