Every day we can watch a large number of movies, soaps ... on TV. Sometimes a miracle happens. A good movie, with real feelings, with great actors, with a great realtor director. For me, there are two movies that everyone should see: the first is the Pacula? "Sophie's choice" with Meryl Streep. The second is 'Journey of Hope'. As a human being, we must learn about humility, about the love of others, about accepting other civilization, other ways of life. We also have to struggle with racism and fascism. We must avoid judgment, criticism; we just have to love our earthly companion. This wonderful movie helps us to reach John (Lennon's) dream: Imagine living all the people living in peace. These two movies are hard to see: watch it, but surely you'll be hurt, but better. Great movie, great actors, terrible story, pain and cry guarantee, but also better understanding of the other. Enjoy it.
