If you have boys or girls who love action, adventure, intrigue and imagination - without breaking into the song every twelve minutes, it's the Disney movie for you! My boys loved this movie every minute, and I have to admit that I laughed a lot in the film a lot. There are no juicy songs to get away from a wonderful story, and the characters are all loving and identifiable in their own right. It has to be one of the Disney classics because of its beautifully illustrated scenery and its unceasing excitement!
