It was a wonderfully smart and entertaining movie that I would never dare to watch many, many times. The casting was great to fit the younger with the older characters. There are those of us who appreciate good actors and an intelligent story format here. As for Judi Dench, she is beautiful and a gift to any kind of production in which his stars. I always make a point to see Judi Dench in all her performances. She is an excellent actress and a pleasure to watch as every transformation of her character comes to life. I can only be grateful if I see such an excellent picture, because most of the moving pictures that are made more recently have no good characters, good scripts and good acting. The film person needs heroes, not deviant manikins, who do not have ingenuity and talent. How wonderful to see old favorites like Leslie Caron, Olympia Dukakis and Cleo Laine. I'd like to see this movie win the awards it deserves. Thanks again for a great evening of entertainment. I congratulate the author, director, producer and everyone who has done such a good job.
