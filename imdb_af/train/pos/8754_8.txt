I watched this movie 11 years ago in the company of my best female friend. I took out my judgment, so I didn't feel very well. <br /> <br /> I finally enjoyed it. It's a hard look if you consider it to be about friendship, unwanted betrayal, power, money, drug traffic, and the extremely difficult situation of living in a strange prison. <br /> <br /> The acting is on the first level. Two of the women I die the most and that is a good thing. Claire Danes is as cute and beautiful as ever, while Kate Beckinsale is very warm and has a good performance. Bill Pullman is also wonderful and shows his histrionic qualities. <br /> <br /> There are many plot twists to dig and make it an interesting visual experience. Plus it shows the tough times in Thailand. <br /> <br /> This is an underestimated movie. Not many movies like this have come in recent history. It should reflect on many things ...
