*** 1/2 Scarlett Johansson, Woody Allen, Hugh Jackman, Ian McShane, Romola Garia. Directed by Woody Allen. Just after joining Johansson on "Match Point" the two come back for "Scoop" a Corky, zany and fun comic ride. When a student reporter (Johansson) finds a new shot from a dead reporter (McShane) when she enters the materialiser of a lame wizard (Allen). The shot of the new Tarot Card killer in London, which may be Peter Lyman (Jackman); while Sondra and Sid play detective. Sondra falls in love with the attractive killer. Allen finally hit a point, not as good as Match Point, but definitely better. I laughed much more than I expected, one of those years to see
