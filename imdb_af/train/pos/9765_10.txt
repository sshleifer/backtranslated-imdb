I saw this little movie at the age of 10/11 in 1979 when broadcast on CBS. I didn't know it was in a theater. To judge it from a children's point, I give it 4 out of 5 stars, because it was a young boy at the time, it looked a little "girlish". <br /> <br /> The climate scene where Gazooks tickles the daylight out of everyone was a bit disturbing at the moment, but you outgrow that kind of thing. <br /> <br /> In 1995, when I discovered a Blockbuster Video again, I had to see it again! I've always liked it, despite the fact that it looks a bit "old". I do not know where the other reviewer here had the idea that it was not on VHS. <br /> <br /> It's out there. Maybe even on DVD at the moment, at least I hope it is. I want to share it with my children someday! 10 stars here, it's still a wonderful children's movie. (end) <br /> <br /> 09/08/2009: Eventually you got a VHS copy !! Woo-hoo!
