There is no director I like more than Mamoru Oshii. Unfortunately, although he did get quite a few films that received great international attention, there are a few more of his films slipping through the cracks. Tachiguishi is one of them, and although I loved it, it's not difficult to see why distributors in the West are somewhat reluctant to release them. <br /> <br /> Between its big and serious movies is Oshii It's known to do smaller projects. While Tachiguishi definitely falls into this category, Oshii has really disobeyed himself with this one, making something difficult to classify, even as a freaky Japanese flick. Go figure. <br /> <br /> At its core, a documentary does not lie completely different from Otaku no Video. But rather than making a fool of an existing subculture, Oshii envisioned his own and immersed himself in the life of cats, scorching food for free and maintaining the Japanese cooking level. Oshii's approach to the subject has close ties with Dai-Nipponjin, as the subject is handled with a deadly gravity while the images on the screen look as ridiculous as they can be. Deadpan humor taken to the limit. <br /> <br /> But it's not all, rather than just shooting his cartoon. Oshii decided to use it by using a new visual technique that is being baptized. A strange mix of live action, photography, digital animation and dolls on a stick. Worked out and acted (or set as you like) by the big ones of the Japanese animation industry, no less, as the project would be as low as possible. <br /> <br /> And if you think just about that, know that the movie is extremely dialogue-heavy, and that makes it a good companion for Innocence. The influence of the writers is analyzed from all sorts of cultural, political and even philosophical angles, by the continuous stream of monologues and dialogues discharged to the audience. And to make it even worse, the whole film is totally based on the real Japanese history and customs, making it even harder for a stranger to get a good grip on the material. Needless to say, several views are advised to make the best of all the details in the movie. <br /> <br /> At conceptual level, the movie is easy to follow and is quite hilaries. Several writers are introduced as being the most influential historical figures of post-war Japan. The movie plays as you expect a serious documentary to be unfolded from any other important figure, but somehow the big and cruel animated cut-out photographic limbs of whatever figures make it not so serious. The series of characters being imported is sublime, Shinji Higuchi takes the cake as a cowboy wearing a nasal ring while taking on the fast chains with his gang bull / people. <br /> <br /> In addition to a nice comic show, Oshii regular Kenji Kawai offers a score ranging from atmospheric and dark to wacky, strange and comical. Many enjoy the exaggerated sounds and effects, which complement the animation and strongly contradict the scene of the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> Visually, the movie is very atmospheric, though it has to be said. that the animation is fairly scarce and effective, remains burnt out, only to occasionally burst into hyperactive weirdness. What is not exactly a bad thing, see how Tachiguishi is so dialogue-heavy. Despite this, the film is still a visual masterpiece, as each frame looks completely green and adjusts to suit the overall atmosphere of the film. <br /> <br /> Be careful though, because Tachiguishi requires a lot from the viewer. If you don't speak Japanese, there is a lot of reading that needs to be done and there are many cultural references that need attention. In addition, the monologues in the film area have been fairly expanded and it can be difficult to follow. The film still has English subtitles and even though my French was mostly enough to get what it was about. I'm sure I missed many of the finer points of the movie. <br /> <br /> Tachiguishi is not easy to film, but halfway through it reaches full steam and it doesn't leave there. I still hope to see this one again with English or Dutch subs. A dub would actually be best for a movie like this (much like Container), although I think a quality anime dub is a bit too much to ask. <br /> <br /> With all that said, I can only congratulate Oshii on another great movie. It's hard to find a movie that mixes and mixes so many styles and influences to create something that is so unique and still works. The film is clever, looks and sounds good and is filled with creativity to the edge. It's extremely funny, even if you can't catch all the details on the first show. But be sure to get it at least with decent subs, as the automated English translation that drives it is totally worthless and the movie doesn't have justice at all. <br /> <br /> Tachiguishi caters for a very specific audience and I'm not surprised that the French have received their release, while the rest of Europe (and the rest of the Western world) are still waiting for a sign of this movie. But for those who like Oshii, appreciate dry and deadly humor and long for creative spirits, this is a movie that cannot be missed, although it may just as well burn. 4.5 * / 5.0 *
