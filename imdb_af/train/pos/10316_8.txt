Remember these two stories fine and first, which is not in the distant future, we see a young boy preparing for the exam day, the state i.q test. The boy is slightly surprised at his parents' anxiety, as some of his friends have already done so and eventually go down to do the test. On arrival he is given an injection and is curious about why. The examiner smiles and tells him it's just to make sure he's telling the truth. The boy then asked again, why would he not? It is later and the parents are worried about the screen when a message appears and states that the state is sorry, but their son's i.q level has exceeded the national quotient and politely asks if they want a private funeral. A cork from a closing scene! A Message of Charity was a heart-warming story about a quick mental relationship between a past-and-present girl. In the past, what has been in a strange story of magic spells out and divides into history pages in the past. A fun story with a heart-warming conclusion.
