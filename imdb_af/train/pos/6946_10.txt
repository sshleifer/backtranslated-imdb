24 must be the best spy / adventure series ever televised. The whole idea of ​​telling a story about a 24-hour real time is brilliant. The style of filming and pacing is what we are stuck to seeing. And Jack Bauer has long been one of the biggest protagonists in a TV series. I rate it, along with The Simpsons and The X-Files, my three most favorite TV series. <br /> <br /> This first episode begins with the conspiracy to kill US Senator David Palmer, who is also running for president. Bauer is called to his office to discover who is behind all this and at the same time fleeing his daughter's way to the uncovered to his bedroom. So starting an adventure in the best political style and what's best about it is that it always takes place in real time, making this TV show a real work of originality at a time when almost every program on TV seems to be Be the same things over and over and over.
