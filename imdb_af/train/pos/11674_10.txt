The planning episodes were a bit dull, but when they came to the desert, it was quite fun to watch. The reason I call it the most realistic reality show is because Charley fell out of the race relatively early to my surprise. When his hands were hurt, I expected the usual stress and then repaired a miracle, but instead he ended the race. The terrifying moment of the show should not have been when Max almost stuck in the desert, with almost no water or food! The end was great and I was very happy to see that at least one of the team made it. Overall, not as big as the Long Way Round, but definitely an interesting watch, as one sees the most challenging race in the world.
