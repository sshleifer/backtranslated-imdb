It likes the original manga of the same name, aka (Tramps Like Us in the US), but it can still be enjoyed even if you haven't read the manga. It's another kind of tail that shows a strong and independent woman who hurts just like everyone. However, due to her outward strength, she fears her inner feelings and therefore those who are around her are hurt by their blunt comments. The only one who really portrays her and with whom she can be comfortable is her new pet ... while ... Momo. If you want something other than the normal boring stuff, with some great J-Dorama (Japanese Drama) actors / travel then it's definitely the series to watch ... and read!
