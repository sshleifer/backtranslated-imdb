If the answer to this question is yes, you should enjoy this excellent movie. I only saw it here in Paris a couple of hours ago (where the action of the movie takes place) and I can still feel the great trauma I found in the back of my eyes ... What a visual shock! I have never seen such a beautiful black and white picture and such a drastic change in the way of making animated movies. I strongly believe there will be a before and after Renaissance, similar to what we saw with Pixar movies or the Akira and GhostInTheShell experiences. This is a real breakthrough in the small world of animated films and I hope this French initiative (a small unknown French studio with a few young people who have had a dream called "Renaissance") will receive the success and recognition it deserves. Vive la France!
