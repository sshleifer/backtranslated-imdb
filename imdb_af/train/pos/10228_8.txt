Being a giant monster lover was that I had to see "Yeti", especially after hearing so much. Thanks to the good 'owl bootleg market' I was able to find a copy quite easily, and was fortunately surprised to see if this movie was actually, I dare say, decent. <br /> <br /> Good for what it is, actually, a vintage giant monster movie. It kicks in quite quickly as Yeti is almost immediately found, and we are introduced to several characters. They consist of a few sleazy ones, some good ones, and a girl who is actually one of the most straightforward beautiful and beautiful girls in a cheese science film. -haired man straight from the original Woodstock concert, and really, he's not that bad of a man, especially after being introduced into the kind of funky cage-like thing in the world. Godzilla he is not - despite his rude awakening, he does not even have rampage (actually he destroys anything in the whole picture), but kinda just looks surprised while trying to figure things out. Yeti seems to understand English well (my copy was dubbed in English) and he knows who the good guys and bad guys are. <br /> <br /> However, we want to see the giant Yeti thing, and he's pretty much in the whole movie, and in typical low-budget fashion, it looks like it's changing a lot, depending on the scene and there is even a bunch of "false bones" shots of him standing there. <br /> <br /> Yes, the special effects aren't the biggest, but there are definitely some good people here. A place where Yeti passes through a warehouse is well done, and in another, he uses the windows of a building as "ladder steps" to climb from the top, crushing each window with its foot and residents often shock. - in a very real order, much better than it should be in such a "bad" movie. <br /> <br /> "Yeti" never says as low as "APE". Actually, the only time it even gets close to real cowardice is when the beautiful girl causes Yeti's nipple to straighten and he lifts his eyebrow in an "oh yes child" way. But even that is not so bad, and even a little laughing from the viewer. <br /> <br /> The movie is pretty long for this kind of thing, but surprisingly it doesn't get boring - the story is really good, and just to watch this beautiful actress on the screen, any male viewer be happy. <br /> <br /> "Yeti" may not be in the top echelon of giant monster flap, but it is certainly better than other King Kong '76 rip-offs such as "APE" and "Queen Kong" by very far .
