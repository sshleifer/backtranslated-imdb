I only saw the video 15 years ago. I thought it was excellent and I still do. I am a former English teacher (high school and college) and a lover of English romantic poetry. Koleridge is so good with me. Anything that detracts from the beauty of the poem or the power of the story will not get my voice of excellence. In this case, everything works well to involve the viewer, especially high school students. The story is well illustrated for a generation that grew up on television. In addition, Michael Redgrave's voice adds a sense of authenticity and authority. Well, so there wasn't a big budget for the project. So it wasn't Star Wars and there is no CGI in it. But who can dismiss Gustave Dor√© as part of the presentation? The above comments, which in just four lines dismiss the video as a piece of garbage, are unfair and inconspicuous. I'm a friend of the producer, but that's not my reason for this comment. I rather defend an artistry that I value at all levels. It is well suited to bring Coleridge's poem to students in a way that applauds them and generates their sympathy for the lesson that the ancient navy gives.
