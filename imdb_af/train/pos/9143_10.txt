It was as if the year 1984 was nothing but the Orwellian nightmare, it was calculated to be with George Orwell's science fiction novel !! 1984 was one of the happiest times in American history !! The revival of the economy, and a revival of basic American values, has resumed an idealistic aura of innocence, regarded by the American people with a very favorable attitude! There have been many ersatz versions of classic movies in the past, but the original is almost always considered better! "Purple Rain" is such a movie in this category !! Made in 1984, Purple Rain presented a dog-ring of eighties happy quality music, which they included in making this great movie !! Certain artefacts that indicate the eighties are indeed classic! Screwball comedies, neon accent clothing, and of course the music !! Eighty-year-old music is regarded by experts as the best decade for music in American history !! In Minneapolis, "Purple Rain" accommodated the use of naive entertainment with the changing times of the city. When I was a little kid, I lived in Minneapolis for about eight months, and then the non-white population was below 3%! By 1984, African Americans made some roads in Minneapolis, thus establishing a solid native culture of their own! The movie "Purple Rain" evokes an eighty-style outfit, and music ensemble, which has captivated the movie effortlessly! I loved the music of "Purple Rain", and the innovative approach that this film brings to confrontational success is indeed brilliant !! See this movie if you haven't seen it yet! Prins has become a dozen icons with this masterpiece !! For a short time he dated Kim Bassinger, he has to do something right! "Purple Rain" puts Prince on the map !! This film expressly gets me assertive pronunciation from THUMBS UP !!!!
