Henry Fool surprised me. I didn't expect it to be entertaining or entertaining either, or as strong as it did. Fay Grim is still surprised by the fact that it is a solid continuation of a story that doesn't need it. As soon as the viewer watched the movie for the first 20 minutes, it became blindly aware that it was one of the BEST successors to brilliant indie movies. At least as good as Ginger Snaps Back, if not better. <br /> <br /> I'm a little disappointed that Jeff Goldblum's share is so small, but I'm glad he's part of this short term. He is convincing and beautiful as Agent Fulbright. Also a pleasure is Liam Aiken, who is fittingly wise to Ned Grim, the son of Fay and Henry. <br /> <br /> This movie is so much fun. For example, I am pleased to discover that Henry is not really the loser he looks at (at the end of the fool) and to discover further that he is actually a genius ... well, it really is a beautiful stroke of the pen. <br /> <br /> I hope they do a third ... like the end of the trilogy. It looks like it's missing. They have to give Ned Fool Grim a right, and Liam has to look for his father to confirm the tremendous change in his mother and the feeling of close genius he feels in himself. Of course, suppose Fay is still withholding many of the key facts of her son regarding his father. It feels like it should be done. I'll buy it. <br /> <br /> Even with more action, it's still not an action movie. It's more drama and plot ... a mystery, kind. I will often see it. <br /> <br /> It amounts to 8.3 / 10 of ... <br /> <br /> The Enemy :.
