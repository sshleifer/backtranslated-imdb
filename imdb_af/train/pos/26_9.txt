When I was a kid, I watched it many times, and I often remember the "Happy Cat" song. All the songs are great, and actually unforgettable, unlike many children's musicals, where the songs are just trapped without real reason. The screens and costumes are cute, and the play is very well done, which is not surprising, as the role of the shoulder is. Christopher Walken is very catlike and does not need stupid makeup, or a cat costume for the viewer to believe he is a cat that has been changed for a man. And Jason Connery is so cute, as the shy and uncomfortable miller's son, Corin, who falls in love with beautiful and brave princess Vera. It's a very fun, fun, show length movie, where characters, unlike most fairy tales, are given personalities. Some of my favorite parts are when Puss Corin pretends to be drowned; at the ball when everyone starts dancing a country dance because it is "all the rage abroad"; when Walken is in the kitchen, dance on the table (he is also a good dancer!); And when Vera told Corin all the things she used when she was young, as if she were a miller's daughter. I recommend this movie to kids and parents who love magic and fairy tales. And it's actually a movie you can watch together, because it won't drive adults on the wall.
