If you remember that summer when you had your first kiss, first boy / girl or first puppy love fling ... this movie is for you! OK, so this movie will and will never win an Oscar, but as a Dominican I loved it ... there are a few things in the movie that may just be right over your head if you're not part of the culture is not ... the children are brought up by a grandmother who is both mother and father, the youngest son who was born and prayed with a Cafe Bustelo tin (sooo Dominican!), Judy harassed men by , going to church and lighting a prayer screech ... the brilliance of the movie was in those little details. Granted, it wasn't a withdrawal from all the works of the movie, but it wasn't meant to be, or it was meant to be an educational tool for those who want to learn about Latin culture (hint: make new friends instead). More of a bitter-sweet, faux-cumenty, this movie really does it without taking itself too seriously. As in the tradition of "Y Tu Mama Tambien" it was just one boy's lifetime story. I recommend it (especially for Dominicano!) = O)
