*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** After two such trips ("Magnum Force" and "The Enforcer"), Dirty Harry seems to recover his step in "Sudden Impact", a gripping thriller that Play wisely for his strengths: Clint Eastwood's charisma, which has also been targeted, and a story that only spends enough time on display and retains its energy for the big scenes. <br /> <br /> For one time, Harry takes his case outside his native San Francisco (where he is in trouble with his superiors for his "shoot first, ask questions" later tactics) to the village of San Paulo. There, (WARNING: Potential spoiler), a group of low kites are horribly murdered, one at a time, by a woman they raped earlier and whose sister has been in a state of katatonia since the attack. /> <br /> The killer is portrayed by Sondra Locke, and she makes Jennifer Spencer's character an interesting mix of compassion and cold-bloodedness. Locke's cold eyes and icy voice, when she tries to comfort her or give revenge to the rapist's hospitalized sister, is very effective in painting a portrait of a woman who is wrong, whose years of suffering and anger are now deadly bear fruit. <Br /> <br /> The rapists are a horrible fate, especially the leader, who practically stamped on his forehead, and a lesbian who looks almost one of the guys, despite her anatomical inability to participate . The backlit screens, though not graphically explicit, are nightmare enough and are clearly meant to abandon the audience to Jennifer while killing her attackers. Some will dismiss "sudden impact" as garbage: a senseless, manipulative revenge story. On a certain level it is true, but it is well done trash. Regarding the film's advantage, the strength of the Sondra Locke show is that we give a complex character whose wounds are more visible in her paintings than in her gestures or speech. What we have here is an action movie with a point of view. <br /> <br /> You may take or leave the idea that some unfair earnings are punished in any way necessary, but the riddle behind the murder becomes apparent. to Harry (a realization that it is prudently spoken with dialogue), he is offered - what to do about a murderer whose motivation he can sympathize with, but whose actions he is bound by the law not to tolerate. This makes the story more interesting than the regular Dirty Harry prize. <br /> <br /> The movie's other redeeming quality is Eastwood's direction. It's a Dirty Harry movie, and Eastwood knows the character better than anyone else. The movie is styled with style and white, and edited to give the action scenes a big payout. Of the best "Harry moments" in the whole series, including Harry's best-known line, "Go ahead - make my day." <br /> <br /> "Sudden Impact" is a movie that gives the courage of its beliefs in presenting a story about a contemptible crime and the brutal consequences that follow. It is also a disturbing detective story, well made and well-told. And it certainly is never boring. On these criteria it succeeds.
