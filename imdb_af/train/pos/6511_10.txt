Like many here I grew up with Scooby-Doo. Unlike many here, I love this show! I think it was very well done and thought. All this indicates it as a turn-off that is not meant to take seriously. The formula is simple - it's a parody of other cartoons with a single bad guy trying to get the good of the good guy. Using the famous Shaggy and Scooby-Doo characters, it's much easier to enter the viewer with the parody humor from the beginning of every 30 minute episode. <br /> <br /> There have always been Scooby-Doo spin-offs that annoyed parents. The classic is the Scooby-Shaggy-Scrappy shorts from the 80's. These spin-offs had their place: They allowed new content to be sold, created new fans and kept Scooby-Doo goods on the shelves. I agree that "Shaggy & Scooby-Doo: Get an idea!" Don't match this traditional role, but that's probably what I always wanted the Scooby-Shaggy Scrappy shorts to be: an action-packed show that focuses on the best / funniest Scooby-Doo characters! Good features of the show: the animation, the voices, the attention to detail, the bad guys, the "best friend" relationship between Shaggy and Scooby-Doo, the constant humor! Bad Features: None, although the revived mystery machine is almost temporary. <br /> <br /> Well done Warner Bros. Animation! One of the smartest cartoons in a long time!
