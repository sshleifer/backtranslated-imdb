All movies made before 1912 should really be viewed with a sense of time and place. <br /> <br /> In 1894, the Lumiere family owned and owned [father: Antoine (1840-1911), Auguste and Louis] a factory manufacturing photographic plates and paper. Not a small business; The factory employs over 200 employees who have received pension and social security benefits - innovative at that time. It was located in Montplaisir in the suburbs of Lyon, France. What caused Louis Lumiere to be interested in building a Cinematagraph in 1894 remains open to speculation. My suggestion is that the appearance of the Edison organization's Kinetoscope (instant print machine) in Paris during the autumn of 1894 provided the catalyst. <br /> <br /> W.K.L. Dickson, of Edison's staff, invented a movie camera about the size of an upright piano patented in February 1893. It is electrically operating (with power from heavy storage batteries.) This massive machine-celluloid film strip (newly developed by the Eastman company) passes a lens at about 40 frames per second (fps). It was an almost immovable object in the "Black Maria" (mainly the first film study.) The Kinetescope machines showed increased deals less than one minute long filmed in this studio. <br /> <br /> In 1894, Louis Lumiere used him to find a moving picture camera. He found that even at 16 fps celluloid film, the persistence of vision of the human eye / brain will allow normal motion to be seen. His camera, called the Cinematograph, was about the size of a large shoe box and was fitted with a detachable film magazine that provided enough film storage to shoot one last minute when it crawled past the lens at 16 fps. is. <br /> <br /> The size and light weight of the camera (it can be converted into a printer or a projector by adding a light source) made it portable enough to be taken anywhere to record an event (provided there was enough sunlight available.) In the spring of 1895, Louis filmed: set a house on fire with firemen entering the dilapidated building with water; and a number of other scenes in and around Lyon. With a Molteni bulb, he turned the camera into a projector and presented his films to scientists presented in the Revue Generales des Science reception room. The images were projected on a screen five meters away from the lens. The screen is stretched between two rooms in a doorway. At a meeting of professional photographers, the same year, Louis photographed the upcoming delegates and on the same day they showed photos of their arrival. <br /> <br /> With the awards of both the scientific and photographic communities, Louis decided to open a public exhibition of his invention by the end of the year. Since each of his films would be about one minute long, he would need at least a dozen movies to make a good presentation. For one of these films he erected his camera at the entrance of his factory. The exhibition of employees was taken at the right time. <br /> <br /> The public place Antoine chose - who presented herself as the "fancier" for the Cinematograph - was the Salon India of the Grand Cafe on the promenade of Capucines in Paris. It was a winter Saturday night on December 28, 1895. As the first hearing, they were presented with a projected view of the outside of the Lumiere factory (with closed gates). Some were shocked to see only a routine slide show of Lumiere photos. But then the crutch was turned on the camera / projector and motion started. Louis took an innate sense of the movie. This movie has a beginning, a middle and an end. In the beginning, the doors are opened and people are leaving their workplace; In the middle, people run out - with many trying to ignore the camera and cameraman, as they seem to be happy to leave a day of labor behind them. At the end, the gates are closed to the factory. <br /> <br /> And this was the first film projected for the entertainment of the general public.
