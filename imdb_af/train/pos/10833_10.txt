This movie made me cry at the end! I watch at least 3-4 movies a week. I saw a lot of movies, even more crazy. But when the scene ended - cathars at its core - I called out! And if you don't - you have serious problems! The story is archetypes - nothing new or original. But it really is - because that kind of thing really happened and that people really exist. Glam is not my kind of music, but I really admire everything they've experienced in the early 70's. At a certain time, it aimed me at Velvet Goldmine! Docudramas never really works very well. But this movie really meant that it all believes ... Because they are not trying to make it a road of glorious concerts, present-day musicians who are superheroes, are a group of girls who are dumb and emotionally numb. drugs and alcohol, they promote rehabilitation and salvation that even comes 20 years ... Again, good movie. Since "Las Vegas", I've never been so shocked by a movie.
