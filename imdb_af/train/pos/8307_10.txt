Tressa's voice performance was outstanding !! Tressa plays the female singer role while Richard was in the club. When she walked out on the stage for the first time, and started riffing and sticking out her stuff, it shook my soul. Her voice is platinum. She must make a CD. She has more fans than she realizes. I loved her performance stopping the performance in the five heartbeats, which she also played with Leon when she was younger. How can a girl have such a voice. She is truly amazing. Good voice Good Good Good voice voice voice excellent voice fantastic voice, back shake, tears cry, lifting, take you back in the days voice. If you read this Tressa, please take my advice and start recording a CD. If not just for the love of singing, but for your fans. I believe you can really do it. Look at these other one-and-one singers, lol.
