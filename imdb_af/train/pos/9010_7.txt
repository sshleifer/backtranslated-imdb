A little impressive and adjoining bad taste; but intelligent enough to be worthy of watching. A wheelchair-bound young woman, Jane Hatchard (Helena Bonham Carter), is teamed up with a hesitant caregiver, Richard (Kenneth Branagh). Richard is an artist who has daydreams of human flight. He builds a plane in his garage and intends to fly it. He wants to revive his own restless life by caring for the independent, dying Jane, suffering from a neurological disease that left her speechless and very little motor skills. Wheelchair bound and full of spirit, her last dying desire is to lose her virginity. She offers her to Richard, who will not help her directly; but is willing to rob a bank to pay a gigolo to do the act. I found this movie ambitious and humorous. Even in this role, Carter has some charisma and likability.
