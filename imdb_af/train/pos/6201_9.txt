Hal Hartley's Henry Fool was an independent film masterpiece and definitely his best work. It has immense character depth, subtle, intricate dialogue, and an excellent emotional end that captivates. I remember interrupting it several times during my first look to absorb what I see and feel. Henry Fool was a complete movie from start to finish and needed no successor. <br /> <br /> So I was surprised when I heard from Fay Grim. Fay was not one of the main characters of the first film and apparently existed more than the disturbing imposition of reality-ness of vanity and ignorance for her brother Simon to be forced to handle as he matures. In her own film, Fay lapses herself, though her maturity takes a very different path. Simon went from almost autistic isolation to a somewhat introverted genius. Fay starts her adult journey as an immature, completely normal, spoiled child and responds to the onslaught of ridiculous circumstances by becoming an adult, completely normal, experienced adult who has no benefits. She deals with problems as any person does, with determination, a little thought, and tired contempt. While Simon learned to control his thoughts, Fay learns to control her emotion. <br /> <br /> The movie contains several finely-exposed elements of its prequel, but differs greatly in tone for most of the film. Henry Fool had you a hard, boring, ignorant world that contrasts with Simon's inner passion and creativity. In Fay Grim, the world is a lively, crazy, emotional place that shows the ugliness of her young life and, by contrast, degenerates the inner wise woman who was not previously nurtured or nurtured by her similar weak mother. <br /> <The film is in two parts, the first dealing with the start of Fay's struggle and subsequent hardening due to authoritarian hostility, and the second that goes into her struggle just to soften enough to reclaim Henry . In the first place, Henry Fool's fans can wonder how the film can be seen as a successor, and think it is unholy to follow such an intense movie with spy games and physical comedy. But that's where the subtlety of Fay Grim lies. The sequel is about Fay's journey, and as I said earlier, her is one of the findings of life-saving common sense in chaos, not the creative chaos in fixed order. Parker Posey is an excellent actress who makes Hal Hartley's tongue in cheek humor perfect. Elina LÃ¶wensohn may be releasing her role in emotional devotion, so that Parker can play straight man and cartoon against the lively, hilarious comedy that takes place around her. <br /> <br /> With the entrance of Henry in the picture, the movie starts taking a sobering turn. Hal Hartley's movies are all playing, and each play must be full circle. Eventually, Fay's newly developed character is shown and integrity is the progeny of her time with the deadly intense Henry, whose pervasive honesty and unique passion spark a spark in anyone he meets. <br /> <br /> Fay Grim is an excellent movie that does not exceed Henry Fool, but Hal's show shows that the nuances of his art are proof of his genius. <br /> <br /> Honestly, I think anyone who bashes this movie has not only missed the point by a mile (and especially the subtlety of Parker Posey's play), but couldn't much interest in the movie Henry Fool not.
