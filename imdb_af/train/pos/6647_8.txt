Gandhi my father is like a book, chapter by chapter you read it (with your eyes) and you learn more about Harilal Gandhi and the case of Kasturba Gandhi. So few are known and this film describes them uniquely. However, the title deceives, it's so much a movie about Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and his son, as it is about Harilal and his mother. And Akshaye Khanna and Shefali Chayya are fully entitled to their respective roles. <br /> <br /> Such movies are like leap years. They only come after so much time. <br /> <br /> Gandhi My Father also deals with an internal struggle, which is sometimes more difficult than any freedom struggle ever undertaken. <br /> <br /> Watch it if you like quality cinema.
