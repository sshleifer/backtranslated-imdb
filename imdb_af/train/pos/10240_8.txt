Genre: Dinosaur, animation, New York, time travel, circus. Main characters: Rex the Tyrannosaurus rex, Elsa the pterodactyl, Dweeb the Parasarolophus, Ooo the Triceratops, a son named Louis, a girl named Cecilia and Captain New-eyes. ? Actors: John Goodman (Rex), Yeardley Smith (Cecilia), Martin Short (Stubbs the clown), Felicity Kendal (Elsa) etc. <br /> <br /> What happens: Four dinosaurs "brain grain grain" and are now hug, friendly dinosaurs that will be fun for kids. Are they going to New York with big plans? <br /> <br /> My thoughts: This is a cute animated movie. The animation of the dinosaurs when they are cuddly and friendly is a little floppy and not-so-good, but they all look the same. I like the dinosaurs when they are cuddly and friendly, they are nice, friendly and good. I like (almost) all the characters that appear, especially Elsa and Cecilia, but of course I also love the others. Overall, I really like this movie! :-) <br /> <br /> Recommended for: People who have lovely children's animated movies, people who are dinosaurs, John Goodman and people who think circuses are not always what they look like? Enjoy it! :-)
