My boyfriend and I both enjoyed this movie very much. The viewer is taken away from modern life to ancient Japan, while at the same time exposed to many current themes. Those characters are realistic and detailed; It has an unpredictable end and story, which is very refreshing. The story consists of mini-pots in the life of several geisha living in a poor urban district. I recommend this movie to anyone interested in a realistic romance or life in old Japan. <br /> <br />
