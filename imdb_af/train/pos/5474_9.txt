On July 10, 2005, the National Art Museum showed the long-awaited, original, uncut version of this movie. It restores vital scenes cut by sensors when released. The character of the butterfly, a moral governor-individual in the original 1933 censored release, is presented here as a follower of the philosopher Nietsze and encourages her to use men to climb her way to the top. Also the grainy termination of the original I accepted in current VHS versions has been eliminated and the end is restored to its original form. A wonderful film of seduction and power. Hopefully there will be a re-issue of this DVD movie for everyone to appreciate its great features. Look for it.
