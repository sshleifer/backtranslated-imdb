This is the first 10 out of 10 I've ever given any movie. What made this movie so good to me? Constant action - there is not a slow part, great acting, clever writing. I also liked the filming style where the shaky and different angles just made you feel part of the scene. Finally, I get an action movie that doesn't try to please all sectors of the public (ie there is no forced romance). <br /> <br /> I love the first two Bourne movies, but I loved this one. <br /> <br /> Warning - after watching this movie, you'll be full of adrenaline and you might want to calm down before driving your car!
