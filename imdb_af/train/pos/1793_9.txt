I saw this movie on Sunday afternoon. I absolutely loved this movie. I loved it all, from the juicy moments of mothers and daughters to the scenes where Mamie Gummer (Lila) was crying because of her poor decision to marry her husband and not because she was really in love. I loved these moments because they were just as real. Initially, I was seriously scared, because I was hoping it wouldn't end like Bobby, who was a good role, but a poorly written movie with no real meat. But in the middle of the film I felt completely different. You will laugh and you will cry, but eventually you want to see another night. Trust me when I say GO GO!
