Spacecamp is one of the movies that kids just love, and mom and dad can also have fun. Growing up in the 80's I enjoyed this movie, it's plot and all the actors. I recently bought this movie on DVD, so if I have kids, they will have so much fun watching this movie as I did. The plot is fun, a group of kids, starting with a journey they never expected, when they were in space by an abandoned robot. They were first in the first place, but when they realized they didn't have enough oxygen to drop it back, they recovered enough oxygen from the space station. They returned to earth, even better friends and a new respect for life.
