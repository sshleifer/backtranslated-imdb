Nina Foch insists that "My Names is Julia Ross" in this 1945 film noir, also with Dame May Witty and George Macready. It's short and because it suffers from the movie. It could have been a good fifteen minutes to half an hour longer. <br /> <br /> When I grew up, Foch was a television game, a neurotic woman, the woman with the fake man, the nerve wreck. She became one of the great actors in Los Angeles. Here she is a pretty young engineering who plays the title role. Julia answers an ad for a secretary and is immediately taken by Mrs. Hughes and her son, Ralph, hired. Little does she know - although we are learning right away - that the employer is a front, just to get the right woman for this assignment, a woman without a family and no boyfriend. <br /> <br /> It's a life -In situation Once Julia gets home, she is swollen, and when she wakes up, she says she is Mrs. Hughes and may not leave. <br /> <br /> The play is very good. Low budget, but still entertaining - some things, especially at the end, happen too fast, so I said the movie was too short. Nevertheless, I recommend this.
