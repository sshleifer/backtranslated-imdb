I have to admit that I didn't expect much from this movie show in my Japanese movie class, but this movie really blew me away. The director does a wonderful job followed by the title of his film, which truly depicts a madness picture. I think the fact that this movie is quiet contributes to the likeness of madness, and helps the viewer the inner world of the characters rather than the world beyond his mind. This movie has added to my feelings about strange silent films against America, because the foreign films work much more to exercise your mind and rather make you think of always going with the fluffy movie with the happy ending, the imagination very little to practice.
