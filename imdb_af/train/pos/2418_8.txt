One of John's Funniest, Eugene Levy is also wonderful in this one. Just want to find the studio that this one should be on DVD, I have it on video tape, but feel that this movie deserves DVD (and extras will be great) the Kung Fu Uuniversity (Kung Fu U) shoot is so much funny, as The whole movie, including the screens he has with his girlfriend and her family, is great, this movie never looks on TV, but it loses most It is hilarious when it comes to broadcasting. If you can find the video, I suggest you buy it (ebay is a good place to find a copy). I'll keep my VHS up to one day, we'll get it on DVD. There are so many movies out there that haven't been released on DVD yet, and that's one of them.
