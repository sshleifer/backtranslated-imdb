Why are the previews so blatant for a movie that is so wonderful !! Everyone needs to know what an excellent movie is. It is tempting and funny at one time, originally and well done. I wish the movie had a good impression of itself as it deserved! <br /> <br /> For anyone who loved the Princess Bride, Labyrinth and other really funny and original fantasy adventure, it is one of the greatest. Robert DeNiro is hysterical. Relative newcomer Charlie Cox is an amazingly leading man. Claire Danes is fantastic as always. Michelle Pfiefer splashes a little with her recent return to the screen. There are also many wonderful moments of underage characters ... even to facial expressions.
