Panic is a funny jewel of a movie - you think you figured it out only in the first half hour, to realize with great pleasure that Henry Bromell is a much better writer / director. <br /> <br /> The movie slowly builds, with one quiet, devastating scene. It's perfect by William H. Macy, Donald Sutherland, Neve Campbell, Tracey Ullman, John Ritter and the most remarkable children's actor. For a long time, I have seen David Dorfman, as Macy's son, delivering his lines as if they were creating totally undocumented thoughts in his mind. Rich and rewarding, this movie will stay with you long after the credits have rolled.
