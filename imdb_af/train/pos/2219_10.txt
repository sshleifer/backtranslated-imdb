This movie was a fascinating look at the creole culture and society that few African Americans are aware of. My own two children are through products from a dad's grandmother whose father was a member of the gens de couleur libre and a black skinwoman whose parents were former slaves. He married outside and against his culture and was cut off from all his family, except for one sister who made her brother's lot pity; the increase of 8 children during the great depression of 1929; To provide the family with food when she can. Of course she feared this family terrified of her own ex-communication. My daughter was fascinated by the movie. We made it in our library.
