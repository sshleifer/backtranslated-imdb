I've always kept this comedy as one of the few has never seriously tried to handle the US government's annual tax demand. Have you ever read a tax code? It's quite a trial to follow it, it's several clauses that our congressmen and senators join to help their financial supporters and various stakeholders. Despite allegations being fair, the tax code always laid the lion's share of the burden on middle and working classes instead of the rich and influential. Most of the different special clauses are meant for their use - go through the average 1040 or 1040A form and look at the variety of different investment and business that each has a different set of rules. Most people will never use it. <br /> <br /> The story here is that a wealthy landowner (Philip Ober) uses his influence to type the IRS that his neighbors (Paul Douglas and Una Merkle) do not have paid taxes in 20 years. The Baltimore office of the IRS is under Fred Clarke, and he pays attention to Ober with his influence. He sends Tony Randall to investigate the situation. <br /> <br /> Randall finds that Douglas, Merkle, and their three girls and two boys are pretty decent people, who rarely need cash (they produce and produce on their farm with their neighbors). But Randall, trained in the clear (after the IRS) lines of the tax code, is trying to get the family grounded. But gradually Douglas sees Reynolds holding Randall, and he keeps Randall from his side and gets him drunk. He also made it difficult for Randall to leave by removing his car's car for repairs by his two sons. <br /> <br /> The plot follows the growing attraction and friction between urban, vaguely ambitious Randall, and rural, Reynolds's life lovers. They actually make a cute couple. Eventually, after Ober complains, Randall is given back in shame and Clarke (a tighter cookie) comes to copper boxes. And come up with a very large tax account, which may destroy Douglas's family. <br /> <br /> The movie doesn't end there - it ends happily, but it reminds us that the power to tax is the power to destroy, and that the government is going too much to destroy. A chance in a million reversal strikes the family, but it's so scarce we know it's just a dramatic trick. More realistic is how Clarke's boss, Charles Lane, cuts the essence of Ober's "help" by suggesting that next year his taxes will be looked more closely. After that Ober is quite green.
