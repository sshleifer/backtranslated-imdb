All the talent, Mr. Sooraj Barjatya, showed in his first 3 movies, I thought everything was an accident because his 4th chief ki diwani hoon was so bad. But I have to say it wasn't an accident. This man is talented and the way he did Vivah is just brilliant. From the first scene it touches you. The sequences between Shahid and Amrita are wonderful. The chemistry between these two actors gives an overview of it between srk and kajol. As usual, Alok Nath is the good and loving dad fantastic, so is Anupam Kher. But it's a Shahid-Amrita movie. Amrita looks good in most scenes, although Shahid looks a little young to marry, but he does a good job of being shy but morally strong. This movie will be especially loved by those who have such beautiful moments in their lives. All in all, a brilliant movie. Hats off to Mr. Sooraj Barjatya ...
