No Strings Attached Features Carlos Mencia does stand-up which makes us both laugh and think. Not only does he make fun on racial issues (like many contenders), but he also talks about the best way to get illegal immigrants out of the country. What do women mean when they say they want to be treated equally? why Americans are more beautiful than Arab terrorists ... why nobody should pray for the pope - and what he hopes he does in heaven ... a theory on how to start Easter (aka Big Ups to Jesus Day) traditions. she looks at the movie Passion of the Christ - and his successive argument with a woman about whether he is touched by Jesus ... how society should treat the physically disabled ... and even if you have the right to joke or not. <br /> <br /> He never stops reminding us that each one of us has a voice. So we must use it to speak the truth, say what we think and don't be afraid of when others are offended. <br /> <br /> Carlos is the bomb.
