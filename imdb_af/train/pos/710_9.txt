While I disagree with Bob and Tammy's decision to give up baby Jesse, and that's something I never wanted to do, they tried to do what was best for the baby. The way this movie is written, you see that you are embedded in the story and ask yourself what you really believe, from all different aspects. Patty Duke? Antagonist? Hardly unheard of, as far as I'm concerned. But during the film, she really convinces you that she is psychotic, or at least something serious about her. Her character is the meaning of "emotionally disturbed." The movie seems to end quickly, and things leave slightly unsolved. But other than that, this movie is really good. It really makes you think. It's not a movie to watch if you just want to kick back and relax and watch something cute that makes you laugh. But it's a good movie to see when you want to challenge your own beliefs, see things from other people's perspectives, and discover something about yourself. Note: you can even grow while watching this movie! And that's all worth it, in the end.
