Probably Jackie Chan's best movie in the 1980s, and the one that put him on the map. The scale of this self-directed political drama is evident from the opening and closing tones, during which a squatter town and shopping center are demolished. There are obvious differences between the original Chinese and dubbed English versions, with many of the jokes not entering into the latter. The latter is also hampered by stars that sound like their Chinese original. In fact, the only thing that fixed the dubbing is the court hearing, at that time the trials in colonial Hong Kong were conducted in English, while the original had this scene in Cantonese! <br /> <br /> However, Chan's fighting style and martial arts choreography are injecting humor wherever possible, so non-Cantonese audiences don't miss much. This is not the dialogue that makes a Chan movie, but the action and the painful out-tasks. The story is easy to follow: Chan plays an imperishable Hong Kong detective who follows a gang father (Cho Yeun) and protects a star witness (Brigitte Lin). The action is excellent from start to finish, and there is not much time to breathe in between. It will never make you think, but what an entertaining, well-stretched film. Probably, this is one of the best martial arts films out there.
