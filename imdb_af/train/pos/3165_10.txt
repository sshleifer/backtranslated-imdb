It was one of the funniest and best sitcoms to hit national television. It is a pity that the show is not placed under big sitcoms where it really belongs. The actors had excellent work and seasons, one to six was the show at its peak. Although the season seven was not as big as the previous six, it was still funny. Season 8 was the real problem that was kicked. Without Topher Grace or Ashton Kutcher, the show simply fell apart. Not to mention, the other actors were not as good as any of the two main characters such as Danny Masterson, Wilder Valderamma Kurtwood Smith, Debra Jo Rupp, Mila Kunis and Laura Prepon (Don Starks and Tommy Chong were also great) showed that it would have the same effect. And the inclusion of Randy (Josh Meyers) also didn't help because he wasn't well received by the show fans. I think if the show ended a year ago, it would surely have gone into history as one of the sitcom greats. Season 8 was a bit dull, but the finals were excellent. I'm going to miss the show, I just hope I'll wake up one day to find out the show is back like those 80's with the same cast, because I'm going to miss hell.
