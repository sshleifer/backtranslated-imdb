It is directed by Ruggero Deodato, a true icon for many horror movie fans after addressing the so-called and infamous Cannibal Holocaust. However, don't expect to find such a notorious role in the movie being reviewed here, as it appears incredibly soft compared to playing a Conan-inspired outing for a young audience. <br /> <br /> Such a description may immediately turn off most fans of the entire Conan-inspired Sword & Sorcery genre, but before you turn your nose on it, it should be said, this movie is just as much fun! <br /> <br /> It is mostly played for laughs and features two GREAT and highly enjoyable heroes in the form of David and Peter Paul aka. the Barbarian Brothers who both have a ball with their characters. <br /> <br /> B-movie lover Richard Lynch appears as the main villain in the play and it's also nice to see roles for Big George Eastman and Michael Berryman. <br /> <br /> This makes the ladies look beautiful and suitable for the whole movie. (A staple and very welcomed ingredient in the genre!) <br /> <br /> What can I say - it's simply a very nice and listless genre and I highly recommend it!
