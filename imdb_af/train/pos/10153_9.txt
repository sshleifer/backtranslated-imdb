I caught this movie at a screen. Was very surprised to find a very nice and fun story. Well acted. Natasha Henstridge is the next Julia Roberts. The male guidance was cute. Very funny movie. Find the best places in New York. Let me go. I just saw you have an email. I thought it should be you. It was a much better story. Mrs. <br /> <br /> It was clean and wonderful for the whole family. Public I saw it with loved ones. A definite recommendation!
