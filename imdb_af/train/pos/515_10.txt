I remember the first time I saw this movie - I worked in the office this weekend and the TV was up for the noise. But I gradually became more and more involved in this movie that I had never seen or heard until I was completely absorbed. A life of life and death (the British title - Stairway to Heaven in the US) is delicious, compelling, whimsical, and mobile, all in one excellently written, well-directed, perfect-focused package. It's a classic that's really up there with Casablanca, it's a wonderful life, with the wind, Citizen Kane, & Chariots of Fire. WHY never received the same public notice and video store prominence? Fortunately, some expert critics have posted them on their "Top 100 of All Time" lists. There is hope - 1940's Fantasia was not a hit until the '60s, and Oz's wizard was a dud at the checkout, but hit a hit by TV. Buy it - rent it - watch it - ask it! You will NOT be disappointed!
