Take 4 couples whose relationships were already on the rocks and place them on an island paradise where they are tempted by 26 singles. This was the starting point of the show, simple but shameful and funny. Leave it on Fox to throw morality out of the window and let the debauchery flow. It was like a real version of Melrose Place. The good thing about the show is that it's not about people connecting and manipulating each other for a cash prize. It was about lust and temptation, pure and simple and the ultimate test for a relationship. <br /> <br /> People also hated or hated the show. It was similar to the slowdown in looking at a terrible traffic accident. You know you shouldn't look, but you can't help but watch. Drama aside, there was lots of eye candy.
