THE BEAVER TRILOGY is without a doubt one of the most brilliant films ever made. I was fortunate to get it back with a Q&A session with director Trent Harris at the NY Video Festival for a few years and then buy a copy of Trent's website. This movie should be seen to be believed! I encourage you to search Trent's name on the web and then buy the movie from his website. He is an amazing guy to start. Don't be confused: The cameraman in the fiction sections of THE BEAVER TRILOGY is not married! <br /> <br /> After seeing the TRILOGIE a few times, I must admit that I could probably do the Penn version without the Sean. It's like a trial version for the Crispin Glover "Orkly Kid" section and is interesting more than a curiosity item if you're a Penn fan if it's a good video. Penn is rather funny, and you can see a big star in this bitter B&W video. <br /> <br /> It's probably also one of Crispin Glover's best roles and I just want to see an updated version of the original Groovin Gary documentary. Once you see this movie, you never get Gary's nerve layer out of your head again.
