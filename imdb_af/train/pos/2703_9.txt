I'm not a big fan of campkitsch and the "so bad it is good" kind of viewing. But I really like this movie for its fun factor and believe it or not. This is innovation. <br /> <br /> The whole thing has a ring of John Waters and is unlimitedly enthusiastic, but with some excellent actors and contemplating direction that makes most of the slapstick and styalised movements. Billy Zane moves with incredible expression (see the scene on the bus for a textbook lesson on how to use movement) and is embedded by some unexpected stars. <br /> <br /> You may not like this movie. Don't enjoy it, but if you get the chance to watch it, save time, because chances are you'll end up with a confused smile on your face and a new perspective on the sense of humor of some. great stars. Highly recommend.
