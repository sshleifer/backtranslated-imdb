A film that made an understandable reluctance to face the inevitable arrival of World War II has dramatized when a Spanish Republican, sent by his soon-overthrown government, (Charles Boyer) invades him in England for his support case by trying to influence rich mining operators not to sell coal to the fascists back in Spain. He upset the locals, is convincingly beaten in one scene and later confronted in the movie with a fierce crowd of miners who still see him as a threat to their shaky existence. Despite socio-economic hierarchy, xenophobia and world politics, this film is divided into a dark and exciting plot, playing unbelievers who are played by Katina Paxinou and Peter Lorre. It is expertly filmed in many dark-lit plays performed in a brave hotel by James Wong Howe, and manages to come under your skin more than once.
