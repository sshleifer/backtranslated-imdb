When people ask me to mention the scary movie I've ever seen, I always answer "Black Noon" and to this day no one has ever heard of it. <br /> <br /> I was alone at the 13-year-old's age 30 years ago when my parents went out for the evening. As far as I know, it was only shown once in the UK and unfortunately it is not available on DVD or VHS. <br /> <br /> If anyone can find a copy, please let me know. <br /> <br /> If I watched it again, it would probably be a great disappointment, but it always kept in my mind as a particularly disturbing movie!
