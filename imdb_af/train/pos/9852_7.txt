No day left without a new released computer animated movie, so we now really have chances to see more than a few good effects. After I watched the ice age, I felt it wasn't as much influence on me as other movies of this genre. <br /> <br /> But that's because I'm a big guy now and I'm pretty sure it's a great movie for kids (maybe up to 14). The story is pretty simple, and the "actors" are funny in a cute way, without any rough or complex humor. Even the "evil" is beautiful, soft, soft cat with those funny teeth. And the story has a happy ending, which was a little disappointment to me (knowing that most of the main characters are sadly extinct), but a good thing for kids. And apart from some battles, no one dies (not even when hit a few times by a mammoth), which has made a cartoon feel. <br /> <br /> The computer animation part is nice but nothing special, except for some very nice cartoon screens, if you want to walk in a nice painting or pages of a cartoon. [There is a lot of work!] <br /> <br /> There were a few gags that made me smile - I accept, the creators have tried to satisfy those adults - but they are hard to mock and ( in my opinion, better left unaware, as it does not fit into the story. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a nice movie, but it's rather the ideal world-and-fluffy animal-for-kids disney cliche. If you don't hate cute animals that are funny, watch them at least once.
