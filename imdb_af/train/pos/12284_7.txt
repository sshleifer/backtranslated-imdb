Couldn't understand why Jeremy Irons needed to express an alarming accent, through clenched teeth and from the back of his throat. In fact, it was rather the movie for me, and derived from what was probably a good thing about him (very annoying). No other actor or actress had such an outspoken accent and while I had always regarded Jeremy Irons as a good actor, I would not consider this movie one of his best. The movie, however, has rushed my appetite, as some of the other comments made are this film, which I found very interesting, and I intend to read the book now.
