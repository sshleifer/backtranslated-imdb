In Mexico City, former CIA assassin and currently an alcoholic decadent man, John Creasy (Denzel Washington), is appointed by industrialist Samuel Ramos (Marc Anthony), with the recommendation of his old friend Rayburn (Christopher Walken) around the bodyguard of the bodyguard. his young daughter Pita (Dakota Fanning) and his wife Lisa (Radha Mitchell). Pita changed the behavior of the cold Creasy, made him alive and smiled again, and he felt a great love for her. When the girl is kidnapped and Creasy informed that she was murdered by the criminals, he swears everybody responsible for the kidnapping. <br /> <br /> "Man on Fire" is almost a masterpiece and will be decided. a classic in the future. The story is excellent, never corny and although it lasts for 146 minutes, the viewer does not feel the time. The film is made up of excellent actors and actresses. Their performances are outstanding, with the emphasis on Denzel Washington, Dakota Fanning and Radha Mitchell. The cinematography has wonderful moments, and the script has beautiful lines. I personally loved Christopher Walken's character to Manzano (Giancarlo Giannini) explaining that Creasey's specialty is dead, and he is drawing up his masterpiece. I agree with the user who commented that "Man on Fire" is one of the best, if not the best, film of the year in this genre. My voice is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Chamas da Vingan√ßa" ("Flames of the Revenge")
