.... after 16 years my Tim Burton disappointed me !!!! Whatever happened to the old Burton, read by Frank Miller "The Dark Knight Returns" as research for his preparation to return Batman in 1988-89? Burton didn't look at the book or the movie because he got everything wrong! This movie sucks! It is not as good as the original and does not deal with the same subject as the original. If you want a good monkey movie, look at the original. <br /> <br /> ** from **** stars
