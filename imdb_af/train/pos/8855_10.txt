Sydney Lumet, although one of the oldest active directors still has games! A few years ago he shot 'Guilty of me guilty', proving to everyone that Vin Diesel can actually act, if he gets the opportunity and the real director. If he retired after this movie (a real masterpiece in my eyes), no one could have been guilty of him. But he's still going strong, his next movie is already announced for 2009. <br /> <br /> But we're staying with this movie here. The cast list is incredible, their performance top notch. The small nuances in their performances, the "real" dialogue and / or situations that unfold throughout the film are just amazing. The (time) structure of the movie, which keeps your toes all the time, so timelessly blends the timelines, that the editing looks natural / flawless. The story is increased, though it would be a good movie (Drama / Thriller), even in a "normal" time structure. I can only highly recommend it, the rest is for you! : O)
