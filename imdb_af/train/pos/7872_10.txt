The first review I saw, said, "What is madhur bhandarkar finally wanting to say?" Must he say something so decisive. <br /> <br /> The most beautiful thing about it doesn't take sides. No propaganda whatsoever. This is the movie that takes up so many corners of a problem (I don't know what I call a "problem" here) and like any mediocre movie doesn't come up with a solution. I was so intrigued when I realized that the movie ended almost in the same scenario, just as it started. <br /> <br /> The movie defines so many characters that are completely different priorities and different ideologies and yet they are all part of the system which is increasingly apathetic. I wish I could say more, but there will be more spoilers. So watch out if you want to see one of the most mature movies of the past.
