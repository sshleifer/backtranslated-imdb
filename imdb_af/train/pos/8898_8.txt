The 60's is a big movie (I saw it all in one night) about the hippie movement in the late 60's. Although the title would be different, the first 5 years of the 60's are not really important in this movie. <br /> <br /> The main character of the movie is Michael, a political activist heading the US for the Vietnam War. There he meets his girlfriend, Sarah. Michael's brother, Brian, goes to Vietnam to fight (which is a surprise!). He comes back from the war and changes in a "Tom Cruise born on July 4" look like and then Michael's sister, Kate, conceives of a Rock & Roll artist and walks away from home and goes to San Francisco during the summer of love. The end is very poor (father becomes liberal and everyone is happy), but I drop it off my voice (the rest of the movie is very good!). <br /> <br /> The performances of the actors are pretty good and the soundtrack of the movie is absolutely brilliant. All the major events of the sixties are in the film, like the murders of JFK and Martin Luther King, as well as the great hippie protest, the summer of love and Woodstock! Look closely at the Wavy Woodstock Speaker "Gravy" (Keeping in mind is breakfast in the bed for 400,000!) As a first-aid worker at the Woodstock Festival! <br /> <br /> In the end, the 60s are a beautiful movie about a beautiful decade! 10/10
