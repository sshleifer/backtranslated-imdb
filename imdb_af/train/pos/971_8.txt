This film is a bit reminiscent of the German movie, THE GENERAL STORY, because a child is transported magically to a foreign country to be a hero. However, due to much better modern technology, dolls and CGI are used to create an incredibly realistic world - one that blows your socks off because of its realism and scope. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this movie, but boy was it a task first! Unfortunately, for most Westerners, this movie is one that you can get up very quickly or dismiss as everything in the movie looks so strange. However, give it a chance. Don't think or try to understand everything you see - just let the story unfold and you'll probably enjoy the movie. <br /> <br /> In many ways, this is exactly the kind of advice I want to give to adults watching Miyazaki's REVIEWED ROAD because it's very similar and contains tons of Yokai (Japanese mythical spirits). The big difference between the two is that the BIG YOKA war is alive and USING is much more child-friendly. While I think the BIG YOKAI WAR was mainly intended as a children's movie in the US, most parents would not want to show it to younger children, because it is so violent, scary and contains some adult behavior. So who is the audience in the West? Well, older kids and adults who appreciate strange movies with non-Western themes and compilation. It's a pretty narrow audience, indeed! <br /> <br /> As you look, look for all the strange little touches. In fact, you can watch the movie dozens of times and see different smaller things every time. A few of the funny references I liked were the comments about Gamera, the scene that came with the comment: "KIDS: Don't Try It At Home", as well as the use of Kirinbier for a person to allow the Yokai to actually see hmm, maybe the scene should also contain this warning! <br /> <br /> By the way, director Takashi Miike is hard to pinch stylistically, except to say that none of his stories I've seen seemed "normal". Some of his films are rather disgusting and disturbing and I hated them (especially AUDITION and ICHI THE KILLER), while some of them are magic and among the best movies I've ever seen (THE HAPPINESS OF THE CATAKURIS). One thing for sure, it's hard to watch one of its films and doesn't have a strong reaction in one way or another.
