Named the story of Steve Biko - played excellently by Denzel Washington, as you would expect - it was actually the story of Donald Woods, played by Kevin Kline. <br /> <br /> It was undoubtedly making Kline as a serious actor, and he was surprisingly good at the role. <br /> <br /> Attenborough gave it the kind of direction you'd expect, and the often spectacular scenes of the masses were those of the kind that only he could overcome. <br /> <br /> The remaining part of the role-play was capable of doing a good job, ending in an ultimate sad story of a South Africa that is nowhere near the distant past.
