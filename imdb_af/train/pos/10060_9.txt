Wang Bianlian is an old street artist known as a "King of Masks" for his mastery of Sichuan exchange. Liang is a well-known opera performer of Sichuan art and respects Wang as an artist and as a person. Liang is worried that a precious art should not die with Wang and so he sows the seed of an heir in Wang's mind. The film is about prejudice, male domination, state of art, values ​​and the most important warmth. <br /> <br /> I can't recommend this movie. The whole movie is in loops. Everything has a meaning. It's a long story that's so well edited that the length of the movie is just 91 minutes. A total satisfaction. For five minutes it's an artistic movie, the next five minutes it's a sad movie, the next five minutes it's a thrill. It just changes his mood as his main character changes his face. The last scene on the queue is phenomenal. Story and writing are flawless. Actors are brilliant. Both lead actors are artists you can tell how they performed. Very impressive. It's not even named for Oscars. That year 'English patient' won the best film Oscar and in the foreign film category 'Kolya'. "Kolya" was just OK and about "English patient", the less the better said. See it 9/10.
