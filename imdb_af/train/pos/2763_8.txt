People tend to complain about the number of films made about mentally handicapped people. I don't see it as a valid criticism, just as complaints from too many movies about any kind of people. Jaco van Dormael does a wonderful job with the writing and direction. Daniel Auteuil and Pascal Duquenne work perfectly together, and Duquenne basically plays himself. The movie covers a surprisingly big event and is not only happy to go over what Rain Man has seen. The end is quite depressed, but it does not ruin the wonderful story that came before. <br /> <br /> 7.8 out of 10
