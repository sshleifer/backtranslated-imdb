I think the team behind this movie did a very good job with the limitations they had. only Â£ 300,000 and 7 weeks to write, film and change the whole thing I think is an achievement in itself. although this film is not for the masses (as a young innocent teenage girl is killed and there is gay eroticism involved in the story), I think this movie is a heartbreaking tragedy and the more you get into the story, the more sad you feel. more so to Heaton because of the love he feels, but is not returned. <br /> <br /> This is one of my favorite British movies that I really enjoyed and watched. I think it's a shame that film is not very good at hearing.
