A good movie. The acting - from the doctor to the pavement artist to the main prostitute, with very few exceptions, was wonderful; I thought soni razdan (mrs.noble) and vrajesh hirjee (saurabh) were the best of the lesser-known actors. Even Kurush Deboo (Tehmul), who was accused of persuading, had a credible and familiar character. <br /> <br /> Another wonderful thing was the camera work - and how it captured the energy of bombay streets, the tranquility of the ghost town that tells its prayers and life in small apartments. <br /> <br /> I love the story of the wall that becomes a sanctuary and then broken down - and the artists philosophically take it. <br /> <br /> It's great to see good movies on Indian themes.
