Although this movie has a first class timetable of fine actors, excellent effects, and a story full of surprises, it has not been cited for studio distribution and is directly on DVD. Perhaps it contains too much 'anti-police' information, or perhaps too many action flashes are released during a glut, but whatever the big screens missed the event, fortunately, the new concept of the release leaves on DVD us. to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> The theme is old: newcomer reporter exposes an inner circle of corrupted police - in this case, the FRU (First Response Assault and Tactical) team, a group of well-trained policemen who created is the mythical city of Edison from its low point of crime, drugs, prostitution, etc. To clean. The suppression of confiscated goods and money proves too much of an opportunity and now, 15 years after its establishment, FRAT is responsible for murder, drug trafficking, innocent people, and so on. The leading dog is Lazerov (Dylan McDermott, who makes a terrifying realist!) And his partner Rafe Deed (LL Cool J, even more buff than usual and proving he can be a sensitive actor). Reporter Pollack (Justin Timberlake) catches a bad blow from the wind and reports his fraud and corruption theory to his newspaper's boss Ashford (the always reliable Morgan Freeman). Gradually Polack convinces Ashford and then Wallace (Kevin Spacey, also a consistently fine character) and helps Pollack in this investigative report. The closer Pollack gets to the truth, the more surprises and incidents happen, and the story runs to a series of unexpected results. <br /> <br /> Timberlake lacks the charisma to face, especially in the company of such seasoned actors. But LL Cool J, Freeman, Spacey and McDermott keep the riddled machine from a movie reel to the end. No, it's not a good movie, but it's one that makes a seated movie action movie with a message.
