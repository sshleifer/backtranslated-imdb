Red Rock West is one of those tight noir thrillers that we rarely see. It is well played, well behaved and does not leave us loose points or unanswered questions as typical in this genre. <br /> <br /> Nicolas Cage stars as Michael, an unemployed Texas roughneck who is desperate enough to work all the way to Wyoming for potential employment. He's honest with a mistake, but always on the dark side of the lot. <br /> <br /> After not getting proper employment, Michael falls into the Red Rock bar where Mr Wayne (JTWalsh) is calling for a contract killer he called from Dallas in his lovely but deadly wife , Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle), to do. <br /> <br /> Wayne gives Michael the necessary details and an installment for the hit on adulterous Suzie. With no intention of going through, Michael accepts the money and then proposes to warn Suzanne of her impending doom. He also sends a letter to the local sheriff who exposes the plot and crevices. <br /> <br /> As fate dictates, Michael will not easily get rid of the situation. Leaving a violent rainstorm, he runs Suzanne's lover. Michael is of course Michael, he takes him to the local hospital, where it is discovered that he was also shot. <br /> <br /> The sheriff is being asked and, like luck, Wayne is also the local law. Michael manages to escape while being taken on the last ride and is later taken by the real "Lyle of Dallas" with murderous enjoyment by the quirky Dennis Hopper. After discovering that they are fellow marines, Lyle insists that Michael joins him at a drink at, where else, the Red Rock pub. As Wayne realizes his mistake and soon he and Lyle are looking for Michael who is willing to fall into Suzanne's arms. <br /> <br /> As the pass picks up, we learn that Wayne and Suzanne really wanted armed robbers, on the lamb for a multi-million dollar theft. To get the money, the movies are now becoming central focus with a series of betrayals, double crosses and murders. <br /> <br /> The movie was very well thrown. Nicolas Cage was typically low key, Dennis Hopper and Lara Flynn Bolye took on their respective roles with more than enough ability. The best performance was against the late J.T. Walsh was threatening without appearing. Walsh was a great character actor who left us too soon. <br /> <br /> Marc Reshoskys photography uses many unique angles added to the stress and plot development. The film was further enhanced by John Dahl's stiff affirmative style and Morris Chestnut's quick fireworks.
