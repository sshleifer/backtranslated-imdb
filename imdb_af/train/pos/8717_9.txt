I must admit right from the top, I'm not a big fan of the "family" movies of these days. Most of them, IMHO, are sentimental shit. But this one, like Toyyory, the previous movie by Pixar, is a lot of fun. The two main characters might be a bit too thin (especially compared to the two leading in ANTZ, but otherwise this movie is better), but the rest of the movie is more than made up. The animation looked good, the humor, though broad, was consistently good. (I especially told Hopper's line: "If I didn't promise Mother on her deathbed that I wouldn't kill you, I'd kill you!") And the actors To do the voices, except the two, were all great (Denis Leary makes an animated movie; what a concept). And like everyone, I loved the outtakes! I hope the video has the new ones.
