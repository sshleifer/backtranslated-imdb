It's not so often that a movie can literally make the whole audience laugh, and five minutes later they fill their eyes with tears. Many movies are trying to do this, but little can deliver the emotional impact this movie has made. Adam Sandler practically pulls you in with his heated and often violent outbursts, but also lets you laugh if the shadow of his past does not diminish. I'm not going to ruin anything, but there is one scene that needs your eyes watering and lip movement. Even the most macho of men will have to be heartless bastards to feel nothing while watching this movie. Don Cheadle gives another good performance but is eliminated by Sandler. Liv Tyler and Jada Pinkett Smith give solid achievements, but nothing in the line of the two leading roles. Sandler's humor is still present, which actually saved the film from the boundary line. There are several laughs to have, but don't think you'll stay there for a long time, as it gets serious again without much warning. <br /> <br /> I can keep on how well this movie has hit About every emotion the human body contains, but I'll cut this one short. I feel there is nothing more to tell you. Do yourself a favor and take the time to see this movie. Even if you have to wait until it comes to DVD, it's worth 100%. A deep moving movie, sure to put tears in your eyes and a smile on your face ... unless of course ... you're a heartless soul.
