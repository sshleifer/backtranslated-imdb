So I'm at home, once around the channels, and I come across this man with heels and make-up, standing in front of a colored background on HBO. Of course I did a double job and decided I would look a while. I didn't change the channel until it was finished, it was so incredibly hilarious. The next time it was up, I made sure to paste it so I could see it again, and it remained one of my favorite things to watch. During the first few minutes you can say that the audience is not quite sure what to think, but he quickly wins them with his incredible humor and humor. While many rising-up comedians come together in my brain, Eddie Izzard stands out as one of the best. His style is incredibly refreshing, and it is nice to hear jokes about things like history and puberty when most comedians keep up with current events. His performance then stayed with me. I went to Italy in the summer, and all I could think of while I was there was how "Italians always go on scooters" CIAO ... "" 10 out of 10. See it. You won't regret it.
