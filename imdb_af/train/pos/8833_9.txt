I was inspired by the title, so during a little sleeplessness (fueled by my curiosity ...), I got up and looked. I then checked my TV list and watched it again! There is one very obvious realization that happened to me when I saw this movie - despite politics, traditions, culture, etc. Teenagers are almost the same everywhere. The characters of Belgrade's children could be transported anywhere in the US Middle East in the same period, and language differences would be impossible, if any of the local teenagers of that era were to leave. They certainly showed the same growing pain and previews, the politics aside: music, sex, movie idols, music, drinking, sports, music ... In fact, many the same things that kept my time busy in 1970's southern California. <br /> <br /> It was a bittersweet story, but the joy of the youth made it very enjoyable. The characters, especially the young actors, were also completely credible. I wouldn't say it was the Slavic "American Graffiti", but I'd say it fits nicely with other 50's theme movies.
