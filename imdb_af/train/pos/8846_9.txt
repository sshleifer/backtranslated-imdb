I really enjoyed this drama by Sidney Lumet. The best word I could get to describe it is insane. It throws the viewer around for an hour and fifty minutes and doesn't let you breathe until the credits finally roll. Trust me, this movie will ponder you all the way. <br /> <br /> The story is very well-crafted and almost brilliant. It's almost like a more complicated Tarantino-type story. The acting is all amazing from all the clues and even the small parts, excellent role. I also loved cinematography, it gave the right feeling as if it were an independent film. This was all good. <br /> <br /> This movie is excited, exhausting and heartbreaking. It's almost hard to watch, but you'll be glad you did.
