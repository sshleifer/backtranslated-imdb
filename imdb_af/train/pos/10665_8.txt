As an indemnity, I've seen the movie 5-6 times in the past 15 years, and I've only seen the music this week. It allowed me to judge the movie without getting busy with what was in the musical or not (but it infected me when I watched the music :)) <br /> <br /> I actually believe Michael Douglas worked pretty well in that role, along with Kasey. I think her 'Let My Dance For Your Scene' is one of the best parts of the movie, a valuable addition to the musical. The dancers and song in the movie are much better than the musical, as well as the role that is at least 10 times bigger (easier to do naturally in the movie). The decors, lighting, dancing and singing are also much better in the film, which is to be expected and indeed delivered. <br /> <br /> The songs that were in common with the musical are better in the movie, the new ones are pretty good, and the whole movie, in my opinion, produces more than the musical, especially when compared to a musical which has few decors. The one bad point on the movie is the obvious cuts between the actors talking and singers singing in the song sections for some characters, but their dance is impeccable, and the end product was nicer than the musical
