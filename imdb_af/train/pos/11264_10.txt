It was one of the funniest and most insightful shows I've ever seen. This is a MUST see for everyone over the age of 16. This show laughed aloud to me and my 2 boys from the beginning. I don't know if everything at the show was true, but the way it was presented had little doubt that Mr. Wuhl was not only very knowledgeable, but he also presented this information to the happy colleagues who were present. As Mr. Wuhl ever decides to do this format again, they will have to rent a building containing the size of the Georgia Dome to keep all those who want to see it. I agree with the idea of ​​making it an HBO series. It would have a wonderful result
