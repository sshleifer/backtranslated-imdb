Hello I am from Taft California and I love this movie because it shows how our little town keeps people from our sports football, is the most important thing in Taft and this movie shows just how important it is that I personally think they should have another one , instead of actors we use kids to play the games, and show us our determination that our Bakersfield has beaten every game for the past 6 years and since I am a senior next year, my last chance is then the college we run is state and I am the next if you want to know I am kyle Taylor and I average seven to eight meters a carry and about five times a game sick break on a 75 or around that site run so check us out on our site and go to our sports pages
