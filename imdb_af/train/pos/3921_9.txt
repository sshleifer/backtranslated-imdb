In Carmen, Saura is once again trying to establish a dynamic report between reality and fiction between the real passions of the personalities in a dance company preparing the choreography for the dance sections of the opera Carmen and the written passions from the story of the fictional Carmen, the famous deadly mixture of a free spirit (read contempt for fidelity) and her ability to anger men with desire. Saura used the same vehicle fiction / reality in a former black and white film, Bodes de Sangre (Blood Wedding). However, while the tension between the dancers practicing Blood Wedding has shown how they have evolved into the fictional characters of the story to be performed by directing their emotions into their roles, in Carmen, the parallel between the little ones, Liberal dancers from the dancers of the troop during rehearsals and the spirit of the mythical Carmen never come close to credibility. It remains a gadget and therefore it is a tricky distraction. One really needs to see Blood Wedding next to Carmen to appreciate the comparison. It doesn't matter, the melodrama Saura tries to set up Carmen, because the Flamenco dance and guitar music of the rehearsals, which is 95% of the film, of some of the best-known Flamenco dancers and musicians, pays more than the subscription price. A defective movie, and a wonder: perfect for a drill in Keats' 'negative ability', maybe?
