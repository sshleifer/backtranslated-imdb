The title of this movie almost watched me see it. Not a Manchester United fan, but the mere mention of Beckham was a bit off, but I put my prejudices behind me and I'm glad I did. <br /> <br /> I didn't expect much from a movie, but I was pleasantly surprised. The movie jumped with me, never looked at my watch and I enjoyed the movie every second. If you like East, East is, then you will love this movie. OK, so the storyline is nothing new, and the classic storylines are included in the movie, but it's all straight and with a fresh air. The movie moves very fast and keeps the audition entertained. The occasional funny moments are good fun and not a bad attempt at humor, and best of all is a good British comedy.
