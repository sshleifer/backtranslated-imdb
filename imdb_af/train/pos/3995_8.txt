Kureishi is not exactly blessed with movies that justify the quality of his writing. Recent custom travesties such as "Intimacy" ruined great writing. But the Mother surpasses all his previous incarnations, even my wonderful laundry. A medieval woman overcomes the widowhood by having a very carnal relationship with the boyfriend of her emotionally weak daughter. The fact that you believe it all is credit for the quality of the play, as it is for the finite gift of writing. And in Daniel Craig we have a tough, brash, gruff anti-hero who denies the audience ever asking why a young stud would think about how a grandmother covers overnight. Beautifully shot, the film only fails in the poor portrayal of the peripheral characters, but as a study of unthinkable lust, it is a winner.
