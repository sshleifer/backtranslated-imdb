Moon Child, starring Japanese rockers Hyde and Gackt, was a better movie when I expected. In fact, I was very impressed and it immediately became one of my favorite movies. <br /> <br /> In Mallepa, the story follows a group of orphans, Sho, Sho's brother Shinji, and Toshi who rob and murder to live. On one of the robberies, Sho meets Hyde's Kei vampire burning in the sunlight. Through the coarse events, Kei's true nature is shown, but no one shoots him away. <br /> <br /> Time passes by and implies that the immortal, immutable Kei Sho has raised and the two have a very close connection. Sho and Kei then meet Son in an outrageous rifle battle, and they become quick friends. Both Kei and Hyde fall in love with Son's sister, Yi-Che. <br /> <br /> Time leaps forward and shows a grown Sho, this time empty of Kei. It also states that Sho and Son have become enemies. <br /> <br /> Through tragedy after tragedy, this movie pops into the reality of life and all its hardship, with the emphasis on friendship and love. It is a real touch movie that is nevertheless sad but beautiful. <br /> <br /> As far as acting is concerned, I think Gackt has done a wonderful job. Hyde did a wonderful job for a first timer. <br /> <br /> The shots were beautiful, but the movie has it rare and short horrible shots. <br /> <br /> All in all, I have to say this movie is great, moving, and I highly recommend it.
