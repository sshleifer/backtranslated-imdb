An interesting TV movie based on the true fact betrayed by describing one of the leading characters, that of a prisoner. Giovanni Ribisi plays his younger brother, who has the delicate mission to decide whether to appeal to the court for his brother's death penalty. But if he goes to visit and enters Elias Koteas, the problem begins. It has nothing to do with Koteas' acting ability. He looks just like the version of a prisoner proletarian roots according to "G.Q." magazine, with a language too sophisticated for someone who spent most of his life behind bars. This realization came to me when I met an old friend, whom I had not seen for almost 15 years, which he had spent in various Panamanian prisons. The young man I know is gone, not just because he is older, but because of his long-term exposure to the criminal system. There are prisons and there are prisons, one has to say, but this one prisoner in 'Shot In the Heart' is definitely outside the world.
