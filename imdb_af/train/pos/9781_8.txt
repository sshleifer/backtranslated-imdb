I heard for a while from Tears of Kali and it sounded like something I wanted, but with all the movies I came in regularly, it became my radar. While driving around the local WonderBook, I found the box for this one and grabbed it. I have to say I'm pretty glad I did it. BALI OF KALI is a strange, greedy, sometimes straight, spectacular movie, somewhat limited by this obviously low budget - but it is still an entertaining and valuable watch. <br /> <br /> KALI TEARS is centered around the fiction of India-based Taylor Eriksson cult group, which practices meditation and other rituals in the quest to dispute the individual's "inner demons" - but it is clear that this techniques too good or not good enough (depending on your view ...) as dark forces are not only wiped out, but also released on unfortunate victims. <br /> <br /> The movie is based on the "anthology" style, with a short but memorable and "eye-opening" intro sequence, and then in the three stories that make up the bulk of the movie . <br /> <br /> The first (SHAKTI) is about a journalist visiting one of the cult members who is being held at a mental hospital. The journalist wants to investigate the cover of the Taylor-Erixson cult, but we find her true motives may be closer to home. When the interview takes a violent turn, the journalist finds out she's got her head. <br /> <br /> The second part (Devi) relates to a violent young man who was sentenced in place of a psychological rehab. of a jail sentence to strike a young man in a coma. We find that the treating doctor in question is actually an alumni of Taylor-Erikkson, and his rehabilitation methods are far from the norm ... <br /> <br /> The closing story (KALI) is about a quack "and his assistant performing" miracles "for a fee. When the healer unknowingly helps one of his clients and actually has a power emission that she owns, the devil is now free to move and search for a new host. <br /> <br /> I have to say I really enjoy TALK OF KALI. There are some bugs with the movie that makes it really great - but it's an original and ambitious movie for what it is. My biggest grip on production is the poor and uninspired over-doubled dialogue. The dubbing is sub-par and I would very much prefer to have a caption option with the original language course. Some reviewers say the act is poor, which I don't necessarily agree with. I think the dubbing is so lacking in glory that it looks stunt, which is not really the case. In fact, some of the performances are a nice damn chilling (the "doctor" in the second segment, and the "client" in the third is easily remembered ...) and significant. The Gore FX has been very well done for a low-budget movie, with some graphic scenes of eyelid removal via cuticle scissors, a pencil-in-the-throat suicide, a decent (but annoying) "shaky") self-flaying, and some other goodies thrown in to a good degree. Not as rough as some of the more "extreme" gore movies out there, but definitely stronger than your average horror card. I also found the story about the cult group to be intriguing and a welcome change in the typical horror story nonsense. There are many scenes of real atmosphere and tension, of which I didn't come in a while. Although flawed in some fundamental ways, I still think TEARS OF KALI will appeal to most "underground" horror viewers - some scenes may be too much for the more general viewer. Definitely Recommended - 8.5 / 10
