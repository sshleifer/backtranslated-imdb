This show is about three little girls. (D.J, Stephanie and Michelle). Their mother is killed by a drunken driver so their father, Danny, invites his son-in-law (Jesse) and his old friend (Joey). So the whole show is about life. The girls go through the problems of life and have life lessons. They develop snippets, boyfriends, and more. The whole show is basically going to go with the flow. You don't have to hold resentment, just let it go. I think this show is really good and fun to watch. I grew up to watch this show and watch it today. I'm glad they still offer this television on television. I almost watch it every day. I rate it 10/10.
