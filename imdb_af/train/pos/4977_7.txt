So many educational films are nothing but thoughts, just saved by the fact that "MST3K" mocked them ("Why Industrial Arts?"). "Hemo the Magnificent" is actually done pretty well. It's all about blood, the heart and the circulatory system. I admit that I don't remember everything, but it does a good job to explain everything, but it keeps it serious but entertaining. I think you can always count on June Foray (most of the voice of Rocky the Squirrel, she plays here a deer). <br /> <br /> Since "Hemo the Magnificent" itself can be hard to find, probably the best place to see it is in "Gremlins": a class looks at it while forming a gremlin.
