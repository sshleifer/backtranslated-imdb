This movie is so wonderful, it's hard to find words to describe it. It's the only time I can't decide what was better, the book or the movie. <br /> <br /> Whoopi Goldberg is great, and Oprah Winfrey, such a good actress, she can be funny, happy and miserable. all at the same time. Overall, the movie is well directed by Steven Speilberg, and should not be passed. 9/10
