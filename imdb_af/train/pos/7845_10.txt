So, Fox pulled the plug halfway through a drama / riddle ... <br /> <br /> How lamb is that? Do they expect us to invest our time in their new performances when there is a realistic risk of never finding out what is happening? Why wasn't the remaining, already filmed, episodes broadcast in the US? They were broadcast elsewhere. <br /> <br /> Hey, Fox! Are you listening? It was a good performance, but you hung us up. If you want to present new drama / riddles, you should at least make a conclusion before suddenly ending the middle theme. Every time something like this happens (and it seems to happen a lot to you - that is, Fox), there are more people who will wait and see before investing their time. That means you'll see an artificially low interest, and more likely to end the series. See? This is a vicious cycle. Don't let us fall again ...
