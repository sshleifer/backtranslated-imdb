Peter Sollett created an engaging portrait of real people living in poverty in the Lower East Side of New York, or Loisaida, as known by locals. <br /> <br /> Mr. Sollett's heart is in the right place when he examines this dysfunctional family, which is typical of the country's various "inner cities". Mr. Sollett emphasizes the positive in the story he presents. These are basically good kids, the children of parents who left them and whose grandmother took under her wing. <br /> <br /> Instead of presenting its characters as losers, Sollett is a positive side they all have. These children are not in drugs or steal because they are poor. If this story was done by Hollywood, we would have seen a parade of stereotypes, instead of struggling kids, but deep inside, they are not defeated. <br /> <br /> Victor Rasuk, as Victor Vargas, was a revelation. He is natural. So is Julie Marte. Her character shows us a non-young girl who is not deceived or driven to do anything she doesn't want to do. Altagracia Guzman, like the grandmother is excellent. She wears her frustration because she can't send her grandchildren into the things she believes in and it's so important to her. <br /> <br /> All in all, it was a great picture, thanks to Peter Sollett.
