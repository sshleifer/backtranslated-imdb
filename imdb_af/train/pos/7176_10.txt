OK - you want to test someone about how comfortable they are with their adolescence and the embarrassment and maniacal changes to it. Then they get their immediate response to look at this turbulent document about children who make socially relevant horror movies in the suburban 80s. More than any film I've ever seen, the film deals with sexuality and ego in a way that is completely human, never sowing, and rinsing in the kind of inherent goodness of youths that have been discolored by the terrified adult world where any Excitement in the youth is accredited to anything from madness to perversion. Mini-mogul Darren Stien seems to be reaching for a deeper understanding of his triumphs and doubts as the patriarch of the strict child's world. What he finds in himself and others is not always beautiful - but shows how to improve and reconcile with age. What does change without reflection mean? I love this movie.
