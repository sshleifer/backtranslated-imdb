How can the viewer rating for this movie be just 5.4? Only the beautiful young Alisan Porter should start automatically at 6 when you determine your rating. James Belushi is good at this also his first good serious role, I don't like him in anything except Over Last Night to this. He was pretty good at running. Also with Tupac. Kelly Lynch, you must love her. Well, I do. I just wonder what happened to Miss Porter. <br /> <br /> I gave Curly Sue a 7
