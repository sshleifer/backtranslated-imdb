I admit that I have a weakness for alternative history stories, from his wonderful life to GROUNDHOG DAY to 12:01. Among the big ones is this jewel. It is pretty difficult to get through MR. DESTINY without giving any appreciation to every single player, from benevolent James Belushi to the murderous Courtney Cox. This movie does not have the gravitas and scale to make it a good movie, but it is a fine excitement on a rainy afternoon. It's also a good rental for a cheap date.
