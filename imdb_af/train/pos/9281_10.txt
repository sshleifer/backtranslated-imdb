I don't know how and where the Iranian directors get their inspiration to set up such a plot. In fact, it's a very simple plot that many directors can emerge --- but can't do it on a movie like Jafar Panahi. The movie is like 2 worlds at the same time the one is interconnected - the soccer match and the battle between genders taking place behind the walls of the stadium. <br /> <br /> It makes you feel like you're in the movie and you're one of the characters, and while watching the movie, as if you also want a look at the soccer game. You will feel exactly the same excitement and feelings as those female actors in the movie. It is so gripping that you want to see the end, you will find out the verdict, you will die to see what will happen to the girls. <br /> <br /> I like the intermittent conversations between the smoke girl and one of the military pupils. It's like Venus VS Mars. It really shows the difference in the minds of men and women and the struggle of women to get equal rights and opportunities, especially in a very patriarchal society like Iran. <br /> <br /> This is the second movie I saw of Jafar Panahi (the first being Crimson Gold) and looking forward to seeing more. <br /> <br /> I'm already addicted to Iranian movies and this one is a must-see!
