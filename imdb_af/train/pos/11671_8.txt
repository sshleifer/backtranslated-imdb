"Against all flags" are each the classic swashbuckler. It has all the elements that the adventure lover can hope for and more in this one is the girl in need, well, not really in need. As Spitfire Stevens, Maureen O'Hara is at her athletic best, running her enemies in violation of the social norms of the era. Anthony Quinn runs the top three colored actors as the relentless captain Roc Brasiliano and proves a fiery and capable nemesis for Brian Hawke (Flynn). For the classic adventure lover, "Against All Flags" is a must-see. Although it may not be quite the same as some of Errol Flynn's previous work (Captain Blood and The Sea Hawk), it's still a very entertaining skirt.
