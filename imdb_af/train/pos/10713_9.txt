An angry boy who has tragically lost his parents is cared for by his grandfather. Together they find common ground in the Gaelic folklore that has been passed orally from generation to generation of islanders. Although tragic episodes, such as the Highland broadcasts, appear in the stories, there is a surprising amount of humor and joy in them. It's all filmed in Skye, so there's a double dose of beauty. The mountain scenery is breathtaking, and it's a rare chance to speak Scottish Gaelic. I am English, so I had to read the captions, but the sound of spoken Gaelic is wonderful. The performances are exactly what you expect from carefully selected non-actors. In other words, you look at the right thing - people who love Gaelic folklore and history. The Gaelic community, especially on Skye, worked countless little miracles to make this film. Anyone who has the slightest interest in Gaelic, folk history, folk music, oral culture, Scotland, British history, multicultural or social justice, should see this film.
