The Three Stooges have always been one of the many actors I loved. I love every one of the shorts they made. I love all six of the Stooges (Curly, Shemp, Moe, Larry, Joe, and Curly Joe)! All the shorts are hilarious and also many other great actors and actresses who were many of them in many of the shorts! In my opinion, the Three Stooges is ever one of the greatest actors and is the all-time funniest comedy team! <br /> <br /> One of my favorite Stooges shorts with Shemp is none other than men! All that appears in this brief is the beautiful Christine McIntyre, Dee Green, Doris Houck, Alyn Lockwood, Johnny Kascier, Nancy Saunders, Lu Leonard, Maxine Gates and Emil Sitka. Green and McIntyre offer great performances here! There are so many funny parts here. It's a very hilarious short. There is another similar Three Stooges short of this one called Brideless Groom and I recommend both!
