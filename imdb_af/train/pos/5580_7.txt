Young beautiful Eva (Hedy Lamarr) marries an older man (Zvonimir Rogoz). Unfortunately, he cannot satisfy her sexually and ignore her. Frustrated, she goes home and plans to get divorce. Then one day she is slim in a lake in the middle of the forest. Her horse runs away with her clothes ... and she walks after that! She meets young and very attractive Adam (Aribert Mog). They make love and she realizes it's the man she wants. <br /> <br /> END SPOILER !!!! Of course, since it was made in 1933, she must be punished for her sin, so it leads to a tragic final. END OF ENDING SPOILER !! <br /> <br /> These horrific people in 1933, but rather tame of today's standards. Lamarr's naked swim shows nothing and if she is completely naked after the horse, it is also shown in the extreme long shot or exposed by branches and so on. There are only a few small shots of her breasts. Even if she has sex with Mog, nothing is shown, but her face, but you see her getting an orgasm. This scene was considered extremely extreme in their day and was completely cut out from the American release. Today they are back. This movie will now be easy with a PG-13. <br /> <br /> Shock appointments are just OK. It is beautifully filmed and there is no dialogue. Except for the music score, it can be a silent picture. Fortunately, all the actors are good - Lamarr and Mog especially and they are so attractive that they just take your breath away to watch them. Also, the sequence in which they make love is easily one of the most beautiful shot and ridden lines I've ever seen in a movie. The scenes of the sexual symbolism (there are quite a few of them) are unfortunately quite obvious. I actually started giggling! <br /> <br /> So, good direction, beautiful images, attractive actors, good acting around the world - but I didn't bow down exactly about it. I found the film moving slowly (beautiful images don't make me a picture), somewhat dull, obvious, static and negative. I can live with the end, but it doesn't excuse the other problems I had with it. Also the final row is VERY strange - and out of place. So I admire this movie more than anything else. It was well done and I would recommend it with caution. Many people seem to love this movie, so I'm in the minority. Use your own judgment.
