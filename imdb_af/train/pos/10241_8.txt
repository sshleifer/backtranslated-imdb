I'm not trying to use IMDb ratings, but I was flabbergasted when I saw the 5.4-rating to one of my childhood favorites. It doesn't make me that much at 17, but as a family movie it's a lovely and significant movie. Children will definitely love it and will not understand the mistakes, and the adults can guess the actor behind each character and admire the subliminal messages of the movie. None of the films were preachy in any way, and it actually has a good message that added to his sweetness. I will admit that the story is on the thin side, and a few scenes like Screweyes' death (which I still miss) may be a bit scary. But the animation is well above average with nice colors and good character animation. The music by James Horner is very beautiful, and the song that appears is memorable, catchy and amusing. I liked a lot of the characters, Louie is probably the deepest of them all, but at least the dinosaurs were getting involved. Martin Short's clown was both hilarious and emphatic, the part when he told Screweyes, "I quit!" had me in stitches. My favorite is Screweyes, an effective villain who is smart and I suppose intelligent. If there was anything, I wish the movie being held in that part, explaining how he lost his eye and why he was afraid of crows, because he could be more developed in terms of depth. The writing, while not worthy of Oscar, has its funny and heart-warming parts, and should entertain children and adults. The voice acting for me was what made the movie. John Goodman, Martin Short, Rhea Perlman, Felicity Kendall and Yeardley Smith produced solid performances, but special mention should go to Kenneth Mars, as he was absolutely beautiful like Screweyes and almost unrecognizable. All in all, this is a good movie. I don't get the rating, honestly I don't. Certainly this movie isn't perfect, and it's not as good as a dinosaur movie like Land Before Time, but it's fun. 7.5 / 10 Bethany Cox
