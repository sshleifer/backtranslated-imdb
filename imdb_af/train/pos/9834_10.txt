Yes, it's cheesy, it's not Zombie, but it's not that bad either. It has Beatrice Ring which is a great bonus and it is entertaining. I had the good fortune to meet Fulci later in his career and he was philosophical about the experience because he was never quite happy with it. It is worth finding a search, especially for genre and Fulci fans. This is a film that is too often released from the hand.
