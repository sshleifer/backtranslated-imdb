Although I'm quite young, the Beatles are my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE band! I never had the chance to hear their music as it was released, but loved them since I remember. <br /> <br /> It's the kind of movie that's worth trying once. I can see why it was not released in the theater, but it is definitely a good movie to turn on the TV. I flickered through my TV guide and saw this movie, it didn't have much detail except something like that, "John Lennon and Paul McCartney meet after The Beatles broke Jared Harris Stars. I have never heard of him (he played John) or Aiden Quinn who played Paul. However, they are definitely underestimated actors! <br /> <br /> The movie had a slow start, but as it developed, I could see how well Quinn, but especially Harris, played their characters. As a big fan, I know how real Lennon and McCartney are. The writer was brilliant and Harris got Lennon's accent, personality and ways! Quinn played McCartney well, but sometimes went into his Irish accent. The makeup artists made them look good. <br /> <br /> THIS PARAGRAPH SHOULD BE AS A * SPOILER * PROFESSIONAL: <br /> <br /> As I have already mentioned, it has started a slow start but has evolved rapidly and has become an emotional movie. I found the little bit in the park a total waste of time and quite out of character for both musicians. Regardless of Lennon's rude line in the Italian restaurant, completely unnecessary. The end was very gripping and brought a tear in my eye when I saw it. <br /> <br /> It's quite different from the other biographical movies I've seen about how The Beatles came together and became known, and they never did the characters so well. Eg "Backbeat". <br /> <br /> In conclusion I would say, if you are a Beatles or John Lennon or Paul McCartney fan, give it a chance that you can have a pleasant surprise. At only about 95 minutes, it's worth waiting for the movie to develop. <br /> <br /> If anyone knows if the 1976 meeting really happened, please send it to the 'comment page' for this movie, I "would be very interested.
