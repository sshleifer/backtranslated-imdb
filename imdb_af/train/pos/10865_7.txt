This movie is great to see if you like films of organized crime variety. Those looking for a crime movie with a charismatic guidance with dreams of taking over in a bad way can be a little disappointed with the way this movie progresses. <br /> <br /> It's a fun skirt by a criminal underworld, but and if you're not familiar with Hong Kong movies, then you can be pleasantly surprised by this one. I was a bit disappointed with some of the choices made on the story, but generally a good crime movie. Some things didn't make sense, but it turned out to be the norm with films from the East. <br /> <br /> No matter what their personalities have been set up, people are randomly doing things. It's a little annoying pattern that even penetrates into this movie.
