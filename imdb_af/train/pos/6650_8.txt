I don't want to comment on how good the movie was or what the mistakes were, because I'm not a professional film critic and I don't have enough knowledge about making movies. What I do know is that it is such a movie in your very first shot, is a great achievement and I want to congratulate the Director. However, in some reviews, which I have read, critics complained that Hiralal's relationship with his brothers was not highlighted and his brothers and sisters were completely erased from the story. Now I would like to point out here that, as the name of the movie suggests, it's not a movie about Hiralal's brothers, it's a movie about the relationship between Mahatma Gandhi and his son Hiralal Gandhi, nothing less nothing. If we start complaining about the fact that some characters in the movie are being sold out, it's a little unfair because these characters don't fit in the picture, no matter how relevant they are in real life. So I think it would be better if we stick to the main idea and stop satisfying a critic in ourselves. <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
