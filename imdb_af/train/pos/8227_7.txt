An interesting thriller that Paul Winfield has as a detective on the murder case. Paul Winfield was an underrated actor who pulled all his roles down so comfortably. It was hard to say the man even acted. Perhaps most famous by younger viewers than the voice / narrator of "City Confidential", Winfield ends his career with a so-so movie; but as always, Winfield shines. A nice look. Erika Eliniak, Erika Eliniak, is nice to look at, but leaves much to be desired in the acting department. Although, to be fair, it is one of her better efforts. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: A viewable thriller that should not be missed by any Paul Winfield fan. A decent phone call to help Paul Winfield away celluloid away from the sky. What an actor. He will be missed.
