During the whole Pirates of the Caribbean Trilogy Craze Paramount Pictures, the ball really played in the restoration of this Anthony Quinn director Cecil B. DeMille under the supervision of the movie and included on DVD and Blu Ray with all the extras. It is obvious to me that Paramount Pictures Execs is blind as bats and ignorant of the fact that they have a very good pirate movie in their safe over a real pirate who actually lived in New Orleans, Louisiana. City would help once. again known for its Pirate Connections. When the Execs at Paramount finally come to the program and release this movie in digital format, I'll be a happy camper. Paramount Pictures it's up to you to get your duff out and get this movie recovered now!
