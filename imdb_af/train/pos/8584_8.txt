Sergeant Ryker is accused of being a traitor during the Korean War, a pending offense. An elongated court march occurs in what time the Sgt. must remain in a military prison. After much investigation, the defense attorney attempts to wipe out the doomed non-com with an eleventh hour pleat. Very good picture.
