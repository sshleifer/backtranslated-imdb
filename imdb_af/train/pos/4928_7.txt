Given his release time, the story that disrupted Panic in the Streets in 1950 was almost a surprise. The body of a mysterious illegal immigrant is found and transferred as no one to further investigation by a public health inspector who claims the body carries a tribal bubonic plague.

Richard Widmark, in his first role following his breakthrough performance in Night and the City, Jack Palance in his cold film debut, is also in the movie Paul Douglas and a young Barbara Bel Geddes. A whole series of unreasonable, non-professional actors (typical of director Kazan) fill in the remaining slots. Elia Kazan directs, Joe MacDonald films (he would work with Richard Widmark again in 1953, and the great Alfred Newman achieved it. Almost everyone involved here did better work, 'Panic in the Streets' is quite the rewarding watch, especially for the film-noir enthusiast.
