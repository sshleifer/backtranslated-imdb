If you want Scream or something like the big-studio horror product we're forced on, don't bother these days. This well-written film was thinking about everything it had to say. The importance of myth in our lives to make it meaningful, how children interpret the world (and its violence), our destruction of the environment and ignorance of its history and legends. Everything here, but not flat on the surface. You can technically call it a "monster movie", although the Wendigo does not take to the end of the physical form, and it is even yours and your beliefs about what happens to the legendary spirit / animal. Some standard thriller elements for those who just watch the basics and the movie, never drill, but the less you see the creature, the better. Fessenden successfully continues with George Romero's tradition of using the genre as a parable and as a discussion forum while still busy.
