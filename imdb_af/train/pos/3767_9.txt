Return to page ten of this review section and work your way back. Go ahead; I'll wait. <br /> <br /> Ready? Well, then you probably noticed the same trend I have. You can put jokes, dated timing and clear-cut plot points and shtick in 'Bogus' all day long, but this movie seems to be one of those "hate me now, please keep me later" movie. <br /> <Bill and Ted's biggest problem was that the original appealed to the children of the 80s who followed the trend and saw themselves at the forefront of fashion.
