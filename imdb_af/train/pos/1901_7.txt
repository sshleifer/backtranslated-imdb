It's hard to put your finger on this one. I think it's basically a comedy about a drunk rich drunk that falls in love with a (relatively) poor girl he wants to marry at the risk of being denied by his family. <br /> <br /> It touches funny moments, romantic moments and moments. Dudley Moore is funny and encourages his self-centered character, Liza Minelli is a convincing foil as the demanding opposite, but John Gielgud steals the show as Arthur's wonderful sarcastic butler. <br /> <br /> It's fun but fun with an unforgettable soundtrack, running for almost 3 months at our local flight.
