I also watched this movie at the Santa Barbara Film Festival. It was an excellent movie about adult family relationships. Paul Reiser wrote the film and included some similarities with his family. It was funny, warm, gripping, and moving, as well as entertaining. A movie like this will do very well with the oral statements. I will definitely tell my friends and family to watch this movie. Let's just hope they'll get the chance. I will judge this film as one of the best movies I've seen in a year. It contains no violence, action scenes, murders, sex, so apparently distributors ask if they should pick it up or not. Believe me, there are people out there who would like to see a movie that denies value, rather than the very typical big box busters we usually get.
