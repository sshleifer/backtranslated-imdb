The first time I saw this movie in the theater at a foreign film festival, I thought it was intriguing, fascinating, the sensitive two-sex artist. So much European, so much Afrikaans! I recently rented it for a second show and could barely adhere to the overworked theme of the mad writer, with a prosecution complex of religious sexual orientation. Get a grip! This man is a freeloader who lives outside society. I suspect the real reason he has this fantasy nightmares over the "spiderwoman" is that after years his guilty complex is ignoring the mother's advice to go in with strangers in cars (and bed)! Not only does he make bad sums of (probably tax-free) booty for writing stories (guilty voyage), but he is too cheap to pay for a haircut, so he is enchanting the beauty owner. Then he has the nerve to complain about the account! But I also suspect that the world has changed a lot since this film was made. On a serious note it was entertaining to see Jan de Bont's camera and one of Paul Verhoeven's previous films. Hmmm, maybe the world hasn't changed so badly?
