I've been reading about FLAVIA THE HERETIC for years, but I only saw it early last year when I was a crazy movie sales, and for whatever reason, it's been my last time in mind, even though it's a few months ago I watched it. <br /> <br /> It is a striking film that takes place somewhere in Italy in the 15th century. Definitely medieval era (though I don't think a particular year is ever given). This is the time of Christian emergence, age is a time of utter madness, and the movie captures it very well. <br /> <br /> Our protagonist, Flavia, is a young woman who meets a fallen Muslim on a battlefield. He looks like a warm and interesting comrade, and she is taken with him immediately. Her father, a soldier of some family standing, almost immediately gathered and made the wounded man right in front of her eyes. But she would still see him in her dreams. <br /> <br /> Her father sends her away to a monastery that looks more like an openly insane asylum - the inhabitants are so badly oppressed by unconscious medieval Christianity. Flavia comes under the influence of one of the nuttier nuns. But in a mad world just the healthy is really crazy, and this sociopathic sister clearly recognizes the sickness around her. She takes the times in which they live, catches a chord with Flavia, who, young and apparently sheltered, begins to question everything about this world in which she finds herself trapped. <br /> <br /> The movie is infallible. in his portrayal of the world, which is very unpleasant. We see a horse money, a gentleman raping one of his country's women in a pigtail, the pious torture of a young nun. All this, Flavia observes and questions, ultimately rejects the Christian dogma that creates such a parade of horror that would make the film some criticism over the years for anachronistic seemingly. I disagree with the criticism. Flavia's points of view, although sometimes spoken on a vague mirror, for example, then-contemporary feminist commentary (the film was made in 1974) revolve around what really obvious obvious questions are. Perhaps it's hard to believe that in her own time, she can be as much of a fish out of water, but that's the kind of small point it doesn't. Flavia is so written that it is possible from our era, or from any era, to empathize with her. Flavia is sad when the Muslims arrive, enter the countryside, and she finds in their leader a new version of the handsome Islamic who still visits her dreams. He almost immediately hit her, he allowed her to virtually lead his army, become a Joan or Arc figure in full force, and direct the intruders to divert Christian society and revenge everyone who she saw what was doing evil. /> <br /> Is she the herald of a new and better world? She may think so, but Muslims of that era were not great at feminism either, because she was learning the difficult way soon. As they say, the new boss meets ... <br /> <br /> It's really just a thumbnail of some of the things happening in FLAVIA THE HERETIC. The movie is pretty grim, with a very depressing, rather depressing end. Not a big public movie, to be sure. However, it is pretty good and does not belong to the "nunsploitation" role it is often thrown into. I think there is a lot of value in the final movie, and I'm glad I saw it.
