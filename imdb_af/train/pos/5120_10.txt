Quick and simple, I love this movie. <br /> <br /> As some others have mentioned, I'm not from the south either, don't really care for country music and never wear a cowboy hat. (I've never been in a car with a dead body in my torso, but I love Goodfellas.) It's just a good movie. Shot in a 2.35 ratio ratio and beautifully transferred to DVD. (The VHS was 1.33 full screen). And yes, a solid 5.1 mix for your viewing pleasure. What can you say about this movie? <br /> <br /> It's just a great love / hate story made in Texas, with good performances. Travolta is fantastic. Along Pulp Fiction, this is the best thing he did. It's in my top 5 for 25 years !! <br /> <br /> Check this one !!! It's a 10 !!!!
