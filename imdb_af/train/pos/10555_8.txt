The idea of ​​this movie has long since tickled my imagination. We all heard or read in some kind of text. What would you do if you were alone in the world? What will you do if the whole world suddenly disappears before your eyes? In fact, the last part is actually happening to Dave and Andrew, two roommates living in a downhill home in the middle of a highway system. Andrew is a nerve wreck to say the least and Dave is considered one of the biggest losers in society. This alone is the main reason why these two guys come together so well because they only have to turn each other when comfort is needed. Just to ... <br /> <br /> Right at the start of the movie, there are many and many problems with them. Both become involved in crime, Andrew suffers from paranoia and simply dares not leave home. Dave is not successful at his job and his colleagues do not treat him very well and with the respect he deserves. The amount of problems they face continues to rise until one day they encounter the inevitable and deal with it. It's just too much for them and they wish everything just goes away. And of course this is exactly what happens. <br /> <br /> The rest of the story puts Dave and Andrew in this world of nothing. Initially they are surprised and have difficulty understanding and handling the characteristics of this crazy environment, but later find out that they can do just about anything they want, because they seem to be the only ones left. <Br /> <br /> Nothing has an incredibly small roll. In fact, besides the first few shots from the film, we see Dave (David Hewlett) and Andrew (Andrew Miller) in the whole movie. Obviously, to pull it off, the cast should be more than the task, because in a world where nothing exists, there is nothing that can distract the viewer in any way. Vincenzo has decided to use a reasonable amount of close-up shots to make it more interesting and actually works pretty well. Photography director Derek Rogers also has a great way to plague the audience by withholding visual information, especially at times when a character is seeing and responding to it, but we do not see it immediately. <br /> <br /> Of course, this can't be an event-driven movie and it's not. Much of the action happens outside their home as they move into the void. And that's where some of the hilarious scenes take place, especially when Andrew discovers a nice area. <br /> <br /> Now you can think, "What does nothing look like?" Well, it looks like nothing. The whole world of nothing is white ... white doesn't matter in what direction you look. This is the weakness of this movie ... After an hour or less it becomes very boring to watch and there have to be events to make it more interesting to look at. Thank you, there are a few. For example, when the two boys can't really jump high because of the features of nothing, nothing is made of ... tofu (as Andrew claims). It is nice to see how they can immediately use nothing to become gods of their own small society. <br /> <br /> One of the best parts of the movie is the set ... Production designer Jasna Stefanovic has a beautiful work in this movie, the home in which these two guys live, is so unnaturally fun to look, but it seems right that these two live in such a place. All in all, the production design is undoubtedly one of the most powerful aspects of this film. It makes the movie worth watching ... <br /> <br /> The very best part of the movie is the acting one. Both David Hewlett and Andrew Miller really look like the professional actors they are both. The camera is on them for every second of the film and, as said before, there are almost no props in the movie, they are really at a bare stage. With lots of character development and some decent one-liners, smart dialogue (sometimes hilariously stupid), it all works to the end - and it really moves the movie away from the low-budget area to well-crafted craft. <Br /> <br /> Let's talk a little about the visual effects, because it's definitely worth mentioning. Nothing has digital visual effects and prosthetics that resemble any modern horror movie. There is a frightening dream sequence in the movie, and while The Drews has been milking the scene, it's still fun to watch. One of the best visual effects in the film is at the end where Andrew and Dave suddenly discover their powers in this environment - they have the ability to wish everything away, so if they can do it differently and make things look like? <br /> <br /> "Nothing" is a bright and well-lit movie, it really helps the idea that they are likely to be dead (this is actually one of their theories), but "nothing" is a comedy and it slowly destroys its own theory. We don't know where they are or what happened to them. We don't know if they'll ever get out, because the movie ends before we see such a thing. The end is not as good as it could have been. It is quite easy to predict what is going to happen, but the authors have come up with some incidents that help make it more interesting. In the end, it's a pretty satisfying one. <br /> <br /> Take "Hollow Man", "Kill Bill", "Cube", "Epoch" and many other movies and you have nothing. This is actually a merger of different styles, but there is no other film (at least I know). Nothing really is that way. For those who remember the original Cube Production Comment on his DVD, remember that Vincenzo Natali talked about how he came up with Cube's story. He talks about him and André Bijelic was a roommate at one time and they were both in this extremely boring room with no hope of coming out. Nothing can be the sifted version of the origin of the Cube story, and to achieve this, it's almost like one of the Cube prequels. <br /> <br /> What can I say? I did not enjoy anything, it is a good movie and the different parts of the movie are extremely well made with tons of intelligent ideas. I still feel the movie miss something and I have trouble figuring out exactly what it is ... Maybe if we have a "Nothing 2", I can answer that question. "Nothing" is a good movie, but not as good as I expected. <br /> <br /> Final rating: 7.5 / 10
