It's a very fine and poetic story. Beautiful views. Beautiful music score. I was twice in Japan last year and the movie gave me this typical Japanese feeling. The camera's movement is excellent as well as the actors. It goes deep in your feelings without becoming melodramatic. Japanese people are very sensitive and friendly and it is very well presented here. The director plays excellently with light colors and shows the audience that it is also possible to enjoy a movie with subtle and fine details. Once you've seen this movie, you'll want to see more of the same director. It's a good, good movie and I can only recommend it to everyone.
