After plunging his toes into the Giallo pool with the master movie "The Strange Vice or Ms. Wardh" (1971), director Sergio Martino followed the same year. It seems to be another spin, "The Case of the Scorpion's tail." Like his earlier effort, this one-star, fun macho dude George Hilton, the next year in Martino's Satanic / giallo hybrid "All the colors of the dark "will die. "Scorpion's Tail" also features actors Luigi Pistilli and Anita Strindberg, who would portray an unfortunate couple (to put it mildly!) In Martino's "Your Vice is a Locked Room and I Have the Key" (1972). (I just love that title!) I think Edwige Fenech was doing the month they shot! Anyway, this movie boasts the attractive direction that Martino fans would expect, as well as a winding plot, some finely crafted killings, and a beautiful Athenian space shooter. The story of this time relates to an insurance investigator (Hilton) and a journalist (Strindberg, who looks like Farrah Fawcett's nicer, smarter sister) who became involved in a series of Greek murders after a plane crash and heritage of $ 1 million by a beautiful widow. I really thought I had gone through this picture halfway, but I was dead wrong. Although the plot makes complete sense, I can watch the movie again to fully appreciate all its subtleties. Highlights of the picture, to me, were Anita's cat-and-mouse battle with the killer at the end, a particularly exciting break-in, and a sturdy battle on top of a tiled roof; very good action bars in this movie! The fine people at No Shame are thanked for another great DVD, with good captions and interesting extras. Whotta great equipment it seems to be, in his constant quest to bring back these lost Italian jewels from oblivion.
