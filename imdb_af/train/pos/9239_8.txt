As I said in my first part comment: These two movies are better than most science-fiction fans. Confession. <br /> <br /> The scenario in the second movie is not moving because we do not see the destruction of human civilization, but the aftermath, thousands of refugees fleeing in small spaces, protected by only one powerful spaceship. <br /> <br /> But when Battlestar Pegasus appears, the story is heated and the battle is traced back to the Cylon planets. . Well, it has a little Mad Max because all they fight is fuel for their spaces to continue to find the distant Earth, but it works for me. It's exciting Science Fiction entertainment with fine actors and decent special effects (although they tend to repeat the least :-)). I would have liked a continuation with Starbuck and Apollo on the advice. Instead, we have a second successor with no names characters who have proven that the story has worked before, especially because the character characters were chosen so well. <br /> <br /> Thumbs down for the 1980s, but thumbs for the two movies from 1978.
