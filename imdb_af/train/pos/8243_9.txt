In an alternative 1950's, where an outbreak of the undead (caused by a mysterious 'spacecraft') through the use of special electronic collars is found, a young loner, Timmy, finds a friend in Fido ( Billy Connelly, his family's recent acquired moderate zombie. <br /> <br /> Fido quickly becomes a surrogate father to Timmy, whose real father cannot express his love for his son (or for his brother-in-law, played by the beautiful Carrie-Anne Moss) was psychologically shaken as a child (when he was forced to shoot his own father, who tried to eat him!). However, Timmy walks in a place of stumbling, when his thin collar collapses, and he falls and dies to an elderly neighbor. With the authorities on Fido's route, can Timmy be able to hold on to his newfound friend? <br /> <br /> A refreshing approach to the whole zombie schtick, Fido is a thoroughly entertaining, fun dark comedy that has to appeal to anyone with a slightly twisted sense of humor. If you take the Romero zombie verse and move it in the 1950s, small town America is a stroke of genius, and the result is just one of the most original films around the whole 'rehabilitated dead' theme I have seen. to tackle. <br /> <Connelly's Fido is a movie zombie worthy of inclusion in the Undead Movie Hall of Fame, along with Day Of The Dead's Bub, and Return of Living Dead's Tarman; I don't often feel empathy for a running body, but The Big Yin's performance is so good that I actually found myself for the big blue bag of pus! The rest of the film also gives commendable performances, with young K'Sun Ray (like Timmy) and Mrs. Moss earns special listings? Ray, for one so young, he puts a special turn and Moss because she's so bloody delicious! <br /> <br /> This is the third zombie movie I watched this week (the other is the somewhat disappointing Planet Terror and the rather fun flight of the living dead) and to my surprise it is also the best. Director Andrew Currie gave the fans of the genre something original to treasure and is a talent to be watched in the future. <br /> <br /> 8.5 out of 10, rounded to 9 for IMDb.
