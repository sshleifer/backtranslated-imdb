The thing I remember most about this movie is that during the Christmas season it used local KTLA TV (Ch.5) during the mid to late 70's, mainly due to the fact that the true story occurred on or near Christmas. It was always a bit disturbing to see hell that this girl is going to be, the only survivor of a plane accident in the Peruvian jungle. The graphic scene of this young girl pulling leeches from her infected leg made an impression on this young viewer. Not quite the kind of Christmas. I was used to it at the time. Certainly not a Rankin-Bass production.
