Sometimes Lady Luck smiles at me. I originally made - and copied over - a VHS band of this great TV show. I was sad when I realized what I was doing, as I couldn't find it. <br /> <br /> Recently, I subscribed to the digital cable, and while searching through upcoming movies, to my surprise was a scheduled movie broadcast. This time, however, I made a copy of it on DVD so there is no chance to repeat my mistake. <br /> <br /> Eventually, I looked at it eight years later, and it was just as exciting and tense as I first saw. There is a bit of predictions for this story as my first contact with "Pandora's Clock" came with a lively reading of the book on the public radio. I just went to the broadcasting station on my way home for lunch, and I was addicted to the first installment. Every day I waited, waiting for the next chapter to be read. <br /> <br /> When I learned a few months later that the book was being broadcast on television, I made sure to schedule it for the event. <br /> <br /> First of all, I would like to say that the film was very faithful to the book, as opposed to what another reviewer said. This is in itself a rare achievement for TV movies. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I agree with others about the casting. I couldn't imagine a better choice for Captain Holland as Richard Dean Anderson. Literally, the film can be crashed and burned without a proper role for this key role. Anderson has never been better, and it is a pity that we no longer saw him. In fact, all the role-players did an excellent job. <br /> <br /> My only complaint to the movie - and the book - was the interjection of the "terrorist plot" to arm a private business jet with air-to-air missiles and steal and shoot his pilot off the stricken plane. In fact, we're talking in less than 36 hours to orchestrate and execute a plan like this one, and it's not at all realistic to all the players involved. No realistic was how little the aircraft was affected by having the first one, when two of its engines shot down. <br /> <br /> Aside from that beef, I enjoyed the tension of the building and found it very credible how the responses of foreign governments were portrayed in the film as well as our own. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity to see this movie, do it at all times.
