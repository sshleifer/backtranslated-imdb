When people ask me why I like so much movies, I usually respond, "did you see the art gallery order in De Palma's Dressed to Kill?" This scene alone represents exactly what I want to see in a movie. If I were a film director, it would be the kind of thing I would like to do. "Pure cinema" is one way to describe the sequence and it's really great to see director De Palma's entire film work at the same high artistic frequency of the scene. It's a dreamy movie, clever as hell, and with more intelligence and intelligence than a dozen films composed. I think the movie is an important point that will always be a topic of heated discussion: can a movie rely solely on technique and still be regarded as an artistic success? The movie has no message to speak, acting is good, but it is at the service of style, and the writing is short on logic. De Palma's movie makes a very good case that the style, when properly handled, can retain a film of the characteristic length. Certainly, Michael Caine, Angie Dickinson, Nancy Allen and Keith Gordon give superior performances, but it's a director's movie to the fadeout. This is a sensational demonstration of the possibilities of the film medium. I won't tell you what Hitchcock's movie pays for the movie (I don't want to blame surprises), but I think De Palma spans the arc of the story and manages a movie that sums up his entire career as a whole. Not for the most beautiful of the heart!
