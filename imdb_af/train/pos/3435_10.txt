This film is a wonderfully simplistic work. Enjoy from start to finish, it's both sad and uplifting at the same time. The performances of Miranda Otto (oh how she deserves so much recognition!) And George del Hoya is beautiful and yet almost painful to watch, as the two tortured souls get to know each other. The support workers at the Dead Letter Office are wonderful bits in themselves, just like Alice's long-suffering boyfriend, whom I couldn't help but feel a little sorry. There is a specific scene I could watch over and over (and I did!). It is so unfortunate that movies like this do not get recognition, and then bring them further into the public eye so that more people can enjoy. I cried, I laughed and I sighed. I would recommend this movie to anyone.
