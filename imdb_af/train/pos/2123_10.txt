Of the three remakes of this plot, I like them all, I have all three on VHS and also have a copy of this one on DVD. There is just enough variation in the scripts to see all three entertaining and again. In addition, any other movie was created three times with such all stars in each one? Of course, the main stars in this one are great, but the supporting actors are also fantastic. I especially like William Tracy as Pepi. He was such a playmaker I was looking for to find other movies. He appeared in many, but most are not available. Like the other comments, I also say - buy this one.
