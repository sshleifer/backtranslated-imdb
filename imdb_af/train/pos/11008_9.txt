You will see through the stars I gave this BIG movie, which "... before you see it for the first time". I have never heard of this movie and happened just because this week (and last) was a very slow rental experience (not much in size). I'm not sure how this movie slipped over me. I love Lucy Liu and Jeremy Northam is great too. Yet it did. <br /> <br /> This movie is a great example of what to do if you don't have a big budget. It just made the right amount of plot and dialogue to make it very interesting and keep the viewer in the dark; just enough. The whole movie is you (the viewer) trying to figure out the plots. Many turn and turn. I would have given this film 10/10, but some of the shots were pretty fake. I don't like this movie too much, but I don't think it deserves a perfect score. <br /> <br /> Lucy Liu is beautiful and mysterious (as always). I think she's pretty much underestimated as a serious talent. Never remind her beauty (which is difficult), she really takes her roles seriously and does not rest on her appearance to drive her through sophisticated emotion plays. And she can also look cold and even lifeless when needed. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Northam does really well, first and foremost, as a pretty corporate rat, willing to run through any maze to prove himself. However, as he changes throughout the film, it's like night and day. I know some fans of Clive Owen, Jude Law, or other hopefuls to become the next James Bond will hate me for this, but Northam would / could / should fit the account. He is suave and cultured. He has a good Bond attitude and voice. I think he can also be cold when the situation calls for it, and down to earth. <br /> <br /> Big movie and definitely this movie buffer recommends it to watch at least once you like corporate espionage movies.
