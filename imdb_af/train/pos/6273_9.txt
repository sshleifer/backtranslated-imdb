I really love this movie, yes, I know it was pretty far-fetched. There is no way Shelby's car can stay on the road, as well as the 540i with all its power steering and other gizmos, but unlike the whole movie is well-crafted. Cage was excellent as usual and the rest of the cast was also pretty good, except for the Brit Bad Guy, he was a little "too much" don't you think? Anyway, good movie, big cars and great acting. I made sure my car was locked and controlled at night. :)
