*** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> This movie always looks very exaggerated, until I remember my university campus having a former student-forced Nazi racist killer - who committed suicide. also: Benjamin Nathaniel Smith called him. <br /> <br /> look him up in the wikipedia- I added some photos to their article about him. <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe, but these things really happen. <br /> <br /> I'm not a big fan of Omar Epps or Ice Cube, but Larry Fishburne, Kristy Swanson, Jennifer Connelly and Mike Rappaport were good.
