It is a film that appears on the surface. It seems as if J.Edgar Hoover is giving him a big bunch to fight Klansmen, go to Indian killers, hunt the famous gangsters of the 1930s and fight Nazis in the US and South. America during World War 2 and Commissions in New York during the early 1950s. Of course, in 1959, we didn't know about Mr. Hoover's obsession with keeping secret files on honest Americans. He has people like Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., bent, but the worst love affair with his deputy director, Clyde Tolson (If you want to know more about the subject, I suggest you see the movie Citizen Cohn). Aside from Hoover, This story of a life in the FBI as told by Jimmy Stewart makes for a decent but dated movie. Vera Miles as his dedicated wife is also good. But Jimmy is the movie. As much as Hoover-controlled production and always made sure the FBI was seen without error, Jimmy Stewart gave the film a human side, a good performance as Hoover always looks over his shoulder. The background score is also enjoyable. I have read recent online articles indicating that this is a forgotten movie. Jimmy Stewart was one of the best movie stars of all time and none of his films should be forgotten. TCM was the last network to show it long ago and I hope they show it again.
