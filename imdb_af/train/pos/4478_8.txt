Overall, it's a lovely, light, romantic, musical comedy. I suppose a small matter can be made for the movie to be too long. But I'm not sure what you will cut out. The song that Kelly and Sinatra do? No. The fantastic dance Kelly does? No. The time the film takes to develop the story line and develop the relationships of characters? No (it often seems a common complaint that more recent movies don't develop the characters). <br /> <br /> Some comments that Iturbi didn't bring much to the movie, but it gives us the chance to see and hear a great talent from the 1040s. So what if he wasn't an actor? He was an important part of the movie as the basic plot to get Grayson an audition with him. <br /> <br /> Originally, Katherine Grayson wanted to be an opera star. Louis B. Mayer brought her to MGM for a screen test that included an aria. During her audition in the movie there is a shot of the MGM buyers who nod and smile. You might just think it was so when she made her previous screen test years before. <br /> <br /> This movie is so full of life that it's hard to beat all the highlights. Great use is made of color and lighting throughout the film. You can see why Frank Sinatra has become the star he did. A nice counterpoint in the movie is how Sinatra (a ladies man even) played the role of just finding a date on leave. You will feel good after watching this movie. 10/07
