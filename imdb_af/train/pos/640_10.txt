My sister and I saw the premiere last night. It was so good that we were glued to the whole thing. Hahaha. I think I'm addicted to the season !! .... they have some very good actors in this thing .. the head coach and the pete player was very good and the plot already got me, but i don't really understand how they do it for a will not last all season. There will probably be some big ones. turn it over. I can't wait until Tuesday. At last Jeremy sumpter who is he? I can say he will be big! He was so good that we immediately fell in love with his character .. can't wait for the next episode. GO Jeremy! <br /> <br /> 'Aimee
