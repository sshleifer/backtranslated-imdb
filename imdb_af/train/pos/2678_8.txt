Hey, I can't claim that all the movies of Jesse (Jesus) Franco have been seen, and there seems to be a lot of it, but it's one of the better (and more) of the fate I've seen. I would most likely have said that he was in his back in the late sixties / early seventies, and anything that has been strange to me lately, and it takes a lot of time for me to explain. Anyway, it's like a big bad dream where parts of it come to various points. This woman is an actress or something, acting in a theater in Berlin where acts of "false" torture are performed for an appreciative audience (?!) And it seems she is dreaming this problem. The catch to what is really and what is not in this movie is apparently the right thing is in sharp focus and the dream is not. She seems to be in a state of deja vu. I won't say it makes much sense, but it's pretty wild and strange and entertaining. Shots from Berlin make it look like a lonely and creepy place, so it adds to the atmosphere. However, the end is extremely sudden, the movie just ends and the band has turned black, I think you don't have to let it know that it was over at that stage. My copy was from the Anchor Bay Euro-Trash collection, and I say, give me more Euro-Trash, I can't get enough of that crap. But that's good crap.
