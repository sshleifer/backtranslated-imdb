it's not Bonnie and Clyde or Thelma and Louise, but it's a good road movie. it lights up its two main characters lightly and easily. viewers quickly learn the underlying tension, which is a tribute to the director. There is the young French (and English) speaking boy who wants to do well in France, have a French friend and drink alcohol, do parties like young men. And there is his Moroccan Arab (and French) -speaking Father persevering in his Muslim faith, with generosity and wisdom of elders, and rejecting the new culture that surrounds him (such as cell phones). the movie can explore very powerful politics - the strange couple riding through the former Yugoslavia, through Turkey and then through the Middle East to come to Mecca. these are areas where Muslim populations were involved in wars, oppression, ethnic cleansing; where dictators pursued torture and summary persecutions to maintain power and where religious communities are constantly fatally fighting. Yet the film moves through the sites and possibilities with only tips from such agendas. The relationship between the two is the key to this movie, and faith, politics is the backdrop. It seems that we are all human and need to understand and care for one another in this world. It's definitely not Natural Born Killers, and it's all better.
