This is a top Jackie Chan movie, due to the fantastic final and good humor, but otherwise it is nothing special. All the characters are pretty cool, and the movie is entertaining throughout, plus Jackie Chan is simply fantastic in this! Jackie and Wai-Man Chan had great chemistry together, and they are both very funny! And I thought the main opponent looked really threatening, but the dubbing was just awful! The character development is above average for this kind of thing, and the main battle is simply fantastic!, Plus some of the bumps Jackie takes in this one is hard! There is really really stupid and goofy humor in this, but it amused me, and the end is hilarious!, All the characters are very nice. It's pretty cheap, but generally very good, and while it's not the amount of fighting you'd expect from a Jackie Chan movie, it's enough to make you watch, plus one of my favorite moments in this movie is when Jackie Dragon and Wai-Man Chan (Tiger) play around with a gun and it goes down! It's a top Jackie Chan movie, due to the fantastic final, and good humor, but otherwise it's nothing good, but it's still worth it. The direction is good. Jackie Chan does a good job here with solid camera work, great angles and most of the movie at a fast pace. The Acting is very good! Jackie Chan is fantastic as always, and is wonderful here, he is very nice, hilarious, as usual some crazy stunts, fantastic chemistry with Wai-Man Chan, kicked that ass, and played this wonderful cock character. He was wonderful! , I just wanted them to stop copying him! (Jackie Rules !!!!!). Wai-Man Chan is funny as Jackie's best friend, I loved him very much, he is also a very good martial artist. The rest of the role play is OK, I think. Overall, the watch is worth it! *** out of 5
