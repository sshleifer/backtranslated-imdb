Well, it's about time. I really hoped there would be a striking episode among the entries this season. Although there have been too many attacks on Hohum entries, this episode has at least performed well. It is quite strange that director Rob Schmidt, who is just not bad, is wrong. Call his credit and author John Esposito, whose only essays have been included so far. Languages ​​Of The Mummy and Graveyard Shift should be the one that gives us the best written and most thoughtfulness. Challenging episode of the season. In "Right To Die" we are treated to the story of Cliff and Abbey. At the beginning of the episode, the couple had a conversation. Abbey caught Cliff fraud and he desperately tries to win her back. While talking, they find themselves in a car accident where Cliff is left with just scratches and bruises, but Abbey is thrown out of the car and taken captive when a spark ignites and petrol catching her has set her on fire . And it's just setting people up. Once in hospital, Cliff must decide whether Abbey should live in this condition, without skin and only nerve reflections. There is also a side effect. Every time its flat lines run, the abbey goes up as a ghost and runs it hard for all kinds of people. Hands afterwards are the best episode of the season and definitely ranks as one of the best episodes ever. I have never seen some of the horrific effects on the naughty scripts throwing in a few twists, and such a striking chance that you can almost touch them, Right To It must have the right to live forever.
