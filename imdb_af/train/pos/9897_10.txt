Good, sorry, but I loved this movie. I just love the whole 80's genre of this kind of movies, because you don't see much more like this one! I want to ask all of you what says this movie is just a rip-off, or a cheesy imitation, what does it imitate? I have never seen another movie like this one, well, not horror anyway. <br /> <br /> Basically, it's about the popular group in the school, who wants to make everyone's life live hell, so they decide to choose it. nerdy son named Marty. It gets deadly if he is really hurt by one of their little pranks. <br /> <br /> So, like ten years later, and the group of friends who hurt Marty, High School reunion letters start. But ... they are the only ones they receive! So they come back to the old school, and one by one is stopped by ....... Yes, you probably know what happens! <br /> <br /> The only part that disappointed me was the end. <br /> <br /> I think you should try it and try not to be critical! <br /> <br /> ~ * ~ CupidGrl ~ * ~
