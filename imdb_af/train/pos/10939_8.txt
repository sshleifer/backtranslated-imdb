The Five Deadly Venoms is a fantastic kung-fu action movie that is entangled in a frantic mystery. There are all the usual signs of a kung-fu movie: great choreography, terrible dubbing, different "styles" of battles, and a wide variety of exaggerated, often chaotic human emotions. However, the plot is definitely better than average. It's interesting and keep your attention through the non-combat scenes. Sometimes it can even set the audience on fire, such as when X character gets terrible injustice. <br /> <br /> Another thing I love about the Five Deadly Venoms is the beautiful simplicity of the movie's moral and themes. Just about everyone gets what comes to it. The cowardly, greedy and corrupt lost. The bad guys, who are consumed by selfish greed, are eventually destroyed by their own betrayal and backlog. The good guys use teamwork, planning and integrity to overcome and get the chance. <br /> <br /> Poison Clan Rocks!
