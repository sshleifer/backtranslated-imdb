I really liked Tom Barman's AWTWB. Just let it come over you and enjoy it while it's expensive and nothing to expect. It's like sitting on a cafeteria with a beer, in the summer, and watching the people go. It certainly won't reflect, it's true, but it's not a prerequisite for a good movie. This is just the experience of the movie that is good. <br /> <br /> I felt there were a few strings that could have been a bit more worked out, but being a Lynch fan doesn't matter much :) <br /> < br /> And I loved * the style or flair of this movie. It's smooth but fresh, and the soundtrack is a beauty. Any music lover will get his kicks from AWTWB, I can assure you. <br /> <br /> I give it 8 out of 10. <br /> <br /> (music mode 10 out of 10)
