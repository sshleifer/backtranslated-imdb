This show is wonderful. It has some of the best writing I've ever seen. It has a brilliant direction by Dvid Trainer, who also targets another smart television series called BOY MEETS WORLD. <br /> <br /> This show is one of the biggest without a thought. Like THREE'S COMPANY, ROSEANNE, and the well-known COSBY SHOW, it will be on television for a long time. <br /> <br /> Of these, perfectly crafted jokes to the great performances you'll just dream of are a great show. for people who lived in the 1970s and those who didn't. This show appeals to the young and the young of heart. A perfect show.
