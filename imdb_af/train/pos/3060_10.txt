It's always sad when "flank" movies like this are overlooked by moviegoers. "Panic" is a wonderful compelling study of a character who feels in the senselessness of his own life. <br /> <br /> Like William, William H. Macy is as convincing as ever. This fine actor seems to have a special talent to get to your heartbeat, no matter how flawed his characters may be; We can't always play the lifestyle of the protagonists he plays, but the emotions of fear and confusion he calls in us are often too painfully known. The title, "Panic", initially seems paradoxical, given the lack of open emotion. At one point, Alex tells his doctor that he seldom gets angry. Yet, as this story unfolds, it becomes increasingly apparent that anger and despair, not indifference, are the driving forces behind this man's existence. <br /> <br /> More than once I was reminded of his performance in "Fargo" Another strong character-driven movie. In both "Fargo" and "Panic" we are witnessing a middle-aged man who somehow lost sight of the rest of his life. He lost his way, and the only way to find it back is to be dark. He knows he makes bad choices, but despair drives self-control and common sense. <br /> <br /> Connected to Sarah, a 23-year-old woman (mesmerizing played by Neve Campbell), Alex meets in a doctor's office. Themselves, this union is less coincidence, more the work of fate. Alex finds some comfort in Sara, and feels that she is a co-hero, like him, who has lost her way and deliberately swung through the rest of her life, without power for his inevitable conclusion. <br /> <br /> Movie options like this are a cunning and convincing way for Neve Campbell to answer the critics who question her acting abilities. Too often it is the characters she played that are the weakness, and offers Campbell no depth to bend her acting muscles. However, this performance can be very much for an eye-catcher. <br /> <br /> In a perfect movie world there won't be more movies like Panic, but they will reach and be appreciated by a much larger audience. If you watch movies for the richness and depth of characterization, rather than just the latest latest special effects, then for you, "Panic" is essential. A +.
