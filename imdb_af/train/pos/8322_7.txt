IK is a cute romantic comedy with two great actors who look good on the screen. Plot is a typical man who is wrong for a girl, you get a girl's size, but make the point of love with the heart and not the mind. Addition of Albert Einstein and his genius group offers excellent comic relief. Overall, a good movie. Not great, but good
