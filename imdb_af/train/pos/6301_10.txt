I took part in a Filmmaker's Symposium, and this film was shown after we had already seen a not so good movie and participated in a 40 minute discussion. Although it was incredibly late and we were tired, the whole audience really enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> Personally, I thought the movie was hilarious in all the right places, and I loved the peculiar characters of characters. They really grow on you in the movie.
