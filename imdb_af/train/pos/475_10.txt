John Turturro once again proves his impressive Russian chess genius who is preparing for a return tournament. He forged an unlikely relationship with Emily Watson at an Italian hotel in 1920. They fall in love with the horror of her social mountaineering mother (Geraldine James). A wonderful love story whose shimmering sheen can make it cerebral. But in spite of its origins in a Nabakov story, it's certainly not. The romantic elements and the sense of time and place pushed the psychological analysis down. John Turturro, who appeared in Barton Fink, "Oh brother, where are you?" The Big Lebowski proves he is not dependent on Coen Bros films to claim his stature.
