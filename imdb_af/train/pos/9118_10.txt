I watched this movie with a special show of the work of Owen Alik Shahadah. It's so interesting where this man comes from. Now he is probably the most important independent African filmmaker in the world. And I'm not talking about black filmmakers. I'm talking about filmmakers rooted in culture. The idea of ​​witnessing the variety and variety of African themes, with its film 500 years later, is an African issue. But the idea doesn't fit that form. Show the artistic diversity. The movie is a whole African cast, but the subject is a human subject that most of us can talk about. I just like the soft comedy in it. And the Kora of Tunde Jegede is just amazing, it's really an art house jewels.
