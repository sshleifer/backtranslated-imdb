The quote I used for my summary is about halfway through THE GOOD EARTH, as a Chinese revolutionary army captain (played by Philip Ahn) apologizes to a crowd for not having more time to shoot from the looters among them. was just recalled to the front lines. Of course, the next author found and shot is the main character of the film, the former kitchen slave girl O-Lan (whose performance Luise Rainer, now 99 years old, won her second consecutive best actress Oscar.). <br /> <br /> The next scene, O-Lan conscientiously finds his pocket looted jewelery by her undervalued husband, farmer Wang Lung (Paul Muni), who is the classic dichotomy of a man's upward financial mobility. the direct reverse of his moral decline. <br /> <br /> For a movie dealing with topic, including slavery, false accusations, misconception, famine, domestic invasion, family animals, spiritual delay, child murder, exploited refugees, riots, civil war, summary of mass street performances bigamy, child reports, adultery, incest and insect pests of biblical relationships. THE GOOD EARTH is a surprising heart-warming movie. <br /> <br /> My secretive thought is in the form of another classic quote, from O-Lan himself (while the precious soup leg her son just stole from an old woman back in the cooking pot after Wang Lung threw it on the ground floor on the other side of their hut): "Meat is meat."
