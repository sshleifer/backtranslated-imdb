I thought the whole movie was beautiful with fresh images and interesting movie art. The actors were on top of their character's back in almost perfect timing and looked good. The music was lazy and well thought out. It even had a decent turn of an end. So, what does that matter to everyone? The story was not quite fresh (felt like a remnant of 'Running Man' with the whole TV idea), but the attitude towards Christianity and Judaism about how the public chose their Messiah was definitely true. It was sensible to follow this one man who was seated in front of a modern crowd and put him on a pedestal because of his opportunity. <br /> <br /> It is possible that Christians or other religious people pick it up because the movie The Word "God" in it, but it shows what the filmmakers are trying to do is teach people who might not have seen the world so did not, especially in the modern world where Christianity increasingly accepted and forgotten about by some. <br /> <br /> I've given it a 7/10 star here on IMDb. I thought every ounce of the movie was entertaining and original, for the most part. See if you are not insulted to see an entertaining movie from Madrid, Spain, about the possibilities of the upcoming modern Messiah to a TV near you.
