When I think of this movie, all the adjectives that somehow relate to are related to the physical appreciation of the world. Texture, smell, color, that's how I think this movie should be judged in terms of. See the rich golden tones around the young concubine sleeping at the fireplace or the swarming Turkish bath, flooding your senses with impressions of spices, coarse cloth, smooth skin, scented oils, flickering flames, satin rust. Don't just look and listen, be absorbed, let the dreamy voice of the narrator comfort you.
