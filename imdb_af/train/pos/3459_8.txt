Together with Patrick McGoohan and Robert Culp, Jack Cassidy was an iconic Columbo villain. The first "proper" episode of Columbo, following two detached pilots, "Murder By The Book", is not far from classical status. <br /> <br /> Jack Cassidy plays Ken Franklin, half a murder mystery writing partnership. His partner Jim is the talented, while Ken has no more talent than the gift's gift and a skill to promote the books. Once Jim decides he no longer needs Ken's marketing skills, Ken knows a plot to kill Jim. Besides being a new plot, it is actually the real-life implementation of a murder story originally intended for one of their books. <br /> <br /> It doesn't take long for Columbo to figure out that Ken is the killer, but unfortunately another murder must take place (Know romance and then kill a major witness) before Columbo has enough evidence to " to acquire a conviction. <br /> <br /> Nothing at all wrong with "Murder By The Book", but it's not quite up to it. I'll just give 'Publish or Perish' the edge on this: both episodes have Jack Cassidy and the world of publication, but 'Publish or Perish' is a fraction more tense and unpredictable. But it's still a big episode.
