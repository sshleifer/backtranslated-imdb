Excellent as the typical TV movie, INVITATION TO HELP is blessed with excellent casting (Urich, Lucci, Cassidy, McCarthy, Joe Murray Brown Joe Regalbuto, Soleil Moon-Frye) and a high draft update to the well-known Faustian plot. . Urich is nice as always and Lucci fetches especially in the mother of all femme-deadly roles. Kind of a hybrid version of STEPFORD WIVES and THEY LIVE, the film starts early in its apocalyptic Miltonesque vision and horror fans are unlikely to have many complaints about the gritty, maudlin deno. 10/07
