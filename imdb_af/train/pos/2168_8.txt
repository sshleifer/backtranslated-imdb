I saw this movie on television late one night ago, but it was a disturbing experience that stayed with me to this day. <br /> <br /> The premise may seem a bit irreversible - due to an earthquake, a hidden underground storage of a poisonous nerve agent in the hills above a small town, and a microscopic amount of the dust finds their way in their food supply. The town's residents are beginning to lose their ability to exercise restraint on every aspect and basic desire that drives our minds from time to time, and what we normally know is simply not to be addressed. <br /> <br /> The pace of the movie is slow, but for me it's just what I add to the creepy discomfort as the townspeople's behavior slowly begins to unravel. There are several surrealistic and very disturbing scenes that have been labeled in my memory all this time. <br /> <br /> It raises interesting questions about what we all would be able to give to our most wanted instincts. Did I enjoy it? I'm not sure, 'enjoy' is the right word. Did it make me think? Definitely. I still think about it. Scary things.
