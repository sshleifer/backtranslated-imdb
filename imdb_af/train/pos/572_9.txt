Responding to the person who commented on how the film went and what believed, there was no purpose for the role of Jess's brother. Here's my answer: <br /> <br /> The role of Jess's brother is a form of dramatic irony in the story. Craig Sheffer / Norman could have provided the living-life issues by looking at how Jess's brother turned out. There are several cases where Brad Pitt and his lives run parallel, for example, when Jess's brother Craig Sheffer takes to a stand-alone bar, and later he finds Brad Pitt there a few days later. The dramatic irony was there, so Craig Sheffer's character would have a greater emotional turmoil at his brother's death, knowing he could have done more to prevent it and then create a more compelling movie mood.
