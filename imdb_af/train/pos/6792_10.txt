I remember this game. It always sat alone on the shelves, until one day I decided to try something new for a change, and got this game. I was upset about this because it was the first PS1 I owned to have 4 slides. When I played it, I couldn't seriously put the controller down. <br /> <br /> The storyline of this game is as good and twisted, it's almost as good as the Final Fantasy VII storyline, and it's hard to reach. If you play the game, you get so involved with the characters, it's amazing that it's just a PS1 game, as it feels like a movie. And I believe it should be made in a movie. <br /> <br /> Bad, this game is a very unheard of game and hardly anyone played or liked it, as it is one of those games that puts the ends of the shelves, with a 50% ticking off, trying to sell. Well, I'm one of those people who always look at one side and try them out and most of them seem to be very good. Heck, that's how I looked at the final Fantasy VII, looked in a catalog and found it. But it's different from Final Fantasy. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, Legend of Dragoon is the only game or RPG that is better than most Square Enix games. I won't be surprised if it is made by Square Enix, but it's not. Almost any games I play are better than the Final Fantasy series, or the Dragon Quest series, but this one is. But what is wrong with me is why it is very little known and not praised, what it should be. <br /> <br /> Graphics are pretty good for a PS1 game, but what can you expect from it? This is the PS1 man made in 1999. The story I already mentioned is wonderful, almost knocking VII. Characters are great, you get so much with them and their actions. <br /> <br /> A certain 10 out of 10. Definitely deserve more praise, and a very well done RPG by another company than Square Enix.
