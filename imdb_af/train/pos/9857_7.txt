While I loved this movie, the trailers that spread the internet this year before it hit the theaters, made my expectations a little high. <br /> <br /> I own the DVD, don't misunderstand me, I don't say don't watch it or even buy it! It's just that I still think the first scene was the best, and nothing throughout the film ever used it.
