Why am I so convinced there is actually another movie version of this novel out there? I saw the film again this year while learning the novel and finding the changes in the movie annoying. There is no appearance of the little boy in the novel and the end has changed. They kill him in the movie, but the whole point is that he has been pursuing the events at Eel Marsh House for many years, but it does itself again and puts the events behind him. Mr. Bentley is a much more sympathetic character in the novel. The scene in the movie where Kipps set fire to the office is clear, and the constant appearance of the toy soldier to indicate the presence of the child is really creepy but useless - Kipps are played by the woman who is revenge looking, not the child. I'm sure I've seen a movie that is better and closer to the novel and actually scarce. Did I just suggest it?
