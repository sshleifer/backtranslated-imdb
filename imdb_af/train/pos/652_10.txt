this movie is so complex that it can be given any description and still play with it. You have an unsafe, upset and fascinating main character (played by Jean-Pierre Leud) caught between two (no, three) women. we listen to his social, philosophical and moral idiosyncrasies in interminable monologues, we see that he works his magic around the three women he loves. It could be the starting point for a bird movie, full of sturdy, cold, uninteresting commentaries. but director Jean Eustache manages to keep it fresh, ironic and spiritual. To be such a long movie, you can't just be lazy, after Jean-Pierre Leaud shouted suddenly after 2 hours of talk while remembering a cute movie line. These kinds of situations are purely cinematographic and cannot be fully restored in a comment. No one can restore the tragic and painfully beautiful monologue from Fran√ßoise Lebrun to the end of the movie. 3 and 1/2 hours and every minute.
