I recently found this movie on VHS after watching it for a number of years. I was not disappointed. It gets better every time I see it. Peter Ustinov stars and wrote the original script (nominated for an Oscar). Other stars you've heard of include Karl Malden, Bob Newhart and Cesar Romero. Ustinov plays an accountant / blackmailer, who has just been released from England's infamous Wormwood Scrubs prison (he has darkened the Conservative Party's headquarters because he is a liberal). He immediately began a search for a new employer from whom he could darken, and discovered that computers were the wave of the future. He made social engineers his way to a London men's club and taught the identity of the best computer experts in town. He steals the identity of one Caesar Smith who has just left the town for South America to practice his hobby to collect game moths. . He talks his way to Ta-Can-Co, a US conglomerate led by Carlton Klemper (Karl Malden). Climbs rent Smith and shows him around the computer center, especially his security feature which consists of a flickering blue light. Ustinov asks the computer how to defeat his security and the computer tells him: "Disconnect blue light." Using hacking techniques from the age of 30 in the future, Ustinov breaks into the system and programming the computer checks to write written to several fake companies. The scheme begins to unravel when Clerk's assistant Willard G. Gnatpole (Bob Newhart) takes note of the amount of business that Ta-Can-Co appears to have with Ustinov's scam companies. With the help of his secretary Patty Terwilliger (Maggie Smith), Ustinov manages to avoid persecution and he remains happy. To tell you how will this very funny, romantic, intelligent and pre-time picture spoil.
