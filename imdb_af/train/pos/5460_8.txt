Lily Powers works on a speakeasy until her father dies. She then goes to New York to work at an office building. It is noted that if she wants to get higher, she must give the men what they want. And what men want is her ... well, you know. Alfred E. Green's Baby Face (1933) is a movie of high sexual content. For a movie of that era, anyway. It was one of the last Pre-Code movies made. Stanwyck gives a very sexy show as Lily. Other role players include George Brent (Courtland Trenholm), Donald Cook (Ned Stevens), Alphonse Ethier (Adolf Cragg), Henry Kolker (JPCarter), Margaret Lindsay (Ann Carter) and Theresa Harris (Chico). The young John Wayne is seen as Jimmy McCoy Jr. This film is about a brave subject and it does well. Baby Face is historically significant film and therefore good to watch.
