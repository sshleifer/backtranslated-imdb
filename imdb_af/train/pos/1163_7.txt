This film was released by Roger Corman so you know the filmmakers didn't have much money to work with. <br /> <br /> Although some viewers may miss the subtleties of this movie because of the very typical "obsession" <br /> <br /> AMANDA, as played by the naturally talented Justine Priestley, is a complex character. Some people like these movies just because the violence is random, but here are the effects of past abuse (treated in a realistic but tasteful way) that form the psychosis of AMANDA. Surprisingly, Amanda redeems herself at the end with a love act, where most of these movies are changed in the typical, battle to death and the evil character dies just as angry at the end as to begin with. <br /> <br /> Some rough sides in this picture, but I have to give it 7 out of 10 stars based on its thoughtfulness and yes, originality compared to the usual - especially on a budget.
