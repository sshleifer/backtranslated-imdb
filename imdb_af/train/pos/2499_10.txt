This movie was incredible. It had an original concept (that of a vampire movie meets Yakuza bully). It's a humorous yet highly dramatic and tragic film about friendship, love, immortality, death and happiness, and reacts subtly to society. On the side of Gackt Camui, the role of Sho is rendered excellent, and HYDE was surprisingly good for his first film as the tortured but humorous vampire, Kei. I also laughed and cried for the happy character, Toshi, who grew up with Sho. I loved this movie every second, especially moments like the funny cigarette scene, the fighting tones, and above all the heartbreaking end.
