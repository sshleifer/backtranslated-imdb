Exciting drama of four men on a canoe weekend along a remote river. They are pacifist Ed (Jon Voight), adventurous, violent Lewis (Burt Reynolds), unpleasant Bobby (Ned Beatty) and nice old Drew (Ronny Cox). The first 40 minutes are great - there are the amazing twin banjos sequence, interesting interplay between characters and just a beautiful widescreen cinematography by Vilmos Zsigmond. Then two hills fall to Ed and Bobby. One of them rapes Bobby ... and the journey becomes a nightmare. <br /> <br /> Just incredible. The scenery is incredibly beautiful, but this terrible violence takes place. To be honest, Beatty's rape never bothered me - I am well aware that it has failed despite the good acting. This movie also shows how the characters change. Ed tested his pacifism, Lewis became weak, Bobby was being violated by one of the people he had mocked earlier and Drew was trying to keep him healthy. The direction of John Boorman is also very assured and the sounds of the forest and the river help the mood great. <br /> <br /> The acting is usually good. Voight is just fine - he's better. Beatty is also just OK - but it's his debut movie and he's brave to play such a risky role. Cox is very good, especially when things fall apart. And Reynolds is just fantastic - one of his best acting works, EVER! How it was even nominated for an Academy Award escapes me. Bill McKinney and Herbert Coward are too credible as the hills. <br /> <br /> A powerful movie - NOT for children. Try to see an unencrypted version - the TV version is slaughtered. It is also essential to view the box, to capture the stunning images.
