I brought this movie back to the Palm Springs International Film Festival in 2005 and of the 14 movies I saw there, I would consider it my # 3 movie. I had an initial interest in seeing it myself from Swedish ancestry with many of my ancestors coming from the Norrland region of Sweden where it was filmed. Also, I grew up in an area of ​​rural North Forest America where many small towns were much like setting up this movie. It is nice to see more movies by using rural places than their institutions such as Soom in Heaven. It was a very good movie and I'm probably a very hard film to go along with his big ensemble cast, but Director Kay Pollock really pulled it off after almost two decades of absence. Helen Sjoholm in her film debut as an actress was fantastic and I would look forward to more of her on the big screen. I enjoyed Michael Nyqvist in the lead of this well-rounded role. I recommend this movie and rate it a 9.0 on a scale of 10.
