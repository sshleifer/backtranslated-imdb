Forget Neo and Bourne and everyone who has half-baked made modern heroes. They only look 12 years old to please the wide audience of geeks who want to be their heroes. Being unable to be Rambo or McClane or even Indiana Jones, Hollywood welcomes a bunch of fakes that have no beard and teenagers yet to look like something that looks like an action movie. <br /> <br /> But their "action pieces" are just painful to watch and any girl may challenge their masculinity without problems. This explains the recrudescence of oldies on our silver screens over the past few years. For better (Rocky, Rambo) or worse (Die Hard 4 - where John McClane, brace yourself .... has no beard!) <br /> <br /> I say it's high time a new hero walked up and let their dominion come to an end. This "Largo Winch" movie is far from perfect, and perhaps too predictable, but at least Tomer Sisley did a very promising performance as an action hero. And the only time he'd weakened was when MÃ©lanie Thierry shaved his beard! I rest my case. <br /> <br /> I didn't know when I got into the theater room, but it may have been the movie I've been waiting for a decade. For the first time in France since Belmondo, a movie can be both remodeled and rooted in B-genre without blushing on its performance. Meanwhile, everything we had to chew was a huge stack or something to reach a wider audience. In other words, it was "Le Pacte des Loups" or "Dobermann" (I like Dobermann, think of you) ... I believe "Largo Winch" has everything needed to be both popular and quality filmmaking. <br /> <br /> I was thrilled and hungry for the theater room.
