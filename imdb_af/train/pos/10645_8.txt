Adolf Hitler's manic desire to impose his will on the rest of the world is the subject of this second in a seven-part series of films produced by the American War Department as an instructional tool for new soldiers during the World War II entered the Army. Hitler's plan was methodical and well thought out, starting with the conquest of Eastern Europe, expanding into the European heartland and then into the 'World Island', consisting of Europe, Asia and Africa. His final move would be to come across the oceans for the ultimate conquest of the Americas and the world. <br /> <br /> In 1935, Hitler received a national command, as the rest of the country fell under his evil. Grade school children praised his praise, and young German boys received training and indoctrination in military camps. Hitler followed undisputedly in Austria in 1938 and followed Hitler with a strip of land which had complemented Germany and Czechoslovakia, called Sudetenland. In 1939 Hitler took all Czechoslovakia. Later in the year, the world was astounded to learn that Germany had signed a non-aggression pact with the mortal enemy Russia, an attempt to delay Hitler's military involvement on too many fronts. Immediately afterwards, Germany invaded Poland, which hit Hitler's conquest right on Russia's threshold. He would go with her later. <br /> <br /> It was during this period that Britain still refused to resist Hitler's push over Europe. Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain felt he had won a great victory for his country by accepting a treaty with Germany, his notorious statement saying "Peace in our time." It didn't turn out that way. <br /> <br /> At least, the most fascinating information to be learned from this installment is provided by a small piece of footage from a German pro Hitler rally in the mid-30's. It was led by German Americans coming directly from the homeland. The Place - Madison Square Garden!
