A beautiful movie, especially if you like horses, WWII movies and the tough Hungarian Plateau. ' A story of courage, compassion and loyalty that exceeds generations. The horse riding is spectacular as well as the main characters' horse in its own training. <br /> <br /> I'll buy this movie and watch it again. It's a family movie and I highly recommend it. A good "Family Nite" movie. Although there are some violent scenes, it was the Nazi occupation of Hungary. The indigenous people were very interesting in the way they stood their ground even in the face of certain deaths of a Nazi officer who had his own personal reasons to hunt Brady. A hauntingly beautiful movie.
