Take this movie for what it is, not a remake, but a completely different approach to the same concept. It's not an epic like the original, it's more of a popcorn player. Visually, it's incredible. Everything else was just OK. <br /> <br /> For what it is, I think the movie is great, but I love everything Burton did. People need to calm down and stop acting like it's the end of the world b / c of this movie. It wasn't supposed to be a remake, and it wasn't. <br /> <br /> The end was cool. . I took it as a parallel universe.
