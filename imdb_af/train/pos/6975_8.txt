If I only saw the pilot of this show, I would have classified it a 10. I was immediately addicted to this wonderful new world. Subsequent episodes did not live up to the promise, but I will continue to look and hope it will get better. The production values ​​are incredible and the acting is the first time. I don't mind, it doesn't seem perfect to fit in with BSG, because I'm so intrigued by the premise and let's face it, they're two different shows. I am excited that both Esai Morales and one of my all-time faves, Eric Stoltz, are back in my life (if only weekly) as I missed both of them. It's a show that needs a little thought from its audience and it's always a good thing. You need to wrap your head around certain aspects of the display; things are not always like them and there are definitely shades of gray, literally and figuratively, in plot lines, characters and of course the various virtual worlds. We all know how it ends, but the journey is in search of a fair ride.
