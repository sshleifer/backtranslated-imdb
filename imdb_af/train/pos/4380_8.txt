This is a very good, subordinate action / drama / and slightly historical film. <br /> <br /> The basic story is about Rob Roy's 1000 pound loan, his theft and the problems it causes for his family and indirectly his clans. <br /> <br /> Cunningham (Tim Roth) is a wonderful villain and character in this story. Brutally cold, and when you look at his face, it looks like he can turn his eyes and look completely angry. <br /> <br /> Rob Roy (Liam Neeson) is also excellent, but I think the authors use the word "honor" 1 too many times. <br /> <br /> The rest of the role is strong, and the whole movie is very well acted and filmed. <br /> <br /> The action is exciting and the sword game is very realistic but not too stingy. The story is good and you really want Rob to win. <br /> <br /> All in all, ashamed of a classic.
