As I saw the movie, I was very shocked to see the 60's over. I know I might be wrong about some things, but the 60s seem to have really affected people of the time. Some people said they would like to go back to the 60's. From what I saw, I'd say yes to the excitement and no to the outcome. But this is my opinion.
