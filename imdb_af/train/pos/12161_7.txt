From the author of "What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?" and "Hush .. Hush, Sweet Charlotte," this end of the sixties horror cycle has a bit of fun and fun. Micheál Macliammóir does a little Victor Buono type, but too often the film becomes dangerously close to a bad musical ... there is a particularly terrible child consideration about half way. Debbie taps, tangos and tricks on a lay Harlow, while Winters's religious fanatic has a lesbian edge for her. Agnes Moorehead controls as an evangelist. Weaver has nothing to do - and even has to pay a gigolo to dance with Debbie.
