Very well done and haunting horror movie of the poverty-driving movie company PRC which usually brings out cashy films like DEVIL BAT or THE FLYING SERPENT. German publishing director Wisbar wonders with a small budget and his studio-based swamp set. Gaunt and ghoulish Charles Middleton are effective as the Strangler.
