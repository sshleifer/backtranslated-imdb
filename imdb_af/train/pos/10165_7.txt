Actually, my voice is a 7.5. Anyway, the movie was good, it has those funny parts it deserves to see it, don't misunderstand me, is not the funniest movie of the world, and it's not even original because it is an idea we've seen before. Other movies, but this one has its own taste, a friend of mine told me it was a movie for boyfriends. I don't think exactly, but who cares? There's also another movie that shows us the very same topic, Chris Rock appears in it, the name is Down to Earth, men, one is a very funny movie, both see if you want and I know you'll agree that Mr. Rock won with his movie. I would like the main character to be given male character to Ashton Kutcher, but the movie is good.
