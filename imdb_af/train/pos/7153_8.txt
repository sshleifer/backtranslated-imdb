My wife is a teacher and she is very familiar with the story and has read it for several of her lessons. It never sounded interesting to me, and I bought the DVD, it would be a movie that would not really have risen to me. <br /> <br /> The first half of the movie has a lot of intent and I thought I was right. It started a bit slow and I had to admit that I was a bit bored - but curious enough to stick to it. Son, I'm glad I did because it was a very satisfying and rewarding movie. I will definitely see it again! <br /> <br /> The casting was very good. Since I didn't read the book, I can't be accurate, but I have to say that Jon Voight was really delicious. You like the characters you were supposed to keep, hate the one you were supposed to hate and laugh at those who were supposed to be funny. <br /> <br /> I can see how some people may not like this movie. . It is sometimes boring, especially in the beginning. All flashbacks can be distracting (though essential to the story). As soon as the story comes to an end, I think you are repaid in the spades for your patience. When everything is said and done, I think it's a very good movie - 8/10. <br /> <br />
