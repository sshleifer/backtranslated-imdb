Happy to our Real McCoy fans (probably all Baby Boomers who grew up in the late 50s and 60s), three of the adult actors / actress appeared when they did the reunion program in 2000. Tony Martinez and Richard Crenna both died shortly afterwards. As good as it was to see Luke, Sugar-Babe and Pepino together again, was it as mysterious about the complete absence of any mention of Lydia Reed and Michael Winkleman? It's my understanding that Little Luke died in 1999, but I don't know how. There is no information about Hassie on the internet I can find. Very curious why they weren't even mentioned? It was so striking, their absence from the Reunion show, that I suspect the family of Michael and Lydia himself (if still alive), 1) asked to be left out of the discussion, and therefore their desire was granted, or 2) TNN could find no trace of either Michael or Lydia (like the rest of us), they disappeared. Therefore, it would be the safest policy to leave them all out of the conversation. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, the look back at Walter Brennen was great. They made no bones about it ... it was grandpa who made the show so successful. I remember, like a child, walking grandmother's gimp step and laughing at my parents (as I am sure, a million other kids had that). One annoyance that bothered me a bit was Richard Crenna's tendency to dominate the discussion ... and sometimes Tony and Kathleen interrupted to make a point. In fact, although Tony Martinez was quite able to contribute to the conversation, he couldn't speak and say too much during the Reunion show. Unfortunately, because I also wanted to hear from all three. All in all, the Reunion Show was a real surprise to me. I've watched it on DVD several times and enjoyed it every time. <br /> <br /> Dodgerdude
