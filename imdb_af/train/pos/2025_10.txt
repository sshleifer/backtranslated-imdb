Anne Brontes epic novel THE TENANT VAN WILDFELL HALL must be studied and read by schools and libraries and people's living rooms. It is a fantastic story and tells the "real" truth about alcoholism and devastated marriages and a mothers fight to keep her son away from her cruel man. She's so stories today that we see and hear and I believe people can learn a lot about reading this book. Based on possible true experiences the writer returned in the 1840s. <br /> <br /> Don't see this movie, it's a good version of the book and is indeed moving a lot. I'm sure Anne would have been happy with the way it was produced. <br /> <br /> Excellent acting and good places.
