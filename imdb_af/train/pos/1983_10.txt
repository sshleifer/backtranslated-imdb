I recently saw it on a cable channel. The movie is wonderful; This is one of the few musicals I have seen that does not shrink from the light and dark. It shows some of the beauty of old age with lots of villain. Some of the set-piece dance series are so up and running, I didn't know where to look. One day I'll see it on the big screen, just so I see what happens. But what really is on another level is Oliver Reed's performance as Bill Sykes. Not only is a thorough deceitful man, but there is something else, some inner demons. He gave me the impression that if you pushed him into a corner, he was able to do anything. It was almost as if the Sykes character was on the verge of madness, waiting just for the trigger. I saw the Robert Newton's Bill Sykes of the 1948 movie, and I thought he was a bad egg, but Oliver Reed's performance intimidated me in my own lounge.
