While in a plane flying through the huge selection of movies, I got Live! almost by accident. oh boy! what a choice. <br /> <br /> I remember vaguely seeing the fan over a year ago and totally forgot that it didn't expect more than a stocking nonsense film about a stupid reality show. Now I can easily say this is a nice ride. I don't remember the last time I was so excited. Not sure if it plays the high altitude with my senses, but the voltage gradually grows through the film to a climax where you can't turn off the screen, literally sit on the edge of your seat and bite the remaining nails have you. <br /> <br /> You first go to a personal moral assessment of where you stand about the fairness of the show. You will drift away from the idea "how can man be so dirty" to "why not?" Ask yourself if you would. Then learn about the participants, their motives and start guessing. You will then see the competitor dressing the trigger one by one and getting excited, although you know the first candidate is safe. <br /> <br /> Good acting, good direction, with a movie experience reminiscent of the old movies where you knew what would happen in the next scene but still more sought after. <br /> <br /> * Spoilers * Few things I would have changed: <br /> <br /> - the decisive contestants. I was really moved by the farmer and we had to do a little more like he did. The idea of ​​a rich writer who wants to be famous is a bit stupid, it feels like you don't care about some of the participants. Although this could be done in the right way, I think the audience should be able to associate with the majority of participants. - game rules, a big mistake: <br /> <br /> What happens if the 5th contestants don't die when he pulls the trigger. do you seriously think the last standing man will pull the trigger and run himself !!! they had to give a chance to all participants to live, that is, when the 5th is also empty, no one dies. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, I'm not too bothered by these bad points, because I'm really having a good time. I just wish I had popcorn with me!
