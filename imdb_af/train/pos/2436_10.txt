In general, I like something nice and fun, so this movie should not have addressed me. But it grabbed me from the beginning. The story of a family's choices and challenges seems obvious, but it raises the question over and over: "What if it's my family, my choice?" I cried and laughed when they did, because I really felt what the people were feeling. It was hard to watch, but harder to turn away. The story is true, and life is sometimes difficult to see! It shows what filmmakers can do without sex, violence or special effects: A good story is a good story. The best and most unpredictable stories are all truths. Like real life, you really don't know what will happen next, or why people do the things they do!
