Rarely do I seldom see a movie that I am completely worried about; it was one of them. It had good acting, dialogue, plot and the scenery was beautiful. I often laughed aloud, especially the kitchen attack scene. The slapstick comedy performed by the lunkhead-hired hand had me one floor, but I admit I'm a sucker for slapstick. The story returned over a group of people in their 30s to a summer camp that they attended 20 years earlier. It was a separation week of camp, as the place would be permanently closed at the end of the season. As adults, the camp looks different and they feel differently about each other. I recommend this funny, moving movie to everyone. <br /> <br />
