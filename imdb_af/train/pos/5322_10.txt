A real dark noir movie and a lot of graphic film, nice storyline of a man who pursued salvation. It may have just been left too late. Visually, there are some very beautiful scenes that are artistically amazing about what can be done with a minimal budget. Full points for Gareth Maxwell Roberts and team, I look forward to the next project with new ideas, although hopefully more British actors will be great. Lisa Ray looks nice, hasn't seen her yet and hopes to see her again in the future. Subject all interesting sex, drugs and violence. Bring it on. I will definitely rent this one and see if you're in the mood for a semi-moody noir.
