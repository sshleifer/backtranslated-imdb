The material in this documentary document is so powerful that it led me to tears. Yes, I tell you tears. This popular struggle of a traditionally exploited population must inspire us all to stand up for our rights, to benefit the greater benefit of the community, and to stop making false excuses not to challenge the establishment. Chavez represents the poor and unhappy in the same way. Bush is the face of dirty corporations and capitalism ran amok. Indeed, Latin America is being restated and the marginalized majority has a voice in five centuries. Although, in the case of Mexico, the election was clearly stolen by Calderon. Chavez is not perfect, far from it. He is trying to change the constitution to rule him indefinitely. It can't be tolerated. Enough with politics and back to the movie; The pace is breathtaking at moments, and deep philosophies from others. It portrays Chavez as a popular hero who is not afraid to challenge the American hegemony and domination of the world's resources. If you think the author is biased in favor of Chavez, don't mind doing your homework. One important message from the film is the questioning of information sources, as apparently demonstrated by the victims found innocent of Chavez's supporters. Venezuela is embarrassing US alleged democracy. Hasta la revolucion siempre!
