Authors Perry and Randy Howze made a very interesting story in "Chances Are". <br /> <br /> By the idea of ​​a reincarnated man returning to his former wife's house many years later, the plot takes unexpected, glorious turns. <br /> <br /> Twenty-four years old Robert Downey, Jr. delivers a great show, with the help of Cybil Shepherd as the widow and Ryan O'Neal as a good friend. <br /> <br /> This trio has just the right chemistry for this little girl, playing one another with a graceful style. I watched this movie on television a few times, and each time it has the most pleasure.
