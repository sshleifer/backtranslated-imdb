The beautiful Danish actress Sonja Richter steals this movie under the nose of everyone, not a little thing in the light of the fantastic performances that surround her. <br /> <br /> Richter plays Anna, an out-of-work, independent, somewhat neurotic (and perhaps suicidal) actress who is desperately looking for a wheelchair-bound, muted, older father, called Walentin (the big Danish actor Frits Helmuth, who died 77 shortly after the film. <br /> <br /> SPOILER ALERT <br /> <br /> Walentin refuses to respond to anyone - until he confronts the gifted Anna, whose whimsical and ominous way brings the poor, old, cracked devil from a self-imposed death sentence. /> <br /> Author / director / actor Eric Clausen made a strong film about the trouble a particular businessman's son (Jorgen, played by Clausen), loves a father who has never accepted him. The film ends in the end, but Clausen has some important things to say about euthanasia, the nature and value of love and care, and how one person, the irreconcilable Anna, can change the course of human life. Highly recommended. Sonja Richter's performance is just the admission price.
