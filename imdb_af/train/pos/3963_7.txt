The history of the FBI, as from Agent Stewart via flashbacks, is intertwined with his personal life story. Stewart and Miles (as his wife) are pretty good, just like Hamilton as a serious agent. The problem is that the episodic nature of the story makes it difficult to get involved. It's like watching bits of a dozen different movies as we get a smile from whose gangsters are thrown. Some of the episodes are too long, some too short, and some just seem to be out of place (Stewart's daughter's school series). Overall, it's going to be too long. Nevertheless, it is a glimpse of its spectacular production values.
