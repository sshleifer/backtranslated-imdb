Zombi 3 has an interesting history in making it. First, it is a successor to Fulci's hit Zombi 2, with Zombi 2 himself obviously a marketing effort to trick people into thinking it was a sequel to George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead aka Zombi. Confused enough? In fact, none of the films have anything to do with each other, but they care about them when they make money. I think Fulci himself didn't care about the production about halfway through Zombi 3 when he decided to leave. Bruno Mattei was brought on board to help the film with extra scenes to extend the running time. <br /> <br /> Zombi 3's plot is your typical zombie prize. Scientists develop a serum on an island in the Philippines, terrorists steal it to unleash a plague, and the zombie runs amok. The scientists want to create an antidote, while the army is trying to cut everyone off without prejudice. There are also short entries from a Radio DJ preaching on how we treat the planet. <br /> <br /> Overall, I really liked this movie. I heard terrible things, but I find the goofy dialogue very enjoyable. The movie looks like it's an attempt to raise awareness about pollution, damaged military people, man who plays God, etc. To get. I felt that it was a serious movie at one stage, but it came in a strange direction, presumably when Mattei boarded it. . <br /> <br /> Except for the other zombie movie, it reminds a lot of Romero's The Crazies. You hear the Radio DJ breaking the good news: "If you see the men in white suits and gas masks, they run for help." Of course, it is played to the images of the men in white who fall under zombies. Later they straighten a scene from Crazies in which one of the regular, uncontaminated people is accidentally murdered. <br /> <br /> The gore factor is pretty good in this one with zombie hordes around every corner. How is it cool? Let me count the roads? 1. Zombie Birth 2. Flying Zombie Head 3. Zombie Birds. 4. Zombie with no legs swimming in a pool. My favorite zombie was the machete-wielding maniac at the petrol station. He was a bad ass and tore almost the whole building to kill a girl. <br /> <br /> Favorite quotation ?? When a sergeant insists on crushing a zombie, the scientists ask: "Don't you think that when the ash is in the air, it falls to the ground and pollutes everything?" Then the Sargeant immediately replied, "Now you're talking science fiction." He also mentions the "Science Fiction" that scientists have been told, even at the end when everyone dies. <br /> <br /> Extras: Gallery, Trailers and Interviews, especially the one with Matthew where he insists he targets 40% of the screens, but can't remember some important information. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: A must see for zombie and Fulci fans. <br /> <br /> Rating: 7/10 <br /> <br /> Molly Celaschi www.HorrorYearbook.com MySpace.com/HorrorYearbook
