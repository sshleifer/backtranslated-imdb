My brother took this movie home from the rental shop and I remember it being such a drill. I think the title particularly deterred me. I can never remember starting a movie with such low expectations and winning so completely. I watched the movie twice before getting my brother back to the store. It is very rare for a movie to speak to me as he did. I was totally trapped in Ruby's situation while trying to make her through her life. The bad thing about this movie is that it ends so soon. I could watch for hours. Another disadvantage is that I'm dissatisfied with everything Ashley Judd has done since. She is so perfect in this movie. This movie is easy in my top ten favorites of all time.
