You would be forgiven for thinking that a Finnish director of Helsinki would not be good at managing an American horror movie (especially one that is totally in an American prison). See it to prove yourself wrong! It was made in the 1980s and the film was made on a budget that matches a modern DIY company TV ad (something I think someone will really see today that is practically used to $ 100m) + action movie budgets unfortunately the industry mindset!) is Mr Harlin's first major production and the - at least what is now considered a star cast. I still think most of the North African contributions to the film industry are more to do with Stellan Stargaard's screen shows (not the well-overrated Bergman director's efforts), at least for all female viewers, but it really proves that there Good movie talent exists outside the US and Hollywood to let us watch a movie in suspense. Try to watch this movie, even if you're not a horror puff, IMO, it's definitely worth it!
