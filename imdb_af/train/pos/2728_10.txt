One of the best ever! Richard Brooks' adaptation of Truman Capote's non-fiction novel is truly an artistic achievement. Beautiful black and white cinematography (which won an Oscar), a ghostly Quincy Jones score and tremendous performances by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson as the peculiar killers. This movie was 0 for 4 at the Academy Awards and has not even been nominated for Best Picture, while Dr. Doolittle was. Go figure! <br /> <br /> Although you don't get to know the Clutter family, as well as what you do in the book, it was a good decision to focus more on Perry and Dick and the pain relief of finding this guys off. John Forsythe is also impressive as Alvin Dewey. There is simply no error in this one. 10 out of 10. Best show = Scott Wilson with R. Blake a second second. Highly recommended!
