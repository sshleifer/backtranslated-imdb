Incredibly artificial they cannot think of now. It seems to be perfect, the biggest and greatest musical ever made, listening to the beautiful songs. This is quite poetry. I am Italian and presented by American music. why can't you do something like that now? Americans were the best and so I show my dedication to this movie. There are words to describe the perfection of this movie. Suddenly my heart sings, what makes the sunset? I fall in love with easy, jealousy ... and the scene with Tom and Jerry. the largest without reserve. if you don't know your eyes aren't open, you should see and appreciate it ... wake up!
