Actually, Goldie Hawn of Washington (Takoma Park, Maryland), but I'm leaving. It's kind of a mr. Smith goes to Washington's type of movie, with some variations, but the same premise. I tied this movie from the cable long ago because I was very lucky at Goldie Hawn. The story is interesting, but it is highly unlikely that some cocktail servers will get a major job in government just because she saved a big shot. It made me laugh and at the same time made me angry. It made me laugh because I had to laugh at some of the situations in which she found herself so ridiculous. (POSSIBLE SPOILER START). It made me angry to think that our government would set up an average citizen in the way she was founded. And the speech she made at the end ... beautiful. Sorry, not many people have such a thing in real life.
