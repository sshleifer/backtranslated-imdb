So 35 years old, Groove Tube looks a lot like real TV today! Special niche networks (nudes), a television program on stoner drug dealers, called the Dealers (ala Weeds, and even the Cheech & Chong Up in Smoke in 1978), strange beer advertisements (Butz Beer, no less bizarre than Bud Bowls ) -minded kid's clown Koko (shaky pee by Pee Wee Herman), even Chevy Chase does slapstick humor (a violent barbershop vocal duo) a year before his 1975 debut on Saturday Night Live. And thanks to the infamous opening sequence Groove Tube earns an initial X score, I still can't hear Curtis Mayfield's "Move Up Up" without thinking of naked dance hippies. ---- For similar sketch style movies, see TunnelVision, Kentucky Fried Movie, Amazon Women on the Mood, Monty Python's Beyond the Fringe, Dynamite Chicken, and the Firesign Theater's all you know is wrong.
