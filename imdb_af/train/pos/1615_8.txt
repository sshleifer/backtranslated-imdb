Wonderful romance comedy drama about an Italian widow (Cher) who plans to marry a man she is comfortable with (Danny Aiello) until she falls to his head, angry brother (Nicholas Cage). The writing is sharp with very good lines, the play is wonderful, the accents (I said) are literal and the film art is beautiful. New York has never looked so well on the screen. A must see especially for Cher and Olympia Dukakis - they are both fantastic and richly deserve the Oscars they have. A beautiful, funny movie. A must see!
