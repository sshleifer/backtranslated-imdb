This movie is one of the "WOW!" movies. Not because it is the best movie of all time, but because it surprised me. Not only was it a TV movie, but it was on Elvis. I can safely say so many mimics, because there is only one Elvis, but I can also safely say that Kurt Russel was very close to the right thing. It was one of the biggest impersonations I've ever seen. He believed me it was really him. I learned a lot about Elvis's life to watch this movie. And didn't make the television part of it get lost - it's actually a fantastic movie! And Kurt Russel could have been Elvis's twins :)
