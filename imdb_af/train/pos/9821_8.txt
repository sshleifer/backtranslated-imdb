I saw this movie on True Movies (which made me automatically skeptical), but actually - it was good. Why? Not because of the incredible intriguing or breathtaking dialogue (of which few are), but because, in fact, despite what people say, I thought the movie is accurate in the portrayal of teenagers getting pregnant. <br /> <br /> It's NOT Dawson's Creek, they are not graceful, cool humorous characters who breeze through sexuality with effortless knowledge. They are children and they act like children. <br /> <br /> They are confused, uncomfortable and irritating about everything. Yes, it can be by accident and they can only be bad actors, but I don't think so. Dermot Mulroney gives (if not cool) a very credible performance and I loved it for that. Patricia Arquette is smart and annoying, but she was pregnant and a teenager? The combination of the two is not exactly lavender on your pillow. The plot was very predictable and so what? I believed them, his stress and inability to cope - her brave but slightly wrong attempts to bring them closer. I think the characters acting by someone else would have been annoying and unbelievable, but they were not. It reflects the conviction of the situation in which they are working, sitting in the classroom and walking with the baby on campus. I was angry with her because I was angry with him because she was such a child and blaming her. I felt everything. <br /> <br /> In the end, I loved it and recommended it. <br /> <br /> Beware of the scene where Dermot Mulroney runs out of the disastrous counseling session - career performance.
