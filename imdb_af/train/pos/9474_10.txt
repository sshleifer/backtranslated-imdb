I saw this movie on a preview and was blinded by it. It's not the typical romantic comedy. I can't remember laughing so hard at a movie and moving through it. The laugh is not here - they are observations, laughter recognition, little shocks of "Oh my God, I thought I was the only one who felt that way!" I won't give away the plot, it's more than just "Guy falls in love with his brother's girlfriend." The whole family plays a role in this relationship. Probably the best mix of laughter and warmth since "while you sleep." <br /> <br /> Steve Carell goes much deeper than he was before, and for the first time I really liked him. The movie is amazing, a list of veteran theater actors I loved in other roles, but they blend to make a convincing family. Dianne Wiest is beautiful as the mother, Juliette Binoche is light and hilarious (who knew she was funny?), And even the cooked Dane Cook gives a warm, quiet, touch. The Sondre Lerche soundtrack is a wonderful addition, and I buy the CD the second it is available. <br /> <br /> Don't miss this one.
