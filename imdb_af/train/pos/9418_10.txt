I've had this movie on tape for years and started watching this morning (while waiting for my laundry --- how ironic!), Mostly because I wanted to hear Benjamin Frankel's title music again. I finally sat down for the first half hour, captivated by how wonderful the direction, writing and performances ensured. The movie is like one of the British character stars of the 50s: Cecil Parker, Michael Gough, Miles Malleson, Duncan Lamont, and especially Ernest Thesiger, great as the pleasant old giant of the textile factories. Not to mention Alec Guinness and Joan Greenwood, not character players like that, but charming, charismatic leaders. It is scientific fiction in its purest form and it is comedy as well. An all-time classic, and I hope no one will ever try it again!
