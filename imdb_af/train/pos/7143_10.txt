"Holes" is my all-time favorite movie! So far I've seen this movie three times in the theaters and I look forward to buying it on DVD this coming September. I read the book after I saw the movie and was amazed at how good the book and film were. The director of this film has done an excellent job creating the book again in film form. Also, all the actors chosen to play the roles played great characters, especially Max Kasch and ZigZag. Props to anyone involved in making this movie, it was a real success! 10 out of 10 stars, I definitely recommend it to anyone to watch!
