This is one of my favorite Govinda movies of all time and best movie of 1994. David Dhawan does a great job of directing this movie, he makes it funny and adds family drama. Govinda is excellent as Raja Babu and gives a good performance. Karishma Kapoor is an actress I hate, this film is a bit less annoying, but sometimes makes it into some scenes. Kader Khan is a maestro in acting and yet gives an excellent performance. Aroona Irani is great as a mother and gives an excellent performance. Shakti Kapoor is brilliant as Nandu the sidekick. This movie has comedy, action, family drama and romance full on the entertainer.
