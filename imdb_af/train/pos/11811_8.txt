Dick Tracy was originally a comic book created in 1931 by Chester Gould. He is a peace detective who finds a crew of villains ranging from all types of visually original characters such as Flattop to The Blank to Big Boy Caprice. (These villains became so popular in the 40s that Warner Bros. created their own tracy-style villains in such cartoons as Daffy Duck). Tracy's comics were renowned for their liberal use of gunplay and the latest technological advances (especially the wristwatch communicator), which got their fair share of screenplay on this excellent movie. The music was wonderful done by Danny Elfman, and the original songs by Madonna were interesting, but they were not the highlight of her career. It's weird, because watching the movie and seeing the exciting moments makes the movie feel as much as Batman because of Elfman's memorable sound on his pieces. <br /> <br /> I love the tough talking kid, Pacino's as Big Boy Caprice (and that guy!), Madonna's crook and cinematography and directing were impeccable. This film was made very professional and features many good actors who were known as great actors for a while before this film was made. (Warren Beatty, Al Pacino, William Forsythe, Dustin Hoffman, Kathy Bates, Mandy Patinkin, Catherine O'Hara, Dick Van Dyke). The film was directed by Beatty himself, which was interesting. It's almost like Beatty saw himself as Tracy in a past life, or something because he really fits the part. <br /> <br /> I had to give this movie an 8/10 for everything it brought to cinema that was overlooked. (for whatever reason). There are many misunderstandings about judging this movie on IMDb, and I still don't understand why. The characters were completely original and lively, such as the style of the set, wardrobe, lighting and everything in this movie. Go buy it today. You won't be sorry.
