A movie I didn't expect very much and just looking for a quiet hour, but what an hour it seemed to be. Rol is an excellent as well as non-serious little story of 'land-boy-lost-in-the-big-city-making', it's funny throughout, the characters are endearing and the pace is just right. br /> <br /> Toby Malone is the true star of the film with his engaging depiction of Matt, said the country boy and the local Aussie Rules soccer hero come to the big city to try out for one of the big teams . He is supported by John Batchelor as local gangster Tiny. Look out for these two. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
