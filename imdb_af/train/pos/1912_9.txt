I'll keep it short and short, the people who wrote the story lines for this show are genius. The actors are perfect for the roles they play. (CJ's character is legendary) and they have so much chemistry on the screen that makes it a very successful comedy. <br /> <br /> When I first saw the new episodes probably came back just over 6/7 months, and I wondered what had happened to Paul. I was killed to find out he died when I looked at Google. He was so funny and perfected his character, an overprotective father, who likes to keep his daughters out of the spot and away from boys. <br /> <br /> I think the comedy came into force even without Paul in it. <br /> <br /> Plus, I think most people will enjoy watching it.
