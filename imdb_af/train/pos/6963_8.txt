A big surprise, probably because I expected it to suck. The reviews were disappointing, although they all seemed to be golden: a man finds out that his new girl is a superhero, and finds when he wants to break with her that she is kind of a psycho. I expected it to fall apart, but it never really did. Sure, it doesn't make as much of its wonderful prospect as it can, and chooses to be short when it's better to expand the film's universe. But I can't blame it. Uma Thurman is big like the bipolar superhero, G-Girl. And I noticed after years of not having liked him that Luke Wilson could be absolutely perfect when he was thrown as a club. He gave two of the best comic performances of 2006 (the other in the almost unresolved idiocy). I absolutely cracked on the expressions on his face when he and Thurman first had sex. It's one of the funniest sex scenes ever. My only real complaint is that they make G-Girl a little too much of a psycho, as almost incredible. Perhaps with a little background I could have accepted it better. However, I can forgive his mistakes, because I had a very good time viewing it. Underline, sure.
