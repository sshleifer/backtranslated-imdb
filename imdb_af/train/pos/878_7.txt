Interesting characters, lots of tension. So close to black and white without being black and white. I was turned off by how awkward the so-called sympathetic mainstream character, a quiet, near-deaf secretary, was able to destroy crime to destroy colleagues, snatch people on the road and eventually participate in a lift and to get someone erect that had to be knocked off as a trap to her own hiding. I was a little dismissed by the trend for otherwise quality films to portray criminals in a sympathetic way without addressing the injury they did to others than portraying their immediate opponents as jerks. In this movie we never know whose money they really are, or what happens to the innocent woman who uses the sympathetic deaf secretary to set up the bad bar owner to take the fall for the missing booty. Bad, the movie could have been good.
