Two years before I was born, this Oscar-award-winning film features the everyday Technicolor sets and costumes, stunning cinematography, excellent wall-to-wall Gershwin music, superior choreography, lighter-than-screen play and great performances by Kelly , Levant, Foch, Guetary, and Caron. Hollywood doesn't do it any more. Definitely, this is my favorite movie of all time, a standard that I judge all other movies. ENJOY, ENJOY, ENJOY!
