I just saw this movie @ TIFF (Toronto International Film Festival). Fans of Hal Hartley will not be disappointed !! And if you're not familiar with the directors oeuvre, it doesn't matter. This movie can definitely stand alone. I have to go the second screen ... it was great, I have to see it again - and fast !! <br /> <br /> This movie is very funny. His dialogue is very clever, and Parker Posey's performance is excellent, as she is in the title role of Fay Grim. Fay Grim is the latest feature of the world and characters introduced in the movie Henry Fool (2000). Visually, the most prestigious stylistic feature uses the usual use of the tilting angle, which is often available in the Hartley works found in various shorts, in the possible films: short works by Hal Hartley 1994-2004 collection, and in the girl's Monday. (2005). <br /> <br /> I took the best shot of this movie on September 11th. Fay Grim's adventure in this story is set against September 11, 2001 against the changing world. Without going into the big spoilers, I see this work and the story world as a brave political and original portrait of rarely geo-politics, as ever before in the mainstream fiction theater after-911 (cf. Syrianna: from lace - Mark Cuban Exec. Prod in both these films ... most interesting, to say the least). <br /> <br /> Finally, for those who are now linked to the characters of Henry Fool, Simone, Fay and Henry, this film is self-conscious and self-referring. It is said, the character of Fay Grimm starts in the film, exactly where she was when Henry Fool ended, but by the end of the film ... Fay's knowledge and experience is totally changed and expanded over the course of the story . What can be in store for the future of Fay and the Fool family ... ?? I can't wait for the third part in this story!
