Pinjar is one of the few movies that really leaves a point and makes you think hard. Set in Partition India, this film shows the true reality of India's partition. Urmila gets full marks for her beautiful and deeply emotional portrayal of a suffering woman with no way to go. Her freedom, personal identity and family respect are taken away overnight over a tragic land dispute. Manoj bajpai is simply brilliant as her repentant kidnapper. There are a few moments in the movie where one is brought to tears. The movie on the points is very traumatic. Some of the partition scenes are backbone chills, but Urmila's endurance and survival are both remarkable. From a woman robbed of her freedom to woman who gave women in similar situations freedom. A remarkable movie that needs credit for intelligent characters and storytelling.
