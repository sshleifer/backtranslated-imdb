This is one of the best movies I've seen long ago. All of you who regard this movie as absolute are not intelligent enough to understand all the subtle humor this movie offers. This shows us that real life and "fictional" action can produce a winning combination. Also, as a romantic comedy, it has one of the smartest ways in which two people can find each other. Call me another movie where you can see it all, as well as Donald Sutherland who sings a song like "They're going to find your anus on a mountain on Mars."
