One of the best of Fred Astaire and Giner Rogers movies. Great music by Irving Berlin. Strong support from Randolph Scott, Harriet Nelson, Lucille Ball, Betty Grable, Frank Jenks, and Astrid Allwyn. <br /> <br /> Terrific songs include: "Let yourself go," "Let's look at the music," and "Everything puts my eggs in one basket." The last song is introduced by Astaire and plays a jazzy keyboard and then a cute dance with Rogers. Rogers also sings "Let yourself go" with horrible among the rugby singers. <br /> <br /> Harriet Nelson (then Hilliard) sings two beautiful songs and plays Rogers' mousy sister. "Get Tea Behind Me" is a song that will stand with you for days. She also sings "But where are you?" Funny and fast, this entry into the Astaire-Rogers series is one of the better. The classic and stunningly beautiful final, "Let's Face the Music and Dance", is one of the best known of their numbers. Rogers wears one of the great dresses in film history .... a glittering sequential number that revolves around her legs as she dances (weighted body) and also looks a bit. Just beautiful. This is the number that Steve Martin and Bernadette Peters once made in Pennies from Heaven. <br /> <br /> Randolph Scott looks a strange choice as Astaire's partner, but he also appeared in their Roberta with Irene Dunne. Luckily he doesn't try to sing or dance. It appears that Grable and Ball would have had larger parts in 1936, but they have a few scenes and make little impact. Allwyn has the bigger role, but is just OK. <br /> <br /> Rogers has one of her best solo numbers in the series "Let Yourself Go" .... Jazzy and thumping, this is a good song. /> <br /> Fun all the way, although I got tired of "We joined the fleet" after the third time ....
