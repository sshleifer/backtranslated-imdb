Trudy Lintz (Rene Russo) was a very happy lady many years ago. She was the wife of a wealthy doctor and had lots of extra money. Her passion was animals and she dedicated her to providing a sanctuary for hairy children on her property. Trudy also raised two chimpanzees in her home to be more like children. They dressed and had lots of facilities. One day she learned about a deserted baby gorilla. Knowing nothing of the big monkeys, she relies on her husband's medical abilities and expert advice to save the gorilla's life. Once out of danger, Trudy decides that she will raise the gorilla, even as one of her children. It works well for years and Buddy, the gorilla, is really a remarkable, intelligent addition to her home. But, Buddy is also a gorilla and his strength and curiosity are quite large. Will Trudy Buddy be in control? For those who love animals, Buddy is a must-see movie. Based on a true story, Trudy and her monkey develop a relationship that is unique in the annals of animal history and doctrine. Of course, Buddy is not a real gorilla, but a mechanical one in the movie, but he is very close to seemingly quite real. Russo gives a good performance as a lady before her time and the supporting players are also very nice. The costumes are exemplary, as it suits the earlier era of the story, and the outstanding settings and production values. But above all, animals are abundant here, not just Buddy, but the beautiful chimpanzees, the ducks, the rabbits, and so on. For those who want to watch a movie and be transported to the animal sky, here on earth, it's a good movie. All animal lovers, and even those who just want to see a big family movie, will be a monkey over Buddy.
