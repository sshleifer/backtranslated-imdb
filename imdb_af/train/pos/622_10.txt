While I didn't consider myself a big fan of fairy-tale movies, Stardust based my intrigue on the view of Michelle Pfeiffer in the trailers as a scoundrel (especially since I'm about to see her as if the bitter Velma Von Tussle in hairspray). Boy, is she so convincingly angry here as a witch, especially with her older ugly makeup in the beginning and end! Robert De Niro is also great as the pirate captain forced to "hide in the closet" to protect his "reputation"! Just about all the actors like Claire Danes, Rupert Everett, Ricky Gervais, Peter O'Toole and many others, do good work here. While Danes and Pfeiffer are classic beauty, there are also wonderful faces of Sienna Miller, Olivia Grant (such as girl Bernard) and Kate Magowan especially if we meet her first. Newcomer Charlie Cox is good like starring Tristan and he looked as much as his father, Dunstan, as a young man I thought it was early on with Magowan (actually Ben Barnes). Many comments have compared it to The Princess Bride and while I can see some similarities, the biggest difference was that with PB, you always knew it was just an imaginary story as told by an old man to his grandson. Stardust makes the most of you that what you see and hear could actually happen even with all the hilarious things that happen continuously. So on the note, I highly recommend Stardust.
