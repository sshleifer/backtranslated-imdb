Wonderful performance by Simon Pegg who only gets better and better with every role. As usual, he plays the part of a very cringy character that sometimes makes you want to embarrass him behind his pillow, but that's what Pegg is about. <br /> <br /> Laughter was frequent and watery and all of them aimed at Penn. The movie is cleverly crafted where every character plays a very sophisticated and serious role with Penn the only humor that is a great credit to the director Robert Weide. <br /> <br /> And I can't let this one go without a quick round of applause to Gilliam Anderson who has shone throughout. Highly recommended for everyone.
