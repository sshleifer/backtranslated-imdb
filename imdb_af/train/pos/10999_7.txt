This movie is about this wimpy man who decides to become a spy for a glamorous high-tech company called Digicorp. This wimpy man, Morgan (Jeremy Northam), is unhappy with his miserable suburban life and his demanding wife and so decides to become a spy. He plans to go to conventions of other high-tech companies and find all the companies' plans. Instead, Morgan finds herself attracted to a beautiful woman (played by Lucy Liu) and crossed almost two times by these two companies, forcing him to become a double agent. How will Morgan get himself out of it? Can he trust the beautiful but mysterious Rita Foster (played by Lucy Liu)? And more importantly, can Morgan make it alive? Wow! What a nice movie! I was completely sucked in after 15 minutes to watch this movie. It's very exciting and you can feel Morgan's fear and confusion, because he's doing his best to stay alive. The scene where they put this terrible attack on Morgan's head to brain him is brilliant, spectacular and frightening. Morgan is slowly going through a personality transformation that is not so clear until you think about it after the movie is finished. From a wimpy man with bad hair and glasses, he becomes a man who is actively fighting for his life. <br /> <br /> The end, wow, the end is incredible! The twist is so much fun! It made me sneak and cheer as it was crazy! Good performances from anywhere, especially from Jeremy Natham, Lucy Liu and Nigel Bennett. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie!
