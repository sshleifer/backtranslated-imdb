If you have a very close and long relationship with the world of Tintin .... do yourself a favor and look at this beautiful documentary about Hergé and his life that creates Tintin. I am so brilliant and a very cool production. The whole background story about Hergé and the people and also the many different situations for which he was influenced, for good and worse, is wonderful. There is a very fine and clear connection between the comics and just this. I'll probably be digging up the Tintin albums again in my basement. Also, the movie itself is very well told and has a good environment sound. I really hope people will find it so intriguing as I did!
