Riding Giants <br /> <br /> This documentary tracks the history of navigating and follows three other well-made and award-winning surfer films, Dana Brown's Endless Summer, his successor Endless Summer II by Bruce Brown, Dana's son and Step. in liquid (IMAX). I saw the first, not the other. <br /> <br /> While the surfing movie is spectacular, I appreciate most of the film's historic perspective. He took us back to the sport's origins almost a hundred years ago and shows how it evolved to its present form. It includes extensive interviews with leading personalities and artists, how surfboard designs have changed over time, which beaches in Hawaii and California have had the most world-class surfers and which gave an incredible adrenaline rush to the sport. The athletes lived for months at a time on beaches, fled from dawn to sunset, camped on rudimentary stacking rooms, caught food, and returned to their shelves the next day. What an euphoric way to spend your youthful days. <br /> <br /> We see the media discovering and promoting the sport after a slow start. What was the biggest boost for the sport? Believe it or not, it was the movie Gidget, although I suspect copyright issues may prevent Beachboys surfing songs such as Surfer Girl and Surfing USA from being credited. The Surfing magazine and Encyclopedia of Surfing (who knew there were such trees) are mentioned for their contributions. We also see commentaries from the pioneers of the sport, their families, and how the current generation benefited from the creators in the 1960s. One such story is how 40-year-old Laird Hamilton, regarded as today's greatest surfer, linked to an earlier leading surfer, introduced him to his only mom. He married before he became his stepfather. <br /> <br /> An exciting musical background of contemporary music from all times accompanies the story. Did I chase your appetite? Great. Have a good ride.
