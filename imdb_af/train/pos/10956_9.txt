For those who think it is strict cat humor and immaturity, you are really wise. While the show contains its part of the joke jokes, it also contains lots of satirical material and pleasure on social issues, racist barriers, clich√©s, stereotypes, and so on. Just read some of her material to get it. <br /> <br /> What I also love is that everything is not a punch line. For those who expect a formulated joke, such as Friends (I LOVE friends fyi), you won't find it here. Instead, Sarah uses situations and other ways to reach her more realistic humor. We don't walk around this world and have witty punchlines for everything that is said to be in most comedies. Instead, the Sarah Silverman program makes it more realistic in this sense. <br /> <br /> Don't accept it as incomprehensible humor, because it's so much more than that.
