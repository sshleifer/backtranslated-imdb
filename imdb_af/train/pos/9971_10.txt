This movie was excellent, I thought the original was quiet, mediocre. However, this one has all the ingredients, a 1970 Hemi Challenger factory with 4 speed transfer that really shows that Mother Mopar knows how to build the best muscle cars! I was in Chrysler heaven every time Kowalski ran that big block of Hemi, and he did it a lot :)
