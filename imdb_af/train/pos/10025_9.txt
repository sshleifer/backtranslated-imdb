It must be a unique twist of two genres ever seen. The giant monster movie genre with the live mummy movie genre. This unique combination allows for a unique and compelling story. The movies are outstanding, including TOM BOSLEY, which I have never been in a horror movie ever. The effects are impressive and the idea of ​​a giant mummy filled with smaller mummies is a cool one. My one complaint, I just wish we had seen more of the giant mummy, but otherwise I think they did a good job. The dialogue, the characters and the story were perfect. The acting was wonderful. It should be the best movie to get out of the sci-fi channel. You heard me, the best movie coming out of the sci-fi channel. I give the cases 9 out of 10.
