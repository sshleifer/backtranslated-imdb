Well, of course, women are too sensitive and needy on the average, which is interestingly depicted from mother to whore, though not pseudo-artistic, excessive or blatant. Unlike many of you, I saw La Maman et La Putain twice. Like many good movies, I noticed that my opinion improved on a second look. All I know is what I saw and went on until further exploration until I got the DVD myself. I have yet to find out why I enjoy this movie so much, but really, what do I care about? Although I am sure, I can and will form a wonderful explanation. Okay, so don't agree, maybe it's boring sometimes, I'm not an expert. The blonde reminds me of a beautiful Grushenka.
