I remember years ago this movie, I think, BBC2. I want to see it again - does anyone know how to get a copy? As I recall, it was a particularly powerful movie, especially the standout scene of the horses wearing gas masks. In addition, I really can't remember too much about the story - so I want to see it again! I trailed the web, but can't find a copy, which is unusual in my experience. Maybe there's no DVD or VHS of this movie on the market. Will appreciate any help that can give me. Thank you in advance for your help. Best regards, Albany234@googlemail.com
