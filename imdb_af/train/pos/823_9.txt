Until the sixth and final episode of the Star Wars saga, which eventually ended in 2005, I always looked at this 1983 tournament as my favorite movie of the long-running series. The varied action scenes and many different characters (Jabba The Hut, hairy forest world, etc.) made it a particularly attractive film. <br /> <br /> None of the action was too focused in one place for too long. The last half hour illustrates this most, as the scene every few minutes from the bush links the spacecraft ships to the individual laser duel between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader. <br /> <br /> Another good feature of this movie said the two previous were not the absence of fighting between two of the stars. Gone was the incessant turn between Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford. Finally, everyone was on the same page! It was nice to see. <br /> <br /> In the end it was just a great adventure story, more than anything else.
