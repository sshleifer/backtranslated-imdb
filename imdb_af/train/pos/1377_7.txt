In the areas where they overlap, these fine films are years ahead of the Innocence of 2004, giving the impression of a smoky eye and heavy breathing and young girls. Here the effect is much more realistic and really gets inside the minds of the three main players, as they are furious with an adolescent falling into potholes. The three principals, all of whom are unknown to me, give very sure footsteps, the kind that is so natural that it will be difficult for them to repeat this quality of acting in other films so I would not be too surprised. if they are not heard again. It will be nice if it can come from the art houses and in the multiples, where there is only an outside chance, it can be a 'talk' of the bubbling that it is not aimed at.
