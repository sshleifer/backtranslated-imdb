There are a number of things that are not correct, although this is not too important, as it happened to who and when in dispute. The most blatant freedom with the facts I think is when they play at Bruno Koschmidder's Kaiserkeller, when they actually played at the Indra and later moved to the Kaiserkelaar. <br /> <br /> I agree with Semprinni20 that the film was biased in favor of Pete Best's version, but if he is the story consultant, I think he calls the shots. I also agree with Semprinni that Pete Best's recordings say the last word on the subject of why he was fired. <br /> <br /> Although the movie is not such a cute production as the later movie "Backbeat", I prefer this movie because it is more accurate and because it has a better writing with deeper characterization. <br /> <br /> There is a lot in the movie that is pretty big - as Brian Epstein tries to hide the fact that he was "malicious," just to find out that the group knew he was always Gay . Little as the group goes into a cafe and order "Corn-Flakes with Milch." My favorite scene, which does have bases, is where an audition, Stuart Sutcliffe, just bought his bass guitar but can't play it. So he stands with his back to the impresario and tries to fake it, but gets caught. It's rock'n'roll. <br /> <br /> Worth watching.
