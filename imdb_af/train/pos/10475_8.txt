A friend of mine recommended this movie, referring to my vocal and interchangeable similarities with Des Howl, the main character of the movie. I think to some extent that I can see it and maybe a little more. I'm not very sure if it's flattering depiction. <br /> <br /> It's a pretty unique job, the only movie that may have more than a glamorous deal, would be true romance, not for the content or style of filming or for the pace of dialogue no. (Whale music is just as much, well, relaxed.) But rather, they both represent modern love stories. <br /> <br /> Overall, I'm a big fan of Canadian movies about music and musicians (for example, I recommend Hard Core Logo) and especially this movie. It's an innocent charm, Des isn't always the most similar man, but there's something about him that draws some kind of empathy.
