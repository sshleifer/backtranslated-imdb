What begins as a generation conflict in this movie, ends in understanding, solemnity and grace. The movie winds through Europe with the father and the young boy clipped over 3000 miles in a car. The cramps require lifestyles, beliefs and life skills to clash. There really is no clear winner. It adds everything as experience, experience of several layers of life. For those interested in understanding Islam, this movie offers a generous and soft prospect without being on the agenda. It's a lifetime story for the young boy, his terrific and rebellious nature turns to openness to receive more ways of life.
