One of the greatest hits of 1926, Brown or Harvard, is an exciting comedy / drama with regatta and soccer tones that gave William Haines the role he needed to become a great star. It is patented Haines all the way: Brash smart aleck who takes nothing serious until he is rejected by everyone's wisdom and becomes a man / hero and wins the girl. Nobody worked this formula like Haines. A terrific comic actor (Little Annie Rooney with Mary Pickford, Show People with Marion Davies), Haines could swing from comedy to tragedy with a change in facial expression. He's a total joy in this movie, such as in Tell It to the Marines (with Lon Chaney) and West Point (along with Joan Crawford), where he repeats the formula. Mary Brian is good as the girl, Jack Pickford is very good like the sick roommate, Ralph Bushman is the rival. Edward Connelly, Mary Alden, David Torrence, Guinn Williams, and Grady Sutton co-founder. This film is now listed for his homosexual relationship between Haines and Pickford and for John Wayne's debut as a Yale soccer player (but I never saw him). Haines was a top five cashier star who started this photo from 1932. It is a pity that he has been largely forgotten and that most of his films are lost. He was one of the most attractive and talented actors of his time.
