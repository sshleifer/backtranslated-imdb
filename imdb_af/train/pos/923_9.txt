I never saw it on TV, but rented the DVD through Netflix as soon as I found it available. I had high expectations and was not disappointed. It's funny, and the animation is excellent. That level of quality I only expected from movies is therefore surprised by some of the bad comments. Perhaps the DVD edition improved enhanced animation? One bonus on the DVD is that it was fun to see both versions of the pilot. I'm an adult, and I really appreciate it for adults. It's not just kids who love lovely animated characters. It is nowhere near "raunchy" as some have claimed, but I can see where some parents don't want their young children to see it. I'm very disappointed that it was canceled. I wish they would produce more episodes. Or maybe a movie.
