"Undo" seems to provoke many opinions among contributors to this forum. Granted, it's a movie that promises a gay life, as most viewers expect, and somehow it goes away from the promise in an introspective view of a young man's soul. The movie has a way to stay with us, even when it's finished. It is a character study of how a young man becomes involved in a love affair with someone who is so much different from him, that will eventually make Maths confused, hurt and depressed when things don't go according to what he hoped for. would be. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen the movie, you might want to stop reading. <br /> <br /> The movie director Sebastien Lifshitz told his story about Mathieu's position. Most viewers seem to be disorientated by the different times in the movie, but there are no obvious tips. The story is told in flashbacks that can contribute to the way some people will see the movie. This is a story about the damned love that Mathieu felt for Cedric and the ultimate outline of their life together. <br /> <br /> First, Cedric, the handsome young local, strives for Mathieu until he manages to convince him he loves him. Mathieu also feels the attraction for Cedric. We realize how differently both young men are, as Cedric tells Mathieu's family, how he feels school is not for him. On the other hand, Mathieu, who wants to be an architect, finds beauty in the deserted place where Cedric took him. We watch Mathieu, read from the guide, want Cedric's attention. <br /> <br /> When Mathieu comes to his mother, she tells him wisely how important it is to continue his career. She also points out what future they both would have together, which seems to be. Mathieu learned his lesson in the hard way. He continues with uncertain life with Cedric and tries to take his own life. We look at him in hospital and talk to a psychiatrist who has treated his wounded soul. <br /> <br /> The end can be confusing for most viewers, but there is a moment in the movie when Mathieu goes to work in a bar where we see him see glasses and look at Pierre, the young man who visit the bar. That's why it's hard to imagine when Mathieu Pierre is looking for his home. Yet we have seen Mathieu obviously interested in Pierre. The last scene on the beach, when Pierre and Ahmed are seen in the sand, has a hopeful sign that things between them will be better if they see a young boy, apparently lost, but then realize the father is near. <Br /> <br /> Jeremie Elkaim makes Mathieu one of the most complex characters in recent films. It is a young man who is difficult to understand at a simple level. Mathieu suffered a lot, only with the separation of his parents, then with his depressed mother and with Cedric. Stephan Rideau, who has been featured on other major French films, is as good as Cedric. <br /> <br /> While "Come Undone" divides views, the movie deserves a glimpse of the complexity and the care Sebastien Lifshitz gives to the story.
