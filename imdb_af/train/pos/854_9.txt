"Margaritas and Cock ..." <br /> <br /> This amazingly entertaining movie grabs you from the opening scene and never stops laughing, touching surprises and unexpected moments. I had more fun watching "The Matador" than almost any other 2005 movie. It's a crazy movie with an unforgettable character, played perfectly by Pierce Brosnan. <br /> <br /> Julian Noble (Brosnan) is a facilitator (hit-man) specializing in high-end corporate gigs (killing rich dudes). He also experiences something related to a middle crisis. After realizing that he has no real friends, no permanent home and no planned future, he stumbles into a Mexican hotel bar one night and runs it in Danny Wright (Kinnear). <br /> <br /> Danny is a down-to-his-happy family man who is about to lose the big business deal, which can only change things for him. He loves his wife very much, especially since they lost their young son a few years earlier. <br /> <br /> The two men are chalk and cheese, almost no common ground, except they are in the same desert. night. And somehow a conversation is being made that changes a chain of events that will change their lives forever. <br /> <br /> The friendship they create reminded me of Laurel and Hardy. One is the straight man and the other is the persistent fool who gets into trouble. The interaction is extremely timely and well-tuned, and it is not part of the wonderful performances of Brosnan and Kinnear. <br /> <br /> But don't make a mistake ... This is Brosnan's movie. He writes one of the most memorable and horrendously similar characters of the decade. He can shoot your mom and apologize and you will surely forgive him. Brosnan can be film's ultimate charm, but it is his most endearing and complete achievement to date. I won't be scared to see an Oscar wink for this role. <br /> <br /> Think of a scene where he unleashes a high school girl with the impurity of mind and the line, "All blushy blushy ... No sucky fucky". He does this with the well-known Bond Smirk and manages to get away with it. He managed to tell a young boy: "Tell your mother to lose 30kg and 20 years. Then come back to me" without being so unlikely. In fact, it makes us even more like him. <br /> <br /> And yet, the movie can surprise us with a couple of real-touch screens, most of which come to an end when the movie takes unpredictable turns. However, when Julian dips through his little black book to find someone to call up his birthday, or when Danny and his wife (Davis) consume one night in their bedroom, the film reaches an unexpected depth of emotion. <br /> <br /> "The Matador" is stylish and energetic. This is constantly entertaining. And it contains a career-defining role for Brosnan as the lonely hit that is looking for normal, friendship and a way to do at least one good thing in his life. This is a forgotten gem in 2005 and you have to make an effort to see this movie as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> TC Candler or IndependentCritics.com
