Obviously, a movie that had great influence, not only on grace, but also on action genre. George Lucas was a fan of this movie as so much of his Star Wars series seems to pay tribute to Gunga Din. The characters that Grant, McLaglen and Fairbanks play are just precursors of Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, and Chewbacca. Even Sam Jaffe's Gunga Din cured in C-3PO and R2-D2, and like him or her, Jar Jar Binks. <br /> <br /> Today, this film is considered non-PC, but there is a speech by Eduardo Ciannelli as Guru the leader of the Indian opposition to the British raj that can become, in many today's sentiments Characterised. <br /> <br /> For a young boy it was a good movie. Three strong men lead and just a hint of romance. There was a time when young boys considered kissing the girl in Saturday. Matinee movie was just rough. Not like today when the more skin is greeted with joy. Too late to cheat lost innocence. <br /> <br /> Hopefully, this movie won't be forgotten, and a few who are navigating channels will stop at TCM and record a movie of action, adventure and dive instead of CGI. actors.
