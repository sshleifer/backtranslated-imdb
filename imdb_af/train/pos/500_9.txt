I, like many tractors Trekkers (or Trekkies, don't care about me!) Suffered from seven seasons of Star Trek Voyager, and dreamed of a better performance when it was over and the end of the "Deep Space Nine" in 1999, prayers, answered. "Enterprise" is fantastic. Fresh perspective, radically different characters, beautiful new visuals, a pop song for the intro. (I was shocked!) I can't think of anything I didn't like about it. sign me up for 10 seasons of this show. "Star Trek" is back - "Voyager," no one misses you! Stop Trekkin '! <br /> <br />>
