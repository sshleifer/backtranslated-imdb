Both Robert Duvall and Glenn Close played their roles with such credibility, but I just cried. Glenn Close's role as Ruth showed she wanted to handle the situation but she was under the dominance of her husband. "Let him think about what he did," said Robert Duvall's character, Joe. The story depicted a rural family dealing with an unfortunate death of a boy by his brother, "The Stone Boy," meaning he was so upset and overwhelmed by what he did, he was emotionally paralyzed. Then, to the end, when Jason Presson's character, Arnold, sent it all to a stranger, I was so crushed for him that I actually thought of some of the terrible things I've done in my life. I personalized and identified with his character. Frederick Forrest and Gail Young's roles did NOT add much to the movie. I thought of Frederick Forrest, who played Ruth's antagonistic, female brother Andy, as a push that did nothing to try to help the situation. His wife, Lou, who was played by Gail Youngs, acted like a mad lady who, without pity, Arnold struck with her own problems without frustration and blaming him for her problems. I couldn't really feel sorry for these two. Although Lou tried to keep her marriage together, she was unsuccessful. Both did NOT handle their problems effectively. They didn't really do anything for the film and were completely ridiculous. Wilfred Brimley's little role as grandfather was touched because he was the only character Arnold showed any attention. I felt that his role had to be expanded. The players just did what they felt was adequate and sufficient. However, I loved the end very much, I actually smiled and cried tears of joy. I felt good. The Hillermans were a family again. I really wanted to be part of this family. They were so realistic.
