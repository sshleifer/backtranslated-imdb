I don't know why the critics scrapped this movie. I never agree with them. <br /> <br /> The movie could have been a bit scarce - I don't usually go to Horror movies! I had to see myself on the psig even in the day. I don't have to be bothered! ;) (The Cinema was also full of kids, heh !;). Liam was as good as ever. I also loved Catharine Zeta Jones (Theo) and Lili Taylor (Eleanor-Nell) <br /> <br /> The house was very Gothic and beautiful in a haunting way. The special and sound effects were wonderful. I also loved the music score, especially the soft songs for Eleanor and her journey to save the kids, how she grew out of her stagnant routine and life and eventually got her strength, peace and freedom.
