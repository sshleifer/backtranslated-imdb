This show has come so far. Only in the cast of Eric to Fez were they all new actors and actresses, fresh faces, and just watching what they achieved. They held onto the show and it was a success. She's one of the best shows ever made and probably the funniest sitcom I've ever seen in my life. It will be sad to end it, but if they end this show, I hope God will finish the series with one of the biggest buttons any season finals ever had. I don't mind sucking all season because they save all the fuel for the final episode. Go swing, get one last punch. The show deserves it, the fans deserve it. If they go, let everyone know she's going to end up like friends, and let the final be big. I say Donna and Eric are married. I say that Hyde and Kelso fought and became friends again. I say something happened between Fez and Jackie because Fez tried so long, but of course it won't work for him. ONLY SET THE SERIES OF LARGE TIME! <br /> <br /> The 70s show will always be the best in my eyes. Eric, Kelso, Donna, Jackie, Fez, Hyde, I wish I had you guys as friends. You are the best! <br /> <br /> 10/10 ...
