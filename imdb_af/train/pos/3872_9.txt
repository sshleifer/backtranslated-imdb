After watching this little fun and comic movie, you will definitely feel better. Cheers to Yves B. Pelletier to have this little, wonderful movie moment, which I believe will be recognized as a brand movie of the year 2004 for Quebec. The actors Isabelle Blais, Emmanuel Bilodeau, Sylvie Moreau and Stephane Gagnon all touch. I compare the feeling that this wonderful story gives you to those who gave Le Fabuleux Destin d'Am√©lie Poulain to me. So if you like the beautiful movie Jean-Pierre Jeunet, I would say that you are also the first movie by Yves B. Pelletier, Les Aimants
