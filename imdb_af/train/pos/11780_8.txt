This is a documentary I got by chance on the British TV channel More4 and I must say I found it very interesting and thoughtful. I will also find the book that was the source material for this documentary. In fact, it is Professor Jared Diamond's theory on why some parts of the Earth's societies were prosperous and others not. The argument he proposed was new to me, arguing how the fortune of the right crops and the real animals capable of housing is definitely a compelling one. Regarding the documentary itself, it was well shot and well portrayed with not too many of the rediscovered scenes that spoiled many modern documentaries. Diamond also helps not to condemn what is a mistake of many intellectuals if they try to get a message to the masses. People claim that his theory is Marxist, but I don't buy it and see it more socio-geologist. It was also refreshing to hear a theory about the evolution of society that is not based on religion. Highly recommended look.
