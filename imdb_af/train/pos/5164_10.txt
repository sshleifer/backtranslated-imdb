I attended Camp Chesapeake. It was located at the head of the Chesapeake Bay on the North East River in MD. It was a similar type of summer camp with huts. It was founded by Coatesville, PA YMCA. I started out as a young camper and later became a Junior, Senior Counselor and later the Waterfront Director. If the camp continues, I would have done anything within my power to become the camp director. Unfortunately, the YMCA's powers have decided to close the camp and sell it to the MD. I visited the previous camp a few years later by boat and was upset about the neglect of the state of MD and natural destruction by mother nature. The 350-hectare site has served so much with all the benefits of contact with nature offerings. A Blackman named Curtis Ford, and his family were residents and caregivers of the property. Mr Curtis was my friend and mentor. I have his only being idol. Even when he couldn't swim, he was a waterman. If I asked him where the fish was biting, he would point the place and I would have a ball. There was also a family camp at the end of the summer. These memories will be with me forever.
