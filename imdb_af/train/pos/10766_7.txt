A thin story with very fine shots. Eyecatchers here are the three ladies of the D.R.E.A.M. team. And to a lesser extent, the guy they accompany. Traci Lords is convincingly the female half of an evil business couple who intend to poison the world with anthrax. Original in this movie is the bra-bomb, put a captured member of the D.R.E.M. team. Of course, she is rescued by a fellow member, three seconds before blast. Although clearly borrowed from James Bond's 'Goldfinger' and 'You only live twice', such a highlight always works well. All in all, a nice look, James Bond replaces three Charlie's Angels.
