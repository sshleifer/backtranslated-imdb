Okay, this movie is fine as I said, but you should probably be considered a watch. It's about two boys Mac and Sam, who are good friends and work as fashion photographers and start the season when Mac (Akshay Kumar) starts dating three air females and leaves his wife suspicious. Sam reaches happiness and almost forgets his friend, but not quite. But Mac thinks so and so he starts with air females. There is garam masala at every step of the movie, songs rock but somethings are missing. The comedy is not about and deserves an award. It's nice but not so good. Some people laughed until their stomach ache hurt, but it didn't deserve much laughter. But everyone's opinion is different. So if you want to see the movie, you are welcome to do so.
