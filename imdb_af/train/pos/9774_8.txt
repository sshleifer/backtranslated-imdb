This movie has its ups and downs, but to me the good things in this movie are much heavier than the bads ... <br /> <br /> What is not so good of the movie is indeed the dialogue, the sounds, the lighting (am i the only one who noticed how the sets were lit, were amateur and the acting. <br /> <br /> What is very good is the highly original story, the very intense atmosphere, the gore factor is very high and the effects done at the highest level. <br /> <br /> So, definitely worth the look or maybe even a must-see for all your horror and gore fans ....
