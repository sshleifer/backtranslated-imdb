I didn't know the right events when I sat down to see it, just the fact that it was based on a real story. After the child's father's death, Rhonda tries to help her daughter Desiree (... I didn't know anyone actually called their descendants) who handled the loss. It is really made for children, as it often happens with 'family' flicks (with that said, go ahead and get everyone together for a viewing, although I want to keep teenagers out of it, unless you are sure they are going to buy the concept) but it does not hide what the death of a parent is, and it does not really speak to anyone. The plot is sufficiently interesting and moves well enough. Actually changing, with the excellent Burstyn shedding most of her co-throws, Mathis follows it well, and Ferland and her peers (with a few exceptions) are least convincing of the bunch (and frankly it is annoying, then again , I'm not really in the intended audience for this thing). Editing and cinematography is standard, and certainly not less than that. While humor is limited to a handful of amusing lines or so, the tone is not an unpleasant one. There is an intense scene or two. I recommend it to fans of these types of movies. 10/07
