OK, let's make it clear. I'm not really in sci-fi, but for some reason I like Stargate SG-1. <br /> <br /> Jack O'Neil takes his team SG-1 through a Stargate. A round device that creates a wormhole. It gives you the ability to travel to distant worlds. It may sound like your usual sci-fi series, but it's not! The plot is not today in a distant millennium like many other sci-fi series. I find it wonderful. It gives you things, events and such that you can link to, and you can jump into the series anytime without learning many new terms and names of all the gadgets. Of course, they did, thank you, O'Neil who likes to keep a simple terminology, there isn't much. <br /> <br /> The series has a nice mix of action, humor and drama. If you enjoy many special effects, you can't find them here. They do not use very bad people, but a limited amount of well-made special effects.
