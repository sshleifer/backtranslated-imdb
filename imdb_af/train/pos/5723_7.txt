So, to be a pretty deep fan of horror movies, it's been a while since I've seen one that really made me jump (or cheat) <br /> <br /> definitely go to DVD get it out of ... a hell much better than the ring. The thing I don't get is that so many people we talk to after the movie thought it was terrible, well, if that's what you think, then ... I know what I liked and what take a fair amount to really scare me, so I have to say that this one is worth looking at. <br /> <br /> If you need everything in a neat and neat line, you can be disappointed in the story, because the plot goes back a bit to build the story (I think if it's in chronological order) shown, it would ruin the whole thing.) <br /> <br /> I'm actually glad this movie had very little blood pressure in it ... maybe the rest of your studio writers and whathaveyous will realize you're not the red stuff about the set needs to scare people.
