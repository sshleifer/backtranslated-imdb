I love ghost stories in general, but I especially like cold, atmospheric and elegant creepy British fairy tales. This one qualifies at all points. A naive young lawyer ("lawyer" in Britspeak) is sent to a small town near the sea to establish an elderly, deceased wife's estate. It's the 1920s, a time when many middle-class Britons go to sea for their health holiday. Well, guess what, there is nothing "healthy" about the village of Crythin Gifford, the creepy site of the older woman's hulking, brooding Victorian estate, located on the edge of a mulled salt nut. When the lawyer saves the life of a little girl, none of the residents will help the threatened - you find why in the movie later the anger of a malicious spirit, the black woman, accidentally occurs. She is not a cinematic, gauzy wraith, but a solid black silhouette of evil and evil. The viewer only sees her a few times, but you feel her malicious presence in every frame. As the camera crawls to the lawyer while reading through legal orders, you expect to see the woman in black at any moment. When the lawyer goes out to the generator to turn on the electricity for the creepy old house, the camera turns on him and you think she'll be there too. Waiting for the black woman to show up, is spooky. We've seen many elements of this story (the closed room that no one enters, the dung, the naive outsider who ignores the residents' warnings), but the director manages to combine them all into a completely new and apparent ghost story. Watch it with a friend so you can get someone warm to grab while waiting for the woman in black. . .
