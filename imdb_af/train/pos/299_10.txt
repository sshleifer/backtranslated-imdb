Peter Bogdonavich has made a handful of really good movies, and they are all one of his best. The role player couldn't be better equipped to play this light, but slightly bittersweet screw ball comedy. Interestingly, the spectacular, light-touch Bogdonavich, which works so effortlessly, gives the film a fairly disarming emotional core. Fresh and instant, the movie begins with absolutely no explanation. There is no soundtrack music to call us. We meet the characters in action, and as Bogdonavich slides in the streets of New York, the movie moves effortlessly. Robby Muller's camera captures it all with an understated simplicity that looks coincidental, but definitely not. The cast is great. In every way, a classic.
