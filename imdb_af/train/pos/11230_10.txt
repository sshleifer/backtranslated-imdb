Hidden Frontier talked about and reported by several news agencies for their long-standing commitment to creating the best Star Trek stories and providing an example of the unity that Gen Roddenberry's mission was. Their focus on homosexuality, depression, war and acceptance of different races is on par or greater than that of the other Trek series and movies. The production value started out as smaller and hooked, but over the 7 production seasons, the acting improved, the stories were more complex and the visual graphics became smoother and more impressive. In season 6 episode 1, Countermeasures, there is one of the greatest space battles in trek history. The ships are well delivered and the space fights are impressive and exciting. The right sign for Frontier is not the ships or backgrounds, but it is the people and the interaction and growth of characters. There are also other Trek series and movies cut with places and characters we all know. I recommend a pull fan to see counter measures and you'll be addicted!
