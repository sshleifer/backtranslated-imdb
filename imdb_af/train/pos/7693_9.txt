"GOOD TIMES," is, in my opinion, a must-see CBS hit! Despite the fact that I've never seen every episode, I still enjoy it. It's hard to tell which one is my favorite. Also, I really love the theme song. If you ask me, even if I was all of them, it would be nice if everyone stayed on the show during the whole race. Everyone has always produced a good performance, the productions design was spectacular, the costumes were well designed and the writing was always very strong. To conclude, although it can be seen on TV Land, I strongly recommend that you catch it only if it goes well.
