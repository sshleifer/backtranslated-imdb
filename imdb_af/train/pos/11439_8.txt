OK - as far as the 2 versions of this movie. There were 2 people involved in the making - John Korty and Bill Couterie (George was just the producer - he really didn't have that in the movie - just helped with money). The 'Adult' version is made possible. by Bill Couterie. John Korty didn't know or approve this version (as it was done behind his back). Thanks to Ladd movies that have undergone, they have not advertised this movie and thrown all their advertising cash for "The Right Stuff", hoping it would pass them ... and it didn't. So, this movie never really had a chance. When Twice made it to cable (HBO), they showed the rules with Bill's version and John threatened to sue if it was shown more (did you notice how the 'adult' version wasn't very long?) . Showtime has the 'clean' version. The video tape and laser disc version is the version approved by John (which has more power than Bill). It's a pity, really, since the 'adult' version is actually better and more meaningful. But it is VERY doubtful that it will ever be released in the version on DVD (or any other format short of bootleg). Sorry to disappoint everyone. I know all this information, as I was previously the president of the Twice-on-One Fan Club (still using many movie items - to own a letterbox version of the 'adult' version, but it's stolen - just have a partial high school copy of it now). 8 stars to the 'adult' version - 5 to the 'clean' version. Any other questions, just ask.
