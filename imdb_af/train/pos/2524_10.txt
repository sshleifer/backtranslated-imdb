I did not expect the performances of Gackt and Hyde to be done as well as they were, nor did I expect them to be thrown into such an artistic well-developed film with enough plot to interest you and leave enough diversity. make it original. This movie was an unexpected masterpiece for me, and I would be looking for the next movie like that. I especially like the fact that it is a vampire movie, but it was not a fiery spot fly, nor did it surprise. The characters all had human characteristics. The way it shows the growth of the characters was incredibly tasteful, and it really makes you feel sorry for them throughout their lives. I give this movie two inches so far. Definitely the best movie I've seen in the past five years.
