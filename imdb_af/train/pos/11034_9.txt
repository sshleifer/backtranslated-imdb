Eric Valette is, of course, a talented filmmaker, and so are the two guys who wrote the script. That's why Mal√©fique is a good movie, with just a few dollars, but also a lot of imagination. Well, I'm exaggerated, but I am sincere. So, if you like dark, yawn movies, watch this one. It's really worth it.
