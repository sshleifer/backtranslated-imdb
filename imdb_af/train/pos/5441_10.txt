Anyone with a young boy in the house who won't watch black-and-white movies should put it on their television set. When the child walks, wondering what all the screens are shouting and shooting, tell him it's an adult photo and he's not big enough to see it yet. It'll keep him there for a few minutes; Director George Stevens and his team will keep him to the end. <br /> <br /> I think my dad did it anyway and I'm the better man for that. This classic adventure yarn, which took place in India during the British occupation, features a trio of army leaders who face their tough union if they are prepared to marry their loved one. Help comes in the form of an ominous Thuggie rebellion with which the soldiers unite. <br /> <br /> "Gunga Din" was one of the great movies to come out of Hollywood's best year 1939. Even more than most big movies from the golden year, it is entertaining in a very immediate and accessible way. The theme music is instantly hummable nirvana. While shot in California, the camera works (the only thing in "Gunga Din" that received so much as an Oscar nomination) has a wind-blown grandeur that feels much like the hundred-year-old Raj. The battle scenes are shot in a very realistic way, not too violent, but very messy, as people fall in every corner of each frame and shoot, in a way that really feels, not like some Cecil B. DeMille biblical victims . br /> <br /> The script not only sets up action scenes, but also develops the relationship of the three sergeants with great puppies of humor. The main focus is on Sgt. Snyder, chasing after long stories of gold treasures. It's a rare action for Cary Grant, and his lights are just right for a movie that never takes him seriously, even if it develops tension. <br /> <br /> The anchor of the trio is Sgt. MacChesney (Victor McLaglen), pushing over his elephant Annie and trying to protect Cutter from his own hair-brained schemes. He is just as funny in his own way, so he leaves Sgt. Ballantine (Douglas Fairbanks Jr., who displays a beautiful Errol Flynnish dash) as the one with the love interest and foundation enough to know he has to grow his boy's pals. <br /> <br /> If "Gunga Din" was a lifetime movie, it would be about Joan Fontaine's efforts to save her husband from his two loose friends and their skull breaks. But since it's a guy movie, the emphasis is on how the trio should stay together and save Ballantine from a fatal worse than death, not just marriage, but if Cutter outraged the tea business several times. <Br /> <br /> The political correctness police are difficult on this film, not so much for the gender issue, but the idea of ​​British soldiers who save poor Indians from the evil Thuggies. This series of colonial excuses. Fortunately, this film was made again when the producers did not need to spell out the obvious liberalism at the heart of the film, that these three sergeants, full of grief and false races, should be saved with the rest of their army by a humble bhisti that only had one of three times when he sought his approval. After all, for all their bad-luck glory, the film's true sacrifice involves the title character, so heartbreaking by Sam Jaffe. <br /> <br /> Back when this film was made, filmmaker Jack Warner said: You want to send a message, use Western Union. Yet it seems that the messages fly fast and furious in "Gunga Din". I now look at the movie and wonder if audiences were meant to wonder again what Gunga Din was when he led Cutter to the golden temple. Was he really revenge against his British authorities? Would he have been justified, especially since MacChesney's cold treatment of him? When Col. Weed the Eulogy, is the poem by Rudyard Kipling on which the film is loosely based, in the direction of imperialism's folly, to prove it to someone who proved a better man than I in the finale? What made them speak of Guru's great speech delivered in perfect English: "You swore an oath of soldiers to die for faith, what is your country, England. Well, I can die for my country and my faith as easy as you ... India, farewell. "Of course, the same character also gives his brutal followers:" Kill for the love of the kill! Kill for the love of Kali! Kill! Kill! Kill! It means that we have allowed him to hate and root the British and save the questions about what it all means. </p> <p> What does "Gunga Din" mean to me, most of me, is the fastest, surest 90-minute rush video. Snyer never found his golden temple, but there is one for all of us who sees "Gunga Din".
