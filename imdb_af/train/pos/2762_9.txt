This film is near my favorite piece of celluloid. There really isn't much I need or want to say here. Except for "See this movie" and "Enjoy the excellent work by Daniel and Pascal", which through this neat, funny and heartbreaking story about "your eighth day" spend - your own day! <br /> <br /> Watching this movie made me think about how I spend my eighth day = my life! It seems that some of our precious time is wasting things to do what we think we should do. Either if it pleases a career or just uses TV shows and ball games. What we tend to miss is the satisfaction of being something for another person - making a difference. About taking room and time to be and live spontaneously - NOW! (on the eighth day). At least that was what I got from the eighth day.
