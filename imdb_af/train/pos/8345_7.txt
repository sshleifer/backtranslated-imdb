I recently got I.Q. and although I'm not a romantic comedy type gall, I think it's just a nice and sweet movie to watch. So many movies in my opinion lack honesty. You know that feeling when you watch a movie and you just feel robbed because it takes something out of the story and it was as if the director just threw it together as if it were dirty? The story between the scientists is a sweet and funny one. How they held together and tried to help them Tim Robbins's character becomes clever. I love the love story between Tim and Meg, because it was simple and gained a good point in terms of love, "nothing that looks like". I would recommend it for a Sunday morning. <br /> <br /> 7/10
