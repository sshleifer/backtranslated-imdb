In Christian Duguay's movie, Hitler: The Rise of Evil, Hitler's early years of life and politics are successfully shown with some small historical flaws and some exaggeration. It is quite natural that a Hollywood movie contains such things. The main purpose of production is the income they will get from the movie. Although such mistakes may disappoint some members of the audience who believe that everything through the book should be done, I believe that most of them fit well with the rest of the movie and make it more interesting. We should not forget that this movie is not a documentary. Who cares, how did his dog die anyway. <br /> <br /> During the movie, Hitler is portrayed as a psychologically unstable figure that gets very angry and very passionate about his ideals. But he was not portrayed as a super-villain, but more like an ambitious politician. I believe this is a nice perspective as the movie is not contaminated by tons of negative emotions and it made the movie slightly objective. Yes, he was a little angry, and his methods were rough, but he was still a man, not a completely crazy figure depicted in "Inglorious Bastards". I believe it made the movie more realistic, even with a few inaccuracies in the historical facts. <br /> <br /> The flow of history is nicely reflected to spectators. Although the film's focus was on Hitler, we also had the opportunity to see what is happening in the country because of these actions by newspapers, discussions of people and the songs in a Jewish cabaret. Society's reaction was also reflected in the film, but it was very limited. Struggles from journalist Fritz Gerlich and ironic plays played in the cabaret were amusing and interesting, but it was all. Most of the time we just saw his followers lift the streets and cheer him. <br /> <br /> Another thing missing in the movie is information about the origin of his hatred for Jews. In the beginning of the movie some ideas were given about this, but they were pretty superficial. Suddenly he was a politician giving speeches about the need for extinction of Jews. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, Hitler: The Rise of Evil cannot be considered as an excellent movie that everyone wants, but it is not unsatisfactory. If you can set directors to change the history of cash, it's an interesting movie that successfully reflects Hitler's personality.
