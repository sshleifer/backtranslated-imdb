Sweet romantic drama / comedy about Stewart and Sullavan writing love letters together without one knowing who the other is. Of course they work together and can't stand each other. You can guess the rest. It is beautifully performed by the entire cast (especially Sullavan, Stewart and Frank Morgan), has a witty, intelligent writing and looks absolutely stunning. It takes place in Budapest and is shot in Hollywood, but I believed I saw Budapest! Everything looks so perfect and dreamy. One of a kind movie. Don't miss it!
