A talking parrot is not a very imaginative idea for a new movie, but Paulie becomes a simple idea in a brilliant, heartwarming movie that will entertain the whole family. It manages the gap between sentimental trash and cruel hardness during the separation of Marie and Paulie, and all the events in the film lead to an extremely satisfactory emotional conclusion. The animal training is well done - everyone will be affected if Paulie spreads his wings and flies for the first time. Paulie is a great character and has had much more success, although this film was not a highlight of 1998, as opposed to Private Ryan. This hour and a half will surely be a pleasant one and one you will remember. Paulie's story is a moving, sad, happy and interesting one. From the moment he is first seen when united with his original owner, you'll enjoy following him and watching him learn about friendship and the fury of life that way. Not one to be missed if you have any heart or emotion. 9/10
