Go into this movie, I heard good things about it. From this I don't really get surprised or disappointed. Simon Pegg plays a very childish character, just like his other movies. There were a few laughs here and there - nothing too funny. Probably my favorite parts of the movie is when he is dancing in the club scene. I have to try it the next time, next time I find myself in a club. A few stars here and there including: Megan Fox, Kirsten Dunst, X-Files chick, and Jeff Bridges. I found it quite amusing to see a cameo look of Thandie Newton in a scene. She is, of course, in a previous movie with Simon Pegg, Run Fatboy Run. I see it as a throw, you'll enjoy it to some extent or find it a bit dull. I can add, Kirsten Dunst is rich in this movie. : 3
