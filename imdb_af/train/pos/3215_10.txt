It was excellent. Get packaged, action packed, and perfect for Kurt Russel. I loved this movie, it earned more than 5.3 or so stars. This movie is the story of an obsolete soldier who learns that there is more to life than soldiers, and people who learn that there is a time to fight, a need to defend. I cried, laughed and was mostly in awe of this story. Good writing for an action movie, and the plot was appropriate and fairly solid. The end was not contentious, but it was still excellent. If you're escaping from New York, or for the undercover root, this movie is for you. Not an unnecessary amount of gore or violence, it wasn't hard to look at that. Something for everyone.
