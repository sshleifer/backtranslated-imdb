Tom the cat, Jerry the mouse, and Spike the Dog (here called Butch, his third name, his second "Killer") decide to love a peace treaty for everyone. It's strange and a little unnatural to see them all so girlfriend like this and their friend looks the same. But by the end, due to a disagreement over a steak, everything is again normal and everything is how it should be. This short is the second of the three on the new Spotlight DVD to be edited and I have no idea why this one was. This cartoon can be found on the disk one of the Spotlight collection DVD of "Tom & Jerry" <br /> <br /> My Grade: B
