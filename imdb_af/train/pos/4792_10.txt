The Straight Story is a multilevel exploration of the goodness and beauty of America. At one level, a slow step through the heartland, it's good residents and amber grain, on another level to grow old and remember what's important (and actively forget what). David Lynch gives us time in this movie and helps me remember that so much can be said with silence. A remarkable film that will gently rest with me.
