Very smooth, lots of Pre-Hays code, and still very sassy. I would highly recommend watching this movie, even if you are not a Stynwyck fan. She's funny, she's sexy, she's hardworking. And love what she's going! <br /> <br /> Barbara Stynwyck is fantastic as a few floozy people in the world, perfectly portrayed by a bank building. John Wayne (in a suit!) Play one of her first conquests. <br /> <br /> The last three minutes are a show, but the sets, the lines, the clothes all add to a whole movie to rise vertically in the horizontal position.
