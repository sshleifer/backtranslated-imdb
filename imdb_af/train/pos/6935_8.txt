James Stewart stars in a classic western tale of revenge related to the fate of the films that the Winchester gun stares at. Stewart is obviously about to add some cold hard obsession to his usual laid back cowboy. The story follows the fate of a Winchester rifle and its owners after winning a competition through our hero and stolen by the man he hunted. <br /> <br /> We meet a variety of players, rifle fighters, Indian traders and bank robbers as we follow the guns through Indian battles, bank robbers, etc. The supporting role players are all solid with Dan Durya who, as Waco Johnny Dean, sticks out the live-wire gunfighter with an itchy trigger finger. Also as a trivia note is a very early appearance of Rock Hudson as an Indian chief. <br /> <br /> The end performance is a classic, tense rifle battle that is fought long and long in and around a rocky outlook. Throw in some good old western action, fist battles, shooting and horse races, making for a raging western adventure. 8/10
