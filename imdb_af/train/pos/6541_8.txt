As a bulk in my mid-40s, I'm not even close to any of Nancy Drew's key demographics, but I was pleasantly surprised by the movie this afternoon. So, could I say, the two sixty silver hair ladies were in my drive. The older man who left the theater just in front of me praised the movie especially to the 20-year-old female master (who said she saw the movie the previous night.) <br /> <br /> More about The Point , however: In the queue just before me there were nine - they count, nine-ten-year-old girls standing side by side, popcorn and hot dogs and sweets back and forth and giggling through the previews. <br /> <br /> Once the movie started, they instantly settled to look .... <br /> <br /> .... and didn't go as much as until the final credits didn't start role. <br /> <br /> It's not a perfect movie; It does not pay its high school subplots, it is not quite self-assured, and its thugs are just a hair too far to criticize incompetent. But the adaptation of the source material is essentially respectful, the plot is quite well-connected and it treads well between the sins of excessive cheesiness and excessive modernization. Last but not least, Emma Roberts carries the movie with exciting grace - Josh Flitter's excellent timing, despite that, is Roberts's movie, and she pulls it off nicely. Her Nancy Drew is the direct ancestor of Kristen Bell's Veronica Mars, and the film is also a linear descendant of Jodie Foster's early and underrated "Candleshoe". <br /> <br /> In today's market, it's a rarity: a family movie that respects its viewer's intelligence. As such, it won't be for everyone's taste - but for what it is, it's the best movie of its kind in decades.
