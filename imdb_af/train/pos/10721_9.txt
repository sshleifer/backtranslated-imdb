It's one of the most guilty fun movies ever! <br /> <br /> I'm ashamed to say that my favorite character is TISH, but still enjoy watching her make her "super cool" outfit with a "totally bitchin" band and stick on the rhinestone on her face. <br /> <br /> But anyway, the movie is actually one of the few "family" movies that interest you. I know the start is going to happen, especially if you know what's going to happen, but the second half is probably one of the most nervous systems in a family movie. <br /> <br /> I will not rise up for millions of people and proclaim to love this movie, it is actually an embarrassment to rent it, but I will recognize it here with the internet to behind pitch. <br /> <br />
