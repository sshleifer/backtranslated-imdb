I rather bought the video late in my collection and would probably have saved a lot of money if I bought it earlier. It always replaces anything else about the "Cosmo's moon" nights. Cher and Olympia deserve their awards, but it's really a flawless ensemble performance from an excellent script. What? You don't know what a "Cosmo's moon" is?
