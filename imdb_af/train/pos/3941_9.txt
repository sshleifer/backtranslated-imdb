Young Mr. Lincoln is the first film of the director / star collaboration of John Ford and Henry Fonda. I remember years ago that Fonda told me that as a young actor, he was understandably nervous about playing Abraham Lincoln and fearing he wouldn't face the challenge. <br /> <br /> Before joining John Ford, John Ford says he's not going to play the Big Emancipator, but just a jack-leg prairie lawyer. It is established. Fonda played a role that directed John Ford into a classic movie. <br /> <br /> It's not a biographical movie from Lincoln. It used to be in the healthy era with Walter Huston and a year after young Mr. Lincoln, Raymond Massey, the Pulitzer Prize Winner Game by Robert Sherwood Abe Lincoln in Illinois. Massey still remains the definite Lincoln. <br /> <br /> But as Ford said, Fonda was not the Great Emancipator, but just a small town attorney in Illinois. The film covers about 10 years of Lincoln's early life. We see him in a general store clerk, get some law books from an immigrant pioneer family whose road he would later cross into the story. And his romance with Ann Rutledge with her early death, Lincoln left a most melancholy being. <br /> <br /> Early 10 years ahead and Lincoln is now a practicing lawyer who is starting to get acquainted. He has served a few terms in the legislature, but he is back in private practice, not really sure if politics is for him. <br /> <br /> That's where most of the action takes place. The two sons of that family got the law books from behind when they were accused of murder. He offers to defend them. And not an ordinary murder, but one of a deputy sheriff. <br /> <br /> The trial itself is fiction, but the gambit used in defense of Richard Cromwell and Eddie Quillan, who played the two boys, is based on a real case that Lincoln defended. I will no longer say. <br /> <br /> Unlike the performances, the great power of Young is Mr. Lincoln the way John Ford celebrates the atmosphere and atmosphere of a small Illinois prairie town in a fourth of July. It's almost like watching a news rule. And it was the mood of the country itself, young, alive and growing. <br /> <br /> Fans of John Ford movies will recognize two music themes that will be repeated in later movies. During the romantic interlude at the start with Fonda and Pauline Moore playing Ann Rutledge, the background music is the same theme used in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance for Vera Miles. And at a dance, the song Beautiful Susan Brown that Fonda and Marjorie Weaver who play Mary Todd are the same one, Fonda danced with Cathy Downs, in My Darling Clementine at the dance for setting up a church in Tombstone. <br /> <br /> For two reasons, Lincoln will forever be a favorite of biographers and playwrights. The first is that he is the living embodiment of our own American mythology about people who rise from under their power through their own efforts. In fact, young Mr. Lincoln, graphically shows Lincoln's background. And secondly, the fact that he was our president during the greatest crisis in American history and that he made a particularly good and moral decision to liberate free slaves during the Civil War, although needed for political reasons. His murder ensured his place in history. <br /> <br /> In addition to Fonda and others I mentioned, special praise must also be given to Fred Kohler, Jr. and Ward Bond, the two townships, Kohler the murder victim, and Connect the Prosecutor. Also Donald Meek as the prosecutor and Alice Brady in what appears to be her last film as the pioneer mother of Cromwell and Quillan. And a very good performance by Spencer Charters who specializes in the rustic characters as the judge. <br /> <br /> For a movie capturing the drama and romance of the time it's set, you can't do better than Young Mr. Lincoln.
