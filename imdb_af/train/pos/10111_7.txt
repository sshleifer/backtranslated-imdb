The Haunted World by Edward D. Wood, Jr. is not a very good documentary. Aesthetically, it is slim and inexpensive, the people in it outline touchlines that make it very unfocused and cohesive, but it adds to the charm. I say this because it is a documentary about a strange ball that made oddball pictures and surrounds himself with fellow oddballs and as such there is no other way to describe the life and career of the man and his crew . There are some summaries of insight into both the genius and the inability of Wood, and the portrayal of both features is a recognition of the authenticity of the documentary. Overall, it is worth guaranteeing a watch for the Wood fan and that of the theater in general, but don't expect brilliance here. Expect a documentary made after Wood's own heart.
