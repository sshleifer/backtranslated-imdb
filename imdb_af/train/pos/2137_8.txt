It's much more than the beautiful story of the middle-aged man who discovers the pleasure of ballroom dancing (though so). This is the story of one person learning to love life again, passing all the pressure of work and money to discover joy again. The bonus in this movie is a fascinating insight into the slowly changing attitudes of modern Japan towards everything from ballroom to physical contact. There are scenes that make you laugh aloud ... some where you want to get up and tango ... and many others where you will just feel good. <br /> <br /> It's a good introduction to contemporary Japanese movie entertainment for those who might be under the impression that all Japanese movies are "heavy" and inaccessible. <br /> <br />
