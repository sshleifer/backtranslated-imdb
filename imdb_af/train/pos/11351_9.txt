Excellent movie. The whole picture was filmed in Budapest, so I feel proud. My little problem was that the trains in the film belong to the Hungarian State Railways (M√ÅV), and it is clear that they were used in large trains, not in the local railway line. According to the story, Chikatilo has his victims in local train stations. In addition, the film is wonderful.
