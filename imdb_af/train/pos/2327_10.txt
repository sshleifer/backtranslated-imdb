A 14-year-old girl develops her first serious loved one on the 17-year-old boy who lives close by while trying to overcome her feelings of inadequacy compared to her older sister. This is the simple starting point of this beautiful, poetic comedy film by director Robert Mulligan. Mulligan is known for the former director of the summer of '42 in 1971 and a Mockingbird in 1962, two giants of the upcoming lifetime genre. Here, he is leading newcomers: Reese Witherspoon, in her film debut, as the 14-year-old girl; Emily Warfield, as the older sister; Jason London, court, 17-year-old boy. Reese Witherspoon is surprisingly good at her film debut, which displays every emotion a 14-year-old girl feels to experience young love and hurt. He never showed a false note. Warfield and London are just as good as well. The film accurately shows each adolescent's thoughts or feelings about love with sad sensitivity, which never exceeds once. Kudos to Jenny Wingfield's autobiographical script; It is one of the very few films about young love that are honest and consistent in tone without being emotionally cheating or sensational. The music is wonderfully simple, emphasizing the tone and the mood from scene to scene, but never becomes obtrusive. The beautiful cinematography is by famous horror director Freddie Francis, who was in his 70's when it was shot. Tess Harper and Sam Waterston play the girls' parents with dead-end accuracy for 1957, caring, strict and emotionally simple. Gail Strickland is also good as the boy's mother. There are feelings to sort out, lessons to learn, and truths in this lovely movie that packs an emotional blunt. To date, it is Robert Mulligan's last film. This is one of the best films of 1991. **** of 4 stars.
