It is a beautiful movie that is performed by all players. It will make you laugh and it will make you cry. The very end of the movie misses me every time. If you want to see a good movie, this is it. Jimmy Stewert provides a wonderful imaginative performance and Frank Morgan like Mr Matuschek spellbinding. Morgan's variety of character is nothing short of wonderful. William Tracy as Pepi is great comic relief and delivers the movies' main lines and performances. Felix Bressart delivers a fantastic show like Perovitch, a staggering shopkeeper who's life's ambition to please those with whom he works. This is a simple story of how close co-workers can be and how two people who have great hostility towards each other fall in love with unusual circumstances.
