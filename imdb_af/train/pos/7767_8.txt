Stack had to receive the Academy Award for this performance period. It's a crime he hasn't done. Wonderful how he humanizes a rich, worthless character. <br /> <br /> Dorothy Malone earned a well-deserved Oscar award for her performance. In fact, all the actors in this movie are excellent. <br /> <br /> The plot begins with a taxi ride, then a plane ride, and then continues on an emotional ride that keeps your interest throughout. You'll be entertained! <br /> <br /> However, it's just a blatant soap opera. One-dimensional, 100-percent soaps. You can call it the ultimate soap, because the acting is so thorough about the material. Excellent act, well-directed, but strict are his soap genre. I don't even call it a melodrama (like "Mildred Pierce" or "Imitation of Life"). Although you do not deny the great entertainment of this movie, you can only imagine what this talented player and director could achieve with more substantive topics.
