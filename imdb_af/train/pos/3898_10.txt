Hilarious hardly begins to describe this one of a kind Tour-de-Star-Wars force (Luke: how strong? Father: the power of a small pony), in which he is the master, he doesn't even break a sweat , terribly saving himself mascara leaks - and this is with nearly 2 hours of his way through history, his birthplace, Europe, and more. <br /> <br /> Van Heimlich's middle of the night, "I found out a maneuver!" after the British Empire's ".. do you have a flag ..?" and antique manslaughter, "Jeff! The God of Cookies!" and much more, it's funny on the fish-flop-on-the-floor-to-jump-start-your-lungs. <br /> <br /> And I confess that I have been playing the video over the years As a British transvestite rises, standing on a chair, it is a slow rental, especially one that goes back ten years. And yet the material is not only timeless, but almost oracle-like, and today's day is nothing more than a fortified, more funny / sad version of where we were a decade ago. Although it is thought of, it can only be coincidental.
