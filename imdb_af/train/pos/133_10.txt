A few years ago, a friend of one of his other friends got a video with the Michael Mann movie 'Heat' on it. After we finished the movie and about to get up, we saw that there was another movie, hard on the envelope's envelope. The owner didn't update it. Nevertheless, we were all glued to our seats by his separate opening, which had no credits. <br /> <br /> About two hours later I was just sitting there wondering: how could I not hear about this masterpiece? . <br /> <br /> This movie was Europe. Lars von Trier woke up the film noir from the dead, spent the reality with intentional obvious sets, but often there were haunting similarities with post-war German photographs I saw. And then the difficult cuts! <br /> <br /> The story itself is a difficult moral odyssey that doesn't have a happy ending. A young American pacifist of German descent comes to Germany after the war, with the intention of doing well to pay for the bombs that his compatriots dropped. But he usually meets distrust and self-destructive challenge. He rents with Zentropa, an eating and sleeping car company (modeled on Mitropa), whose owner is one of the Nazi co-workers the Occupiers whitewash. Our hero falls in love with his daughter - who later appears to be a member of the Werewolf, Nazi-after-war terrorists. If he no longer understands the world (or just Europeans), in his anger, he blows a railway bridge under a train that he just saved. <br /> <br /> As a final note, for historical correctness: In The Real World, the werewolf was nowhere important as the film implies. They were mostly a last Nazi propaganda coup. After an SS unit killed the head of Allied-Occupied Aachen, two months before the capital, the Nazis announced the creation of the entire legions of saboteurs and terrorists. They will be ready to fight the rules, the Werewolf. But just a few hundred of most Hitler youth received training, and two or three times were deployed to presumably murder communists or forced ambassadors in Bavarian villages. They had a lasting fear of residents, with Hitler's death and the end of the war. <br /> <br /> However, the Werewolf propaganda had a great influence on the occupants. They feared the Werewolf everywhere, presumably behind a serious accident - but without exception, a cause was later found (ignored by some recent pseudoscientists). For example, when a guest exploded in the police chief of bombed Bremen, or when the Soviet military commander died in a motorcycle accident in Berlin. The effect was strongest on the Soviet Union, who arrested tens of thousands (mostly children!) 'Conditional' suspected of being Werewolf and ending in prison camps where many of them died.
