It was one of my favorite sets when I was a kid. The Swedish broadcaster decided to broadcast it again a few summer when I completed my first semester of the medical school. I was surprised to see the depth in which the organs were explained. Certainly, some things are simplified, but most of them were correct (though made 22 years ago!) And quite understandable. I suggest that all medical students who should see it soon should look. It's a great way to learn some basic medical words, for example. Now I'm in my 7th semester and I think I'll watch the series again as soon as I bought the DVD box :-)
