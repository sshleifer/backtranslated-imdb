First of all I must say that I am Portuguese and it is not usually for me, spend my time watching Portuguese movies, probably one every year or even ... <br /> <br /> ... and the reason for this is the almost general idea between the Portuguese people that the national photos are terrible, is very close to the worst ever made! But in the last decade it has surprised me when we get back to the funny of the 40s when "Leão da Estrela" and "Costa do Castelo" were the world's best of their time, with films like Pulsação Zero or "Black Nula", both by director Fernando Fragata and also by some actors and music in common. <br /> <br /> This one is also good, not the same kind, because it is not a real comedy; In fact, it is officially a drama, a woman's drama, it has some unexpectedly funny parts, the cause of humorous characters or hilarious things that happen to them, such as the hypothetical journey to the Caribbean just to be laid . <br /> <br /> The plot works and can surprise us a few times; the actors are good, the places are regular as the score; but the truth is that it all makes sense, then we can see it as a good effort for the national film. It seems to start out of the ashes as the phoenix. <br /> <br /> If you're a Portuguese movie, surely you can take better option, but it's still one that needs to be measured.
