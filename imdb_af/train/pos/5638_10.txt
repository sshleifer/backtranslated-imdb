I really enjoyed this movie. Britney is an excellent role model for teenagers and should be more appreciated. This movie is about the next of your dreams and never gives up, no matter what people can do or say to discourage and criticize you. Holly fulfills her dreams, just like Britney. <br /> <br /> There are times in each one's lives when people judge for what they are not who they are. If you watch this movie, you will understand that you are special in your own way and that you have to follow your dreams, whatever happens. <br /> <br /> I want to thank Britney for encouraging me and my friends to follow our dreams. She would never know how much it meant to me. Bravo Britney. You are the greatest !!!
