One of the best musicals made, one that is timeless and worth seeing time and time again. Delicious! The play, especially by Ron Moody as Fagin, is wonderful. Costumes are beautiful .... even the loose children. <br /> <br /> The two young girls playing Oliver and The Artful Dodger are wonderfully talented. Oliver Reed does a good job depicting Bill Sykes where you can't help but hopes he'll come to a terrible end .... what he does. <br /> <br /> The dance is cleverly choreographed and is fascinating. Oliver can keep his own like the My Fair Lady, The Sound of Music, Oklahoma, etc. A movie for the whole family.
