After a slow start, BRUCE ALMIGHTY is a very funny movie that has something positive to say. It was not one of Jim Carrey's best achievements, but he was still OK. Morgan Freeman was just like God. Jennifer Aniston had a few good moments. I miss Steve Correll on "THE DAILY SHOW!" <br /> <br /> I like director Tom Shadyac's choices of movies. He also did LIAR LIAR, PATCH ADAMS, and THE USEFUL PROFESSOR. In all three and in Bruce Almighty he takes a big comedy star and tells a human story with him. A director who knows comedy can get the talent he gets, and can tell a sensible and intelligent story. It's hard to find. <br /> <br /> My biggest complaint is that they had to use more biblical references. I just remember three specific Biblical references and they were the three funniest parts of the whole movie. My guess is that the first few concepts of the script had more Biblical references, but they were cut out because the producers were afraid of breaking people. It's too bad because I thought it was a missed opportunity. <br /> <br /> My Grade: <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
