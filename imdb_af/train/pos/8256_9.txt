See this movie at the Vancouver Film Festival and thought it was deadly smart, stylish and FUNNY. <br /> <br /> The movie was ROCK SOLID. Great work by Carrie Anne Moss, Dylan Baker, Tim Blake Nelson, Billy Connelly and Alexia Fast. <br /> <br /> Rarely, I thought of the movie for days after I saw it. <Br /> <br /> Authors, Dennis Heaton, Robert Chomiak and Andrew Currie have laid many political sub-texts - but didn't hit you on the head. <br /> <br /> The world they created had depth, and made sense. There is a crazy carnivorous spirit to this movie. <br /> <br /> FIDO is guaranteed to heal eagerness. <br /> <br /> Love it !!!
