All dogs go to Heaven is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I only saw it when I was 3. Now I am 12 and I hired it, it reminds me of things and it brings back so many memories, these were the days. I love the music, I love when Charlie arrives in Heaven, I love the song "Let me be surprised". I love how Charlie looks and his voice, Bert Reynolds can only play Charlie's voice so well. I love this movie, the first one is the best because it is so original and good. It really brings back memories that no one can describe, not even me. If only I could go back those days. I love the characters. If this is the way the memories come back when I think 12 how I will feel when I'm like 19, I hope I can see it when I'm older. When I first saw it, I never knew I would really look back and feel that way, I hope it will be available to watch. I'm so happy that this movie was made and the wonderful idea came to mind and heart. On a scale of 1-10 I will give it perfect. It's a wonderful movie. It is so difficult to explain the feeling when I get older and if I have children, I hope they can experience this feeling.
