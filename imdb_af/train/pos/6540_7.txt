To be honest, I had to see this movie backwards, didn't expect much, but hey, I wasn't deceived, I had a good time. <br /> <br /> I would say this movie is a way of fresh breeze, despite facts they have tried to modernize Nancy Drew, but it has brought me to this youth movies of the 60-70s of Europe and Quebec Remember where they manage to communicate with adults. In this case, a 16-year-old teenager tries to do justice by solving a mystery about the death of an actress who died 25 years ago. Anyway, since her father was in Hollywood, why not rent a house with a mystery behind doors? Well, at least Emma Roberts does a good job here. Just like the knobs, which were first brought naively to support his sister's pranks after Nancy, but in the end Nancy got quite cool enough to stay with her, even with her affairs. <br /> <br /> The rest of the supporting role is fantastic, and was fortunate to see Rachael Leigh Cook this time in a different role: a single mother (she did this in Family Rescue, but this time playing she's an adult woman ...) Anyway, don't dump it, it's fun!
