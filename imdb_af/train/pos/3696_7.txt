Although I live in Minnesota, I recently studied in France and left this bizarre gem of a movie. <br /> <br /> This movie was great to say the least. A creative and unique film, the various directors, each borrowed something different from their interpretation of love in the City of Light. The first instinct is to fit each of these little stories into a complete storyline, much like 2003's Love Actually. However, this effort obsolete the magic of each individual segment. When taken at face value, the love stories, along with each of the short segments as their own individual movie, tell a beautiful message. <br /> <br /> The movie is strikingly bizarre, sometimes to the point of confusion - and each individual segment can be difficult to follow. Nevertheless, after a viewer who carefully considers each of the segments, the short plot lines become clear after a short time. The confusion is almost intriguing; It keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting for what will come next. That makes the viewer wonder: "Did it really just happen?" but let them be satisfied that it did. It's the kind of movie where the viewer, at the exit of the theater, can't really decide whether they love it or have hated it. The initial reaction is to watch it again and again, just to see that these individual lives merge into a cinematic masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The interesting decision to make the movie multilingual adds something to the spectrum of people who can relate. This adds to the reality of the movie - here the American tourists speak English, the Paris French, and so on. The number of people who include the film leads to an understanding of the international language of love. <br /> <br /> From disease to supernatural, the love of parents to the love of men, this film covers all the basics of romantic storytelling. In its beautiful and peculiar way, every unique event falls in a way of telling a story: that of all kinds, sizes, nationalities and forms of love.
