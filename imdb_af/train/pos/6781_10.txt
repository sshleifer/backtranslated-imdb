When an actor has to play the role of an actor, fiction or facts, the task becomes much more difficult than playing a role. In a double life, Ronald Coleman surpassed himself as Anthony John, the tortured double personality. He established all his talent and sincerity in that character. The facial expressions, manners, gait and attitude spoke eloquently about what Anthony John was going through while playing Othello on stage. Coleman also did very well as a Shakespeare actor in those short scenes like Othello who were part of the movie of a movie. Closups of Coleman's face as Othello tortured by doubt about the fidelity of Desdemona were worth watching in their own scene. In addition, his character's stage eclipse and only one can reach Coleman's depth of acting perception. It was like Spenser Tracy as dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, besides this dual role, was much more profound. Shelly Winters looks so nice, vulnerable and beautiful at the same time and has added her talent to the movie. It is believed that Ronald Coleman played his part in this film above all others he played and won the Best Actor Oscar in 1947. I will see this movie repeatedly and never get bored.
