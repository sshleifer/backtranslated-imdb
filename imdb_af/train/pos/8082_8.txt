It's been a while since I watched this LOTR. I am currently looking for a copy to buy. Bakshi's work is fairly true for the original work. The visual sources grow and sometimes haunt. <br /> <br /> Disadvantages? Sometimes the movie is confusing or confused. There is one or two times where the storyline slows down to a crawl. But overall - buy this movie. It's great for kids, adults and collectors.
