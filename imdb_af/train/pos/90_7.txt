Yes, the poster is quite a horrible piece of work. <br /> <br /> I thought the movie was OK ... nothing really outstanding ... I just hoped he would be a hardcore druggy and totally his dirty life. <br /> <br /> Ahh, but it can't happen to rich kids, can it now? Not to the son of a wealthy businessman who holds big ballroom parties and has a nice comfortable lawn in front of the mini house. No ... the child is too good to lose sight of his life. . After all, who will drive the brand new motorcycle and who will go to the law school? <br /> <br /> Oh, the poor, small, rich children ... in their beautiful, beautiful home, with their ivy-league schools, ultra-clean homes and social parties ... what will the world without them do? <br /> <br /> I hope everyone gets addicted to drugs, passes their lives and ends in jail ... so maybe we can see movies that don't turn everything around the arm, little rich boys and girls. of the surreal world.
