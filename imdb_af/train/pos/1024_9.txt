I wasn't always a fan, but the show grew on me. It was only after season 5 that I saw the wealth of the show. They eventually ended Daniel Jackson's search for his wife, and eventually most of the Go, Ould System Lords, were killed by rival Lords, SG-1 or others. <br /> <br /> By Season 5, Stargate SG-1, began to spring. With the new writers and the attention of manufacturer Peter Deleuise, the show has become increasingly solid. <br /> <br /> The characters also became birthday. Colonel Jack O'Neill was the stereotypical hero with emotional baggage. After his son Charlie was killed in a shooting accident with O'Neill's weapon. He decided to end his own life by going to Abydos to meet the Go'ould RA. The character offers little growth for any actor and actor Richard Dean Anderson chose to play him straight to protect emotional stumbling blocks to protect himself. just allow his closest friends to enter. <br /> <br /> Amanda Tapping joined the film as captain Samantha Carter. She was a feminist on the verge, ready to fight any man who doubted her ability to do her job. Although this character had little room to grow, Tapping did a good job concentrating on Carter's strengths. She took the time to get a basic understanding of some of the things Carter was talking about, so that she could present the character intelligently. <br /> <br /> Christopher Judge joined the alien Teal'c cast. Teal'c was a stranger called the Jaffa. The child (snake like creatures) would have brought himself into the Jaffa until they grew to the point when it would be inserted into another life form. The Jaffa would die. Teal'c was the first prime minister of Apophis's army. To know that Apophis was not a god like Go, he realized the genocide their armies had on the galaxy. Finally, after having had enough, he and Jack O'Neill freed their team along with a couple of innocent people. After arriving on earth, he realized that the earth was the planet he was looking for. Who would help him fight the Go'ould. Christopher Judge did quite a bit of character. Teal'c is a wise fighter, of whom he has learned much from his teacher Master Bra'tac. The show would not be complete without Master Bra'tac played by Tony Amandola. He is also a rock. Eventually, he became an adviser to most of the SG-1, especially Daniel Jackson. <br /> <br /> Don S. Davil was with General George Hammand from the start. Davis did an incredible job with Hammond, making him sympathetic and normal. He does his job, has a wife, boys and girls and grandchildren. You can really say he's the anchor of the base. Simply, I'll die for that man. If it's not allowed by its superiors to provide troops to support teams of the world. He will go himself. He does not leave anyone behind. <br /> <br /> I have dr. Daniel Jackson last saved, because this character, I believe, has grown the most in the ten or eleven years. When choosing Shanks, I don't think the producer realized how strong Shanks would be and now that people are talking about Jackson, they're not talking about Spader, they're talking about Shanks. In the early years, the Jackson character came across as a shutter. That's why I probably wasn't a fan. As the seasons have pasted, the character has become stronger. It gave him confidence. In the end, from season 10, the Jackson character matured to the point of becoming a hero himself. He still monitors the group's ethics. He still leads information to move any mission forward. Aseaology, History, Culture and Inquiry are part of his being. He's determined. Although a man of peace, he has to the point that using his weapons is the only way to resolve a disagreement. <br /> <br /> Other characters include: Vala Mal Doran (Claudia Black) and Colonel Cameron Mitchell (Ben Browder), new lead of SG-1. Both actors come from a series called Farscape and why they are merged are any guessing bodies. I see little difference between Mitchell and Crichton (Farscape character). Black's character is simply off the wall. Definitely different from her soldier like character Arin Soon.
