To all the haters out there: condemning a single episode TV series is judging a whole book by reading the first few pages. That said, I was a big fan of SCG, thought it was the best TV drama (not just sci-fi) on the air. But it was time to end and the story continues. I liked the SCR epilogue "The Plan", but it raised so many new questions as it answered. So I eagerly expected Caprica and I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> I was hoping it wouldn't try to be another SCR, and I was glad Caprica was something different, and I found the story exciting in a different way than burning space struggle, explosions and scientific special effects (don't get me wrong, I like those things too). Eric Stolz and Esai Morales give solid performances, and Alessandra was just wonderful. I can't wait until next week.
