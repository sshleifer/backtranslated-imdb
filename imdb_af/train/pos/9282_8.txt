In Iran, women are not allowed into soccer matches. Officially, this is because they are spared from the vulgar language and behavior of the male audience. But of course it's about sexism. Women are lower forms of people. <br /> <br /> Some brave girls resist it and try to get into the stadium using different tricks. They are captured by soldiers and held in a sort of cage until police come up. <br /> <br /> Despite the insane situation, it's a movie with lots of humor. It is also encouraging to see how people always find different ways to combat oppression. You will be touched at the same time as you laugh a lot. Good work by director Jafar Panahi. It is in many ways a heroic comedy.
