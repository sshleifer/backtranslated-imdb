Darius Goes West is a film depicting American belief that everything is possible if you try hard enough. This wonderful fun and sometimes heartbreaking movie shows a young man who never expected, but wanted to see what was beyond the boundaries of his beautiful city, Athens, GA. Darius wanted to see the sea. His long friends, Logan, Ben and several other good friends decided to make Darius's wish come true. They started small. Ben & Logan's mother started an e-mail campaign to relieve Darius's condition: Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and to raise funds for Darius to take Darius to see not only the sea but to this great United States. see. To say the young college friends managed to bring hope and awareness to this dreaded disease would be an understatement. They realized Darius's dream and then some. They kept their lives in jeopardy while having Darius love, care, and lots of fun, while Darius helped to see how he could show the same qualities to others who suffer from DMD. Darius also volunteered for the Red Cross - sitting in his chair to collect money (along with his friends) outside a local grocery store. His wonderful smile tells the world that dreams have come true - all you need is hope and a group of colleagues to support and care for you. Give Darius and all the guys an Oscar - no one else deserves it anymore. Martha Sweeney.
