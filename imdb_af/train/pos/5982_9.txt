One of my favorite movies. It has everything - rocking soundtrack, courtesy of Eddie Clark, ex Motorhead, lots of action, lots of laughter, completely ridiculous plot and the most amazing 80's stereotypes as characters. Eddie, the cute guy, who just wants to be alone to be different, Leslie (about as wet as they come), Nuke (rock burnout), Eddie's Mom (pathetic), Roger (the geek) and Ozzy as the preacher (surely he exists in America?). Then there are the boys (rich, evil and stupid) and the girls (empty, in vain and stupid). what more can you ask for? <br /> <br /> Well, first of all, there is Sammi Curr, the rock star, an amalgam of every 80's badass rocker you can think of. What about the rocket firing firearm? Then there's the scene where Sammi pulls the old lady through the TV screen and smashes her. And what does Roger do? Why, ho, just like a good geek. My favorite scene is where Tim Hainey gets Sammi's long overdue reward through the wet finger in the plug-magic! <br /> <br /> If you were in the rock in the 80's, or just unloving movies like me, check this one. It is available on DVD and very cheap (trick or) so treat yourself.
