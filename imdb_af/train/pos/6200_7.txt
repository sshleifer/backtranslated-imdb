Henry Fool is a better movie. But this is the perfect way to follow a movie like "Henry Fool". "To take Henry seriously, his lies and his mysterious aura. Even the opening shot of 'Henry Fool' when Simon puts his ear on the ground while Henry walks over the hill is more evident through 'Fay Grim'. The top jokes, which are more or less meta-jokes (about writing the movie and jokes themselves), are good, but the opening of the movie is a bit saturated in them. Also shooting Hartley's use of Dutch corners throughout the film, yes, it is intent, but it feels forced and over-exploited, it goes beyond what I would like to mention, annoying. It's a faulty movie, but a must for any Hartley or Henry Fool fan. <br /> <br /> Don't listen to stupid reviews, don't watch this unless you've seen the first movie. The plot, satire and wit of this movie is completely lost if you haven't seen Henry Fool. It's a successor. It's just stupid.
