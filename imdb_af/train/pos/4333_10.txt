see it in preview - a wonderful film-wonderful characterization. Spectacular and intelligent dialogue actors were fantastic. Peter Falk will be an Oscar. Paul Reiser was beautiful. Photography was wonderful. Traveler was at the theater when we saw the film, and he made a lively report on the film making. It was a long dream that he had to write a semi-autobiographical report of relationships between boys and fathers, and more specifically between him and his father. Achieved in a dramatic and entertaining fashion, the supporting role-play was well-chosen and gave the film a sense of family. I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see intelligent drama and great performances.
