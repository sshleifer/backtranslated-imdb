It was a nice, fine movie. This movie is good to just sit down and watch and be entertained. Just a typical Hollywood movie. This movie will never win an Oscar or anything and definitely does not earn one, but I thought it was pretty good. It's kind of like the show 24, but in movie format. If you like the whole thing, we have to stop the terrorist to kill the president's kind of movie, then you'll enjoy this movie. Personally, I think the storyline WAY has been done too much, but The Sentinel adds a bit to the mole in the secret service. All in all, this movie won't leave your jaw to the floor or change your life, but who says every movie should be so good to be good?
