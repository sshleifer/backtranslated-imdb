This TV series was one of the ones I loved when I was a kid. Even though I now see it through the pink shadow glasses of nostalgia, I can still say it was a quality show, very educational but still funny. I didn't see the original French version, just the Swedish. I have no idea how good the dubbing was, it was too long to remember. <br /> <br /> The premise of the show was to show you how the body works. I swear, the school hasn't taught me half of what I know about this show. It also tied other things, as if you were eating unhealthy food and not exercising, with good examples in the body. Who wants another bar of chocolate if you know that miniature virus tanks can penetrate you? : D The cartoon looks pretty, very child-friendly, but done with care. Cells, viruses, electrical signals in the brain, antibodies and all others are represented by smiling cartoon figures, and look closely at how you can expect them to look in the animated body. <br /> <br /> This and The Series on History (especially the environmental review final) were important parts of my childhood. I'm so glad I found them here.
