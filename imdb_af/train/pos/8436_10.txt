Not only was this movie better than all the final season of H: LOTS. But it was better than any movie made for the TV I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> Watch the "Top 250" I see that only one small screen movie made it: How did the Grinch Steal Christmas. I think it's time to raise that group to 2. <br /> <br /> I will admit that the original series had several shows that were better than that, but I didn't care. I just loved to enter the world of the Baltimore murder group again!
