Another Downey must see! If you are an obsession fan like me, you should see this movie! He plays Alex Finch, a 22-year-old Yale degree who realizes that the life he just made is the life he left 26 years before. Alex is the reincarnation of Louie Jeffries, a non-nonsense lawyer who happily married Corrine (Cybil Sheppard). Louie is murdered at their one-year anniversary when hit by a car. He claims to go back just this time in the body of Alex Finch. Performs Robert Downey Jr., a lot of confusion, and a lot of laughter. <br /> <br /> Although this movie is 15 years old, it still makes you wonder if there really is such a thing as revival. And if so, how often do you meet the same soul life after life. I don't know the answer. But I know you should see this movie. It's a riot, and Downey looks so good in a smuggling. This movie makes you believe in love and true love never dies. It is only recycled.
