Dark comedy? Gallows humor? How to make a comedy out of murder? It can be a risky business as the viewer is expected to abandon their moral values ​​and laugh at the denials of a man who kills people. So, the story is rock solid with a good dash of suspended reality to make it work. So, Pierce Brosnan, the Irish's answer to 007, is now thrown as a chain smoke, sex addict, who kills people for life and has a life crisis. He meets a struggling businessman, Greg Kinnear, and after a rocky start he learns he needs a friend. But Greg's happy marriage to Hope Davis and Brosnan sees in him the basic things he doesn't have, love, home and life. Add character actor, Philip Baker Hall as the hit manager and we're on the games. Brosnan is wonderful and rude like the anti-hero and Kinnear as his counterpart, the very human businessman. Hope Davis adds a sparkle as Kinnear's very conventional woman, who is fascinated by this fiancé who drives in their lives. The end is wonderful and with a little surprise for it. You should make the theater feel at least partially good - if you are able to stop being afraid of killing people.
