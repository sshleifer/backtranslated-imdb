I'm so glad I saw this video at the store. I was looking for some happy movies and this one was a real gem. I loved that the movie, a love story of its kind, is not about some beautiful twenty somethings; rather, this is a story of some beautiful sixty-somethings, used to be twenty-somethings. It's a good, well-written, and wonderfully-activated story with fabulous world-flower music in the world. It also has a wonderful surprise for Scottish castle lovers. It made me smile and ready to watch it again, which I did a few times before I switched it on. I highly recommend it.
