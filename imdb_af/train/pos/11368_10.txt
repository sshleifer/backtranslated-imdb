A surprisingly complex and well-crafted study of the "First" serial killer in the USSR. In the days of perestroika, this intense piece is brought to life with the actions of Stephen Reah and Donald Sutherland. <br /> <br /> This investigation by Cicatillo as a murderer is well-rounded and by some of his actions. While it is right to show others, there is a subtlety that is compelling without being openly graphic. Not for the weak of the heart, but as it is the subject, it is often disturbing, but it is essential to develop the most important participants in this fact-based story. <br /> <br /> In an unusual way, HBO provided us an excellent movie. . Congratulations to the director and editor of this great piece. It's in my Top 10 Must see list.
