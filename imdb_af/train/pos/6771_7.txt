so yes this is rather nostalgic looking at the 1 episode, because that's the one episode I definitely remembered. I enjoy watching the first season and yes compared to the action-packed performances we have now, this show looks lame. but frankly I like the "less violent" part of the show and the story line has more dust than the latest. I thought it was interesting that Belisario's Airwolf and JAG have similar themes - the main actor (Hawke and Harm) is looking for an MIA family member (brother, dad). wonder if Robert Belisario's personal life mimics this 2 performance theme. <br /> <br /> Question - Does anyone have pictures of Hawke's cabin. I love the cabin (similar to a dream cabin of mine) and this is one of the scenes I remember about Airwolf.
