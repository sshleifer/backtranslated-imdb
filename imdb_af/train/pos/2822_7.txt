The movie Torrent was a first and a last for Greta Garbo. It was her first American film at MGM, the only studio in the US she will ever work on. It was also the last time someone else was credited to her, it's her foremost man, Ricardo Cortez. <br /> <br /> Torrent is based on the popular Spanish writer Vicente Blasco Ibanez's work, Entre Naranjos. It's about a couple of mismatched lovers, Garbo and Cortez, who can't quite get together, mainly because of Cortez's mother Marta Mattox's turn. <br /> <br /> Mattox is an evil woman who has some ideas about who her son should marry. Remember it is Spain and such regular marriages were still pretty good in those times. Mattox thought Gertrude Olmstead as a daughter-in-law, she was the descendant of Mack Swain, a man who grew rich in pig production. Swain provides a couple of moments of comic relief with his pigs' concern before becoming big, old piglets to be slaughtered. <br /> <br /> Blasco Ibanez had previous novels. The Four Horsemen Of The Apocalypse And Blood And Sand Before. filmed with Rudolph Valentino in the lead. It might have been interesting if Valentino did this to Garbo, but he could make more than a movie if it was done. In any case, one of the Valentino wannabes falls into Ricardo Cortez with the male lead. <br /> <br /> One reason why Valentino might not want this movie is because the main character is the Garbo's other than the other two works previously mentioned. . When she gets dirty by Cortez, what does Mattox and her adviser banker Tully Marshall say, she leaves Spain and goes to France where she becomes a great opera star. And lead the scandalous life there completely. <br /> <br /> When she returns to Spain and tries to repair things, Mattox is even more furious. She has a political career in mind for her son. Cortez is now running for the Spanish parliament, which is hardly called the Cortes. <br /> <br /> The title refers to a flood and a dam that causes all kinds of rural destruction. Cortez immediately marries the Torrent in a rowboat trying to save Garbo out of the way. When they come together, they have a brutally open conversation, the brutality comes from Garbo. <br /> <br /> The special effects here, primitive, though they look now, are quite remarkable for their time. They look very much like the shots used in 19th Century Fox's The Rains Came, which came out in 1939 and won a special effects Oscar. Unfortunately for Torrent it came out one year before Oscar made his debut. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to end up so you have to see the movie to find out if Cortez and Garbo meet up in the end. At the same time, Garbo won rave reviews for her performance, and in an era where excessive gestures were the norm in the silent screen, she was remarkably subtle in her role. So she would be the rest of her career. She had a remarkable face for approaches. <br /> <br /> Although Greta Garbo is going to do much better than Torrent, this movie is a fitting debut for her on the American big screen and is great for today's audience.
