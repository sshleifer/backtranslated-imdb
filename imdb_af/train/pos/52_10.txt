This movie is incredible. If you have the chance, watch it. Although, a warning, you will shout your eyes. I do, every time I see it, and I own it and have watched it many times. The performances are outstanding. It's about darkness and pain and loss, but there is hope. This movie looked at me differently: vicarious experience, according to my English teacher. Also, if you have seen it, note the interesting use of shadows and light. Home room is a phenomenal movie, and I judge it 10/10 - for real - because of the excellent play, wonderful plot and heartbreaking dialogue. Very tense, very moving. Don't give all the answers, but make many good points about humanity
