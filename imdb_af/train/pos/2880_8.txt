"Cinderella" is one of the most loved of all Disney classics. And it really deserves its status. Based on the classic fairy tale as told by Charles Perrault, the film follows the trials and tribulations of Cinderella, a good girl who is abused by her evil stepmother and equally unlikely step sister. When a royal ball is held and all qualifying young women are invited (read: the king wants to get the prince to marry), Cinderella is left at home while her stepmother takes her terrible daughters with her. But there is a Fairy-grandmother at hand. <br /> <br /> The story of "Cinderella" on its own will not be a feature, and while it is likely to remain in the story, the fairly casual characters of the Fairy Grandmother are animals. To get the title character for the ball, Cinderella's real sidekicks become. The mice Jaq and Gus are the main sidekicks, and their own nemesis is the stepmother's cat Lucifer. Their fianc√© usually confuses with the main fairy tale plot, and is usually wonderful. However, the film lowers a bit between the main introduction of the characters and shortly before the step soldiers leave for the ball, but after this slowdown, the film really goes back and forth (since "Cinderella" is the most twisted story of all time, probably ) ends up as one of the most Disney stories. <br /> <br /> The animation and art direction is beautiful. All the legendary Nine Old Men animated on this photo, and Mary Blair's color and conceptual art (she also succeeded in drafting and color styling for Alice in Wonderland, Peter Pan, The Three Caballeros and many others) to wrap their way on the screen. The colors and designs are nice, especially in the Fairy Godmother and ball scenes, as well as in the beautiful moments here and there. <br /> <br /> Overall, "Cinderella" is one of the best Disney fairy tales and is recommended for young and everything that embodies Disney philosophy, that dreams really come true.
