There is about 25 years of inspiration packed into it. Starting with existential themes of Blade Runner, as well as the vision of the future - with corporate billboards featuring their products, the technology of later Matrix films and Spielberg's AI, and the black and white graphic novel similar in Sin City. The creators made a lot of effort in the visual department and the outcome is a well-crafted future neo-noir. Add a detective story and you have an interesting movie. I know what it wanted to be, but it wasn't enough to get the final destination, regardless of the beautiful footage.
