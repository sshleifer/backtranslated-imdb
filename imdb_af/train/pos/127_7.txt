Zentropa has much in common with The Third Man, another noir-like movie that is riddled with post-war Europe. Like TTM, there are many innovative camera works. There is an innocent American who is emotionally involved with a woman he doesn't really understand, and whose naivety in contrast to the natives is more noticeable. <br /> <br /> But I have to say that The Third Man has a more appropriate storyline. Zentropa is a little broken in this respect. Perhaps it is deliberate: it is presented as a dream / nightmare, and making it coherent would spoil the effect. <br /> <br /> This movie is indifferently grim - "noir" in more than one sentence; one never sees the sun shining. Grim, but intriguing and frightening.
