The trailer for this movie didn't do the movie justice. And while the movie didn't know what it really wanted, the first half of the movie is a light romance comedy and the second has a more serious romantic drama. The overall impact was much better than I thought. This movie was more of a date movie, but the trailer made it into more of a thriller that never really seemed to be. Kidman, one of my favorites, of course, I'm biased, but this movie was apparently a light, sensitive, and somewhat odd movie that made better. Three out of four stars. 9.5.02.
