This zippy and fun short of 1916 - the time when Charlie Chaplin and Fatty Arbuckle were the big names in comedy - the young Oliver Hardy as a ne'er-do-well who must quickly impress his rich uncle by a woman manufacture and baby for his visit. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's going to be smooth and soon there will be more women and babies than he can handle; plus the compulsory chase and misunderstandings that are the characteristic movie of early movie slapstick. <br /> <br /> Well restored, this can be seen as part of 'The Early Movies of Oliver Hardy' and is now available on DVD, a fine complement to the available corpus of the big-screen favorite comedy duo.
