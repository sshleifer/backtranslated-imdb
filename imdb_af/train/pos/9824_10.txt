This movie is a good example of the state of erotic B-movies: bad porn movies without the hardcore sex. The plot in this one is not as bad as these things go; It involves a female lawyer who tries to prove her lover is innocent to murder his wife. However, the rest of the movie leaves something to be desired. Bad acting, bad direction, bad woman, bad sets, bad cinematography, bad sound and bad sex scenes. The filmmakers need to distinguish between raunchy and erotic learning. They do not even have the common sense of having Gabriella Hall naked or in a love scene. <br /> <br /> How stupid is it?
