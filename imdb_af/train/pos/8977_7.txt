As a movie, it's hardly a 4, but for movie fans of the 1940s, it's almost a must-see and gives a 9 as a variety show! I was drawn to see this by the presence of Richard (Captain Midnight) Webb who plays the Colonel in charge of the event. What surprised me was the beautiful display of Doris Day. Outside of 'Calamity Jane', I've never seen her switch a song better than she's here. Randolph Scott is also unforgettable, even though he doesn't see much screen time. It was a while since I saw the movie, but I was almost certain Humphrey Bogart made an appearance. With so many familiar faces, it's hard to keep up. If it ever comes to a TV station in your neighborhood, you have to follow the Doris day order, if nothing else! <br /> <br />
