This early version of the story 'The Student of Prague' was made in Germany in 1913, with Paul Wegener (who was also in The Golem a few years later). In this film he plays a dual role (technically impressive for a 95-year-old film to see them in the same shot) after meeting a mysterious old man who made a deal with him for gold - the gold that he needed to win a spade, he earlier saved from drowning. <br /> <br /> Moving at a fast pace (the movie runs just over an hour) and fairly well written and featured, 'The Student of Prague' has echoes of the Faust legend as well as Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, starting with a pact with a mysterious figure of potential evil, developing into good and evil sides of the same person.
