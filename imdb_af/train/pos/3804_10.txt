My 3 year old loved it. I loved it, my wife loved it. So 10 out of 10 of our family. Regarding violence? Not really so violent, mostly from the flaccid variety. No one really dies, no gore, no blood, no torture, so it's definitely suitable for kids, much more than many Saturday morning cartoons. <br /> <br /> This movie takes the idea of ​​CG movies where it should go. <br /> <br /> First of all, beautiful graphics, wonderful textures, with true depth, aren't trying to be realistic, but form an artistic whole. The moss on the stones, the rust on the metal, the relief on the wood and the stone, everything adds everything. <br /> <br /> Unlike many contemporary CG movies, character modeling is peculiar, not cute, again within an artistic whole. The faces may look less malleable than some other movies, but the characters are more puppet-like than human. I think it's a good thing, it gives truth, how strange it may sound, it's easier to suspend your unbelief. <br /> <br /> Hair, fur, clothes, in the end, at least with the likes of Pixar. Just note in the opening scenes when Lian-Chu is fighting the huge snail; Gwizdo is for some farmers, and they all have detailed clothes that let me interrupt the movie just to admire it. <br /> <br /> The environment. Far above the cars, and even Wall ?? E. Space has been done many times, but the fantasy environment of Dragon Hunters is only comparable to some scenes in Never Ending Story and Lord of the Rings, but again it is an artistic whole and with very good ideas is thrown easily. Beautiful views like the scene in Monsters Inc. Where do they drive through all the doors through his storage facility, or Wall ?? When we see the big rubbish towers he made, abounding in this movie, everything is big, but never got used to it; It's just the background all the way! The interlude where they walk through the area with the fantastic fall. The Chinese wall, the islands floating in the air. The Broccoli in the air? This is where I believe CG should go, make something take your breath away and do it again and again. <br /> <br /> The sound is good, the music is varied and not just epic, and happy without any vocals, and purely original for the movie. <br /> <br /> Animation is pretty good. Lead his inspiration to cartoons, especially a good use of stretch and print. Sometimes it's not realistic, but the 3D models aren't realistic either. <br /> <br /> Characterization is also well done. Lian-Chu The gentle and uncertain giant gradually grows with confidence in the attention of little Zoe. <br /> <br /> Gwizdo's wily driver of Lian-Chu end up in the end, while Zoé doesn't really change. not at all, but who wants to change that cute child anyway? I loved at least Lian-Chu than any other recent character since Sulley in Monsters Inc. <br /> <br /> The internal strife in the group is exacerbated by external pressure, just as it should be in a proper fantasy story. . <br /> <br /> The story is mostly reminiscent of the Never Ending Story, especially the world falling apart. The samples are fairly standard money, except for the flocking one. It lacks the emotional impact of Wall ?? E, which is the real strong point of the movie, but it is a much more fun ride and lacks the annoying music scene in the former play, and has action from the first scene. This movie is what you want to see for a fun and exciting time. <br /> <br /> As I have already mentioned a whole vision, the whole movie apparently followed strictly. <br /> <br /> It looks like the environment is ready for more adventures, and I will do it for one hope. <br /> <br /> One lace note, the French actor Lian-Chu does, looks a bit like Jean Reno First, but I'm glad it wasn't him, though he is one of my favorites. Nice to hear a new voice for me. <br /> <br /> I give it a maximum rating, a little surprised at the mediocre and low ratings by some; I tried to address some of the concerns raised by two reviews with the lowest vote. Approach this movie as an adventure, and as a European movie, not Hollywood, but different.
