First of all, it's just the funniest movie I've ever seen. It includes perfectly-timed slapstick, sexual humor, and smart-mind-up stand-up. But it goes deeper than that. The Souler Opposite is an original love story (something we don't see so often) that gave me hope that there is love, that two people who love one another can work through their adversity; and that such a comic life takes up (something I believe we should all have) can be accepted by the people who really matter. Chris Meloni gave such a convincing performance as Barry Singer that he had to win an Oscar. The film is brilliantly written and I hope we will see more movies from everyone involved in the future.
