I just can't understand the negative comment about this movie. Yes it is a typical boy-meet-girl romance, but it is done with such flair and polish that time just flies. Henstridge (talking about winning the no-pool lottery!) Is as magnetic and tempting as ever (who says the golden age of the theater is dead?) And Vartan holds his own. <br /> <br /> There is flush chemistry between the two; The movie is the liveliest when they share a scene - lots! It's done so well that you want to get together ... <br /> <br /> Ignore the negative comments. If you feel a little blue, watch this movie, you will feel so much better. If you're lucky, you'll be euphoric. <br /> <br /> (PS: I'm 33, Male, from the UK and still a hopeless romantic search for his princess ...)
