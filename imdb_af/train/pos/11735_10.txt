This film is pure Elvira and shows her to her chest ... I mean the best! The story (compiled by Cassandra Peterson, Elvira's alter ego) is inspiring and engaging and is brought to life by Elvira's white and charm. The viewer gets the opportunity to see Elvira in a whole new light as she struggles with the prejudice of the people of Fallwell, Massachusetts (where she traveled from Los Angeles to read her great aunt Morganna's will) and at the same time trying to help the long-suffering teens deprived of the matriarchal chastity of Pariah and the rest of the city council. She also had to deal with her appeal to Bob Redding, the owner of the local theater, and another woman (Patty) who also had her eye on Bob, but didn't earn as much as his love like Elvira. And later, in the movie, she is also confronted with the descendants of '' a great metaphysical celebrity '' and the charges of witchcraft brought against her mean that she will be burned at stake. Elvira manages to be sexy and vulnerable, street-minded and naive in this movie, while making crazy funny jokes and dual-sense downward lines. <br /> <br /> This movie is inspiring because it never gives the message of yourself and always tries to follow your dreams. In the end, Elvira's dreams end up being the best thing that can happen to this wonderfully unique and determined woman. <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie countless times and I'm never tired of it! There are no unnecessary scenes and I have captivated myself throughout the movie. A review will not really meet the real movie, so I can only tell you to see it because it's one of the best movies ever made! Meanwhile, I wish you '' unpleasant dreams! ''
