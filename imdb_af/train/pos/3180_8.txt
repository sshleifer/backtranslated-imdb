A friend lent me this DVD, which he got from the director at a festival, I think. I warned that some of the technical aspects of the movie were a bit shaky and that the writing was good, but not good. Maybe it colored my judgment, but I have to admit that I like this movie. <br /> <br /> The standouts where the actors. Youssef Kerkor was really good like Ernie, the main character, kind of pathetic in a special way. Adam Jones (also directed) and Justin Lane were excellent as roommate Ernie was mad. The Bill character (Justin Lane), who was much of a movie dressed as a panda, was by far my favorite; He was the least one-dimensional, and reminded me of an old college roommate so much, I called the guy after watching the DVD. Really lovely and very funny. Some of the other plays were good, some were so-so, but nothing was bad. I also really loved the vigilante duo. Nice and funny. <br /> <br /> I give this one high marks, though it has some problems, because you can tell when you see these people caring and have decided to make their movie. Well done to Adam Jones and crew.
