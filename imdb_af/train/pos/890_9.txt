This is an excellent Sammo Hung movie. Actually, it's a big piece of Hong Kong action theater. The story tells the story of pedicab drivers in Macao looking for love and excitement with an ominous pimp. The performances are excellent and the characters are all nice and well-defined. The story is involved and has enough romance, drama, comedy, and tension to watch one another between scenes. Sammo Hung proves here that he is probably the best combat choreographer in the business. The action is simply incredible, especially. the battle w / Lau Kar Leung and the final. Billy Chow and Sammo Hung are wonderful. A must see for any fan of action.
