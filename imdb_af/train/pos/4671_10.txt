Kudos to the authors of this movie for creating a highly engaging drama. The curious character development indicates a nuanced and well-trained writing team. The listener can't help but help but feel that he / she has to make tearing emotional decisions that place the cerebral pals against the libidinals. The viewer has the opportunity to develop the character himself, although her predictions are rarely validated. <br /> <br /> Credit is also the result of filmmakers breathing life into the environment. The timber shop is transformed into a unique person as the film unfolds, with its own attributes, bugs, a variety of highly charged relationships and, of course, a lot of relentlessly linked to those of the other principals. <br /> <br /> Make sure you catch up with this one at your local art house.
