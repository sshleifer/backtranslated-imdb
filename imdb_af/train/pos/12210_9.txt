People claim it is pretty funny, but they had to cut it down considerably after production. I have Harry as a professor right now, and frankly this is one of the best classes I had. It's quite funny to tell about what happened in the making of the movie, because Harry is so animated. I originally watched a "joy of life" for another class where Harry made a voice in the movie, and I started watching this movie after I started the class. Harry originally did some execution work, and is really sincere about creating moments that move you, especially if you need to change things again until you hit that moment, but that's something you see in this movie.
