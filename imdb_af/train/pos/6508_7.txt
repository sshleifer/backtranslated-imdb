I grew up to look at Scooby and was always a fan. This cartoon moves away from the same old routine that can become boring for viewers. The Crooks in Mask routine is getting old and this cartoon is a change. It's not meant to replace the Scooby gang, it's just a break from the same old crime scene for both viewers and writers. The cartoon's focus is on Scooby and Shaggy who experience a huge amount of money and use that money to reject world-winning plans of a crazy scientist and his goons. Small guests of the gang and the gang themselves are offered from time to time. If you are a fan of Scooby-Doo, you can still appreciate the bond between a boy and his pomp, along with the jokes that come with it. Just Enjoythe Cartoon and support the creators / writers and producers so it won't be the last Scooby Cartoon.
