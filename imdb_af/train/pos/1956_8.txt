Really, I think this movie is more an example of an easy target than a really bad movie. In fact, the movie is done very well in many ways and is very entertaining. <br /> <br /> Yes, the writing is a bit over, but it's the genre. The film has a noirish atmosphere centered around a femme fatale. Like all the old noir classics, it also has a script that turns you around so you don't always know how to think about it, and it can be stretched if you think too deeply and try to put all the pieces down. together. It's the genre. Generally speaking, the writing has enough surprises and turns to guess the viewer and, in turn, to surprise, without abandoning the viewer. <br /> <br /> Sharon Stone is also an easy target. The truth is that she looks good and she talks her dialogue with double enthusiasm so that it is in something mysterious, sexy and fun. <br /> <br /> The direction is more than acceptable because we are face. this - you need an audience interested in "does she or she doesn't?" ask for two hours. In addition to a rotatable screenplay and a fun performance by Stone, it is effectively done by creating a noirish atmosphere that is both dark and very strong and modern at the same time, with straight industrial lines joining Stone's sexy curves. The frame is always beautiful - press silently any time and there is something interesting for the eye. <br /> <br /> The film also effectively builds on things that were in the first movie, making them a little more real, especially the gender. "Katherine Tramell is bisexual ... how shocking!" Here, more matter-of-factly is being dealt with, and usually the sexuality of the film is used to perform better. It is still titillating, but not as readily available for shock value and buzz as in the first. I won't say it's not a bit of a gimmick yet, because let's see, this movie is supposed to be fun. <br /> <br /> And a fun movie is it. It may be an easy target, but if you look for what it is: a noirish, femme-fatal driven, winding, sexy, has-or-not-be-what-dunnit, you are planning to enjoy it (no pun intended).
