I found the movie "Holes" by hearing from people that it wasn't typical Disney, that both children and adults both came in the story. People, let me tell you that I wasn't disappointed. "Holes" is based on Louis Sachar's novel and follows the adventures of Stanley Yelnats, a boy sent to a strange youth camp in the desert. He is a friend of a boy named Zero and together they are on adventure that changes their lives. It was a very interesting, unique, different and funny story. I didn't know what to expect when I looked at it. It was interesting to see how the story came together like pieces of a puzzle. The boys who played the juvenile criminals were all very funny and Jon Voight was just hilarious. Sir. Now that I've seen the movie, I have to read the book. Most recommended!
