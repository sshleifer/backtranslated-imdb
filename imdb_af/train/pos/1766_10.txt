I got a preview of a preview of this movie last night and didn't know what to expect. The premise was stupid and I assumed it would be very shallow, fun-of-the-virgin humor. What a great surprise. I laughed so hard, I cried to some of the jokes. This movie is a must see for anyone with an open mind and a slightly twisted sense of humor. OK ..... it's not a movie to go with your grandmother (Jack Palance?) Or small children. The language is dirty, the jokes are (very) rough, and the sex talk is about as graphic as you will find anywhere. What is wonderful, however, is that the movie is still a lovely love story. My girlfriend and I both loved it. Steve Carell is great, but (like the office) makes the supporting role the movie works. All the characters have their faults, but they also have depth and likability. Everyone pulls their weight and chemistry is perfect. I can't wait to get the DVD. I'm sure there will be Office Space for replays and quotable lines.
