Abhay Deol meets the attractive Soha Ali Khan and greets her "Hello Sister" !!!. It sets the tone for a remarkable debut film by Shivam Nair. Soha, a middle-class girl ran away from her home in Nainital and came to Delhi to marry her lover, Shayan Munshi. But Shyan doesn't come to leave Soha sad and alone in the big bad world. . Abhay, the lower class next door, becomes protective of the vulnerable Soha and helps her find a job and shelter in an old age home. Slow flower flowers and Soha agree to marry Abhay. Then Shyan goes back to Soha's life. <br /> <br /> A sensuous movie with a very unusual story, lovingly shot in Delhi, revolves around the delicate Soha. This well-crafted film has moments that will be eaten forever in your memory? the awkward first kiss & Abhay's quick apology; Abhay describes Soha as "class wali ladki" and hastily added "he doesn't love her"; He gives a churidar to Soha and asks her for a date. <br /> <br /> The music is good and the background music is excellent. In a scene where Soha chases and embraces Abhay, the soundtrack disappears. The silence carries both the uneasiness of the relationship. <br /> <br /> The gripping end to a bitter sweet movie, whose memories will last for a long time. <br /> <br /> A must see I'll rate it 8.5 / 10
