I am one of Jehovah's Witnesses and I also work in an acute care medical facility. Over the years, I have seen people die from haemolytic reactions to blood transfusions, have attended numerous conferences on blood-born pathogens, and have seen several patients become seriously ill from transfused blood pathogens. I also heard that several Jehovah's Witnesses are being told they will die if their blood fails and after 26 years in the field I have never seen it. The question is, "Is it really unreasonable to refuse blood transfusions or is the community of great benefit from the battle over this issue?" The problem for Jehovah's Witnesses is a moral one. "You must remember blood" is not an ambiguous statement. Thanks for this movie and leave comments on it.
