"A Thief in the Night" is a film that is generally ignored by filmmakers because of the low budget (which was obvious) and its subject - the rapture of the true Christian church and the fate of those who left behind. Nevertheless, it was a gripping story that the viewer kept and definitely showed him or her about their relationship with Jesus Christ. It all touched - even a pastor who preached the Word, but didn't believe it. He knew exactly why he was left behind. This movie, and the sequel "Distant Thunder", has to watch movies. Even with the new "Left Behind" series telling the same story with a much higher budget, the impact is still the same. A thief in the night broke the ground of this genre and will always be remembered.
