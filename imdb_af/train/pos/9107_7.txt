Several story lines are interwoven between different women's characters. The shoes they wear serve as an indication of their troubled lives. Everyone is transformed at the end of the movie. Adela (Antonia San Juan) leads a brothel; Her daughter Anita (Monica Cervera) is delayed and has a limited life. Leire (Najwa Nimri) is a shoe designer with problems and loses her boyfriend; Maricarmen (Vicky Peña) lost her husband and now makes the children of his late, former wife. Isabel (Ángela Molina) is a boring rich lady. <br /> <br /> Other characters are used to connect the five main female characters. In the storytelling, not everything is given away at first. Some connections are surprisingly late in the movie and this adds to the experience. The shoe theme is driven to extremes. For example, when Leire works as a shoe designer and works in a shoe store where she steals her shoes, she breaks one of her heels. <br /> <br /> In the editing of small connections, screens are made. A phone ring, a cigarette is lit, a song, etc. Used to make the connection and quick cuts. Regular storyline changes keep it from boredom or reach of TV levels. It is strong music driven to set tone and atmosphere. The cities of Madrid and Lisbon serve as the backdrop for the stories, and shots of those cities are used to expand the story beyond the characters. One of the more moving shots is when Anita, who makes the same walk every day, extends her walk and limits the life of the relative calm of her street to the busy main road. How the space limitation is visually translated is well done. As with most Spanish films, many narratives are done visually, using the soap-like stories as the simple background. There is a poetic ending that is somewhat romantic and sentimental, but it is still beautiful. <br /> <br /> If Ramón Salazar falls in love with his own material, it is too long. Some scenes are kitsch and on the soap, including the play (Adela's love life, Isabel's doctor). The shoe theme is exaggerated and is a poor metaphor. <br /> <br /> It is often compared to Magnolia because the structure is the same. But they are different. Magnolia is more technically competent, but somewhat mechanical. It has more ability to visually translate emotion and atmosphere. After you see it, you tend to go to the new movie city right away: Madrid.
