"This man's fleet" is, like other commentary, a rare and well-filmed look at Navy lighter than air (LTA) activities. The LTA teams were justly proud that the convoys they shaded never lost a ship to submarine attacks. And the filming at the various NAS locations gives a valuable look at a kind of aviation that's long gone. However, the first half of the movie is about Beery, his relationship with his friends, and he meets the Tom Drake character and his mother and gets Drake's leg. Only then will the second movie begin. The second movie is mostly LTAs in action, with an underground bottom, guys being killed and causing a lot of damage. The look is pretty neat and realistic, I think. Then we move to Southeast Asia. Did the Fleet have LTA there? Never mind, this part is really wild, with a blimp used to extract some discarded planes from the jungle. And the Japs shoot like crazy. Shades of Vietnam, except the getaway is oh so quiet. It's a blimp we're talking about. In the end, a wonderful WWII drama about a very unusual part of the war.
