Well, what can I say I just watched this fantastic movie when my nerves were still jangling! Jacques Audiard, the director, has to make quite a name in France, and rightly so. Vince Cassel is not Tom Cruise and Emmanuelle Devos is also not Penelope Cruz, but these two are fantastic actors. It is a naughty and compelling thriller that slowly starts with a clever character building and then tension begins to strain to a wonderful climax. Others wrote about the plot, so I will no longer say if everyone in this movie plays their role to perfection, the director, the actors, to the cameraman, and everything looks so real, no stupid game, the battle when It happens so credibly, the expressions, the emotions, it's almost like you're there as a spectator. Do yourself a favor, get the DVD, a bottle of wine, turn the light layer off, unplug the phone and immerse yourself in this Hitchcockian thriller :)
