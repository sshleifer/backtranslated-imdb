First, I'm not an Justin Timberlake fangirl who is obsessive to make him look good, and I'm not even a big Justin fan, but I enjoyed this movie. <br /> <br /> I am working on a video store and when I saw this movie with its great role I never heard, I had to see what it was all about. I didn't find Justin's game so bad, it was clearly the worst of the group, but it's an impressive group, with Cary Elwes and Dylan McDermott two names who didn't even make the first credit list. The story is basic, a journalist who has exposed corrupt police, but I did well. L L Cool J's character was clearly in conflict, but I honestly knew what he would eventually do. Morgan Freeman is as always the wise mentor figure he does so well, and as much as I like Kevin SPACEY, he was just there. HI's character doesn't have much content, but it's Kevin Spacey, he can't do anything wrong. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, I thought Dylan McDermott got the best performance as a murderer. In fact, credible and really in character, he feared me several times. <br /> <br /> I really expected a lot of cheesiness to be honest. Horrible catches, unjustified actions, such things, but it was done surprisingly well and I found nothing of it. Every shooting had a point, it wasn't clich√©, really firm. <br /> <br /> Overall, wonderful cast, decent story that kept me interested and just enough action to make me jump. I don't know why it didn't appear in the theaters, it was better than a rubbish I saw on the big screen. I'd say it's worth seeing.
