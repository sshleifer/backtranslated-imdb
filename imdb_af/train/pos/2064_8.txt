The ScareCrow was on the funniest killers I've ever seen! Plus he is most of the time he jumped, and it was fantastic! He also had an excellent voice. I mean it was perfect for him. The story lines were also excellent. I love how the kids' soul was transferred to ScareCrow, it was cool! Plus, he had a reason for all the killings I mean after what those people did to him ..... I'll be angry too! ScareCrows watch was really good! his appearance gives that person an "OMG!" reaction when they see him! It was wonderful the stare he got was funny! Those people were stupid, who would stare so long! They have to look at them and run for their lives ... though it would not be made any difference!
