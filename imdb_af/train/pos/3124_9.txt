Jason Bourne sits in a dusty room with blood on his hands and tries to make sense of what he has just done. Meanwhile, a CIA chief in NYC describes the agency's response to what just happened on the screen. An American flag stands proudly at the center of its desk at the forefront of the shot, but as it speaks, it slips out of focus, as its plan comes in moral dubious territory, as if it is not associated with the course . of the action the government man decides is needed in the interests of national security. <br /> <br /> This shot makes the movie's mood effective. In addition to portraying Bourne's quest to find out how he became Jason Bourne, Ultimatum is also examining the human cost of the measures taken to protect us in the interests of stability and security. <br /> <br /> It's also probably the best movie you will see in the theater this year. <br /> <br /> It's just as intense. Bourne says to Simon Ross (Considine) "It's not a cricket story, it's really" and in the audience you almost believe it. The camera shakes, but remains steady enough so you can see everything and feel that you are there at Bourne while trying to evade its pursuers and the performances are so good that these guys seem to be the characters they portray. , instead of just actors doing well-written roles. The action scenes are so brutally fast and well choreographed that they seem instinctive rather than planned to the smallest movement; The stunt work is nothing too wonderful. <br /> <br /> The pacing is just incredible. It goes on to the conclusion, but not so fast that it makes you struggle to put it together; The script provides the information you need as quickly and clearly as possible before moving on to the next timely action set. While they are often simple (the Waterloo series is just a man on a phone watched by a man on a phone), they have been accused of such a dramatic intensity that you can't see their eyes from them. does not decrease. <br /> <br /> The movie is just as focused to drive forward so you can't help move along with it. <br /> <br /> With its intense action work, brilliant storyline and intelligent exploration of decisions made in the name of national security, the Bourne series is one that accurately captures the ambiguities of our age. Ultimatum is its highlight.
