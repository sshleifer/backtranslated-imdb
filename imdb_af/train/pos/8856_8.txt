BEFORE THE DEATH KNOWS, YOU KNOW DEATH, start promising, and set up a simple gate that goes wrong, telling of different perspectives (in RASHOMON style). At about the hour, Sidney Lumet transforms this movie into something so much more than the sum of its parts; It eventually leads to a versatile family drama, exploring the full empire of human emotions / relationships, as the story comes to its cold climax. <br /> <br /> Like Lumet, he is able to perform extraordinary performances from his star-studded cast, without any idea of ​​overworking or hyperbola. Philip Seymour Hoffman, in one of his best roles, is a complex, mysterious and interesting character, and often dwarfs Ethan Hawke, who plays his brother Hank. It is not to say that Hawke is not bad; In fact, he is fairly adequate, in a difficult role that suits his style. Marisa Tomei is excellent for her relatively short appearance (the fact that she carries her meat contributes to it). Albert Finney's character (Andy and Hank's father) is the most intriguing, and I think he earned a little more screen time. Amy Ryan also performs her work properly. <br /> <br /> BEFORE THE DEATH KNOWS, YOU ARE DEAD, it is not an exceptional movie, but it proves that Lumet is still near the top of his game at the (apparent) twilight of an illustrious career . Many of its features and brands appear here, not least of what its characters use. Infused with a murder script (no pun intended), smart dialogue and pacing, and a decent score, BEFORE THE DEATH KNOWS, YOU ARE DEAD, it is a must-see. A really understated jewel. 8/10. 3 stars (out of 4). Do not enter my Top 250 at 248. Highly recommended.
