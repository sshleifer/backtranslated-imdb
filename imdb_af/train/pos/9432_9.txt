* SPOILERS * Four men, Ed (Jon Voight), Lewis (Burt Reynolds), Drew (Ronny Cox) and Bobby (Ned Beatty) decide to go on the Cahulawassee River before being flooded. <Br /> <br /> They wanted fun, having a nice weekend in nature. <br /> <br /> But if two mountaineers cross their path and one of them (Bobby) rapes, everything starts to hell in a handbasket, and this "nice week" will even cost one of the four lives ... <br /> <br /> 'Liberation', which is stupid in Italian with the title 'Un Tranquillo Weekend Di Paura' ('A Kalm Weekend Of Fear'), is the Grandad of movies like 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre', ' The Hills Have Eyes', 'Wrong Turn', 'Last House On The Left' and all the other 'Evil Nature / Revenge' subgenre movies, and one of the scariest, right next to 'The Hills Have Eyes'. <br /> <br /> Based on a book by James Dickey (featured in the movie as Sheriff Bullard), it's a different story about how someone can think in a situation he knows everything when he does no. <br /> <br /> And the image of the dead man's hand jumping under the water, or the hands holding the gun of the one-piece, are ghostly images that will never give understanding. /> <br /> Delivery: 9/10.
