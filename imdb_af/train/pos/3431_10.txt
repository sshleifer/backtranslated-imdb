Simply the best Estonian movie I've ever seen, though made by a Finnish director Ilkka Järvi-Laturi. Tallinn Pimeduses is an entertaining thriller about a lot of gangsters trying to steal a large amount of gold, a national treasure belonging to the Republic of Estonia. But at the same time it is a summary of the conditions of many Eastern European countries at that time. In the early 90s, the Soviet Union fell into pieces and many countries, such as Estonia, became independent. Now the conditions can be better in most of those countries. But in the early nineties, many of the new nations had to fight against corruption and organized crime, leaving the Soviet era as an inheritance. (And many of them still ... at least on one level or another ...) <br /> <br /> Tallinn Pimeduses is a very realistic film of that era with credible characters and well written writing. The actors are also very good, especially Jüri Järvet (perhaps the most famous Estonian actor, playing Snaut in Tarkovski's Solaris), playing and old gangster who is slowly tired of his lifestyle. But the astonishing performance comes from Monika Mäger, a children's actor playing Terje, a boy in her early teens, whose presence in the plot is reasonably necessary. (and her name is not even mentioned in the IMDb credit list!) w <br /> <br /> There are not many movies in the world that are both entertaining and artistic at the same time. But Tallinn Pimeduses do this. Unfortunately, Järvi-Laturi's other films are far from this kind of achievement. His first one, Kotia pain was too artificial and his latest, History is Made at Night was just a strange mess.
