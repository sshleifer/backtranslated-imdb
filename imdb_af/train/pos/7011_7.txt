First, I had this movie. It was well done by everyone. <br /> <br /> I don't understand comments I hear from people about a surprise termination. I didn't know anything about this movie, except a few "gotta sea" recommendations, but I knew where the plot went within ten minutes. (I won't mention what led me to not spoil a good movie for others.) Still, I kept looking, despite seemingly obvious. It was nice to see how everything played, the details and the character motivation in later scenes. <br /> <br /> I don't hate it if I guess the end early in a movie. I just hate it if the road to the decision is bored with boring scenery. <br /> <br /> Even if he plays such a troubled character, Will Smith's screenplay is fun. He is energetic and credible in everything I saw him. Seven pounds is another good performance. <br /> <br /> Rosario Dawson is a solid artist depicting a peculiar, rather sincere character despite a terminal heart condition. Beauty is in the eye of the boyfriend, and with Rosario, if you don't like her, think about replacing your eyes. <br /> <br /> It was nice to see Woody Harrelson again on the screen. I haven't seen him much lately, but it can just be me. Woody did not have a tremendous amount of screen time, but he sold his beautiful piano player, blind man character for everything it was worth. Excellent. <br /> <br /> A brief piece of research on the goat bell tells me that its venom is cardiotoxic, neurotoxic and dermatonecrotic. I would think it makes it a dubious choice for both pets and plots. In general, I should recommend this movie, not for the plot, but for some very good performances, and for the fact that it tends to evoke some of the tragic emotions we generally try to avoid.
