It must be one of my favorite movies, unlike the weak 'Elvira's Haunted Hills' ... anyway, I like the way the movie is a goth / com Wizard of Oz story ... < <br /> <br /> Elvira is a goth Dorothy who was stranded in an unknown town after the death of a Good Witch (Elviras Tannie Morgana). She experiences a "Ruby" ring that is extremely powerful and sought after by the Bad Warlock (Her Uncle). She is friends with four characters that she accidentally helps to grow throughout the movie with a dog in the trailer. There is a show with her uncle (the wicked witch of the West) where Elvira realizes she has the power in her and eventually defeats him. In the end, she is sent out by the villages after working on their hearts and finally arriving at her destination Las Vegas (Dorothy's home in Kansas). <br /> <br /> There are many references to the wizard of oz by the movie ... she and her uncle both quotes lines relevant to their parallel characters. Elvira: "You must be Aunt Em, and you must be Uncle Remus .... There's no place like the house, there's no place like the house!" Bad Oom Vinny: "I'll get you pretty, and your puppy too!" <br /> <br /> There is a sign that Elvira fits when she is first on her road trip, what the state of Kansas calls. /> <br /> Besides that, the fact that one of the sequences she has torn ... I mean was inspired by FlashDance "is pure genius ... and if you don't roll around to laugh her titty twirling at the end of her "many 80's" Las Vegas show, then you didn't have a leg in your body ... This movie is a Cult / Camp Classic
