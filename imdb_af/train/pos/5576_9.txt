This movie is hilarious! I looked at my friend and we just had to see it again. This movie is not for you filmmakers who will only look at the films nominated for the Academy Awards (you know who you are.) I will not recover it because you saw it from all the other reviews. <br /> <br /> "Torn" is a light-hearted comedy that laughed at me all the time. It does not take too much and should be watched by your friends, not your girlfriend. It won't win awards, but it should only be looked at to be appreciated. True, some of the jokes are toilet humor, but it is not necessarily a bad thing. Everyone can use it sometimes. Some people have to relieve and see "beaten" for what it is, not what it is. <br /> <br /> **** 1/4 out of *****.
