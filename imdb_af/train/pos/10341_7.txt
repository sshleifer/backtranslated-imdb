A true scream-situation comedy conquered from the mid 70's this movie was a big hit for about 5 minutes and disappeared from the face of the earth. I'm constantly amazed at some comedy films that are a major release one week and then disappear. HOW ANXYTY, THE SUITABLE DETECTIVE, THE BLACK BIRD, DO NOT CREATE OUR US. . and has no profile at all. NORMAN was the comedy of the month when 1976 and everyone wanted to see it, laugh about it and never call it again. Famous for being shot at videotape and being transferred to film, an experiment at the time, NORMAN is an intrepid political frightened safe that the Farrelly Brothers must remember today. If they made it in the first place, there would be no complaints about its contents and neither. It is very funny and YES very rude and hilariously all wrong. Just as it should be. In fact, as a coarse 1976 movie with all the horror colors and clothes, it actually works better today.
