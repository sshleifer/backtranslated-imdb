This Wrestlemania just didn't do it for me. While some things, such as the royal royal and involvement of celebrities, were a return to the good old days, it was more than a high jump in your home than anything else. Above average ... worthwhile for several games such as the tag team game, although it is noteworthy that the title change didn't matter, as it was overturned the next night.
