It took me a long time to find the title in a special videotape in Berlin, and I was fortunate to find an English version with Dutch subtitles. I think this is one of the best horrormovies ever. It seems strange to me that some people call this movie a black comedy. I must admit that I couldn't laugh when I saw it for the first time (and it was the same with the second time!) On the one hand, Trelkovski looked so beautiful and even cute in his shy behavior, but on the other hand he hit this boy on the playground and there is no explanation for it. But the most popular thing, of course, is his transformation in Simone Choule and the fact that he doesn't know who he really is. His hallucinations are the most frightening in this movie. Of course this is all in his mind, but is this this apartment that brings out this female side of him or was it before he moved in - I think this is an interesting question. His schizophrenic behavior is difficult to understand and it is terrible to see his two sides or identities fighting each other. The result is that he first cuts his hand and later jumps out of his window. But this terrible cry - does it mean that everything will repeat again and again ... that his soul is in a cage or something? And these Egyptian hieroglyphs and other Egyptian things? The fact that he / she looks like a mummy in the hospital - it's not an incident but a clue in my view.
