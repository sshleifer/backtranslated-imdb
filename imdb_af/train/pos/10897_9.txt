What would you expect from a movie called 'Surviving Christmas' and presented as 'festive fun', such as Ghandi or English patient? There are many things I love about this movie, it's funny, it's very well thrown and it is excellently written. I came to the movie as a Kaplan / Elfort fan, but was doubtful when I read the plot, it sounded ridiculous. But the film doesn't come that way, because Affleck (like Drew Latham) plays perfectly, one minute a childish adult, the next a mature man who realizes he has achieved everything in life, whatever he really wants. In fact, we see Latham grow up in this movie, when he experiences the problems of those he is experiencing and realizes that their lives are not so good, he sees that his own fate is not so bad. <br /> <br /> This movie has fewer or weaker scenes than many other comedies I've seen. Comedy is so much harder than any other kind of drama, whether it works or not, and very few comedy writers get it right every time. I especially loved the drama scene, where the family took to reads written by Latham. The pleasure is in the reaction of Tom Valco (James Gandolfini) and the comments of Brian Valco (Josh Zuckerman). This is the dilemma of greedy Tom Valco, who has to bite his tongue, wear dull hats or sing the Christmas tree to earn the prize money that the film is moving well. <br /> <br /> The addition of daughter Alicia (Christina Applegate) in the story brings a beautiful romantic angle, and why not in a Christmas movie? Of course, it is wheat and confronted; He is rich and attractive, she is beautiful and single, and inevitably her and Afflect fall into the snow and fall face to face. Great! One thing I wanted was more festive music to promote the atmosphere, but I can't really complain. I have what I wanted.
