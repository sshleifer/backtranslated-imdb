I couldn't find anyone to watch DiG! with me because no one I knew was a fan of one of the bands. Of course everyone believed you could just enjoy this movie if you liked the music of The Dandy Warhols or the Brian Jonestown massacre, but this is so far from the truth. The only requirement is that you have an interest in music and / or pop culture in general. The way in which the careers of the two groups are parallel is a perfect representation of the paths that a band can take, and watching the audience eat and the Dandy Warhols spit is fascinating. I agree with other reviews that say it would be nice to get a final word from Anton himself, as he is clearly portrayed as his own worst enemy and the bulwark for the band's ability to just stay. <br /> <br /> Most interesting to me is the Dandys respect for the BJM (despite their lack or reciprocity) and for Anton (despite his volatile behavior). The Dandy Warhols respect the art that the group produces, although the group hates everything that the Dandy Warhols now stand (although unquestionable). The best rule is when the drummer for the Dandy's says, "I won't get them new anywhere again" and the guitarist is unknowingly dried up. "I'll still buy their records." For me it just shows how powerful music can be. <br /> <br /> Definitely this movie, even if you don't know anything about any band. It is more about the themes of rock music and how they develop that make this movie so interesting. It's so scarce to follow such a group for so long.
