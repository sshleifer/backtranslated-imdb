Looking at a porn movie, I prefer to have some kind of plot, and a descent dialogue. Back bedroom doors are one of the few I have experienced with those features. <br /> <br /> The new girl next door grieved the neighbor's human nature and weaknesses where seduction and sex were involved. Chelsea Blue (I mean Brooke LaVelle) is the choice actress to play the part of the extortionate seducer, and play the part wonderfully. Chelsea Blue is a very talented and extremely beautiful actress. The movie gets an overall 10 just because it's in it. Her partner in the film, Monique Alexander, is a definite boyfriend. The two have to do more work together. However, in this film, Monique, who plays Gigi, doesn't have much to do or say. It's a pity. She looks as though she has more talent to share. I like the girl who was the next (possible) DA woman. I forgot her name, but she's pretty pretty and not a bad actress. Nicole Sheridan ... I'm still trying to find out what some people are so excited about. It is obvious, there are parts of her for which they have been paid. What's good, but is she ready? Sorry, but come on! I'm afraid her performance here would have dropped the rating, except that Chelsea's talent and beauty dominate any negative offenses. Overall, this movie is a good one.
