Kazan's early film noir won an Oscar. Some of the reviews here are in extraordinary detail and length about the film and its symbolism, and judge it very highly. I can almost see where they come from. But I prefer a more intimidating approach to a long-lost movie shot at virtually no budget and quasi-documentary. Pneumonic pest is loose in the streets of New Orleans, and it is up to a Widmark military doctor and a city detective (Douglas) to catch the main rider (Palance). The movie is moody, shot in black and white, and makes very good use of places. Widmark is wonderful as usual. Forget the symbolism (crime is equal to illness, and illness is equal to crime) and just enjoy the chase. It is not always easy to watch such a movie, as we are good in this new century, because it is of a particular style that was very short-lived (after World War II in the early 1950s) and would be unlikely to matter. be for the accidental movie watcher. For those who are going to watch it for the first time, it puts the big end to the end. It's something else, and frankly I don't know how they filmed some of them. I can say it probably took so long to film the final as it did the first 90 percent of the movie.
