Directed and co-authored by Eytan Fox the author / director of the highly acclaimed 2002 mini-function "Yossi & Jagger" (2002). This comparative epic, at 1 am 53 minutes, is another fine romantic drama in which we must cope with tragedy as well as the beauty and joy of life. Westerners, especially urban gay men like me, should be moved outside our security area and be aware of real life and the death struggle elsewhere to love fairness. <br /> <br /> While "Yossi & Jagger" focused on a few gay lovers in the secluded boundaries of the Israeli military service, "Ha Buah" is centered on a group of civilian friends, both straight and gay, which shares a unity in the heart of Israel's general gay tolerance, but not always gay-friendly, capital of Tel Aviv. <br /> <br /> "Ha Buah" opens with a dramatic border point scene in which Noam (Ohad Knoller ?? Yossi of "Yossi & Jagger") first met an attractive young Arab Ashraf (Yousef Sweid) . Romance is blooming soon? But in that political climate, opportunities need to be grasped quickly or completely lost. <br /> <br /> From here we follow a complex interaction between the members and lovers of the household and the inevitable effect of Ashraf's very conservative family. If you follow this movie's dialogue closely enough, you will have no reason to be disappointed at the end. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack for "Ha Buah" is alive and the visuals are beautiful and slim? ie the real life in the Middle East. <br /> <br /> The English captions are very easy to follow and you relax and appreciate world cinema at its best.
