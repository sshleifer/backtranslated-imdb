This movie is a very relaxing, romantic comedy that is thoroughly enjoyable. Meg Ryan does a very good job as Albert Einstein's genius cousin, although she believes in her own skills. Tim Robbins does an equally good job as the mechanic who falls in love with her when she arrives with her fianc√© in his shop after picking up her car. I loved Walter Matthau as the only Albert Einstein. This movie only has a very relaxing feel to it, while it is still some sort of serious (if possible, it happens here). <br /> <br /> I personally found this movie very entertaining, especially the old scientists - I thought it was fantastic and hilarious! This movie seems to be overestimated. If you have a passionate sense of humor, this is the movie for you!
