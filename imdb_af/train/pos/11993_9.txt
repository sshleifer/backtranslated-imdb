Together with Darkwing Duck, it was unfairly canceled. Disney is in decline since Tarzan and we need a show like this to get Disney back on track. Ed Gilbert and Jim Cummings were perfect for the voices of Louis and Baloo (sounds familiar?) The theme theme tune is also catchy. Out of all the villains, who are all on their own, Tony Jay stands out as Shere Kahn. Louis and Baloo sound very similar to the voice books in the Jungle Book, which is not bad at all. In fact, this is quite inspiring! The animation was on the point, and the writing had a lot of white that was missing in animations for years. PLEASE RETURN THIS VIEW! 9/10. Bethany Cox
