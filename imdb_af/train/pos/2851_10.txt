Japanese indie film with humor and philosophy where the three main characters literally run through the whole movie, chasing each other because of strange circumstances and comic coincidence. As they run, we see what is going on in their minds and how they got where they are at the moment. The act of running is a metaphor for this down-on-luck happiness of people's lives. Somehow, what they actually pursue is not what they originally pursued, but for meaning in their lives and an escape from their personal problems and broken dreams. Running makes them all feel alive. The great life-changing adventure ends when they accidentally get in the middle of something big, violent and so absurd that it's cleverly funny. One of my favorite movies of all time by genius director Sabu.
