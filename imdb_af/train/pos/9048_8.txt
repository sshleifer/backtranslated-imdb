I resisted seeing this movie and I understand why it wasn't a big hit in theaters. "October Sky" feels and looks so familiar. And this is. All plot controversies and emotions were previously explored in other films - and perhaps even better. But despite its familiarity and resistance to all Hollywood formulas, this movie is turnable and durable on every turn. <br /> <br /> Sputnik is the inspiration for this journey of heart, mind and soul. Just like the characters of Steven Sondheim's musical MERRILY WE ROLL ALONG stood on their apartment roof, hoping they would start their new generation ("What do you call it? You call it a miracle."), Sputnik has A similar effect on the young rocket boys of this true story. While the townspeople of their 1950s reject the coal-mining town, Homer sees Hickham Sputnik as his ticket from a life in the mines. <br /> <br /> Mastery direction and casting make the journey of rocket son Homer and his poles look. fresh and new. Especially, subplots of Homer's sick teacher become. Remarkable restraint is shown in the portrayal of their delicate relationship. Also remarkable is the father / son who anchors the film. Perfectly played everywhere. Even Homer's mom gets her moment without cliche or intrusion. Her ultimatum for her husband is both worthy and heat-breaking. "Myrtle Beach" says it all. <br /> <br /> An important video chain I've despised has a sign next to this movie explaining that you will like this movie or that they will refund your money. For once I agree with them. You will never look at the October air again. <br /> <br />
