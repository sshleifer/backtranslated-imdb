This movie is incredible. With great characters, especially the old swordsman who can jump in the form of fireballs and jump over the trees, this film tells a classic story of battle between good and evil forces. The final imprisonment is extremely breathtaking and the music score is a bit cool. <br /> <br /> Very, highly recommended. Not for the smallest children. This one earns a 10.
