"Footlight Parade" is just one of several great musicians that Warner Bros. produced in the early 1930s to avert the Depression. "42nd Street" and the Golddiggers series were also manufactured during this era, and they literally made millions of Americans forget their problems for a while and enjoy themselves. <br /> <br /> While most of the films produced are the great talents of Joan Blondell, Ruby Keeler and Dick Powell, just Foolight Parade, the incomparable James Cagney had. Almost ten years before his most famous musical, "Yankee Doodle Dandy". Here he dances in the most original dance styles, with his arms usually lowered to his side, and his legs do all sorts of waves and kicks. It's easy to see that he enjoys himself, and that makes us enjoy him more. <br /> <br /> While almost all the music shows appear at the end of the movie, it's worth the wait. I believe this movie was made just prior to installing the production code, so some of the costumes and scenes are a bit of a giant. But it's all fun. <br /> <br /> No matter what the movie's plot is, just know there's a lot of laughter and a superlative role. Apart from those already mentioned, Guy Kibbee is at his best here. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
