"Footlight Parade" is fascinating on so many levels. Of course, there is no way the so-called "theatrical prologues" could be produced in any theater on earth. Think of the large pools and three-storey long fountains for "By A Waterfall", for example. (Berkeley six years later, John Garfield in "They called me a criminal" and the Dead End Kids sang "At a waterfall" when they took their showers.) <br /> <br /> "Shanghai Lil "is the best production number in the picture. This is a catalog of 30s Warner Bros sensibilities. Note that the black guys with white and Asian prostitutes are mixed in the scene. You will never see blacks in a social scene in other movies of the period unless they were a train or girl in a big house. Here the black guys sit at the bar and sing with the others. I also get excited when the military dancers do a "card section" performance of Roosevelt's image. There is also the NRA Eagle - the logo of the controversial National Deal of the New Deal. FDR was the new president and hope was so high that he would pull the nation out of the depression. You will never see anything, so naturally, work-class oriented that comes from MGM. Warner Bros dictated the lifting by the FD. administration. <br /> <br /> Dear little Miss. Ruby Keeler was never better than his Chinese hooker, "Lil." don't play. She barely looked at her feet while she was dancing, which was one of her shortcomings. <br /> <br /> The Pre-Code stuff is fun. The number 'At a waterfall' is wonderful in this regard. The girls change into their bathing suits at busy bus speed through Times Square with all its lights on. The ears girls swimming over the camera provide the kind of shots that won't be seen for 35 years. In a few months the Production Code will eliminate such naughty pleasures.
