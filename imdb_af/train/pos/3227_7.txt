Kurt Russell is strong and (mostly) quiet in this futuristic action thriller by Paul Anderson (Event Horizon, Resident Evil.). On a garbage planet, Soldier plays like a cross between Rambo and Shane. Russell barely speaks like the title character, an "outdated" genetic soldier who is dead. The supporting role of colonists, including Connie Nielsen, Sean Pertwee and a surprising hirsute Michael Chiklis, is capable. They spend most of the movies scared of Russell, and the rest of them run for their lives. Russell's performance here is one of the best he has ever given. With almost no words to say, he carries emotion, feeling and meaning with look and look. It's almost a mime performance. When the action series kick in the gear, he kicks ass - and does it in a strong, quiet, real way. There are errors. Jason Scott Lee is brutal as a "superior" genetic soldier. Jason Isaacs gives a good impression of Frank Burns of M * A * S * H ​​as a weaselly commander, and Gary Busey brushes a gut (and almost brushes his belt) as Todd's mentor. It's an underrated, and excellent sci-fi flick, and recommended for anyone who wants a second visit to the universe of Blade Runner - David Webb Peoples has written both screens.
