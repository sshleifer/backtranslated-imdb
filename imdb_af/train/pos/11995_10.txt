"Spin it!" <br /> <br /> The 90's opened with a clever Disney favorite, "TaleSpin," the TV cartoon featuring "The Jungle Book" characters. Join Baloo and Kit Cloudkicker as they fly the Ocean as you have never seen before: from Cape Suzette, Louie's mountains, through jungles, on water, in volcanoes, in search of adventure, in search of treasure, on looking for fun, all in one action-packed cartoon adventure !!!!! <br /> <br /> It was a favorite of both me and my family. It ran on the Disney Afternoon throughout the first half of the 90s until the original cartoons moved to the Old Disney Channel in 1995, which I once saw on holiday in 1996 before getting a cable in March 1997. <br /> <br /> And good news: today the DVDs are here !!!!! Enjoy the fun and excitement of "Dun, Dun, Dun, TaleSpin !!!!!" <br /> <br /> 10/10
