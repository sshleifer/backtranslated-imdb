I just want to say that among all the so-called classic hip hop movies Ive seen such as Wild Style, KrushGroove, Breakin ', Style Wars etc. ... IMO BEAT STREET is the best among the others. When I ask others about what their fave is, BEAT STREET seems to be the best. But it is the lowest position of all. 4.3 is just a punch "under the band" (If it says, 5 points is the band). I like the musical performances, the breakdancing makes me want to spin, RAMO makes me want to throw a piece ... c'mon, it's a classic !!!
