One of the ten best comedies ever <br /> <br /> It looks like a comedy is so happy and light that sings. Keaton's comedies are jealous, harmonious, intelligently ordered, thought. <br /> <br /> Wonderfully amusing, deliberately delicious and resourceful, THREE AWES belong to a concept of a top ten comedies if I were to sketch one. A triple love story will captivate the viewers; I want to bring this approach here? Keaton's comedy is upside down like Lang's THUNDERS? or B REBOURS. Again are some of the waters of the time and the periods in the Stone Age, in Rome and in Keaton's times? In a Mohammedan country, in Renaissance Italy and in China. The same device works in the two movies, one, a grim, ominous melodrama; - The other, a light, well-muted comedy. At Keaton it's actually the same couple; and maybe it's also with Lang. The babe wanted by both Buster and Beery is nice. I have written and found THREE OUES well, without being extremely sophisticated; The plot is actually very POPEYE ???? The babe is a piece of furniture, the only protagonist being the two male competitors? Keaton and Beery. Keaton's movie is simply very good and maybe one will be tempted to claim that it looks like ambitious fun, but it's not, but it's great fun, fun, great fun. And Wallace Beery makes a fine nemesis.
