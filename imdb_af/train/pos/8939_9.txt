A powerful adaptation of the best-selling book and the smash Broadway plays about the lives of Bessie and Sadie Delany, two "colored" sisters who were 100 years old. Wonderful in their age played by Ruby Dee and Diahann Carroll, they tell their story in the flashbacks of Amy Hill Hearth (played by Amy Madigan), a white reporter of the New York Times. The flashbacks and contemporary scenes don't have as much inspirational value in them as in the book, but are really powerful. However, certain aspects of the sisters' lives, such as the inter-racial background of their mother and the reasons for their father's strict personality, are not clearly reflected. You need to read the book to fully understand these things. It's just as good, because the book is just as good! Apart from the flaws, it was done wonderfully and performed, especially by Dee and Carroll, and a very powerful and educational film.
