I loved it and was so broken that no season was made !!! I wish they would! it was the best show ever !!!!!! there is probably no chance that they will decide not to cancel the show there! ha ha i wish there was already! I will be so excited !! I would really! I miss it! and was especially broken not to know what happened to Jason! I think they have to make another one ... I also think its stupid that you have to write ten rules to post a comment. This will drag your comments on and no one will read it !! I really want to know what happened to Jason and Nicole ... maybe they can make a run!
