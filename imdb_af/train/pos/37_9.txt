Of the elements that make it the best at this point, I have to say # 1 is Christine McIntire. Shemp's scene when poisoned and her reaction is truly wonderful. I suggest that Christine, like one poster, tried to laugh in that scene, but it made her look even more angry, to smile at Shemp's possible death. <br /> <br /> Another character that helps out is the Goon. His appearance was a great cross between horrific and comical goofball. Almost a character I would choose to meet in a dark rose or for any matter. I would prefer a little real whodunit mystery in this, but hey, when a short is this good, that's going to complain. Not me
