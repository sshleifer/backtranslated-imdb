An unconventional historical drama, with some fine fighting scenes. Tobey Maguire gives excellent performance, and gets some good backing. The writing is literate and fairly original, and the film is graciously liberated from heroes. That said, it drags a bit, and the last line is too much like a TV mini series. Still, Frederick Elmes's camera work holds one interest in the dim pieces (and every time you see a shot that reminds you that he worked for David Lynch). Worth to see.
