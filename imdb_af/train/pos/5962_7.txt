I've seen a number of "80s rocker horrors" from rubbish like "Terror on Tour" to ridiculous fun gems like "Slumber Party Massacre 2." Somehow, I managed to keep this one off, which is strange because it is probably the most popular and well-liked one. Well, I finally succeeded and it is easily the best of these mostly terrible (but almost always engaging!) Subgenre. The plot (which was picked up in the movie "Black Roses") relates to a misgit called Eddie, who has been charged by everyone in his high school for his taste in music. He loves 80's metal, especially his idol Sammi Curr (played by late big Tony Fields.) After Sammi dies, Eddie gives favorite radio DJ him Sammi's final recording. As soon as Eddie played the record backwards, he discovers that he is a bit louder, and bad things start with those who lure him. Is Sammi's music owned? "Trick or Treat" is well made and a total hoot. The special effects are great, although it contains the typical 80's laser beam. I grew up in the 80's, and while I wasn't a heavy metal fan, I remember the urban legend about playing back a record that worshiped the sounds of Satan. Haha! I also remember being told by my older brothers and sisters that both KISS and Ozzy worshiped Satan. It is therefore very amusing to see that they both come as a harmless radio DJ and an anti-rock priest. If I only saw this movie as a kid! While the movie in the 80's seems to be making fun between the alleged devil worship and heavy metal, the viewer never really looks like Sammi Curr is back from death, causing the destruction and killing of anyone coming in his way. It's the worst point of the movie, but if you can think it over, it's fun.
