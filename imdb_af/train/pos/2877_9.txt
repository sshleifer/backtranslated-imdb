I don't think I should tell you the story. Because it's been telling years and years. So I only share my feelings. I first saw Cinderella when I was five years old. From then on I was a Disney kid in a good way. The animation now looks childish and old-fashioned, but it is now part of its charm. Now, at the age of High School Musical and computer-generated images, people seem to have forgotten the genius and magical essence of early Disney movies. Luckily I was born before, so I was introduced to this classic. And it doesn't matter how old I get, I return to those five years it looks at VHS. What's the real magic of Disney.
