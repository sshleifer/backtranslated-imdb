Always enjoying the big actors of Harry Hamlin, (Jim Lansford), "Strange Hearts", '01, playing a straight arrow, all sorts of lovely young women get a lot of attention, namely Lisa Zane, (Lynne), "Monkeybone", '01, a co-worker at Jim Lansford and you're wondering why he's not trying to beat her. Annie Potts, (Kris Lansford), "Breaking the Rules", '92, is a very warm and lovely woman for Jim and has full confidence in her husband. Kris always wants to stay with her husband and even buy him a house without seeing him. This movie will keep you up to the very end!
