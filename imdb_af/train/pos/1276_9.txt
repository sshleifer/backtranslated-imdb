I love this movie. The noir footage combined with Spillane's no-nonsense character Mike Hammer works wonderfully to create a mood and seldom feels in low-budget detectives of the early fifties. It may not be 'The Maltese Falcon', but this film makes its own solid contribution to the genre. Spillane is often criticized for alleged misogyny, etc., but its "ladies" are far above their male counterparts in terms of cunning and intelligence. Poor old Mike Hammer, as played effectively by Biff Elliott, is blinded by the beauty of the mysterious psychiatrist he meets when investigating the death of an army mate. When the penny finally falls, his face is a picture. Good to see that the 50s censorship does not force the filmmakers to leave the famous last line. A Bona fide low budget classic.
