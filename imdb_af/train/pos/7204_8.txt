This is a stage game adapted for the screen. 95% of the film takes place in the beautiful home of playwright Sidney Bruhl (Michael Caine). He is the author of an incredibly successful Broadway game, but his last 4 attempts have been cursing - terrible. <br /> <br /> An aspiring playwright, Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve), who attended Sydney's acting workshop, sent him a copy of the play he wrote. Sydney tells his wife, Myra (Dyan Cannon), the play is fantastic. But is it good enough to die? Time will tell. <br /> <br /> Smart dialogue and numerous twists in the plot keep this movie entertained from start to finish. The whole role plays a good time. It reminds one of another fun Michael Caine secret: Sleuth. Valuable look. <br /> <br />
