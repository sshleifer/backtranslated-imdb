As I recall, George Girley's lyric and brother Ira Gershwin presented the Gershwin catalog for this film and it was refurbished by the producers. In many ways, it was a typical 50-year-old movie musical by the free unit at MGM and led by Vincente Minelli with much help from Gene Kelly. <br /> <br /> Of course, the Gershwin was one of the largest of all Broadway musical teams, but I think George himself was one of the greatest of all American composers, period !!! Gene Kelly was, of course, one of the two greatest male dancers of the film musical (one think of the other?) And I don't think she was ever in doubt. But I think the rest of the cast needs some explanations: Oscar Levant was a well-known personality in his time and as a real friend of George Gershwin he had to be in this movie. He was a talented pianist and even a moderate talented composer, as well as a well-known neurotic and hypochondrial, and as always, he plays himself. <br /> <br /> At this time, Leslie Caron was unknown and she was of the French "gamin" type. A talented dancer, she was never a real beauty. George Guetary, who plays the part of Maurice Chavalier, oops, I mean Henri Baurel, was Greek and not French, but he is definitely more than OK as a French boulevardier, even though it's a bit too young for the part. <br /> <br /> Gen's hoofer's voice is here, but Guetary has much better voice equipment. Although Gene was better thrown elsewhere, it is, of course, in 'Singin' in the Rain 'where his character calculates much more, even here he sometimes shows himself off-hook (he's not thrown for nothing as the original hook-up Joey in Pal Joey , the Broadway musical.) I wasn't so enchanted with his "I Got Rhythm" scene with the kids who didn't seem so spontaneous to me. <br /> <br /> Also, the character of Nina Foch's character Milo is quite annoying. <br /> <br /> But the highlight of the film is, of course, the long ballet at the end of the film, based on the title music with sets and costumes in the styles of the great French Impressionist painters. <br /> <br /> I have found it hard to believe Gene and Oscar as struggling artists and I don't think the musical numbers are as well set up as they may be, but on balance, the Gershwin music is in this movie very well served. <br /> <br /> The DVD is well done with fine clear graphics (when they are firmly ed.) and the mono sound is good, but a little thing level.
