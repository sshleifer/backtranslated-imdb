This is one of the best ensemble comedy / musical "B" movies I've seen (and since I'm in my 40's and just watching it now, I'm not an expert, but I have all the famous movies there saw. ). When a ton of actors get their lead for minutes at a time, the comedy usually comes in the music bands, and often the music breaks off the comic flow. Call me in a crazy mood, but when I saw it on TCM Europe, I laughed with pleasure! So, who laughed at me? Without a doubt, Mischa Auer gave me a fantastic breakthrough laugh, he even steals the end, it was wonderful! I'm talking about what I think is why this movie works, because although L & H is a point of sale (and why I'm complained to seeing this one (they and Hal Roach), I like them in their early Hal Roach stuff) , it keeps them to a minimum and remains squared on the ADULT rate (according to the standards of 1930, and not so far from today's standards when you read between the lines). Jack Haley is also great to watch, I admit that I only know him from W O OZ and I loved him there, and I also laughed out loud at his waiter in the show. Patsy Kelly is the only "ugly" femme in the 30's movies that really turns me on (something tells me she was a spit fire in real life); and the music numbers have a real professional production (Busby Berkley'ish) quality, which has blown me away from what I'm used to in this genre. I can continue, but I'm sure I really enjoyed this movie. 8 of 10 I saw it on TCM Europe and will take it to look at my wife again at TCM USA. Good stuff!
