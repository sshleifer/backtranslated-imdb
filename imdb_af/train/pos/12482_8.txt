I read nothing but good things about this movie and finally had a chance to watch it late tonight and that was all I expected to be and more. This is the way a proper horror movie should be. I think the reason it was so scary was because it was so realistic. The haunting sounding score was perfect for setting a dark mood. I like the dramatic opening scene and enjoy the rest of the movie. It was very easy to follow and understand, unlike some movies that are too complicated. The special effects were very good. I'd love to see more horror movies like this one. This is easily one of my favorites. A realistic thunder and lightning storm would have made a nice atmosphere for this movie. Otherwise, all the elements had a good horror movie needs. I recommend this movie to anyone who can appreciate a good, terrifying movie that doesn't push. I'll add it to my collection. The DVD has some interesting special features.
