I just can't agree with the above remark - there are many interesting and indeed incredible cinematic images in this one, it has an unusual structure and moves well to a terrifying climate range that is noteworthy for the effective use of silence. Furthermore, it explores the strange impulse of suicide in a very honest way, without recording any impact it shows, but not surviving and sensational. There is also documentation about it, as well as horror and art house cinema, and deserves a place under the canon of 'different' horror movies such as The Blair Witch Project and the original Ring (which predicts it and may well be unknown influence). It is definitely worth seeing if you are interested in the sides of horror cinema.
