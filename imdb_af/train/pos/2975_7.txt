Trey Parker and Matt Stone, creators of the show 'South Park', come back with something completely different. They create a new sport that combines baseball and basketball. This sport is known as baseball. It's like basketball, except that the rules of baseball are. involved and there is another letter e in the title. Here's how you play: you just shoot the ball while these two guys try to divert you to make the shot. Without simple. I can try it one day. After the game hits the streets, it soon becomes a great success. Who would have known that 2 immature friends could find a sport that was so successful? <br /> <br /> My opinion <br /> <br /> 'Baseball' is a very rough and dull spoof, filled with lots of slapstick violence, but it actually makes a little laugh and lots of fun. A definite recommendation for those of you who love slapstick and rude humor.
