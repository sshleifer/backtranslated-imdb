This is the one in which the lesser Rut Gordon plays an Agatha-Christie-type murder story writer who closes her cousin into a safe. Gordon believes he killed her cousin and the young man dies of suffocation, while Gordon goes back and forth to New York. However, he manages a few clues, scratching on some black safe boxes and an improvised and well-hidden note. Columbo enters the case, suspecting her immediately and solving the mystery simply by using his supernatural mystical intuitive powers. Oh, and Mariette Hartley is going to be Gordon's secretary and will be an extortionist. Hartley is, I believe, the great daughter of psychologist B. F. Skinner. I don't know if her ancestor has anything to do with her attractive belly button displayed during a belly dance, but I always admire Skinner. <br /> <br /> The murder was well handled. It's a good plot, and none of the artists or crew have anything fluff. But the outstanding figure here is Ruth Gordon, just a five-foot-tall shot. She was over 80 years old and watched it. There are moments when she is almost tarred, but she always has charm. Her acting is idiosyncratic. You can never be sure if she is serious or offensive to Columbo and the audience. She also gave good lines. What humor comes from Gordon? Columbo doesn't have any of his regular comic moments. <br /> <br /> All in all, a good job by everyone involved.
