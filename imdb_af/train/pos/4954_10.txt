A big, funny, sweet movie with Morgan Freeman (who plays himself) and meets at a small shop at a Spanish girl named Scarlet (Paz Vega), exploring a potential independent film. I was a bit dubious about the movie for the first ten minutes, but as soon as he was in the store, I really started to enjoy the movie. It shows how a positive attitude can change anything. It does not contain any complex plots and it is easy to follow, but will upset the sadness of mood and make you smile without the need for a small clay romance. It completely eliminates several scenes that allow you to connect your sides with low torque. A very rare masterpiece!
