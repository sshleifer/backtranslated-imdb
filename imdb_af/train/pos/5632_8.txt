Sounding drama, written by William Mastrosimone, based on his stage play, in which Farrah Fawcett Marjorie plays, attacked in the car by rapist Joe (James Russo). She manages to get away, but police inform her that there is nothing they can do. She realized, however, that Joe had found her wallet and knew where she was living. When her housewives Pat (Alfre Woodard) and Terry (Diana Scarwid) were down at work, Joe paid her a visit to complete what he had started. After humiliating and humiliating Joe in a variety of ways, Joe gets her chance to hit him back and bring him to jail. Because she knows well, she is in another "his word against your" situation and that no rape has taken place technically, she does not intend to use him easily before confessing Pat and Terry what his intentions were . <br /> <br /> The movie is finally a show between its two opponents. As it is now, Marjorie displays such ruthlessness that one has to wonder whether or not she has become as unholy as her nemesis. Fawcett does a good job, while Russo is really great when it comes to the depraved creep that does his best to manipulate the situation. With just two characters on the screen for a lot of running, the movie has an intimate nature that suggests it will work even better on stage. Director Robert M. Young is not ashamed of the ugly and more exploitative elements of the situation; The movie is sometimes uncomfortable to watch. And by the time Marjorie prevails, things change so that it is no longer so easy to encourage her to go for blood, and one hopes that Pat can show her. <br /> <br /> I felt "extremities" were a good movie that at least kept interest and a fairly high level of intensity. Woodard and Scarwid are both supportive (Scarwid has a wonderful moment where Terry introduces herself as a rape victim), and the pace is consistent. Granted, the dialogue is not always very sharp, but the material forces every step of the way. <br /> <br /> 8/10
