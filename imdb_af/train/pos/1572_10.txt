When you read another user's review and say it's a terrible game, I can't stand still and do nothing! <br /> <br /> Well, this game is good, out of the news (with two real people, full of humor and credibility!), to the story, I find it very good! I only complain about the enemies starting to flash when they die until they disappear; and some frustrating situations on the LEILA VR missions, when riding the bike here and there ... <br /> <br /> Besides that, it's a good game, with a good story, good graphics, excellent characters , good soundtrack ... I recommend it! Certainly! It can be a little old, but still nice! At least, on the Dreamcast ... but the PS2 version will be the same.
