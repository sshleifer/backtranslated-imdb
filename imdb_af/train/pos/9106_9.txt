Since I first watched it, Piedras is a personal favorite and one of the few photos I could actually watch over and over. The big screenplay shows the lives of a lot of women (all of them somehow interconnected) with deep understanding and sensitivity. Ramón Salazar achieved a compelling film in his director's debut, proving himself an effective actor director. <br /> <br /> Not that all the performances are great. Of all the leading ladies they range from average (Najwa Nimri) to very good (Vicky Peña), but the standing ovation must be directed to newcomer Mónica Cervera, who convincingly plays Antonia San Juan's delayed daughter. Enrique Alcides is irresistible charm as the girl's male nurse, and there are nice little twists from Andrés Gertrúdix, Geli Albaladejo and the director himself, Ramón Salazar. <br /> <br /> "Piedras" was beautifully written and filmed when I looked at it so much that I couldn't stop thinking about it for days. I highly recommend it.
