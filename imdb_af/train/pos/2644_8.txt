I don't know what it is, but I find it so nice about this movie, but the first time I saw it, I wanted to see how it ended. I'm not a big fan of Paul Winfield or of war drama, but I really wondered how and when Winfield would find his child. All he knows is that the boy has green eyes. The truth is, I haven't seen this movie in years, or it has been shown on the television for a while, but this movie is a bit of one man's odyssey after the pain of the war. Winfield shows a very sympathetic and heartwarming representation of a man who has been lost through his memories. There is an underlying message in this movie that he is seeking the last shit of human morality in the wake of this war and the reality he is confronting. Why this movie is not yet on DVD or video is a mystery to me.
