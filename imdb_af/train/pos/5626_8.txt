Marjorie, a young woman working in a museum and living with two female roommates, Pat and Terry. One night she got in her car and was attacked by a masked man with a knife. His plan is to rape her, but she manages to escape. The man has her wallet. The police can't help her, as the rape didn't happen. Then one day, when Marjorie's roommates are at work, her attacker comes there. His name is Joe. A long struggle against this man. But then she passes his eyes and mouth with insecticide, things that will kill him if he doesn't get help quickly. She commits him and makes Joe the subject of the same kind of physical and spiritual assaults he has used on her earlier. The Extremities (1986) are run by Robert M. Young. It is based on the controversial Broadway game of 1982 by William Mastrosimone. Farrah Fawcett, who lost her fight with cancer last year, is awesome as Marjorie. James Russo, who also played the attacker in the play, is convincing as Joe.Alfre Woodard and Dia to Scarwid are great like Pat and Terry. James Avery is seen as Security Guard. She has a Golden Globe nomination. It's not a movie that's supposed to entertain you. Asking a question is justification for revenge. It's not a perfect movie, but I recommend it.
