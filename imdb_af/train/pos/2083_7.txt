This film was an interesting show by Hollywood on the novel of the same name by Pearl S. Buck. While some today believe it is common with racial stereotypes, the idea of ​​Chinese protagonists was progressive in and of itself. I found that the white actors playing Chinese were not as bad as I expected, it was not the Asian equivalent of Blackface. Only then was there not really an Asian actor in America (and not even George Takei did) and Rainer did a good job with her part. It was not the greatest achievement I have ever seen, but it was nice for the old school's preliminary method. The locust scene was very well shot and had convincing special effects. <br /> <br /> I wonder that the timing of the release during the Great Depression type changes this movie into an allegory. Particularly the political upheaval disregards the farmer farmers and how it seems to be left behind by all this. <br /> <br /> The movie had some parallels to the John Ford style, but I think the eastern influence also affected it. . If it was a western family, the locusts would eventually have won and punished the farmer for his pride, lust and greed. But here he learns his lesson and then he wins.
