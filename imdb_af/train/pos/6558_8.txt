I do not agree with previous comments on this movie. I think it was cute and nice and it was a good message for young girls like my daughter. You don't have to dress like a cheap hooker to be cool. You can be smart and beautiful and healthy. I think the throw was good and the story was good for the target audience. All-in-all my wife, daughter (10) and I thought it was a good movie. I definitely recommend it. It also encouraged my daughter to read the original Nancy Drew mysteries. I'm sure she would love to love the Hardy Boys. <br /> <br /> It was a struggle to make her sleep tonight because she wanted to start reading right away. I can't think of a better outcome for that movie than reviving interest in the classic series.
