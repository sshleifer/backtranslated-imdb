I always enjoy movies that portray life as it is. Life sometimes has boring patches, no real plot, and not necessarily a happy ending. "A River Walk Through It" is the perfect name for this movie (and Norman Maclean's novel). Life ebbs and flows like a river, and these are difficult places, but it's a wonderful journey. <br /> <br /> Robert Redford brings a lot to the movie. His narration has a friendly feel that fits perfectly with the picture. As a director he is held and calm and he takes some amazingly beautiful scenes. Regarding the acting, Craig Sheffer and Brad Pitt work surprisingly well as brothers. I do not know how to describe Tom Skerritt and Brenda Blethyn's performances, except that they really really feel. "A River Walk Through It" is a wonderful movie. <br /> <br /> 8.6 out of 10
