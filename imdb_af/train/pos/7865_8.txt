Page 3 is a good movie. The story is so refreshing and interesting. Not once throughout the movie I looked at myself in space. Konkana Sen did a good job in the movie, although I think someone with more glory or enthusiasm would have been better, but she did a good job. All the supporting actors were also very good and helped the movie. Boman Irani did a good job. There is one thing that stands out in this movie THE STORY it is wonderful, and very realistic, it doesn't bother the forest. It is very straight forward to send out his message. I think more movies like this should be made, I'm sick of watching the same tuck movie movies over and over, they are now getting hard to digest. Everyone should watch it, it's a good movie. Not me 2 cents :)
