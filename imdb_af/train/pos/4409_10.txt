This movie is one of the sleepers of all time. I gave it a 10 rating. The story is of the famous 'Bushwhackers' from Missouri who fought along the South during the War. The clothes they wore were authentic, history and why they fought, were very accurate and well researched. There was actually one of the battles that didn't happen, as they portrayed ... but not bad for Hollywood. The actors were well-cast and were either the brilliant actors or the director really knows how to get the best of them. I suspect it was a combination of good directing, super-cool to find the right people and great action by the actors. Not just one or two ... this movie really screamed! It has action, romance, excitement, good guys and bad guys (sometimes depending on your individual perspective) and history all went in one go. Even the future Spiderman and Jewel. And she's fine!
