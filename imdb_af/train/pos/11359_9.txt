Citizen X tells the real life drama of the quest for a ceremony called "The Rostov Ripper". This big movie shows the long journey it took to try to catch a killer. The film shows how politics might have helped the government keep the killer for more than 12 years. (Possibly more than 50 victims, mostly women and children) The performances of Stephen Rea as chief detective and Donald Sutherland as the overall investigation lead were excellent. Jeffrey DeMunn as Ripper Andrei Romanovich Chikatilo. This is the type of movie that will captivate you and immediately investigate the matter on the internet. It's a movie that can't be missed. This debut I believe on HBO and never got a theatrical release to my mind. Great movie
