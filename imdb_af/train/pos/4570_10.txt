Even if you know absolutely nothing about Ireland, you must love "My Left Foot" (and especially Daniel Day-Lewis's performance in it). He plays cerebral palsy Christy Brown. As a result, he spent most of his life. Even when they try to warn people about something, they just laugh at him. The light in the darkness for him is that he has control over one body part: his left foot. He uses the addition to paint and write poetry, which brings him prominence. <br /> <br /> Daniel Day-Lewis and director Jim Sheridan did very well with this collaboration and also on a later collaboration: "In the Name of the Father" (but "The Boxer" was unnecessary). "My left foot" can make you feel many ways: sad, hopeful or something else. But anyway, Daniel Day-Lewis has given the performance of a lifetime here. A great movie in every way.
