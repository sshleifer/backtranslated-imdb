Deanna Durbin really saved Universal from bankruptcy and made it possible to stay a great studio. By the mid-30's, most of the great directors at Universal such as Milestone had gone Browning and Wyler. Only James Whale stayed, but his sought after horror movies were behind him. Deanna and Judy Garland appear in a short "Every Sunday" and initially Garland was proposed for the role of Penny in "Three Smart Girls". When Garland was not available, Universal switched to Durbin. Initially, she was definitely a supportive player, but her potential was so bright that the script was rewritten to make her the star. Directed by Henry Koster, the film had a European touch. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with a beautiful panorama of a lake in Switzerland. The three smart girls of the title - three sisters, Joan (Nan Gray), Kay (Barbara Read) and Penny (Deanna Durbin) are sailing with Penny giving her glorious voice to "My Heart is Singing". Everything is not too good on the home front - their father plans to remarry a younger woman (Binnie Barnes) so that the three girls, with the help of their trusted nurse (Lucille Watson), decide to go to New York and their mother. reunited. . Lucille Watson is best remembered for her role as Robert Taylor's strict mother in Waterloo Bridge (1941). <br /> <br /> Donna is a gold digger who is set up with Alice Brady. To marry Judson Craig (Charles Winninger). For someone with no movie experience, Deanna is wonderful like Penny, a typical tricky, enthusiastic child sister and she is as beautiful as a photo. When she sings to someone who cares about her, you will just melt - what a glorious voice she has. She also has one of the funniest lines in the film. When her father console her with "I'll bring you to the zoo tomorrow," she replied, "Oh, I can see enough monkeys here!" <br /> <br /> With the help of Bill Evans (John King) they decide to hire a "Mischa Auer" to Donna's romance. They arrange to get together at a nightclub, but because of an abuse, Mr. Michael Stuart (Ray Milland) wrong for the score and Donna falls for him (she thinks he owns half of Australia!) The plan falls as he falls Kay and Donna want to speed up her marriage to Judson. <br /> <br /> Penny decides to take matters into her own hands and run away. She is taken to the local police station where she entices the police with her version of Il Bacio (she tries to convince them that she is a young opera singer.) Everything ends happily with their mother (Nella Walker) things with their father, and Meanwhile, Donna notices the unfair count (Mischa Auer) and sails to Australia with him. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
