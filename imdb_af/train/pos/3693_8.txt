It's not easy to make a movie with 18 different stories in it. Although 18 different international directors have taken up the challenge, not all of them are good, some of them even boring. But in his entity, "Paris, you t'aime" is breathtaking, showing that, like "Love Actually" it put, "love is everywhere", especially in the city of love. Here's an overview of the 18 different stories. MONTMARTRE - kind of a dull opening sequence, nothing really special about it. A man finds a parking lot and sees very strange couples, and wonder why he can't get a girl. And if suddenly a woman falls beside his car ... QUAIS DE SEINE - Another dull ride, about three teenage teams looking for a piece of ass, suddenly a Muslim girl travels right in front of them and gets help from one of the boys. Basically, but with a warm heart. <br /> <br /> READ MARAIS - it was a great disappointment! Although a love story between two boys with an artistic background could have been interesting by the great Van Sant. Ultimately, everything that comes after the monologue by Ulliel is good, everything before it is just annoying. <br /> <br /> GARDENS - an entertaining sequence by the Coen brothers. Buscemi - without saying one word - is fascinating and the whole series is just hilaries. This one tied me to the end, and this one also really gets you attached to the movie. <br /> <br /> LOIN DU 16IEME - a beautiful story too, even if the performance is poor, the heart is there. It's the story of a Spanish woman who dropped her child early in the morning to look after another suburban baby. Pretty. <br /> <br /> PORTE DE CHOISY - this segment should be the weirdest and strangest of the whole movie. Some kind of shampoo sellers arrive in a Chinatown lookalike place in Paris. If I understood correctly, it was about inner beauty, but I think I'm wrong. <br /> <br /> BASTILLE - a wonderful sequence. A man meets with his wife at a restaurant to break up with her so that he can run with his mistress. But the woman has some devastating news. Pretty basic but really sad and beautiful! PLACE DES VICTOIRES - a sad sequence too. Juliette Binoche plays a sad mother. One night she woke her dead child. When she arrives at the place, a cowboy tells her she can give her last farewell. One of the best segments! TOUR EIFFEL - Two mimes that fell in love could have been good, but although they have some good movies, the story is not intriguing and not funny at all. <br /> <br /> PARC MONCEAU - a true Original and Good Order, one of the best of the movie! A young girl and an older man discuss their future and her fear of a certain man ... Cuaron is doing a good job and the actors are great! QUARTIER DES ENFANTS ROUGES - An American actress (Gyllenhaal) falls in love with her drug dealer. a beautiful segment again, with a very sad end PLACE DES FETES - a woman comes to a homeless man, he starts talking romantic to her ... because she is the love of his life. Beautiful, sad, shocking, romantic, ... Place des FÃªtes will all cry. <br /> <br /> PIGALS - a boring series between Ardant and Hoskins, looking for new excitement in their relationship ... very unfunny and unromantic, Pigalle is a down-down. <br /> <br /> QUARTIER DE LA MADELEINE - bringing a little diversity to the movie, QdlM is a relief. A young man (Wood) finds a victim who kills a victim ... The tourist and the vampire ... fall in love! Dark, terrible and strange romantic, Madeleine is wonderful. <br /> <br /> PERE-LACHAISE - another loose-down segment. Targeted by Wes Craven and by stars like Mortimer and Sewell, it could have been good, but Pere Lachaise is just plain, not original. <br /> <br /> FAUBOURG SAINT-DENIS - the rumors are TRUE, Twyker's Short Film is beautiful, beautiful and well done. A blind man picks up the phone and hears of his girlfriend (Portman - truly amazing) that she breaks with him. He reflects on their relationship. <br /> <br /> QUARTIER Latin - although this segment is co-directed by Depardieu and has such stars as Rowlands, Gazzara and Depardieu, this segment is also a decline. Nothing happens, a lack of chemistry between the actors. <br /> <br /> The 14th arrondissement - the last order is hilarious and sad at the same time. An American tells about her trip to Paris in her French class. Her French is really horrible, but at the end of the segment she realizes that Paris is so much more than she sees. <br /> <br /> With Feist in the background, Paris, your t'aime ends in a lovely tone, and I do not leave myself at all, although some segments have bored hell out of me, the entity of the movie big! A real movie experience for young and old. Paris, you t'aime wonder!
