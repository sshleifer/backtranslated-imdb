The director and two stars of LAURA (1944) were executed for this solid policeman. Dana Andrews is the son of a criminal who becomes a police spokesman to cut all ties with the past, but cannot keep his inherited violent ways in check while questioning suspects, and one night he goes too far; Gene Tierney is the estranged wife of his victim, an ornate war hero who became involved in the town's leading racer and Andrews number 1 nemesis, Gary Merrill (who himself was Andrew's Snr's protégé). As usual with Preminger, it is a well-crafted film with a remarkable opening credit sequence and fueled by a good role that also Karl Malden (like Andrews' established superior), Tom Tully (as Tierney's car-mouth taxi driver) and Neville Brand (as Merrill's chief thief), with the eye-catching support, also comes from Craig Stevens (as the smart, female victim), Bert Freed (as Andrews sympathetic partner) and Robert F. Nolan (as Andrews' strict outgoing superior) . Having warned the latter to recover his ways, Andrews moved after a few hours after his murder, Stevens, to put the police on the (in this case) wrong songs from Merrill. However, after Tully became the first suspect (at which time Andrews and Tierney are romantically involved), the policeman himself goes to Merrill's army to completely disguise and frame the racket driver for his own murder! Obviously, the protagonist has a complex character and Andrews rises to the challenge with a first-class characterization that is typically complemented by the in-house Fox noir style.
