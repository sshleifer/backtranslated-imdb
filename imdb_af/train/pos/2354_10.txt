It was such a surprise when this show went on because it was such a fresh, innovative and original show. It makes every show I've ever seen seem boring. The moment the first episode broadcasted, I was enchanted, and I easily attached to all the characters (which usually never happens because I always hate a few characters). It is a pity that this show will not have a third season, as it should be one of the best shows I have ever seen and it does not overdo my feelings for the show. Nothing can ever replace Pushing Daisies because what can ABC find possible to replace this show? It's easily the best television show. <br /> <br /> I came to Kristin Chenoweth and I stayed because I fell in love with the whole show.
