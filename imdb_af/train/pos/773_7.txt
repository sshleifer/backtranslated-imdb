I expected something else: more passion, drama ... Another failed attempt of originality. It's a pity to say that the movie in the old clich√© of "cheesiness" falls. not very convincing and the lines that are common have no white. The soundtrack was good and well adapted. I can't say that this movie is a total flop because people watch it but it didn't meet the public's expectations and came to the conclusion, the production holds you almost half an hour in front of the TV. This is a noticeable thing. So, I think it's worth seeing if you don't get irritated.
