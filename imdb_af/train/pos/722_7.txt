One of b and c film makers Roger Corman's biggest cultist was the Ramones vehicle (originally named for Cheap Trick), Rock N'Roll High School. It's just a simple, technically dated story (but would serve extra doses of nostalgia as it was the kind of thing Napoleon Dynamite made characters - see Eaglebauer's of) about teenagers who love rock n'roll. <br /> <br /> Students at Vince Lombardi High School are met with resistance by the evil principal, Miss. Evelyn Togar (played by the cult classic favorite, Mary Woronov) who fears Rock N'roll makes the kids in uncontrollable, amorous devils and vows to make a Rock N 'Roll-free zone. In fact, she plans to wipe out Rock N 'Roll for all students, whether it's at school, and she has the collaboration of most adults who can make the plan successful. <br /> <br /> But if Riff Randell (PJ Soles) can't help it. A Ramones fanatic, she has written a few songs (including Rock N 'Roll High School) that she wants to give to the Ramones, and trying to do so is held back by Miss Togar doing everything she can to her watch the Ramones play in the village. It culminates in an ultimate uprising between the obsolete fun-following adults and the teens (in an end reminiscent of the Rand, somewhat). After years of punk, when the fame of the garage rockers, the Ramones (and others) another mark in the music evolution will mark, it was wonderful to see a movie showing the fun of everything and on such humorous, exaggerated way. <br /> <br /> It's mostly light comedy, but a good feel-good comedy, though, if you're in the mood, there's something that gives you back to entertain you. With Jerry Zucker (fame of the plane) and Joe Dante (of Gremlin's fame), both participating in some of the director, you can get the idea of ​​what kind of humor you're in (and not to mention, expect Dick to see Miller, even if it's just for a few minutes in the finals of the movie. The story has to be inspired later (and updated) through the mid-90 comedy, Detroit Rock City, which turns a small character into the vehicle for older glam rockers, Kizz. <br /> <br /> I recommend The passing Corey Feldman vehicle, Rock N 'Roll High School, has been released nearly a decade later. The original is still the best.
