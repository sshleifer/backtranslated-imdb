I joined IMDb so people know what a good movie is! It does not often come across a moving film and a visual film, yet humble. You have read the plot so all I want to say is not to see it, because you want to see a clash of cultural religious identity babe, because it is the typical misconception that people read, but appreciate and realize it is going to happen. about a father and son traveling together getting to know each other by their struggle. Buy it and send it before film4 arrives there. It was one of the few films to be nominated for an independent and foreign BAFTA. The beauty is that he is able to appeal to someone, even if you never use subtitles or just for the Hollywood formula, just a good story that will keep you engaged. The only thing I wish for is that it will be longer and see what happens
