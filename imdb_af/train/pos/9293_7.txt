Tip number one - read the title as "the time of the mad dog" or maybe dogs. This is a pretty good ensemble piece (look at the role and rent it - you know you are curious), and first time director Bishop gives them their chance to take his time so the characters interact with the cold as they wait - not enthusiastically - for the return of the "big boss" and whatever revenge takes place. <br /> <br /> For some of us, Christopher Jones is the highlight of his self-abandoned exile from films. he remains a commanding film presence. And yes, with Christopher Jones, Larry Bishop and Richard Pryor involved, it's the "Wild in the Streets" reunion party!
