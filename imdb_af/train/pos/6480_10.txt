It was by far the best war documentary ever made. From the beginning of the first episode, Sir Laurence Olivier described the terrible events in Oradour-Sur-Glane: "The day the soldiers came." Until the last days of the war when the mushroom clouds appeared over Japan, I never missed a second of this classic series and I remember well, even though it returned in 1974. Every aspect of this tragedy has been dealt with in detail. . This whole series must be mandatory for as many of the world's children as possible, so that the tragedy of World War II is not repeated and that dwarf, hatred, greed and intolerance are not confused with patriotism or religious zeal.
