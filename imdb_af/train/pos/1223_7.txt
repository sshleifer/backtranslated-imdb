About a year and a half ago my dad told me about The French Doors. I thought it sounds interesting enough, but I didn't try to find it anywhere. Then about a year ago I remembered that movie and thought "hey why" and trying to find it on the internet. finally after about a week of watching, I found it on atomic films. I phoned my dad to the computer and told him, "Hi Dad, I found that spectacular movie you've already told me!" He smiled at me, turned around to turn off the lights, so it was black, apart from the computer screen, saying I should see it. I started well ... Then when he got worried about what was there, I found it very unpleasant. at the end I pushed back my chair and got up. It made me jump !: P If you didn't see this movie, I recommend you because it's worth it. even after the fourth or fifth time it is still disturbing. <br /> <br /> GREAT MOVIE!
