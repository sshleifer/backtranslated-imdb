Timeless musical gem, with Gene Kelly in top form, stylish direction by Vincente Minnelli, and wonderful music numbers. It's a good start from end to end, one of those movies that people see with a smile and say, "They don't make them as they used to!" But they never made them that good. The climactic 25-minute music series without any dialogue is one of the most beautiful in film history. Movie magic, clearly derived from the heart and soul of everyone involved. A must see!
