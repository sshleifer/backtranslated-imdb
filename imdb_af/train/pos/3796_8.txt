Jim McKay has made one of the best films you'll see all year long. The quiet simplicity of this movie pulls you off the opening shot and never lets go. There is not one false note in the whole movie. Not one. Everything works. The hand camera is never distracted and always where it should be. The three young ladies whose lives we follow are always really. There is no single beat where the audience is reminded. We look at actresses that play a role. These are just real girls trying to find themselves. There is no political agenda, hidden or otherwise. It is cinema at its most basic, and although it will probably only be seen by a handful of moviegoers, it deserves a much greater release. special hats down to Hugh Hefner for providing the filmmakers with the necessary money to make this important film. I can't wait to see what Mr. McKay does next.
