I don't quite know how to explain "Darkend Room" because summarizing it wouldn't do it right. It's a typical Lynchian short film with two beautiful girls in a strange, mysterious situation. I would say this short is definitely more on the "Mulholland Drive" end of the Lynchian spectrum, as opposed to "The Elephant Man" or "The Straight Story." This is hidden on Lynch's website, and the search is worth it.
