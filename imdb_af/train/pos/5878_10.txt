Garam Masala is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Akshay Kumar is excellent as the female man who has business with 3 girls and is involved at the same time. John Abraham is sometimes amusing and this is one of his best works so far. Paresh Rawail is excellent as usual in most of his films. The director Priyadarshan delivered good films in the past. Hera Pheri, Hungama and Hulchul are the best. Garam Masala is his funniest film he made. The three new actresses are average. Rimisen doesn't get much in this movie. I was impressed to see how Priyadarshan made a movie with a simple storyline of a man who had a relationship with 3 girls at the same time. All 3 girls have a day off in the same day and end up in the same house. Packed with many Laughs, it's a non stop entertainer.
