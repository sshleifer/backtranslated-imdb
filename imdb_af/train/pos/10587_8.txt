This movie is not shocking, despite the lo fi production and its link to Troma productions. A dark fable for adults. Exploitation is a theme of sugar cookies, and one wonders if the roll did not fall prey. A strange movie with alluring visual arts: shadows and contrast are prominent. Definitely worth it, especially from fans of Warhol and stylish decadence. Through all the cruelty and wickedness a moral, though distorted, can be shone.
