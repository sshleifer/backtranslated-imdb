Absolutely enjoyable song and dance film with Frank Sinatra and gen Kelly, as well as Kathryn Grayson. <br /> <br /> The movie won and Oscar for George E. Stoll's score, and it has nominations for best photo, best actor for Kelly, and Best Cinematography, as well as a Best Sun nomination for "I is in love with Sinatra. " <br /> <br /> It was a cute story about Kelly helping his friend. Sinatra gets a girl and falls in love with herself. The beautiful Grayson (The Toast of New Orleans) surprised us with her singing, and we had great songs and dance routines by Kelly and Sinatra, as well as the works of pianist conductor Jos√© Iturbi. <br /> <br /> A classic Hollywood music from a past era.
