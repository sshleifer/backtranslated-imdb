I caught the movie on the cable late at night, and I was pleasantly surprised. I can only imagine why this movie was not better known, because the subject is very disturbing. But if you can handle the subject of sexual abuse, it's a well-activated, exciting and very interesting movie. Both Richard Gere and Claire Daines are very good at it. And although the subject is not for the despondency of the heart, the film does not go away from being too brutal (such as 8mm). I recommend it to anyone who enjoys series killers and stress-type movies.
