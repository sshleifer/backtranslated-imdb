I just have to throw my two senties. Relax, it's a comedy. Yes, for the most part, the characters are broadly written and performed. I can't think of many comedies where they aren't. It's not a new version, it's almost every week on video and on the air. Would I see it in a theater? Sure, I did that when it first came out. It's funny ... it must be enough. <br /> <br /> Even if I didn't like it at all, I'd still see it on cable for Michael Keaton. He is an underrated and undervalued actor. I can't think of anyone else who is so capable in every genre. I also can't think of one that is so successful. A comedic actor who is also an action star (short-lived but still), who is also a romantic head, who is also a dramatic actor; a villain and a hero. I can't think of any, at least not in Hollywood. Certainly no one who was successful in all those genres. I mean there is Tom Cruise, but to me he is better to be Tom Cruise than to become a character. But it's not about Michael Keaton vs. Tom Cruise, so I'm going further. <br /> <br /> Gung Ho is worth renting, it's worth buying because you can probably find it for $ 10.00 or less at stores like Wal-Mart. It is worth looking at the cable (if you have cable or satellite). It's one of those fun to watch movies. You can break your brain and just relax, and hide. <br /> <br /> To ask for more, I ask too much in my honest sense.
