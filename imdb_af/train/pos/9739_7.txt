I enjoyed this movie, mainly because of Simon Pegg, who quickly became a solid box office for the comedy films. <br /> <br /> He was hired from his death. Jeff Bridges, as author, for one of his celebrity cloths. <br /> <br /> After paying his costs, he made it into the higher echelons of celebrity writing hackdom (the seventh room) where he came to be a lesser known celebrity himself. The storyline is very funny, and Gillian Anderson plays an impressive supporting role as a personality person. <br /> <br /> On the road to success, he finds the true meaning of love, etc. <br /> <br /> The formal plot aside, the film was very funny, mainly due to Simon Pegg, Jeff Bridges, and Gillian Anderson. Kirsten Dunst was good to love. The rest of the supporting role play did his job well. <br /> <br /> It was a good comedy and worth watching at the theaters.
