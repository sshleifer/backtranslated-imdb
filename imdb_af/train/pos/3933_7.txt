The problem with portraying an actual individual is that the performance may be good, but still does not work if the audience does not believe the actor portrays the person. This is the main problem with "Young Mr. Lincoln:" Henry Fonda gives a tremendous performance, but I found it hard to believe that Abraham Lincoln was as soft as Fonda portrayed him. <br /> <br /> It's essentially a courtroom drama with a young Abraham Licoln at the forefront. Whether it's a real story, I don't know, but if not, why use Lincoln as the central character? Never mind though. In the film Lincoln defends two young men accused of murder. <br /> <br /> There isn't really much on the film, and it looks like it's nice. I wanted more story and character development. The movie is 100 minutes long, but it doesn't. There are a few little scenes with Lincoln and the booming relationship with Mary Todd, but they seem superficial. <br /> <br /> The acting is good everywhere, but as I said, Fonda's character works as a character, but not Abraham. Lincoln. I just don't think the true Lincoln was soft. Certainly, he has a big voice when he needs it, such as when he persuades a drunk lynch gang to have the accused heard, but Fonda depicts Lincoln too soft. The other performances, however, are solid, especially Alice Brady as Abigail Clay, the accused's mother. She is a good lady, for whom we can really feel. Simple and unconcerned, but very sweet; we can see why Lincoln wanted to help her. <br /> <br /> John Ford thinks of this movie as an epic, and at the time of his release, it was probably. But even then there is not enough material to offer it as such. <br /> <br /> It's a nice look, but not a classic.
