This movie is a punch of punk rock fun from start to finish. The Ramone, the ruling princess of the late 70s Punk rock, appears as themselves. PJ is teaching stars like Riff Randle, the rebellious high school girl who lives and breathes rock and roll. Riff is obsessed with writing songs for Ramones, her favorite rock band. She keeps the school rockin ', and encourages her fellow students to join her in jubilant antiques. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the school that Riff attends is a brand new principal called me. Togar, hired. She is a large, intimidating Amazon woman. And his vows to make the student's counter-line. She even performed some of the students as monitors, who returned to their classmates. Me. Togar is particularly determined to be Riff and put an end to Riff's anarchic Shenanigans. But Riff has clever ways to fall on Togar in every turn. <br /> <br /> Kudos for the wonderful performance of Mary Woronov, in her role as Principal Togar. Mary is a legendary B-movie actress. And in this movie she plays fascist Ms Togar, with a sniff. PJ Soles as Riff, turns into an electrifying show. Clint Howard as the double Eaglebauer, has fun with his role. <br /> <br /> The Ramones play many of their hit songs in this movie. And so the viewer sees why the Ramones were so influential in the 70s Punk rock scene. Certainly, this is a good movie for Ramones fans. But even if you're not in the Ramones or Punk rock, this movie is a tremendous blast (literally) of energetic pleasure.
