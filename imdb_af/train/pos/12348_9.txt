It helps incredible if you are familiar with the culture and period of time this movie takes place. First, these ladies are NOT geisha, they give or take over (prostitutes) in the Yoshiwara-type "green houses", about 1860. It should help to clear details that can be confusing to the unaware. The film deals with issues of loyalty, love and, perhaps most importantly, how people deal with adversity, both their own and those of others in their immediate environment. This plus the far-reaching photography, along with the haunting music, make a beautiful ride. Just plug it in, stop your unbelief and enter their world. You won't be disappointed.
