Another detailed work on the subject by Dr Dwivedi takes us back to Panjab in time. Dr Dwivedi has chosen a difficult subject for his film debut. He worked on every detail to bring the story to life. The treatment of the subject is very delicate. <br /> <br /> Although we were not in the area, the sets and costumes really look. Unlike most movies made on partition, this does not focus on the greedy details of violence to attract audiences, but on their descendants. The characters come to life. Priyanshu Chatterjee delivered an impressive performance. Manoj Bajpai acted to show the fate of a guilty man. The rest of the cast also did a good job.
