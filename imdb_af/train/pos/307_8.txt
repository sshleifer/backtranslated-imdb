"They're all laughed" is one of those little movies I always recommend to friends to look for something out of the ordinary. It is firmly rooted in the screwball-romance traditions of the past, but looks more contemporary. Even the decidedly early 80s atmosphere doesn't date too much. Bogdanovich shows the whole business so lightly on his feet that reality never drops it on the ground. But it said, this kind of sweet little movie definitely relies on the actors to keep it going, and "TAL" is blessed with a dream throw that understands the requirements of this kind of story. It is a movie that will not last so long if it was not for the small moments of the excellent cast: Colleen Camp's commands simultaneously to John Ritter and her dog; Blaine Novak releases all the hair under his hat; and especially the moment Dorothy Stratten falls to John Ritter and says, "How ... funny." It is such a piece of fluff that you don't want to put too much of it, because it is a fear of crushing it, but it certainly makes one with a light heart and a smile on your face.
