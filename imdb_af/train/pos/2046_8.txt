While the soundtrack is a bit dated, this story is more relevant now than ever in the US. Not only does blue work work, but everyone's jobs are outsourced by US companies while government profits and Americans suffer. <br /> <br /> Peter Strauss is Emory, a steel worker who works the same job his father has done for 35 years. His wife is well portrayed by Pamela Reed, who is very realistic, and tries to support the family with two children when Emory loses his job. The mill is closed under the pretext of mismanagement, but there is also eclipse and cheaper wages where they can pay one steel worker in one month (outsourcing) that they have to pay Strauss / Emory in a day. Remember, these men are all good loyal workers who have values ​​and try their best for their family. <br /> <br /> John Goodman, Gary Cole (like Strauss's brother) and some other associates are also affected. . It is very disturbing and realistic. Some scenes move between Emory and his dad. Emory hopes his local union will be able to reopen the mill, as they promise to do so. <br /> <br /> Emory's brother, Lee, sees all the writing on the wall. There is no work in the rust band (Ohio) and they must continue. But where in the US can they go? Where would it be better for a blue bar steel worker? <br /> <br /> There is a triumphant scene at the end where Emory and his crew fill up the steel building. The guard allowed them to do so as a final gesture, one of the men committed suicide and he had empathy. <br /> <br /> Overall, a good message movie about difficult times here in America. Something that pays little attention to being personally affected. 8/10.
