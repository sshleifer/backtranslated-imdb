This is one of my favorite sports movies. Dennis Quaid moves and convinces in the part of a man who gave his dream to be a baseball jug when his arm came out on him. As a high school coach, he challenges his players to win the division championship by telling them he will try for a baseball team if they do. They win (partly due to all the batting practices they take with a coach that can stretch more than 90 miles per hour), and he keeps his side of the bargain - and is signed! <br /> <br /> If you ever decided to try something new and scary as an adult, Jim Morris's story will resonate with you. It moves and inspires, and the man's relationships are true. <br /> <br /> Inspiration is not the only reason I rent this one. Dennis Quaid is just straight in the part, and a baseball movie with a nice man changing a diaper is my idea of ​​heaven. Ladies, if you feel I do, look at this one.
