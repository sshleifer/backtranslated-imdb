This one is hard to watch - as a previous reviewer says. It is incredible considering the terrible films that came out after World War II - especially the "liberation" of Dachau. Obviously we knew exactly what happened to the Jews from the middle of the war. The "transport" sequence is clear, almost as if based on a real news rule (the Nazis wanted to take their atrocities). Knox as the Nazi is brilliant. He sketched the course of a Nazi career. This karting tells, especially when it is in contrast to the other Germans' reactions, to laugh at Hitler, then incredibly and eventually helplessly. However, this contrast allows us to believe in the "conversion" of a young Nazi officer into an anti-Nazi attitude. This happened as a witness to the various attempts against Hitler, especially the Staffenberg plot that occurred when this film came out. A strong film, effective with flashback, accurate prediction of the Nuremberg trails and others that would occur as soon as the war ended.
