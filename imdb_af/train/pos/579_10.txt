In my humble opinion, this movie did not receive the recognition it deserved. Robert Redford lives near me in Provo, Utah, at Sundance. I enjoy most of his work, and that was my favorite. I'm sorry that more people didn't appreciate it. My grandmother was an avid reader and read the book years before it came out on the big screen. She told me to read after we saw the movie together. The movie and book hit an emotional spot in my heart, and I was a few days after the movie a few days later. Sometimes love is not enough to hurt our loved ones. We see it in our own family relationships, but endure our love and our families and their stories in generations of time. The cinematography was perfect and breathtaking. I was amazed at his beauty and how well it brought the words of the author of the book, Norman Maclean, to life. "But if I'm alone in the canyon's half-light, everything seems to be fading into a being with my soul and memories, and the sounds of the Big Black Foot River, and a four-paced and hoping for a fish The river is cut by the world's great flood and runs over rocks from the basement of the time, and on some of the rocks are timeless raindrops. some of the words are from them. Any possible mistakes the movie may have are overshadowed by the beauty and grace of the story and cinematography. It was beautiful!
