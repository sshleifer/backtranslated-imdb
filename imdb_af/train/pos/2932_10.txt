I saw my fair share of comedy and performance movies, but this one is so original, so fresh, it will make you wonder why you always walked, succeeding right in the video store. Murphy has some pretty funny jokes, but it's just too funny to succeed. If only every movie can be, it's funny. It should be called "107 minutes of the most incredible comedy". Murphy is a comic genius in this movie and will tell you "this is the guy Dr Doulittle did!" He talks about the ice cream man, shoes that throw mothers, his aunt with a mustache, racism, and everything you could possibly imagine and those you couldn't. If you ever see one comedy in your life, it's like all the movies can be Delirious.
