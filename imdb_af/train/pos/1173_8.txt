"Night of the Living Roofs" was a pretty strong finish for the first half of Season 11. Obviously, a parody of various zombie movies, especially Dawn of the Dead, is parallel to the homeless with living dead as beings that feed and thrive on savings change rather than brain. <br /> <br /> Kyle is found guilty of the sudden mass outbreak of homeless people when he gives a $ 20 to a homeless man from his home from the goodness of his heart. More homeless people are starting to infiltrate South Park until the town is completely overrun. This is a very strong Randy Marsh episode, as he takes on the role of the hauling leader of the adults hiding on the roof of the Park County Community Center. But before Randy makes it to the community center, he is attributed by hundreds of homeless people screaming screaming: "I have no change!" Unfortunately, refugees lose Gerald Broflofski to the homeless, when he tries to escape by catching a bus out of town, and unknowingly throwing away all his change for the bus to divert the homeless. Then he becomes one of them and asks everyone for change. <br /> <br /> The boys are trying to find out why there are so many homeless people in South Park, and find a man who is a director of homeless studies. They found that the nearby city of Evergreen had a similar problem with the homeless, so they escaped to Evergreen to find out what they were doing to solve the problem. Unfortunately, homeless people break into the man's house, and he tries to take the easy way out by shooting himself. However, he fails several times while shooting himself in the jaw, in the eye, in the chest, in the neck, in the shoulder, screaming screaming until he finally dies. This scene might have been better than a similar scene not done two weeks ago in the "Fantastic Easter Special". <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, a member of the refugee has discovered that due to the homeless problem, property values ​​have nosedived, so the bank closed its home and made him homeless. Randy immediately turned on and held the gun to the man's head. When the man finally asks the other for a few dollars to help him, Randy pulls the trigger. <br /> <br /> In Evergreen, boys find out that the town's citizens have sent the homeless to South Park, and that passing homeless people from town to town is taking place across the country. The boys change a bus that leads the homeless out of the South Park and take them all the way to Santa Monica, California. <br /> <br /> The zombie movie parallels and the great Randy Marsh lines make this one definitely viewable. 8/10
