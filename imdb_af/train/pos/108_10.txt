"Europe" (or, as you know, `Zentropa ') is one of the most visually stunning films I have ever seen. The blend of gray scales and color photography is close to seamless ... a real feast for the eyes. The picture was a contender for a 1991 Golden Palm in Canners. The award goes to Barton Fink (by Coen brothers); a film stylistically very similar to Zentropa. Here's a class exercise: hire both movies and be a judge yourself.
