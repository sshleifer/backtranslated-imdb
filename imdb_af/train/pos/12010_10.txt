Warning: a gentle spoil. <br /> <br /> The story of Joseph Smith stands as an incredible - even moving - episode in American history and world religious history. This movie shows events in the life of Joseph Smith, who respect the Mormons as a prophet for the restoration of the true Church of Jesus Christ on earth. I've seen the movie so far in his first month of public performance. <br /> <br /> Joseph Smith is first shown as the youngest of a trio of brothers (Alvin, Hyrum & Joseph) who need surgery at a very young age. The operation, without our modern facilities, was bloody and difficult. The scene helped to show the coherence of the Smith family and the ties between the brothers and between Joseph and his parents. <br /> <br /> Joseph's religious confusion and subsequent prayer leading to what Mormons call the First Vision are interestingly depicted. . The face of Jesus is never shown, but you see the unmistakable nails in His hands. The rejection by religious leaders and many in his small New York community is at least slightly adamant by Joseph's marriage to Emma. <br /> <br /> This movie does not describe the events of Mormon church history, but just jumps from scene to scene. It's not a criticism - just a note about the style. <br /> <br /> The practice of tar and feathering is shown, and it is particularly dramatic and moving when Joseph has recently attacked a sermon on the Savior's love of scarring. <br /> <br /> The film masters the memorial and growth of Mormonism as a children's church at the same time, while at the same time the increasing opposition that has spread in the heights of local governments, br /> The film shows many scenes from Joseph's life, including some beautiful moments depicting his relationship with Emma. An attempt is made to show the depth and complexity of Joseph's life, including his passionate love for his wife, his endless love for children, his knowledge, his courage in the face of dirty and dangerous opposition, his religious sentiments and his compassion. <br /> <br /> Since Joseph and Hyrum drive to Carthage, to never return alive, most characters from the whole movie, whose lives have been touched by Joseph, are shown along the way to help strengthened what has already been seen, but to make the final scene more powerful. <br /> <br /> In the end, the martyrdom of Joseph and Hyrum is portrayed, and filmmakers are considered to consider the events they have just seen. <br /> <br /> When I first watched the movie, I assumed it was made by the church to introduce Joseph Smith to non-members. I no longer think that's the case, though I hope the movie can only do it. As an insider, I find that the film is a celebration of Joseph and strengthens the good things we already know about him. I'm curious to see how outsiders will see the movie - whether they see it as a propaganda, an epic story of an American religious man or something else. <br /> <br /> The movie is beautifully shot, family-friendly, moving and hopefully something good for everyone. The fact that the events actually depicted in the United States are interesting to consider in the light of the many aspects of our culture - including freedom of religious expression and respect (generally) of the law - our mothers take for granted.
