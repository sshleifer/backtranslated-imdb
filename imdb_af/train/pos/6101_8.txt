So I don't ruin it for you, I'll be very brief. There are some good plays and funny lines from the attractive role. A young Harvard Med School graduate (Brian White) finds out he doesn't know much about what he thinks about people. He goes to a Florida hospital for his internship because a girl (Mya) left him for a job as a TV producer. His senior resident (Wood Harris) has been a great help from his "creative colleague" (Zoe Saldana) to speed him up. They help protect his career and show him the broader possibilities that come from compassionate doctors rather than a player who just wants to make money (as apparently for many of my buddies).
