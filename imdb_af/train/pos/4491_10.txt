I love this movie 'Spring and Harbor Wine'. I was born in Leigh, about 7 miles from Bolton. I moved to Bolton in 1965 when I was 20. My workplace was daily via Little Lever through Farnworth, sometimes on a bicycle, but then by car when I could afford it. The movie brings back all the memories of the neighbors of the working class that almost always broke, but who will always help you if they can. Fred Dibnah was at the turn of Bromwich St. where my beds were. If you haven't seen the movie when you first released, you can be forgiven for comparing it to a soap like Coronation St, and I agree it's a soap, but then it's Kitchen Sink Called Drama '. Watch this movie for the talented cast that soon became household names of regular roles on TV. I look mainly at the shots of the location and the feeling is good that people are poor but happy!
