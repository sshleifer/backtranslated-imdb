I went to bed with my gf last night, and while she brushed her teeth, I swung channels until I found this Chinese movie called the King of Masks. I initially thought it would be a Kung Fu movie, so I started watching it, and then it caught me right away, and I had to finish it. <br /> <br /> The girl in the movie was absolutely worshiped. She was such a good actor because he was so few. Perhaps the fact that it was in Chinese, so the English was baptized, made it harder for me to tell ... but she really looked perfect. I felt so bad for the girl as she was trying to please her "boss," but everything just got rotten. lol. Even when she brings him a grandson, he can only survive his art ... it seems the kid has been kidnapped, so he is arrested and has 5 days to live. lol ... everything she touches to be nice to her grandfather just goes back. <br /> <br /> In the end, he sees how much love is in her and teaches her the art of masks ... just as heartwarming to all the accidents in the movie. <br /> <br /> Definitely a gem, and totally original. <br /> <br /> Scott
