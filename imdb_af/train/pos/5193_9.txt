The sword fighting was outside this world, the battles were spectacular without flying on a wire technique (to the end) that is too common today. The scene with Chan and Bid was probably the highlight of the movie. The characters in the assault on the bad house were clich√©, but the movie was comfortable with it. An injection of humor from Woo. <br /> <br /> The plot with its turn and turn was unpredictable and exciting and you couldn't tell who was good or bad or which side people were. <br /> <br /> A good sense of tension and wealthy surprises. The depth of the story is very intense for a flying movie of this genre and reaches you in a way that most kung-fu flicks do not.
