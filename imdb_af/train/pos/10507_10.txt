This game is wonderful. Really, you should get it if you don't have it. Although old, it was wonderful when it came out. I believe this game will always be a classic. It's just like a Super Mario World or so. When I was young, my friend and I would sit and play this game for hours trying to beat what we eventually did. It's not nearly as advanced as Super Mario Galaxy, but if you're a fellow Mario fan, it's essential. It's fun and challenging. Everything you can from a fantasy game, except for good graphics, (well, it came out in 1996) ROCK ON 4EVA MARIO LUIGI AND YOSHI !!! Nintendo is the best!
