From what I read many people was disappointed with this movie, compared to Part 1. Initially, I could understand it, but after a little thought I think they are wrong. Soderbergh continues with his actual story of Che's life he started in Part 1. Part 1 tells a story of a revolution that moves from incomprehensible to an ultimate successful conclusion. Part 2 tells a story of a revolution that moves from inconspicuous to a completely unsuccessful conclusion. It is not Soderbergh's fault that these two parts of Che's life had completely different outcomes. He boldly chooses to tell both in a fairly simple way. The viewer may feel better at part 1 than part 2, but this is the reality of Che's life and is not, in my opinion, a fault of the director. The film is far from perfect. It's probably too long. At least in Part 1 we saw different aspects of the war, as the guerrillas were successful. In Part 2 they can't get a break and we see that their numbers are still being reduced by death. Che's catch and death are treated well. The film is strongly enhanced by the dialogue in Spanish. Benicio Del Toro is again excellent as the charismatic Argentine. So if you've seen Part 1, you'll see a very similar story of a very different story in Part 2.
