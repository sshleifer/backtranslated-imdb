I must start with apology because I thought the first 75-80% of this movie was hilarious. This is mostly due to Brad Pitt's performance. Spot on. <br /> <br /> The action of everyone involved was pretty good, but Brad stole the movie. The atmosphere was perfect in every way. I'm not a huge Pitt fan, but it has to be one of its best roles. <br /> <br /> Brutal, Honest, Gritty. All the good words to describe this movie. <br /> <br /> I read a previous review and the person said that the reasoning behind Early's violence is not explained. This is explained, but fortunately they do not need graphic details to convey their point. <br /> <br /> Overall, I gave it a 9 because every scene 1 or 2 was effective. I think the humor in the first half or so is perfect for this movie. Among Cats.
