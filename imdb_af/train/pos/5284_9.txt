Father and son communicate very little. In fact, they speak different languages. When the boy drives his father 3,000 miles for his pilgrimage to Mecca, the talks are finally taking place. they are difficult and need to grow on both parts. <br /> <br /> This movie takes us into the hearts of these two travelers, and it is indeed a great journey for the audience as well as the two principals. The images throughout are impressive, especially the final scenes in Mecca. This again underscores to me how much else the world can be, but also at the same time, how similar. The same goes for the father and son in this movie. <br /> <br /> See this movie. Tell your friends to see it. You'll be glad you did.
