Thre is not a single Scorsese movie I would like to list on my favorite movies. But that's the best thing I've done through my DVD player in about five years. Scorsese's patient clarification of favorite movie moments, and how Hollywood works is incredibly gracious, calm and intelligent. <br /> <br /> These are 3 DVD sides appreciated by material. It will be a British production, as everything about American corporate culture has crushed the quiet, methodical, no-frills, focus-on-content approach taken here. And a US production would have asked him to say he just liked movies that were popular favorites. I wish everyone had a page taken from his love of movies. You should love the movies you do for personal, idiosyncratic and specific reasons. Not just more "Me-too" votes for The Godfather, etc. People have no idea what ideas are being explored in their favorite movies. If they did, movies would be more interesting than they are. Scorsese KNOW what ideas are being investigated, making it a compelling, appropriate speaker on the subject. I appreciate his artistic, generous interviews over the past decade. <br /> <br /> On a negative note, Scorsese is best when he is excited to show you some dark films, rather than learning something well-established about film history. And I wish he picked those three hairs from the bridge of his nose. It is very distracting.
