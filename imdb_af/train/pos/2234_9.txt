Although the special effects and technical features of this movie may indeed be feasible for some, I have never eaten the pictures of this movie on my young and impressive mind when I saw it about 8 years old. The story of this girl's survival and of the tests she has endured has been with me for years, and I have thought more than once about how the girl made it out of situations far above everything I saw. <br /> <br /> The fact that it's a real story, and the fact that I was a kid when I first saw it, could be the reason for my high rating of this movie. Every time this movie is broadcast on television in the 70's and 80's, I'll be watching television, in every scene with an interest I can't explain, drink. For the first time, I'm supposed to watch it as an adult (and with a colored worldview), it may not be nice for some. I actually went out of my way to get a copy so I could show this movie to my son. <br /> <br /> Like many other movies, it's not for everyone. If you are impressed by remarkable human survival stories, it is partly for Peru / Macchu Picchu and / or the Amazon, then I believe you can enjoy this movie as much as I have enjoyed over the past 30 years.
