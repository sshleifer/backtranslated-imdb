As someone living near Buffalo, New York, this movie scored some points before I even saw it, as the story is based here. There are even a few parts with the right news TV anchor people from Buffalo. And for once it doesn't knock the area. Hallelujah! <br /> <br /> Theology-wise, puh-leeze !!! God is still made to look and think like people ... and of course, be a bit on the liberal side. To be the lightweight comedy, it is nothing that any awards should win, but it is still entertaining and is a pleasant way to kill 102 minutes. <br /> <br /> There are some laugh-out-loud slapstick comedy scenes, and hopefully audiences - from Christians to atheists. - Has something out of this, except a few laughs, as prayer is actually about. Kudos to the writers to at least correct theology and give a good message. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a good sad movie that shouldn't be offensive.
