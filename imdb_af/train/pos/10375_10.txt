A Land Boy Aussie Rules Player (Mat) goes to the city before a major AFL Test match, where he has to be taken by his cousin. And then it goes wrong. <br /> <br /> His non-hobby cousin is mingled into a drug deal involving local loan hair / drug dealer Tiny (who looks like any gunman, but definitely Australian). Needless to say, mats are entangled in the chaos, and it is not long before the minds of tomorrow's game are rushed to the back of his mind, as the night's devastating events unravel. <br /> <br /> Performed Western Australian professional Shakespearean actor Toby Malone performs well as a young naive country boy Mat and successfully plays a role under his age. Best support comes from John Batchelor as Tiny, and an entertaining role by David Ngoombujarra as one of the policemen following the events. Role is fast, often funny, and very good use of an hour.
