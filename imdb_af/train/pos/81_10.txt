I watched the McCoys reunion and was delighted to see Richard Crenna and Kathleen Nolan and Tony Martinez !!! To see it was wonderful, because I always watched the show grow up when the TV said there would be a reunion. was so excited !!!! The only thing I couldn't figure out is why Lydia Reed (Hassie McCoy) and Michael Winkelman (Little Luke) were not there. I know Walter Brennan's dead. So I got on my computer and tried to find out about them and found this site, so if there is someone who can tell me what ever happened to Lydia Reed (Hassie McCoy) and Michael Winkelman (little Luke, I'll be grateful I was looking for everything and not happiness, the only thing I could find out about Michael Winkelman was that he had to be born in 1946. This show had value and morale, every show had a lesson. did not have The whole role was incredible, the only thing better than finding out they would meet them, so it is impossible if someone can help, please.
