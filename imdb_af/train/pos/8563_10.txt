The film follows the events of the novel "Cel mai iubit dintre pamanteni" (translates as "The most beloved among man"), written by Marin Preda (a very controversial book and film), a novel that is something like became the Bible. or the story of Hamlet, very popular and difficult to get, due to his satirical content about the Communist regime. It represents the drama of the intellectual man, the humanist, in a "red" world. A movie full of passion, fear, sexuality, all the great ingredients for a great movie recipe. One of the biggest Romanian films, despite his psychological load (it is a European film).
