Larry Burrows has the clear feeling that he is missing something. Since then, he missed a major baseball shot at school that cost the championship. He is convinced that his life would have been better if he had made that shot. Then one night his car broke down again. Larry goes to the nearest bar to wait for the trailer. Larry happens at Bartman Mike, who is unknown to Larry, is going to change his life forever. <br /> <br /> The alternative life premium in cinema is almost a new thing, stretching back to the likes of It's a wonderful life and shows no signs of abating with the very recent Sandler vehicle that was Click. It is a genre that produced many mixed results. Back in 1990, this James Belushi-led production, which is rarely mentioned when the said subject comes about, seems to have been largely forgotten. This is a pity because it has a dry appearance and is not short in the department of humor. We know that we are led to his ultimate message, the end comes, but it is a fun and enjoyable way to deduce. The film also serves as a note of what a fine comedy actor James Belushi was. I mean, if his style of cunning and larking offense is not your thing? then the chance that you will avoid this movie anyway. But for those involved in Red Heat, K-9 and Care for Business, Mr Destiny is right on your street. Along the ride are Linda Hamilton, Michael Caine, Jon Lovitz, Hart Bochner, Jay O. Sanders, Rene Russo and Courteney Cox. <br /> <br /> Mr. Destiny, pure escapist fun with a kicker of a message in his heart. 10/07
