I saw it subtitles as it was in Russian, but really enjoyed it. The main character Sasha was cursed, with a deadly weapon as an extension of his body. Unfortunately, he lived his whole life because he was different and because of anger he caused deadly things. <br /> <br /> When Sasha finally found love in a young woman named Katya, everyone was trying to take her away from him who ends up in a deadly battle. There was a fair amount of gore, but not too much for the weak. <br /> <br /> Not for people who like the old Hollywood movie, but for those who enjoy independent movies. Kinda has the feeling of an Asian fantasy movie.
