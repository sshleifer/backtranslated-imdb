Directing this movie was great for a comedy. Many of the screens appear to be from a cartoon and much darker (visually - not storytelling) than I expected. Granted, it can't be the funniest movie ever made, especially if you're in very rough sexist jokes, because it has very few of them (compared to others like Something about Mary or American Pie). As you see it again, several jokes come out and get better. If you've ever read a comic book or a comic book movie (Batman, X-Men, etc.) and watched it, you'll probably enjoy the subtle humor that goes through the whole movie. If you didn't like them, enjoy the respectable cartoon this movie has for them. If you like this movie, the DVD has some cool extras. (8/10)
