This film is a beautiful, light-hearted look on both sides, where the "club child" rave center is reconciled with New York's artworks, music and performance works (with a cameo by the ubiquitous Miss Bunny). This is "Torch Song Trilogy" for the perky-after-teen girls. "The Girl" for our intact, affected millenniums. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is quick and funny, and Parker Posey's client deserves - if not an academy at least a kudos "golf" stadium. <br /> <br /> Of course, this movie rests on the very stylish platform heels of Miss. Posey, and she was thrown perfectly. Like many of her acting work, it may not be very deep, it is often self-referring and, well, posey ... but it works. She is a talented comedienne, an amazing entertainer, and entertaining this movie. She wears it on her shoulders like a faux leopard wrap, and never drops it on the floor. <br /> <br /> Mary is a superficial party of fashionista who is not above the designer clothes of a friend's closet or stealing with someone else's boyfriend. On a deeper level, it is a story of a girl and her friends who are careless in every sense of the word, including other people; and the caring process of life is needed for life. <br /> <br /> The writing is beautifully crafted, witty and the only show disappointing is the aunt, in a role that was far too one-dimensional and heavy handed; A more nuanced performance of her would have deepened the relationship between the two ... but ... hey ... it's comedy. A surprisingly deep role, which gives this film a vital and world vision, is the selling boyfriend. We must all be so happy ... is he the one for Maria? or the one who gets away? <br /> <br /> I consider it an 8 because it is not a good moment of film history, it is not a classic and it is not a good art (everyone gets deeper and richer to look again). Like 'Desperately Seeking Susan', it represents something very true about its period, but may become irrelevant over time. Yet it has everything that an entertaining movie needs, and it's worth checking out several times!
