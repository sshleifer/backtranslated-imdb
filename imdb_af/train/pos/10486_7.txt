"Saving Grace" is never overly funny, but it does make a lot of good laugh and I enjoyed it very much. Brenda Blethyn is a good actress and does a good job of portraying widower Grace, who is considering growing marijuana to pay her big debt. The supporting role-players also do a good job. French actor Tchecky Karyo has a funny little role. The point of departure alone is attractive. The idea of ​​a woman growing and smoking over the hills sounds funny enough. And the movie now and then plays with the premise. Of course, there are flat moments, like one where two elderly women forfeit Grace's marijuana leaves for tea leaves and begin to pull childish anesthesia at the shop where they work. It was a ceaseless bunch that didn't quite fall down. The scene of the movie is dull and sometimes dull, but I laughed enough to recommend this English entry. <br /> <br /> My Score: 7 (out of 10)
