Oh, those sneaky Italians. It is not the first time that they have based a movie on source material without the permission or knowledge of the novelist in this case. Of course, this is not something that is typically Italian, but much in the early days of theater, mostly because they often thought they could get away with it. James M. Cain's publishers retained this movie of American screens until 1976, but the film itself has grown a bit into a well-known classic. <br /> <br /> The movie is not as good to watch as the American American in 1946. version, but it's a good movie. Of course this is not at least because of the movie, it is a great story, it's a plot and offers the movie with some great characters and realism. It follows the novel very closely and is therefore mostly the same as other movie versions of its story, of course, as a difference it made in an Italian environment. <br /> <br /> Allow the Italians to make a movie about life and the right people in it. This early drama always has a very realistic feel about it and is therefore quite involved in watching. Unfortunately, the movie lost some of its power to the end, when the movie was left a little and dragged into parts. The movie could have ended 15 minutes earlier. <br /> <br /> However, I don't really have much else to say about this movie. It's simply made great, based on some large and strong source material. Completely an impressive direct debut for Luchino Visconti, which led many more great and memorable Italian dramatic movies. <br /> <br /> 8/10
