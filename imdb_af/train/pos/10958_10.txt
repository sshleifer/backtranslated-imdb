This show is so incredibly hilarious that I couldn't stop watching the marathon on Comedy Central tonight (despite having seen all the episodes before). I always considered Silverman a great talent and it is ultimately a vehicle for that talent that is being recorded by a wide audience. I look at this show and I laugh a very large percentage of the time ... I can't say about many TV shows ... can you? This show is ultimately something new and interesting and (more importantly) funny! This is a show I will never miss and this is one that I will buy on DVD as soon as it arrives. You owe it to yourself to watch this show ... I predict a long term for this series ... And just to be clear, the people who offend this show just aren't. Maybe they lack intelligence to understand it ... they must stop making foolishness by attacking something they don't understand. Anyone who uses the word "bigot" in reference to Silverman, or who claims to be just "shocking" ... is far from the point. She is exactly the opposite; just google her and you will soon see that she is a great advocate of civil rights, etc. If you do not know that she embraces ironically all these outrageous views, you will not. And if you don't get it, do the rest of us a favor and be quiet about it so that we can all enjoy it ...
