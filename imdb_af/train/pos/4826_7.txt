This film deals with the life of Queen Victoria during her youth and her first few years as the monarch of Great Britain. <br /> <br /> The Young Victoria has incredible production. Each scene is designed and decorated to impeccable detail. The exquisite costumes, cute places and beautiful gardens make everyone "The Young Victoria" very impressive. I was most surprised at the thoughtful cinematography. How each person is placed in relation to the background or foreground is well thought out, each scene is well constructed. The scene that hit me the most is when Victoria speaks to Melbourne. Melbourne is positioned in the middle of the Victoria's window frame, while Victoria placed Melbourne from the corner where Melbourne held his arm on his hips. <br /> <br /> Stories show, it is compressing to being followed and understood by a person without historical knowledge of Queen Victoria. Many events are ripped out or even explained. I expected a big scene from the coronation, and disappointingly it only took a few seconds. <br /> <br /> Overall, "The Young Victoria" is a great movie, and it would have been even better if it was longer so the events could be explained correctly.
