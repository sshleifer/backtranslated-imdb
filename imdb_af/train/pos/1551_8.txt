It seems strange that such a complete urge as Dukes or Hazzard and The Hills Have Eyes (the new version) can find DVD distributors, while older - and far superior works like this movie - are nowhere to be found. With all the ongoing debate on the morality (or lack thereof) of warfare, and interest in spying (watching the multiple Jack Ryan, Bourne, XXX and "Mission: Impossible" productions, it seems a clear choice for release on DVD) It seems to be a 1968 movie, as it is a 1968 movie, but it is still weighty, it is still a production that actually has something valuable to say and lots of sites to entertain the audience. There is nothing else, SOMEBODY will consider getting the soundtrack on some CD, be it a composition with other Morricone music or as a standalone, I don't know if the industry is bothering to read what we have to tell fans about their products, but if you read this and other comments, please take us seriously. We pay for your luxury homes with our hard-earned dollars spent on tickets, DVDs and CDs - give us what we want! said, if you read it and did not see this fi lm, lobby for this is release so you can see what those of us who saw it are talking about. You won't be disappointed.
