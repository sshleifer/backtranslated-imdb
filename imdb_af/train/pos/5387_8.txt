Even in the 21st century, childbirth is dangerous: women have miscarriage and childbirth early. Seventy-five years ago, it was not uncommon for women to die during childbirth. This is the theme of "Life Begins": a look at the "difficult case" of a maternity hospital. Loretta Young starred, a woman who was brought out of prison (which crime they committed is not the germ of the plot) to give birth; she is contrary to the fact that she must give her baby after birth. She is in a ward with several other women sharing their joy and pain. <br /> <br /> Although Loretta Young is the lead, outstanding performance is being used by Glenda Farrell. Farrell was one of Warner's "B" women in the 1930s, who played a role in movies, and sometimes starred in B-movies (Farrell played Torchy Blane in various sections of the "Torchy" B movie. ) Here, Farrell is playing an expected mother who does not want her children, as they will just get in the way. She does everything she can to get in the way of the nurses, including the smuggling of liquor in the ward (this is of course during the Prohibition Days) and drinks like a fish - they never heard of fetal alcohol syndrome back in the 30s . <br /> <br /> Interestingly, unlike most of the early 1930's, it's not the women who get stupid in the way of the heroic. This situation is reversed, with the expected fathers trembling jelly. (Look for veteran character actor Frank McHugh as one of the expected fathers.) "Life Begin", to be an early talkie, deals with the topic with an honest pop-up melodrama, but it is quite a beautiful little one movie. Turner Classic shows it, though rarely; I just saw it glorified in a few days, Loretta Young. But it is highly recommended to watch it.
