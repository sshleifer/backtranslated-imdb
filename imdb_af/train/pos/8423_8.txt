It's My Bush who is first a very entertaining performance by Parker and Stone, I thought. It's often very funny, and it's pretty subversive and crazy. South Park fans will surely get something here. <br /> <br /> Another surprise is the production value here. There must be a lot of money in it, and it shows. Very expensive details. It's not a small show. And Comedy Central is not a very rich channel, but of course they have placed a lot in this show. In a way I understand it was also the death of the show, too expensive. It could certainly have been cheaper and gone the will was there. <br /> <br /> The critics like it, and it had its little fan base, but it failed to get a big audience. As we know, the show stopped after 8 episodes, which I think is almost 1 season. <br /> <br /> As I really liked the show, it has its faults. The problem with the show is that it doesn't know what it really wants. It's like a sitcom and a sitcom parody at the same time. The actors do a good job, and some of them are well-thrown, but I think they don't always get the bizarre humor they are supposed to offer 100%. <br /> <br /> I personally think the show needs some characters that were more on earth for the show to work. In South Park you have Kyle and Stan, who are kind of a realistic touch in the more looney universe. I think it's kind of what South Park does. You need some healthy characters that you can handle in a realistic way, and that makes the foolish things so much more interesting because it forces you to take them seriously at some level. If everything is archaic and stereotyped, it is difficult to include emotionally in the show, which is really Thats My Bush's biggest problem. Kyle and Stan are characters in South Park that make sense of the madness in the show. We have nothing to do with this, and this performance suffers. <br /> <br /> Another anchor point is Parker and Stones who thrive with republicans. It's the only thing with them that I don't really get what they're trying to do. Not Bush depicting nothing but a stupid Homer Simpsons lovely kind of character IS a kind of subversive in a world where many people can't stand him and think he's the worst president since Nixon, and a parallel comedy -world of letterman and so it just satirizes its every move ... but it's hard to understand if Parker and Stone actually mean anything to it. It's like the joke on us, but somehow it doesn't touch the point. It seems uncomfortable, because it doesn't remind you of the real Bush. <br /> <br /> In addition, I actually thought the show was very enjoyable. Some of the jokes here are hilarious. The pro-life supporter who was a surviving, aborted fetus is probably one of my favorite jokes by them in any show. And the show is full of great stuff, and sometimes it's funny when you use your head for a while.
