After losing the Emmy for her performance as Mama Rose in the GYPSY television version, Bette won an Emmy next year for BETTE MIDLER: DIVA LAS VEGAS, a live concert filmed for Las Vegas HBO. Midler, who has been performing directly on stage since the 1970s, proves that she is still one of the most electrifying live artists in the business. From her opening number, her classic "Friends", where she comes from the wings above a beautiful prop cloud, Bette recommends the stage with style and charisma of a rap-style number called "I Look Good," she proves she is a way with a joke like few other artists in this business if she played her way through a variety of musical choices. The part of the show where she salitvel salithout goes a little too long, but she manages to use her old Sophie Tucker jokes here well (although she actually forgets one joke in the middle of it, but ad ad her until she remember it's hysterical). Bette also treated us to Rose's Turn of GYPSY and the title of her smash movie THE ROSE, as well as a shameless plug for her hit movie THE FIRST WIVES CLUB. She brings the house near the end with "THE ROSE's" Stay with Me, Baby "and her only # 1 hit record" Wind Under My Wings "by BEACHES. It's a brilliant evening of musical comedy entertainment and for Midler fans, it's a must.
