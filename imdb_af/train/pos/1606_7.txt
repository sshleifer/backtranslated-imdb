The "adult-targeted movie" is currently a rare thing, but Moonstruck does it well and is still a better than average movie, which is very well-aged. While it's comical moments are lower than the rest, the movie has a wonderful specificity (Italians in Brooklyn) who aren't used to swapping the characters or viewers. (That is, Mobsters never appear in complication. It never becomes grotesque like My Big Fat Greek Wedding.) The secondary story lines are told economically with short scenes that allow a break from the main board. These are the scenes that are currently lacking in contemporary movies, where their immediate value cannot be impressed on growers and bigots. I miss these scenes. It also includes older characters beautifully. The movie takes its own lights, quietly down to a conclusion. There is no poorly written scene that is included to relax some business people. Cage and Cher do very good work. <br /> <br /> Moonstruck calls old-school, ethnic, business day New York much like 'Marty' except Moonstruck, is much less sacred.
