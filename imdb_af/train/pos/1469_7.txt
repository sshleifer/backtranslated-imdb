I admit it creates great expectations before I look, because some friends have called it (and they are not pervs!) As a must see. And this is a must see! Don't expect anything to break out. <br /> <br /> The Freudian psychoanalysis is interesting in many parts of the film, but there is just too much perversion and it doesn't end in the end. <br /> <br /> Some of the good things are the analyzes of Kieslowski's Blue, most of David Lynch's, some of Hitchcock's, and perhaps some I've missed (I just remembered ... Dogville), and I don't usually miss things unless they're too obvious or loose in the air. <br /> <br /> Unlike being repetitive, which makes it too long, the documentary is enjoyable to mark the perversions that are unconscious by us, hence the commercial success of most tension makers has studied and used as basis for this theory. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the energetic tone of the narrative and the effort of Mr. Zizek to revive Freud's theory, which has long been numb, especially in North America. Again, it is over and I do not believe to be a waste of time, because I believe most people have a dark appreciation for death and blood.
