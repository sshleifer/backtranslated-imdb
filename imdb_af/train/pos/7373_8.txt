Before the regular remarks, my main curiosity about THIS IS NOT A LOVE LOVE, although the DVD of Wellspring Media in the United States lasts 88 minutes. Any input on this is appreciated! <br /> <br /> Two friends with very rough lives take the road for an adventure. Whatever they enter, it is only, with one who accidentally shoots a girl and escapes the two in the field on foot. Rather than just a big chase, the movie is complicated by the brave and rather childish spike acting improperly, and its tree stump holds like a teddy bear. Some viewers may not like the story based solely on the character Spike, but adding a little frustration to the story would make the movie too easy. You will see how the more stable character Heaton refers to Spike as "big man" as opposed to Spike's "out of control" attitude and behavior. Honestly, I was also exacerbated by Spike's ridiculous behavior, especially the spray, but in a desperate situation, it is clear that someone from his mentality will choose a temporary escape. But Heaton was there to keep things in control until things got right over his head. <br /> <br /> Kenny Glenaan as Heaton is a wonder, and after a while I stopped wondering why he would like to pick up Spike from prison and continue with a friendship, due to Glenaan's big show . After all, there are many reasons during their run that would be a good idea for Heaton to just splash Spike and try to save himself. I think Heaton felt like a protective older brother of Spike, and the loyalty between the two is hard to break - until things get too desperate. <br /> <br /> While some of the cinematography is indeed artificial, it offers more flavor to story rather than just shots of the men running through the desert. The beautiful landscapes, rain and large gray sky provide a bleak tone that increases the feeling of tragic conditions. The score is also unusual and the use of Public Image Ltd. The song "This Is Not A Love Song" and as the title of the movie is pretty clever. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is understandable if you don't mind IT IS NOT A LOVE LOVE, as it is focused on two contrasting personalities who escape from another man who is determined to hunt them ( played by a cool, silent David Bradley). It's not big-budget action entertainment. For the rest of us who like to find something minimal and dramatic, it's time to spend, and it offers some extremely tense moments that keep your breath a bit. <br /> <br /> I really enjoy the movies that came from Scotland recently, such as this one, Dog Soldiers, and The Devil's Tattoo. I'm also a bit grateful for the subtitles offered on this DVD, because the accents are sometimes quick and difficult for some viewers to understand. <br /> <br /> Frustrating, dark, and often tense, THIS IS NOT A LOVE LOVE is very tragic but exciting storytelling. <br /> <br />
