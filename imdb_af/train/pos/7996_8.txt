Involved, ugly, nasty retro action thriller, about a bodyguard who is determined to find (and destroy!), The murderers of the girl he was supposed to protect. This film is almost an anachronism in today's politically correct atmosphere. Director Scott has no desire to apologize for the inherent immorality behind the film's dramatic structure. Scott is also unaware or indifferent to 30 years of social progress. I really don't think we'll see a more violent movie soon, so you better see this one while you can. Despite his relentless grim, I think the movie is a powerful example of cinema at its most sinister, exploitative and effective. Scott has a difficult thing to sell, but I think I'm a buyer. The extraordinary technical aspects of this movie are just too effective for me to ignore. Scott's direct choices are simply astonishing, and he does a good performance from Denzel Washington. Sensitive souls should stay away from this one, but I have recommended it to the viewers looking for a big, action-filled movie.
