The Master Blackmailer, based on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's short story, "The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton," is the first feature length of Sherlock Holmes story with Jeremy Brett I saw. The story is interesting and dark. The movie has a somewhat sad, sad feeling, but it is quite entertaining (with some particularly funny scenes). <br /> <br /> * Spoilers * Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson seeks to expose the identity of an illusory extortionist who destroys some of the most prominent families in England by publishing private letters that will somehow destroy their lives. They finally find that he is Charles Augustus Milverton, an "art dealer", after the few tragic consequences for victims who cannot pay. Our heroes will help Lady Eva Blackwell next time, who has to pay an amount outside her, or her upcoming marriage will definitely be called. The scene into which Holmes and Watson Milverton's home breaks is intense. Although the film has a significant happy ending, the tone is sad and sorry. <br /> <br /> Outstanding performances by Jeremy Brett and Edward Hardwicke (as usual), and Robert Hardy as the infamous villain (most audiences probably recognize him today as Cornelius Fudge in Harry Potter), Serena Gordon as Lady Eva Blackwell , Norma West as Lady Swinstead and Sophie Thomson as Agatha (the plays that include her and Holmes are a riot). I give it a *** 1/2 out of *****. My only complaint is that there was not enough inspector Lestrade. (I wish they'd added in the scene at the end of the short story where he gave the description of the two burglars, one of which fits Watson.)
