The best of the seven Sam Fuller movies I've seen (including Park Row, Run of the Arrow, Banned !, Shock Corridor, The Naked Kiss, The Big Red One, and this movie), Pickup on South Street count as one of the best film noirs. It represents Fuller at his most controlled. I like him if he is out of control, but almost everything in Pickup is perfect. The film is absolutely beautiful. Richard Widmark stars as a bag stealing a microfilm intended to go to communist spies. Jean Peters plays the woman wearing the movie for her boyfriend played by Richard Kiley. Peters is forced to find Widmark and get it back. She finds him by a chair pigeon played by Thelma Ritter. Widmark and Peters are attracted to each other, which Peters's loyalty changes (this and the fact that she is learning to work for communists, the Cold War is really interesting). The love story is done a bit fast and not completely credible, but it's not so bad that it harms the movie (unlike Fuller's previous film, Park Row). Richard Widmark is wonderful. It should be one of its best roles, but I'm not so familiar with his career that I can say so. Thelma Ritter gives the most memorable performance. Her role gives the film an unexpected emotional resonance, and her final scene in this movie is as touching as any you will find in the theater. I will never forget it. 10/10.
