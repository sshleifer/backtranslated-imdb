Every country that has a working film industry has a healthy (and perhaps insane) artist who makes movies that you can only fully understand if you are part of this country. I think Hondstage is such a movie. <br /> <br /> You see the lowest level of Austria's society, dirty, disturbed, strange, hateful. But they still have enough money, so they can afford cars and big homes. And they definitely do a lot of strange things here that may seem "normal" to them because they do it throughout their lives. From a normal human point of view, you can easily follow the movie and be disgusted or fascinated and watch a fine piece of Austria's art films. <br /> <br /> But if you LIVE here and you know the people you see the characters in dog phase as the crop of society. A society that will be more insane day by day creates its own rules that no one else can understand, the social system inside. And you see the people. Sit in the park, standing in the opposite street corner, in the same line in the row. Maybe you meet them in a bar or disco you may visit. Maybe you even work with them in your work or they live next to your home. You start hating them without knowing exactly why. You will try to get away - but you can't. Maybe you will end up like them. But it looks "normal" to you because you're doing it all through your life ... <br /> <br /> Life is not that bright, although Austria is one of the richest countries in the world. It has beautiful people ... but some are ugly too. There are many hardworking people who try their best ... but others drive on the backs of others and destroy everything that the people of Austria have built up to date. <br /> <br /> A very pessimistic movie.
