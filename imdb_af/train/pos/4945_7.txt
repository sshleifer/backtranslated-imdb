It's a tricky movie to classify 10 items or less. Generally, I don't mind defining genres, but there's something about this movie that lets you put it in a specific category, to give you feelings about it, even with just one word. I totally recommend this movie to everyone, and if you really enjoy the cinema and if you enjoy life, you will want to do the same once you have watched it. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie and call it great and wonderful to admit it is not perfect, but it does nothing wrong. I don't want to sound like I'm contradicting myself, but I believe writer / director Brad Silberling knew exactly what he was doing when he finished writing this inspirational writing. I'm sure he wanted to achieve a product that has nothing to do with perfection: a product that would be as simple, attractive and uncompromising as its title. Well, he did. <br /> <br /> Silberling, director of long, complex, dramatic films like "City of Angels" and "Moonlight Mile", proven with "10 Items of Less", which only closes 70 minutes, the passion he has for his work and also the faith he has in it. To place an actor (Morgan Freeman) in front of a woman (Paz Vega) in a grocery store and take them exactly to the places that ordinary life will take them is what Silberling suggests here. <br /> <br /> I can't tell you anymore, because within the apparent simplicity, a mind-boggling background is not to be underestimated. Because everyone here is exposed: the camera focuses directly on the two main characters, sharing endless conversation in a car ride that is not endless because life is alive. And let me say how praise Silberling handles the situation by saying that he reaches in less time (not just in movie time, but in the single day the movie develops its events) and in a smaller place, the kind of connection between two characters that Sofia Coppola generated in "Lost In Translation". <br /> <br /> The movie, found in Tokyo, also experienced an actor and a woman, and they also had conversations about the moments in which they live. their lives. It's in the conversations where we know the quality of 10 items or less, and just as in Coppola's movie, the naturalness of each situation is never lost and the images with all music and no words don't seem to be forced or included. in the picture to buy time. <br /> <br /> In this aspect, Silberling's collaboration and his director of photography Phedon Papamichael. The man who shot the beautiful sceneries in Sideways and focused on every emotion in "Patch Adams" delighted us in visual passages of true scenery. <br /> <br /> But the ultimate beauty of "10 Items of Less" can be found in his cast (by Avy Kaufman), in his two main characters. They are the ones who conveyed this feeling that I mentioned at the beginning and I can't specify; we feel their connection and we can say they have fun and that they can even improvise things. Winner Morgan Freeman, also an executive producer of the movie, simply stands there confirming the status he has in the film industry today and one that is well earned: a quiet man with wisdom who can easily make you cry like he can make you laugh. And the beautiful Paz Vega (well, I said she was wonderful in "Spanglish")? Here she proves she is the right thing, and Hollywood is not small for her.
