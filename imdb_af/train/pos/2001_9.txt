I was happy to see "Oliver!" in 1968 on a big movie screen in Boston when I was a teenager. Later in the summer of 1969, I was delighted to see that this film was still playing at a prominent theater in Leicester Square, London, after winning the Oscar for the best photo of the previous year. <br /> <br /> Your success of "Oliver!" on both stage and the screen reminded me not all talent is starting on Broadway and ending in Hollywood. This legendary story by Charles Dickens, who is part of the literary legacy of all English-speaking people, was brought to London by London, admirably by Lionel Bart. His beautiful musical then became a hit in New York and around the world. The film adaptation was made in England during the summer of 1967 and then released in 1968. The sets and musical numbers are staggering. The song "Who will buy?" requires hundreds of actors and the British film director deserves his Oscar for putting it all together seamlessly. Some Canadian and American talent are also part of this amazing production, but mostly it is a tribute to the fine workmanship of British film studios, such as Shepperton. Good show! Other film studies at Elstree, Boreham Wood, Bray, Denham and Ealing have also given the world many films to treasure over the years.
