I was at the same writing writer conference and saw the movie. I thought author Sue Smith made a very clear summary of what the film was about. But the movie didn't really need explanation. I thought the themes were abundantly clear and inspiring. A movie about the ability to dare to face fear - especially fear has come from parental figures - and overcome it and thereby embrace life's potential, is a film that is appreciated and enjoyed . I enjoyed it much more than the 'Somersault'. I also think Mandy62 was a little ignorant of Hugo Weaving. As a glimpse of his vintage, I must look so good! I agree that many Australian films have recently been quite dark, but "Peaches" are delivering the goods. I'm glad I saw it.
