I watched this movie a while back and it's still at the top of my 'favorite movies' list. It is incredibly compiled and what really makes the movie is the detailed time bits (like the 'Cafe Bustelo' coffee crate that is being reused as a cup to wash her grandson's hair) that people don't see because you won't be this movie do not understand. IF YOU ARE HISPANIES. It is just one of those films that are very culturally specific and particular. Please do not bash this movie if you do not know in advance what basis it is built on. I see exactly what the author / director is going to do, and he hit the target perfectly! This movie is highly deserving of a better rating.
