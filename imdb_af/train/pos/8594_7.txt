The Sentinel I was hoping would be a good movie and boy. I was right. A great story, first of all from a novel and I thought it was an original story, but I think it wasn't and it was a very clever story. Michael Douglas in this movie is very good and Keither Sutherland is also, but it is very difficult to get him on his role as Jack Bauer in 24, but eventually he and he are very different in The Sentinel as he did in 24. so another person tries to pick up their TV role but fails. Eva Longeria. She wasn't so good at the movie and had a back seat in the whole thing. After watching the movie, I constantly dreamed about The Sentinel and couldn't sleep.Overall Sentinel is a good movie and I would recommend it.
