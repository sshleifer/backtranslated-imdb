I remember remembering this movie a long time ago, but then it had no special effects, the play was really good. And it still has the same message for today, although technology has changed, maybe they should make a remake of this movie. It would be interesting to see a remake. I also enjoyed the music of the movie, and at that time Larry Norman was a very good songwriter, although most Christian music now offers worship and praise. I was always curious to know what happened to Patty after the series ended? Did she go on to make more movies, did she finally get married and raise a family? I'd like an update.
