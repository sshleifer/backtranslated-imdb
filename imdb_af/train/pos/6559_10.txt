The gang of roses. "Every rose has its thorns." <br /> <br /> A blend of old western and hip hop blended perfectly. The clothes styles, the scenery and the plot are all suitable for what the director wanted. <br /> <br /> Plot - in five years they robbed twenty-seven banks and then disappeared without a trace. Now a small western town is under siege, and one of the first victims is Rachel's sister. The Rose Gang is ready to ride again. And this time it is personal. <br /> <br /> Rachel (Michael Calhoun), Chastity (Lil 'Kim), Maria (Lisaraye), Zang Li (Marie Matiko) and Kim (Stacey Dash) drive along for five years. When Rachel's sister is killed, she ends her friends again and drives a revenge trail. <br /> <br /> A good candy for the western version. (If you've seen Bad Girls, it's a little better in the ways of the female characters). <br /> <br /> I gave it 10/10 because the characters, plot and landscape made it to me. .
