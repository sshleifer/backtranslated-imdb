My girlfriend and I have a thing for Robots. So I'm trying to find movies that have robots. And this movie has robots. Big. They beat the sound and broke apart, with the fate of nations hanging in the balance. It's really cool. You have to forgive this movie its many shortcomings and just try to appreciate what the director and his crew of technicians could put on the screen while working with what was, of course, a tight budget. It is very difficult to keep this movie. Because of those big robots. They looked like Transformers and they fought like pro wrestlers! It laughed my girlfriend. And that's good enough for me. Special mention must be made of veteran character actor Paul Koslo: as the manic Russian Villain, or he ruthlessly bumps into his helpless opponents, after they have already surrendered or complained that their proximity to him in a bar resulted in his vodka taste "like blood" (a line he delivers with a nice camp sub-Bela Lugosi accent). He obviously has a ball and the movie is very beneficial when on the screen. It's a handsome little movie that deserves its cult reputation.
