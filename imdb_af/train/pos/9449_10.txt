I watched this movie in the early hours of the morning when I had to fall asleep. It was in itself evidence that Salvation was a spell-binding film. I think Boorman did a wonderful job of directing this movie. How expert the early scene was with the hills and the banjos dueling. It showed so well and early how inherently reserved and simply the people of the area were. Case in point - near the end of the "duel" smiled the banjo-playing boy (loved his banjo), but when Drew tried to shake the boy's hand to "duel", the child was reserved to respond. The river tour never bore you, sure. The rape scene was brutal, but it was necessary to just show what the group was in this backwoods area of ​​Georgia. I think Beatty's traumatic shock afterwards was well done. Some have said that he did not become afflicted by the ordeal. I disagree - if you really received attention, he did not respond during the entire action that was immediately followed. Reynolds placed the arrow through the attacker and they chased the toothless man. It was confusing when Ed later killed the other man on top of the cliff. It almost appeared that the arrow was shot while Ed curled and expected to die, but then you realized the arrow he had shot eventually came into effect. <br /> <br /> Anyway, a good movie, and I was staggering between an 8 and 9 at my vote, but after reading a message from a disgruntled voter what it was a "1 "gave, I gave it a" 10 ". The reason of this individual was based on personal prejudice rather than objective view, and his voice was, of course, a non-correlating attempt to lower the rating.
