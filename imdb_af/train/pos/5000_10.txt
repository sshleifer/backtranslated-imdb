Creature Comforts in America had to be released on another network, or at least had the chance to have their full episode run. Unfortunately, this was not the case. Since the American public (apparently) has attracted the attention of an imitation when it comes to humor that does not consist of debauchery diatribes, or has a concern about the skatological functions (both sound and odors), there will be little and far between. One of the main problems, however, was how brilliant it was, it was made for a rarefied audience who knew what to expect, but was viewed by a hearing and boardroom who didn't look at what they were watching. What is sad, but not unexpected. I would have liked to have seen three seasons of this show even though it was produced for direct DVD release. The material and the interactions between the beings was rich in sub-context and there were other conversations just waiting to be under the surface. But thanks to Political Correctness, such conversations only occur in my mind.
