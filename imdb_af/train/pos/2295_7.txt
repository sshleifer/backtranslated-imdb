There are some very clever humor in this film, which is both a parody of and a tribute to actors. However, after a while it looks just like an exercise in style (despite big gags like Balasko who continued the part of Dussolier and performed very well by everyone involved) and I wondered why Blier made this movie . Everything is revealed in the end when Blier, who appointed Claude Brasseur, gets a call from his father (Bernard Blier) - from heaven, and gets the chance to say how much he misses him. An effective emotional hairdresser and, of course, sad. But there is not really enough dramatic tension or emotional involvement to keep the rest of the movie interesting throughout the running time. However, some really nice scenes and sequences, and anyone who likes these 'mosntres sacr√©s' from the French cinema, should get a good treat from this movie.
