Thank God, it was not based on a true story, because what a story it is. Confirmed by despicable characters whose depravity knows no bounds. In front of the devil is an enchanting, jawbone excursion in perversion that would be laughable (and sometimes even - or perhaps because of - the sickening tragic undercurrent of human dysfunction throughout) as it is not performed with such a beautiful, overwhelming belief by its stars. The excellent screenplay by Kelly Masterson and beautiful direction by none other than Sidney Lumet also didn't hurt. <br /> <br /> The main dysfunction here is of a family nature, with the two big screwed brothers (brilliant depictions of Philip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke) deciding to rob their own parents' jewelry store, an attempt which is pathetically wrong. <br /> <br /> The story is told with time slots (recorded on the screen, such as: "Charlie: Two days before the robbery", so no one should be confused); Some people said they did not like this device, but I thought it worked perfectly and contributed to the split of the whole thing, as the two brothers involved barely have full cover - you could not make it right between them poker hand to save your life. Throw these cute extra delights: one of the brothers is a drug addict, married to Gina (Marisa Tomei, also excellent), who has a relationship with the other brother, competing in a few monumental brothers and sisters, along with the fact that said Drug addict brother hates his father (a devastating performance by Albert Finney), who apparently caused him severe pain in the past and you have a Shakespeare Greek tragedy on your hands. Continue carefully.
