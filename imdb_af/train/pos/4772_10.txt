This movie may be the most beautiful and uplifting one I've ever seen. I'm not a religious person, but sometimes a great art like this movie can give me an almost religious experience. One suddenly realizes that there is real meaning for life. <br /> <br /> I have to admit that when I first heard of this movie, I was skeptical. I thought the plot sounded confronted and I was afraid the story would be banal. But I was a David Lynch fan and decided to let it go. It took me about 30 minutes to get caught up in the movie, but then I was completely lost. There is so much wisdom and warmth in this movie! I felt the cinema really taught me something valuable about life. <br /> <br /> It is not a typical David Lynch movie, and in some ways it was very surprising that he had to make such a movie after he had dark sides of human nature for so many years. On the other hand, I am not surprised that he succeeds in conveying deep emotions and profound human insight, because I also thought he was doing very well in The Elephant Man. Lynch is one of the most talented directors and I think The Straight Story is still his best. 9.5 / 10
