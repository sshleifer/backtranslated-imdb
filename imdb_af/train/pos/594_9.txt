13 days after Glory tells the traditional story with sympathy to the Mexican position. The biggest problem in this movie was that while cowboy actor James Arness played the role of Jim Bowie convincingly, the rest of the actors in the movie were Brian Keith (Davy Crocket) and Lorne Greene (Sam Houston) too old . > <br /> Raul Julia played General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna with grace and dignity due to the professional soldier who won the battle. The scene where he raised his officials, because he didn't get a guard on the mountain and found a similar man, is one that the authors did not understand. Failure to keep a watch is an important reference in the army. Santa Anna was within his prerogatives to be angry. Raul Julia did a bad writing through the scene. <br /> <br /> Kathleen York was an impressive Susannah Dickinson, a woman to be earned for her courage. However, Kathleen York can be reminded that, as Dickinsons welcomed from Pennsylvania, they probably didn't sound much Southron.
