While the main story in Morocco is supposed to, this film was shot in a very tight budget in 18 days in foggy Romania. Although their cards are broken, the actors and the crew play with remarkable skill and dedication, so that I ultimately touch the result of both and gracefully. Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau offers a formidable performance as the bad man. The writing and the direction provide a few jewels. However, whether you like the movie or not, it will probably depend on you starting at Alexandra Staden in the title role. Other reviewers pointed out Staden's shortcomings as Modesty Blaise. They may have a point, but I found her interpretation very good and very appropriate. Modesty manages terrible chances by discipline, innate talent and courage. Cities seem to be the same here.
