This movie (with the alternative title "Martial Law 3" for some reason) introduced me to Jeff Wincott for the first time. And that was a good introduction. Although I had never heard of him, he was an excellent fighter. The action scenes in this movie are GREAT! There are also many of them. By the way. The recruitment battle at the Peacekeepers headquarters is especially good. There's just something about a single man who makes the shit out of a lot of people that is really fun. And for the rest of the cast: Brigitte Nielsen was a good choice for the villain. Roles like this fit her (but not others). Matthias Hues has always done good work. He is a good fighter and macho-like character, and was a good competitor for Wincott in this movie.
