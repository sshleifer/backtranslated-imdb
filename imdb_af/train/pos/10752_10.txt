It was the most visually stunning, moving, amazing and amazing story I've ever experienced. Frankly, even those adjectives can't describe it. I can't just pick one scene that stood out for me. If I had to list a few, it would be the reaction of the fireman on the conflicting sound of jumping victims; the reaction of people trapped in the elevator, who were unaware of what was going on, as they eventually came to the terrible scene; the shock and disbelief of the spectators; and finally the silence. <br /> <br /> On that day, and even now, I'm reminiscent of Star Wars (1977). Obi-Wan says, "I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of voices were suddenly scared and suddenly silenced." It is wonderful how it is so accurate in the description. There was really a disturbance in the Force. <br /> <br /> This documentary version shows this disturbance alive. The feelings are so incredibly visual. The anger, the frustration, the shock, the fear, the exhaustion, and the realization of his greatness. That's all there. Not something was missed. <br /> <br /> It's a powerful and most moving documentary and well-deserved from the Emmy. Not just because it makes 9/11 documents, but simply because it is all it has to be. <br /> <br /> If you plan to watch, make sure you grab a box of tissue. You will need them. I know I did it.
