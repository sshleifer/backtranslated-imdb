After many of the things got rid of on the edge, a bait mountain rescue climber returned Gabriel Walker (Stallone) for his girlfriend Jessie (Janine Turner), while the cloudy sky where the weather looked a little threatening, a spectacular unforeseen air hijacking goes wrong and $ 100m from a treasury departmental level is lost in the middle of nowhere, followed by an accident landing? <br /> <br /> Stranded from the snow peaks, and needing mountain guides to win the stolen cash, the high-trained hikers make an emergency call that calls for the rescue unit? <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Gab and Hall (Michael Rooker) have to face the accident scene that the emergency call was a fake and a bunch of unmerciful terrorists led by a psychotic (John Lithgow) just waiting for them to find a way out of the stormy mountain with the dumping cases of money? <br /> <br /> With breathtaking shots, hilly scenery, dark heights, dangerous climbs, freezing temperatures, "Cliffhanger" is definitely Stallone's best action adventure movie?
