Michelle Rodriguez plays Diana, a high school girl with a shame and 2 x 4 on her shoulder. She is ready to fight anyone, especially her father, who pays her brother's boxing bags. Princess decision box will be a great way to focus her anger. <br /> <br /> I love the relationship between Princess and Adrian. Santiago Douglas as Adrian is excellent. See how their emotions are formed against each other by the square circle.
