Okay, first of all I hate commenting on this thing, but I felt I had to get up for this movie. There were so many people saying it, and I felt that people who might want to see it have a second opinion. <br /> <br /> First, Bend It Like Beckham is not meant to be the most profound film of the century. If that's what you're looking for, go somewhere else. Just because it is an independent film does not mean it should be artificial. It is supposed to make you feel good and you have to have fun watching it and the two things are being properly achieved. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the acting though "Halle Berry in Monster's Ball" is still good. The movie doesn't have to do that, so honestly it doesn't. It's a family movie. If that's what you wanted, you wouldn't have to look honestly or even in this movie. <br /> <br /> Finally, it has a very cute story. I think it's well thought out and it's fun to watch. It is also true to life for most of the culture, so if you want to sit down and watch a movie you can enjoy and feel good when you are done. If you are looking for something with deep-minded plot lines and great dramatic scenes, it's not for you. <br /> <br /> -Lyndsay
