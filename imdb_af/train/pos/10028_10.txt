When I saw this movie, I was amazed at how good a movie it was. It's the only movie I think I'll ever give a 10-star score. I'm sure this movie will always be in my top 5. <br /> <br /> The play is wonderful. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslett are at their best. I don't think anyone can have a better job than Kate. <br /> <br /> If it's a rainy day and you can't decide what to rent, well, that's the one. You will love all acting, special effects and more. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen this movie, rent or buy it now !!! You won't regret it. <br /> <br />
