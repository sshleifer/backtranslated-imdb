This movie was one that played very well in 1932 and probably won't work as well today, as it is a bit old-fashioned. However, if you are the kind of person, like me, who worships older Hollywood movies, you cut the movie a bit and enjoy it for what it is - an interesting soap. <br /> <br /> The movie is set in a neighborhood for problem pregnancies. In this large room, about half a dozen beds are waiting for women to give birth - but doctors are worried about possible complications (yikes - such a room will really traumatize the mothers!). And like an episode of 'Love Boat' or 'Fantasy Island', every mom has her own special story. With so many rather extreme and crazy stories, you have to suspend unbelief. I really enjoyed the movie. <br /> <br /> Here are some of the stories: One involves a father. You do not see the mother, but he is a very, very nervous father and it is included for comic relief. However, he was wonderful here - very pleasant. <br /> <br /> Loretta Young and Eric Linden are a sad case. Loretta was sent out of prison to hospital - she apparently killed a terrible man. You do not know exactly what happened, but you assume he is trying to force himself! Yet she gave a 20-year sentence - and her husband was dedicated to her and was as much as possible on her side. <br /> <br /> Glenda Farrell is a terrible person. She has the maternal instincts of a hamster - a really, very bad and alcoholic hamster! She is pretty funny and worth seeing through most of the movie. I liked drinking her from a hot water bottle filled with gin and getting upset when she learned she couldn't sell money to sell her twins !! Late in the film she has a typical Hollywood heart change that was supposed to touch. I faced it. <br /> <br /> There is a woman who gave birth to a newborn baby. Amazingly, after the words, they put the woman back in the same hall as the women waiting to give birth !!! A crazy woman, who you supposed to lose a baby a bit, runs off the psychiatric unit. She insists she has a baby. Later she escapes again and actually one of the children! <br /> <br /> There are most stories than this, but the one I mentioned is most important. As I said, it is a soap opera of all kinds and is very entertaining - and rather sad in the case of several of the stories. The end is especially heartbreaking and extremely well done. There were some particularly good performances - especially Farrell and Aline MacMahon as nurse. All in all, a very good movie - and I have no idea why they had to remake the movie just a few years later (which was typical for Warner Brothers).
