A warm, touching movie with a fantasy-like quality. <br /> <br /> Ellen Burstyn is as always excellent. <br /> <br /> Samantha Mathis performed very well, but there is only one thing about this one that will haunt your memory. <br /> <br /> Most of all, you need to see this wonderful 5 year old. old, Jodelle Ferland. I was so captivated by her presence, I had to buy the movie so I could see her again. She is a miracle of God's creation. <br /> <br /> Judging by the high IMDB rating, I'm not the only one fascinated by this young actress.
