I've been trying to rent it many times, but was always with the girl, who generally rejects whistles and ensemble comedies with the commentary "Uhm ... looks good, but I'm not in the mood for that movie. "So comes the" Almighty Solo Movie Night "! <br /> <br /> Anyway, I got Welkom at Collinwood a pretty enjoyable movie. While it is reasonably comparable, it has laughed moments of pleasure and some aloud. I was unaware of the fact that it was a remake, and as a general rule watch movies to ignore it and look at their own merits anyway. George Clooney sits in a humorous and short-lived as a wheel safe that has mostly left me wondering two things ... 1. Will not every comedy be better than Mr. Clooney brings in a strange 5 minute como? and 2. How do they make fake tattoos that look old and faded and how easy were they? The role players, all good actors in their own right, have a good job and you get the impression that they have had a good time working together. It's pretty important in a movie like this. Needless to say, everything is not going to be as planned in this movie, both plush and humorous, but it made me look at the special features and consider watching the original. I consider it a success! Rent this one for a good time, maybe take some friends and a pizza. you will have a good time. <br /> <br /> *** 7/10 *** <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is spectacular on a synonym. It's great to use the far-fetched Paolo Conte, and it passed me from the score long after the credits rolled.
