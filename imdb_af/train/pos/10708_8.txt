John (Ben Chaplin) is a lonely bank clerk who lives in a small town far away from London. Although he is on the internet, he is contacting a Russian agency of brides. He chooses Sophia (Nicole Kidman? The man can be lonely and shy, but definitely has a good taste or not?) And when they meet, he realizes she doesn't speak English. The communication between each other is basically limited by sex (again, imagine, what a terrible situation for the man, just a kinky sex with Nicole Kidman!). On her birthday, two Russian friends from her visit them. Then many surprises will happen. I like this movie: first, it's almost impossible to be 'marked'. Is it a black comedy, an action, a thriller movie? I believe all the choices are correct. Nicole Kidman is beautiful as usual, and I'm very curious about her Russian: does she really talk in a correct accent or is it just a torch? Anyway, I found it a fun movie. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Isca Perfeita" ("The Perfect Bait")
