Clark Gable plays a con man who busts the life of hard-boiled lady Jean Harlow. He tries to suck her while shaking him with her hard-gal attitude. In spite of their cynicism and disadvantages, they fall in love. When Gable accidentally kills a man during a sting, he goes out to leave loyal Harlow to the women's prison where she discovers she is pregnant. The writing of Anita Loos and Howard Emmett Rogers is excellent, with very well-drawn and surprising characters (including a Jewish socialist female prisoner and a black woman inmate and her ministerial couple played almost a trace of stereotype). Gable and Harlow show their mettle as actors and add curiosity and wishes to their characters who send them outside the typical Gable and Harlow roles. And the direction is much better than you expect from Sam Wood. One beautiful shot inaugurated Harlow in jail, then led to a surprising snow courtyard as the camera traced to her. This is one of the best of both "criminals in love" and "women's prison" genres and has some of the best hard-boiled dialogue ever written.
