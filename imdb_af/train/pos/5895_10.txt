I read an article about Dan Jansen's Olympic and personal journey before I saw this movie. I was always inspired by a story of hope and the overall life-changing events, and that was no exception. <br /> <br /> The background of the characters provided gives you a sense of family proximity and how they are positive. influences each other's lives. I can't speak with the accuracy of specific details in this movie. It is normal to take a creative license when writing a script. But the spirit of Dan and his family is what matters here. <br /> <br /> It's worth a movie of a story to be told. I felt empathy for the characters and at the end cheered.
