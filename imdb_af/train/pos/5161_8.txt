Kirk and crew land on a lonely planet where the sun is about to explode. They intend to evacuate the residents, but find the place abandoned except for Mr Atoz who operates a high-tech library. Despite getting a straight answer from him about everyone's whereabouts, Atoz is indifferent to their questions and insists that they should make a quick choice while there is still time. They have no idea what he is talking about, but are wandering around looking at the mirrored discs on the viewers and they see images of the planet's past. Then, while a disc is in the viewer, Kirk walks through the doorway and is withdrawn in time back to what looks like the Earth like Louis XIV (the 1660s). When McCoy and Spock follow, another disc is in the viewer and they are sent to an ice age hell. All too late they realize that the library is a time travel machine and repository. <br /> <br /> While Kirk's visit is rather short and not so exciting, Spock and McCoy's are much more aware, as Spock falls head over. for Mariette Hartley - who was sent to this terrible place as a punishment. The screens with Spock are particularly interesting and very atypical of the normal-logical guy. <br /> <br /> Spock's departure from the norm, the wild-minded scripts and many different places make it an exceptional episode - one is worth seeing. <br /> <br /> FYI - Ian Wolfe, the excellent character actor, played Mr Atoz. I am a huge fan of older movies and have seen him as a supportive and playful player in many films in the 30's and 40's and he has almost exactly as he did in this 1969 episode. Interestingly, although he was old, he was still 23 years old - dying at the age of 95 !!
