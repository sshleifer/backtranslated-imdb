The endless boundaries of our inhumanity to our own kind never fail me. This truly amazing story of a terribly abused and largely unheard-of population is compelling, well-documented and outraged. As an American, I am constantly being humiliated by the behavior of my country and it's just another in our long catalog of international dissolution. We suck. This is probably the first John Pilger documentary I have ever seen, but it immediately showed me what he had done. My only complaint, and the reason why I gave this movie only eight out of 10, is that Pilger shows us this travesty and the horrible collaboration of American and British governments, that our viewers / citizens are complicit in our own inaction ... but make no suggestions on how to help. I do not know about Britain, but America has made it almost impossible for the citizens to participate in their government's actions. A gesture in the right direction can help these residents.
