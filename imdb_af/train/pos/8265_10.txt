The name of this movie alone showed me just what it was all about, so I posted this movie in the early hours of the AM. If you ever wanted to see which mineworkers had to go through the early days and actually see a dramatic scene as the mine crumbled on the men. This film clearly shows that Germany and France can work together and be friends after World War II and how the Germans came to France's unbelief to the French miners. The actors were all outstanding, with unusual scenes in the mine with a horse and a small young boy working in the mine. There is an old, old, retired miner who turns off the mine when the lift breaks down. If you're a real movie buff, it's a movie you don't want to miss.
