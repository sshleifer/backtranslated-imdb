In the late 1800s, San Francisco, poor, well-dressed Errol Flynn (like James J. Corbett) worked at a bank, and enjoyed local events (boxing) with co-worker and drinking friend Jack Carson (like Walter Lowrie). One day, Alexis Smith (as Victoria Ware) runs in the "Comstock Bank", where Mr. Flynn works. Flynn was so caught up with me. Smith's elegant beauty, and offers to carry her withdrawal letter. Smith is secretly taken with the attractive Flynn, but is enforced by his brashness. <br /> <br /> Flynn's good act (actually a catch-up) gives him a complimentary membership in the cute "Olympic Club" which conveniently includes a gym (with boxing equipment). Flynn's audacity and practical joke (he kills men on the parallel beams) irritates members of the club. When an English boxing champion visits the club, members try to get Flynn to fight the man. They are hopeful, Flynn will resign, be humiliated by his defeat - but Flynn wins! <br /> <br /> First time producer Robert Buckner puts a good package for Warner Brothers and director Raoul Walsh. Mr Buckner was definitely in the success of his contribution (script) to the studio's brilliant "Yankee Doodle Dandy". Unfortunately, this story is positively ridiculous. There was a "Lord Jim" - this story is thought to be the filming of James J. Corbett's autobiography "The Roar of the Crowd" - but this film has to be considerably fictionalized. <br /> <br /> Flynn is a very attractive front man; He maneuvered the writing lightly and had to be recognized as an excellent actor in the early 1940s. Many of Flynn's characteristics are (are?) Overlooked as great performances, and this is one of them. Smith does well as his female interest, and sends her emotions to the viewer. Director Walsh makes the insomnia smooth and excessive. The supporting film is a treasure trove, by Alan Hale (like Pat Corbett), to run Lon McCallister ("Paging Mr. Corbett"). <br /> <br /> ******** Mr. Jim (1942) Raoul Walsh ~ Errol Flynn, Alexis Smith, Alan Hale
