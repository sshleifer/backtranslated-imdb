I think the deal with this movie is that it has about 2 minutes of really very funny moments and it makes a very good trailer and many people have come in the expectation of the trailer and this time the movie is not the trailer. It is a bit slower and slow for such an exciting performance, and I think I can see from the comments that people have a love / hate relationship with this movie. <br /> <br /> But if you look at this movie for what it is and not what it might consider the cast of the cast, I think it's pretty good. Julia Stiles is clearly the star, she is so kind and careless that under the conformity of everyone else, she just believes and the whole audience falls in love with her with Lee. The rest of the cast, of course, Lee's testosterone-filled colleagues, his elegant mother-in-law, his rogue friend Jim and his bride-to-be are all doing an excellent job in matching Stiles' stereotypes and boredom. stand out in the first place. <br /> <br /> Lee doesn't live up to his costs, I don't think, but you can see it more than it's hard to live. Perhaps this is a source of disappointment. <br /> <br /> The movie itself, despite a bit of inertia and a few jokes that aren't as funny as the author's intentions, is quite funny and I have a much-loved intelligent movie. The themes of conformity and 'the safe route' seem to fit on several lows. For example, there was the whole motive of suggesting scenarios, but would never act on them until the last scene, or how he listened to a radio program on the highway and talked about how everyone was matching, or how everything was and Julia Stiles' characters have said and done is echoed by one person's safe choice themes and one is the risky choice. <br /> <br /> The other good thing about the movie was that it was kind of a screwball comedy in which Jason Lee had to lie down through the movie and dumb luck (for example: the pharmacist is a good chef) and a great deal of his side touches most of it. <br /> <br /> While it wasn't as funny as I expected and there was a little devastated talent, but overall it's still a good movie.
