About 200 members of the Cleveland, Ohio-US film association, Cinematheque, met on August 19, 2000 to see a pristine Cinemascope picture of Michelangelo Antonioni's 1970 movie, "Zabriskie Point". John Ewing, a filmmaker, who does an excellent job of getting the best prints for his series, shared with the audience beforehand that this print was specially flown from Italy. Only one showed it. <br /> <br /> The audience was entertained when the film unfolded its artist on the large panoramic screen. If you see this wonderful print, showing how Antonioni meant, you have made it aware that it is indeed a modern artwork. It was increasingly fitting that the series be housed in the Cleveland Institute of Art in University Circle. <br /> <br /> Antonioni's compositions were created for the Cinemascope landscape. His beautiful balancing of images, striking use of colors, versatile choreographic movements, everything is the work of a true artist, using the screen as his canvas. <br /> <br /> Eventually, the audience could understand "Zabriskie Point". As his story unfolded, it became clear that this work is not about the story itself, but rather an artist's impressionistic version of fleeting images of his subject. Setting up some of the more turbulent activities of the sixties offers only a dramatic car for the artist's fuller collage. <br /> <br /> Antonioni is not bound to conventional storytelling standards, and can break anytime to creatively embellish an event with grand decorations. The audience has willingly gone with the flow of its remarkable imagination, as its large images on the massive canvas are receiving a striking attention. While the audience may only be tangentially involved in character relationships, it realized the theme here is human aleination, the director's recurring theme. <br /> <br /> It is also realized that no pressure can make any smaller or lesser quality than this original in Cinemascope fit into this particular version. So the audience appreciated the view of "Zabriskie Point" in its original, breathtaking format, and broke into the thunderous applause at the end.
