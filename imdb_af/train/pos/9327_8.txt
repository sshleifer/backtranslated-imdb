I write this after seeing the perfect boy at the 2002 Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras Film Festival in Sydney, Australia. <br /> <br /> When their Father dies, two estranged brothers meet at the funeral and after discovering that one of the brothers dies of AIDS, they enter a heartwarming journey of reconciliation. The two leaders do a wonderful job of creating the gradual warmth and respect that builds between them as the film progresses. I do have one blemish about the movie - while the brother who dies is sick, he does not look. A person of 0 T4 cells will look pretty sick - not even a revamp to make the actor look sick. A small grip, but one that makes it slightly less realistic. Despite that one small grip, The Perfect Son is a wonderful movie and you have the chance to see it - do it. I hope for a DVD edition in the near future!
