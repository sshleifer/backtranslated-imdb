"Toi le Venin" is Robert Hossein's masterpiece, and one of the great sensations of the fifties. On a Frederic Dard novel, a writer frequently worked on the director (see also "le Monte-Charge" which Hossein did not direct directly to what he also played), the screenplay grabs you from the first photos on a desert road at night where a beautiful blonde can be the most burning of the criminals to the mysterious house where he finds his femme fatal .. and her sister. start with a cat and mouse play. One of the sisters is in a wheelchair. But is she really disabled? Which one is the criminal who tried to kill the hero that night? <br /> <br /> The two actresses, Marina Vlady and the late Odile Versois, were sisters. <br /> <br /> Turn off all lights before watching. Very exciting.
