An old saying goes: "If you think you have problems, visit a hospital." It has been updated in recent years: "If you think you're having trouble, watch a TV talk show ... especially Jerry Springer's!" This movie is one of those so bad, it's good! That's why I gave it a seven. It's good, but not good. It's a great way to waste 95 minutes, just as daily talk shows are advertised as an hour of your life, you'll never come back! "All the well-known themes are here ... treacherous men / boyfriends, the wildest audience on television, women flashing Jerry, etc. The shocker watched Molly Hagan, who usually plays sweet characters ("Seinfeld" and "Herman's Head") trailer mother and Jaime Pressly ("My Name Is Earl") as her equally trashy daughter, who favors sexual virtually every man with whom they got in touch, carried out. The men (including the staff producer) were presented as substantial lunkheads that earned what they got. I don't want to spoil or reveal everything, but play the movie like the daily show. Here in Phoenix it is beaten every morning for two hours, and then everything seems different. Again, I give this movie a seven ... it's good, but not good. Jerry Springer is best in small doses of one hour.
