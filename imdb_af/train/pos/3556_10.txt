Oh, it's such a glorious music. There is a little miscarriage - Frank Sinatra is very disgusted with the Jewish Nathan Detroit, though it only appears on "Sue Me", which is a clear Jewish song. Unfortunately, the filmmakers decided to cut out one of the best songs from the show, "Marry the Man Today", and replace it with an inferior Sinatra exhibition. With these two flaws in mind, the movie is differently beautiful. Jean Simmons shines like Sarah Brown. Marlon Brando cannot be worth the beans, but in any case pull it off. Stubby Kaye is wonderfully repeating his Broadway role (written for him). Damon Runyon's language and pacing and humor are well received. It's on my see-it-every-chance-I-get list.
