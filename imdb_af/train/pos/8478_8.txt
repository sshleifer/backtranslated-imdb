I saw this movie as a kid and it broke my heart! No other story had such an unfinished end. I grew up on very big anime movies and it was one of my favorites because it was so unusual - a story about unfairness and cruelty and loneliness and life and choices that cannot be undone and the need for others. Chirin is made alone if the Wolf kills his mother, but the Wolf is also alone when Chirin follows him in the mountain. The Wolf doesn't kill the lamb, even though every evening says: "Maybe I'll eat you tomorrow." The band I have is broken and broken down by age and use. I'll fix it and someday see the movie again and cry just as hard as I did as a child. Stories like this, with this depth and feeling, and this complexity of meaning, are very rare. This is a sad story, but I have never made a catharsis any more beautiful. I'm glad I saw this movie, and I'm glad I saw it as a kid.
