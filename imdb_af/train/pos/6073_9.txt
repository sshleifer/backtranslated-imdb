My college professor says Othello could be Shakespeare's best drama. I don't know if I agree with him. I bought this video version of the movie. First, I like Kenneth BRanagh as Iago, he was very complicated and worked very well in this adaptation. Unfortunately, he did not succeed, but played a role. Lawrence Fishburne shows that American actors Shakespeare can play as well as British actors can do. not that there was a British vs. US issue about it. In fact, if we all work together, Shakespeare can reach the masses he deserves richly. Apart from other Shakespeare tragedies, it is addressed on the issue of race. Something that has existed since the beginning of time. The relationship between Iago and Emilia could have been better and showed the complexity of their union. While Desdemona's Othello loves his whole heart, he is weak of jealousy and fears she loses her to a non-Moorish man like Cassio. This is quite a big play at the end of the movie, but I won't reveal the end. It's just worth watching. I think they edited many of the lines after 2 hours, but they always show Shakespeare.
