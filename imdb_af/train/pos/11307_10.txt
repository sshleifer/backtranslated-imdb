To get in touch with the beauty of this movie, watch the soundtrack, not just the music, but the way all sounds help to weave the images. How beautifully the opening scene leads to the removal of Gino, establishes the theme of moral ambiguity! Note the way music introduces the characters as we are guided within Giovanna's marriage. Don't expect to find much of Italy's political life here in 1943. That's not what it's about. On the other hand, if you are susceptible to the music of images and sounds, you will be led to a word that goes beyond neo-realism. Towards the end of the film there are moments of Antonioni-like landscapes that have more to do with the inner life of the characters than with real places. This is one of my favorite Visconti movies.
