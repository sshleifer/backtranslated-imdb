I love this movie. This is one of the things I can look at again. It is well maintained by a good role that is not too hard to be starred. <br /> <br /> The prospect of a new widower housewife turning to sell pot to make ends meet could have been in an Americanized turd of a movie or action thriller. The movie will also have completely killed. <br /> <br /> The movie plays like an Ealing Comedy with a tremendous feeling-good factor throughout. <br /> <br /> Just look at the scene with the two old ladies and a box of cornflakes ... (no it's not a spoiler!)
