In 1990, Brad Pitt and Juiliette Lewis have a TV to die for, both of which played almost the same kind of parts they do in California. I have no doubt that this has led them into this big screen movie. <br /> <br /> California finds aspiring writer David Duchovny and his girl friend, art photographer Michelle Forbes on a rocky relationship of species because of Duchovny's obsession with writing a book and in the thoughts and souls of serial killers. In fact, he has planned an unusual odyssey, he wants to land and visit the sites of several well-known serial killers. But he and Forbes are shattered. <br /> <br /> Fate comes in more ways than financially with the arrival of Brad Pitt and Juliette Lewis, some strange southern types who agree to divide the cost of gas into this country. trip. It seems that Pitt himself is a serial killer and decides to do some research himself, hiding in the minds of someone who is fascinated by amorality. <br /> <br /> California is not the kind of movie I usually use. going for, but Brad Pitt's acting ability and charisma really does make it work a lot. Pitt is the current definition of an innate Gothic refugee of liberation. But better than he is, Juliette Lewis is again playing these low self-esteem types that she looks good. Watch her scene with Forbes as she does her hair and Lewis describes her sad and pathetic life. Lewis's dialogue and Forbes responses should be shown in acting classes across the country. <br /> <br /> For those who like their bracts, they don't get any better than California.
