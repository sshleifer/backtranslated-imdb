[WARNING: PROMOTE SPOILERS] <br /> <br /> I have made this adult friend whose idea that her parents have sex makes her terribly uncomfortable. She thought when I reflected on the audience's response to "The Mother". <br /> <br /> People hunted when May (Anne Reid) wrote passionately in bed with her younger hungry lover, Darren (Daniel Craig) or later sexually explicit drawings in May. I doubt whether the audience was so bad about the nudity or the contents of the drawings, that it was uncomfortable to enjoy a woman in her 60s rapturously. <br /> <br /> Author Hanif Kureishi (My Beautiful Laundry, My Son the Fanatic) once again proves why he is one of the most cunning narrators on each side of the Atlantic, his story not easy to take This searing family drama is not a movie you can claim you enjoy watching, as it is raw, complex and often makes us uncomfortable, yet it is powerfully good. <br /> <br / > Kureishi and Roger Michell (who directed "Notting Hill" of all things) produce an unforeseen, frightening and beautifully active portrait of an older woman who realizes after all this year and she can still enjoy all the pleasure In a wonderful eternal moment, when her son, Bobby, asks her not to be hard, she may jump back, "Why not?" <br /> <br /> Why not, indeed. /> <br /> Anne Reid deserves an Oscar nomination for her in May, subtle, limited, powerful and sad, often all at the same time. down May Darren and Paula (Cathryn Bradshaw) observe in a seemingly passionate clutch in a bar. Or when she begs Paula to open the front door to a disastrous date. Reid's eyes and face reveal all May's anxiety and despair. In the movie's most devastating moment, May before Darren falls to her knees, willing to do something for him, and just ask him to be friendly. This is a tremendous performance by a remarkable actress. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed Michell's use of natural sound, especially when May and Toots arrived at Bobby's place. It perfectly illustrated the cacophony around May and Toots, the flickering way their own family welcomed them. <br /> <br /> This film has sometimes reminded me of the honesty and touch of Mike Leigh's work, except "The Mother" depends on a slight sense of optimism to keep. <br /> <br /> My One Doubt: Michell's decision to give May and Darren's first love center an almost cute sensitivity. The lovers stay out of focus while in the foreground a white curtain gently moves in the wind. And the only sound is from May in the heart of passion. <br /> <br /> The problem with Michell's approach is that Reid and Craig, who completely enclose Darren's role, are so fearless in these roles that it is unfair to remove their characters' almost primitive energy from the audience. pitch. Especially since Michell has no evil to make later sex scene visceral. <br /> <br /> This movie doesn't have incredible characters. We sympathize with May, but she also causes her daughter's suffering. But I doubt Kureishi intended to tell his story to similar people. His point, I believe, was to unmask a family that is already cracking when something emotionally disastrous happens. It is infallible in its glory and ultimately memorable.
