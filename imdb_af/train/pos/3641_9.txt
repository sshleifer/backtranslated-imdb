This movie has several things for it. It's a "feel good" story. The characters and actors are enjoyable, realistic and presently fine performances. Most importantly, I believe Dennis Quaid knows how to grab and throw a baseball. Robert Redford looks as though he is throwing a bat in "The Natural" and so has Kevin Costner in "For Love of the Game" and "Bull Durham." In the "Major League" Tom Berenger and Charlie Sheen seemed to know what they did, but many of the others didn't, and the picture was pure folly - and not very funny. <br /> <br /> So much earlier baseball movies, even where the stories may be interesting, have presented such a lack of baseball capability, they were ridiculous in this regard. In "The Stratton Story" and "Strategic Air Command" Jimmy Stewart allegedly looked as credible as a professional baseball player, as your overweight, non-athletic, older uncle in the family reunion game. Other viruses and physically robust stars (eg Gary Cooper like Lou Gehrig; Robald Reagan as Grover Cleveland Alexander; and Dan Dailey as Dizzy Dean) also showed some baseball capability that would put them in the late round while "picking up. "for a Sunday picnic game (even if it's a cow, and even if your uncle was involved). <br /> <br /> The plays of Quaid's high school team he coached, the one where he goes to the devil slips, and those who play with him in two minor leagues and in the US league are all true. The participants are credible and competent. In addition, he is an engaging actor who always delivers a talented and appropriate characterization (except, to some extent, some of his "top-notch" scenes and his forced accent in his depiction of Jerry Lee Lewis). But he's definitely un-targeted here, and this movie is a "9," as good, or better, as any other of this genre, except for "The Natural."
