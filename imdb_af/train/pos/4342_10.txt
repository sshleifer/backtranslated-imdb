This movie didn't really surprise me, so it just got better and better. I thought, "Paul Rieser wrote it, huh? Well, we'll see how he does it." Then I saw Peter Falk in it. I appreciate Colombo. Although I have never been a big fan of the show, I always liked to watch Peter Falk. <br /> <br /> The performances of Peter and Paul were so natural that I felt like a fly on the wall. They played so well apart that I felt almost enjoyable! ... And I didn't even drink! <br /> <br /> This movie was so well done that I wanted to get Paul straight on the phone and let him know how much I enjoyed it! but I couldn't find his number. Must be unlisted or something. <br /> <br /> It was one of those movies I didn't know about or what it was or was. It just went on and I thought, "Eh, why not? Let's see. If I don't like it - I don't have to look at it ..." ... and I just loved it!
