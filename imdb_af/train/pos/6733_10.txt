There was a wave of recent surfing movies that I randomly exceeded without any warning. I caught this treasure this week on digital cable and what a pleasant surprise it was! The focus is on navigating the pioneers of major golf from the 60's Greg Noll to our current Laird Hamilton, from Waimea Bay to Mavericks to Jaws. Hell, I can only watch a movie about Laird Hamilton - one of this generation's great athletes - so the rest is just jus. There are many good surfing mixed with interviewing outdated and current surf stars, in a pleasant, relaxed and unpretentious manner. Of all the surf movies I saw, it tells the great wave story the best, and I think that's my favorite. Enjoy it!
