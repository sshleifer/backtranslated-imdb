The trotta movie rosstrasse is the best movie I've seen for years. I'm not really interested in movies with historical background, but with that she won my interest for that time !! <br /> <br /> The only annoying thing about the movie is the screens in New York, and the impression I have of "trying to be as American as possible" ... which I think has completely failed. <br /> <br /> The scenes in the back really got my heart. German actress Katja Riemann has earned her award completely. she is one of the most impressive actress I've ever seen. In the future I will watch more of her movies. Congratulations to me for being a German. =) and just for a year in us, as soon as I get back, I'll buy some Riemann DVDs. <br /> <br /> So for everyone out there who hasn't seen this movie yet: watch it !!! I think it will be too long to describe what it is all about, but especially all the flashes and timers are hard to explain, but just what is it, you will be sweet !!!!!!!
