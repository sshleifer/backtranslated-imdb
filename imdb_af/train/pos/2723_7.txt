IN COLD BLOOD is masterfully directed and adapted by Richard Brooks. However, it is also so bent that it is realistic, it is sometimes more clinical than entertaining. Truman Capote told the brutal murder of a Midwest family. He focused on minutia and wrapped him and the reader in the subject and subjects! Brooks goes wild from that approach in favor of something closer to docudrama. Although he plays movies in real places, he keeps his distance. The murderers are depicted as decomposed imbecile, which they certainly were. They are not seen as wrong souls (as in the Capote book) and the cruelty of their deed is terribly blunt. Scott Wilson and Robert Blake are excellent as the killers like the supporting role, including John Forsythe and Paul Stewart as the reporter (the Capote character?). The landmark photography is through the large Conrad hall.
