I watched the un-broadcast episodes online and I was so sad that the show won't be back. It had the best role of adult, talented actors and a wonderful chemistry. It seems that all the actors are personal friends in real life. Towards the end, the performance became mesmerizing, sexy and highly vigilant. Of course, some of the story lines aren't realistic, so what ... The characters are all nice and you root for them. The show reminds me a cross between 2 other favorites: "Sex and the City" and "Felicity". Great kudos for all role players. Note to ABC execs: Nielsen rating reports do not show your true results. The show will mostly record it. I was very disappointed with big networks to flood us with reality TV or teen-oriented programs. Why getting a mature, thoughtful, well-directed material should we switch to HBO or FX? I can only thank the network for the rest of the episodes online. The new streaming media will gain more and more popularity among viewers.
