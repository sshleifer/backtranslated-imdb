When I first heard that Hal Hartley was a successor to Henry Fool, I was excited (it had been a personal favorite for years) and when I heard it did something about terrorism. Having seen it, I was surprised to find that it worked, while still being a completely different kind of movie than Henry Fool. The writing and direction were both dead and the acting was excellent. Special kudos go to Hartley to reassemble almost the entire casting, up to Henry's son, who was only four in the original. As I said, this film is very different from the first, but it works: I reconciled myself to the change in tone and subject to the fact that 10 years have passed and the characters would find themselves in many different situations since the first movie ended. In this case, an unexpected adventure follows ... and it's about everything I've given away ... not to mention the fact that I have to see it again to really understand what's going on and whose double crossing . Although definitely one of the better movies I've seen in a while, it suffers as many chases end with it, as it appears that Hartley is now planning a third and the movie is hanging you. I'll be sure to buy my tickets for part 3 ('Henry Grim') in 2017.
