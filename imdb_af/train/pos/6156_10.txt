This movie has always been my favorite Disney movie. Then on 11/21/01 I saw the 30th aniversity of this movie DVD. WOW I remember why I loved this movie. The DVD is so big, it has an extra 30 minutes that the original didn't have. I didn't know it when I first looked at it. The movie has since made so much more. The music they cut out had to be entered. You haven't seen this movie until you've seen the Full 131 min version. Many people say that music is forgotten. I remember every song in this movie of heart, every song has its own charm, and comes together as a hole. I remember when I was younger, I had the "Eglantine" song in my head for days at a time. As well as "Briny Sea" (the song was meant to marry dolls but was cut out of the movie). Please check out the new, uncut 30th anversion movie and vote again for this movie. the 10 what it really is.
