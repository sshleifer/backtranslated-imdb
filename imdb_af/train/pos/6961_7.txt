The title got my attention and then I wondered what would come out in the plot, since we saw so many "super-men" movies this year ... and in fact I really liked it, as there are a number of unusual funny scenes what I didn't expect. Uma Thurman played as an average in G-Girl's role. Surprisingly, I was able to watch her toes in wide screen again (as in the beginning of Kill Bill). Luke Wilson, however, played very well, the idiot every day the big woman meets, I could really get into his situation. If you want a light touch, you definitely have to look at G-Girl and Matt's adventures, especially to encourage your partner. 7/10 in my collection.
