An axial second installment manages to be as good as the first. <br /> <br /> Again, the casting is just wonderful. I love how the first and second episodes have nothing in common, except for the white and the clever. <br /> <br /> The second episode is just very funny, very stupid and very enjoyable. This is the very first Christmas episode, about a woman being tormented by a serial killer dressed as Santa after killing her own husband. Just like the first episode; karma. <br /> <br /> The most humorous scene is a tie between the murder of her husband and her phone call, and first fear her fear until it becomes real.
