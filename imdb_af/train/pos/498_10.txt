This was what I expected when the stars drew DS9 priority. Not too thin DS9. It was a great show in its own right, but it never got the fans more of what they wanted. Business is that show. Although a resemblance to the original trait, it differs enough to be original in its own way. This makes the ideas of exploration exciting again for us. And it was one of the primary ingredients that made the original so popular. Another component of success was the relationships that developed between the crew members. Viewers really care for the crew. Businesses also have a lot of promise in this area. The chemistry between Bakula and Blalock looks very promising. While sexual tension in a show is often a crank, I feel the stress on the business can lead to much more and much more than is typical. I think even when we handle such large-scale characters of different races or species, we get some very interesting ideas and television. Also, we have to take note of the performances, Blalock is very convincing because Vulcan T'pol and Bacula really have a clumsy and strong character that delivers a good performance. The rest of the film also produced good performances. My only grip is as follows. The theme. It's good it's different, but a little to be my desire. We need something a little bigger. Don't be orchestra. Maybe something with a little more electronic sound is adequate. And another complaint to me. They sell too many additions. They can do this by selling fewer ads or showing two parties. Otherwise, we'll finally see that the performances' final act is wrapped up too quickly, which was one of my Voyager complaints.
