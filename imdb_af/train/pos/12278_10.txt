Well, I said it all in the summary, I loved the movie and the movie. I'll give every actor an Oscar ... big, fantastic movie ... I'm 25 now and I watched it 4 times. different periods and I always think I will not cry and I always do, about 2 or 3 times ...;) Meryl s. was absolutely brilliant, jeremy iron too .. just brilliant ... i wish the movie received more awards ... i really know no one who watched it and didn't love it ... also, Glenn was great. .. the story was beautiful and sad at the same time ... I loved the fact that despite everything Clara and Esteban so loved and how Blanca was near her parents ...
