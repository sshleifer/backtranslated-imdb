This series was a cut above the rest of the TV detective series of the day, but somehow didn't find an audience. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​a blind detective may not be completely new, but so much to the story. And who can forget Pax, the beautiful guide dog in the series! <br /> <br /> While the stories themselves couldn't have been better than the average series, the New Orleans institutions have the acting and the music (I note the commentary on the music score in other comments ... I remember it clearly) everything works to make a good TV show even better! <br /> <br /> Well, you never know ... someday Paramount might just not dig into its archives and leave it on DVD!
