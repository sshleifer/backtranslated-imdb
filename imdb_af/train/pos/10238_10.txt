People expect no less than brilliant when Steven Spielberg does a movie, and this movie is no exception. Some movies I love have done badly at the checkout, but I'm happy to say, this movie is not one of them (more than nine million dollars, which I don't think badly). The characters were fun, the animation was clear and not vague, and the music was also modern, which is unusual for an animated movie. I didn't think that Professor Screw Eyes or his "Scary Eyes" were scary for little kids (the target audience for this movie), but I thought what happened to the creepy professor at the end was a little too dark for a child's' Movie. Overall, this movie is a fun and enchanting classic that I have loved for years.
