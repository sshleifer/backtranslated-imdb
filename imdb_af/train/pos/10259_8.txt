Many people are unfair sh! T on this series, but several of the Guinean videos are pretty entertaining. Devil's experiment in particular has a very fantastic effect - not only the notorious eyeball scene, but also a very realistic slap on the foot and a sledge hammer break is very realistic - especially for the video's vintage and low budget. <br /> <br /> Let me start at the beginning now for those who do not know: This film is an "extreme" torture / false snatch film that arrived in Japan in the mid-80s. It is a plot as it stands: A young girl is held by a few men and forced to undergo a series of brutal tortures to see where her breakpoint is. It involves brutal violence - all effectively realistic effects, including those mentioned in the last paragraph, as well as a painful outlook on the use of hot oil on the prisoner's arm and placement of the stomach in the subsequent shaky wound. <br /> <br /> The least effective rows are at the beginning of the video and consist of an unconvincing slap session where three men take turns beating hell out of the girl while her head falls and a second order where the three men take turns kicking the girl and pushing her to the ground. Of course, these two scenes are staged and detract from the realism of the rest of the proceedings. <br /> <br /> The actor who is the victim of the "experiment" is pretty convincing to have pain and takes a good amount of abuse and rough stuff on camera. Her reactions, as she tied her headphones to her head, and loud noises were played for hours, became cold. The other abuses she takes are unearthed in the only times of a resting place in a tree's net. There is also a disturbing scene where the giggling is chased by her and another disgusting thin scene where she is spun into an office chair and forced to drink a bottle of Jack Daniels until she snaps. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen this series. I hope I helped you decide if you want to shoot this episode. 8.5 / 10 for devil's experiment.
