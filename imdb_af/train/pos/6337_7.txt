I've had a morbid fascination with tornadoes for over 40 years, since my fifth grade teacher, a native Texan, tells stories of those he saw in his youth. Fortunately, I lived my whole life in the Middle Atlantic, where tornadoes are scarce and usually not as violent as those in the West, but I had two close encounters, one in PA and the other in NJ, in the Middle -Ooste. the past decade. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the family scenes, especially the conflict between Jack and Dan Hatch. When the tornado was close, Dan knew the most about what he had to do, and he probably learned it at school, as I know tornado safety is a major issue in parts of the US where these storms are more frequent. However, characters in the movie have done two things some people think should be done or are safe to do in tornadoes, but are not supposed to do or be unsafe. <br /> <br /> Once the siren sounded Dan and Arthur went through the house and opened the windows. For years, this is what people have said to do, but tornado security sites now advise not to do so. People are also hiding in a highway on the way. This method was made popular by an early 1990s video made by a T.V. team during a relatively poor twist in Kansas. However, in the most serious tornadoes, people can be sucked out of these underpasses. This happened during an outbreak in Oklahoma in May 1999. <br /> <br /> The tornadoes in this movie hit in the fall, which is not a common time for them to happen. (Once again, one of my close encounters took place at the end of September.) They also traveled from north-west to south-east, while most such storms in the northern hemisphere are moving from southwest to northeast. However, this is not so unusual. A well-known tornado that hit Joliet, IL in the early nineties, traveled in that direction (like the one involved in my other close encounter). <br /> <br /> I think the movie was supposed to be in spring. This movie is based on a book which, in turn, is based on a real event that took place on June 3, 1980. But it was still a compelling story.
