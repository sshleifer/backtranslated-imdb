I just saw this movie version of Frank Loesser's Guys and Dolls for the third time with my mom who's never seen it before. She was pleasantly surprised by the singing voices of Jean Simmons and Marlon Brando. And she thought the Havana rows where Simmons and Brando had stormed were excellent. It was also impressive to me and was usually the highlight of the film. Directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, this film, originally created as a story by Damon Runyon, only takes a while with the slow pace of non-musical scenes, but pulls you in for a while. The other story with Frank Sinatra and Vivian Blaine was not so compelling but still has their charms especially during the "Sue Me" number. Also love Stubby Kaye's "Sit Down, You're Rocking the Boat" number and the performances of Sheldon Leonard and B. S. Pully. With a theatrical view, Guys and Dolls is not a good movie music, but definitely a very good one.
