I thought it was a very funny movie. I love dog movies and comedy movies so combined that they were twice as good. K-9, k-911, and k-9 PI are my favorite movies. Jim Belushi is hysterical and Jerry Lee is hilarious and wealthy making them a great team. The only downside is that I really didn't understand how Dooley's wife died. She died before this movie, but how? If they said this, I must have missed it. Other than that, I give it two inches / tails! Those dogs (Jerry Lee and Zeus) needed a lot of training. They were so funny and all the sounds Jerry Lee made when Dooley talked to him were so funny. My favorite was when Jerry Lee sang and he would bite people's families to get information very funny
