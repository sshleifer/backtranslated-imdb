********* Ten out of ten stars ********* <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe it's a television movie. Just the phrase, "made of TV", shakes me. The production value for TV movies is almost always remarkably lower than production values ​​for professional film studios. It is said, this version of the "Christmas Carol" had to be released in the theaters because it is so good. This is my personal favorite of all the Christmas Carol movies because every aspect of this production is of the highest quality. Yes, there are some minor screen disturbances with two of the ghosts Scrooge visits, but there isn't a movie that doesn't have at least some flaws. <br /> <br /> Scott turns into a star performance like Scrooge, he's a pleasure to watch. In fact, I can't think of one show in this movie that should not be attributed. The costume, location shooting and winter background are captivating. The musical score is engaging and heartwarming. In addition, solid direction, flawless cinematography and faithful essay; We have here what one day will be considered a holiday classic. It's really not long enough to be a classic, but notice my words, one day it will be soon. This film has turned into an annual Christmas tradition in my home because it embodies the true meaning behind Christmas: Love, Selflessness and Giving. In a selfish, greedy world, my family and I can lose ourselves in "The Christmas Carol," with George C. Scott.
