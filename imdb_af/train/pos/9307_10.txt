Not a movie for everyone, but this movie is in my top 10. I am a fan of black comedy. With a role including Richard Dreyfus (Vic), Jeff Goldblum (Mick), Larry Bishop (Nick) and Gabriel Byrne (Ben 'Brass Balls' London) in the lead, the lines can't help but be dry. The supporting role is almost dead center. With the slight flaws in the movie: Ellen Barkin's makeup had her face washed off; there were a few gimme cameos by Joey Bishop and Richard Pryor who had served no purpose, and Michael J. Pollard's screenplay was too short. Over all, the movie was just incredible without ego to ruin a good writing. If you've seen Larry Bishop's (author, director) film, Underworld (a dark crime spot), you'll enjoy this one. His next outing (writer, director, actor) is Hell Ride with Michael Madsen and Quentin Tarantino.
