Having looked at several episodes of this series, I have come to the conclusion that television producers are completely without any form of originality. Here is an old science fiction standby, ingeniously wrapped in the form of a true original concept - and still they can work it. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is good! The male actors are fairly skilled in their careers. Most characters are well drawn, with special kudos on the hero and she's more than a nice kick. And most of the episode plots are over as tasty. So what can be wrong? How about the, the female characters and the cosmetically perfect actresses chosen to portray them. <br /> <br /> The producers insist on portraying the female characters in this - almost good series - in a way that looks like the end product of a misplaced cheerleader. Why do I ask why? <br /> <br /> The episodes fall flat when the female guest comes star or recurring character on the screen. These actresses are all totally incredible in their roles, and you don't have to see them knowing they are unable to act. A blind man can tell. Just listen to them talking. They make their dialogue with all the drama and effects of a 16-year-old at the high school prom. Who would believe these women are Phd scientists, senators, corporate managers and medical doctors? <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, if the producers have their choice of a Stockard Channing or a Morgan Fairchild, guess who they will choose - every time? And of course the series suffers from it. Sorry!
