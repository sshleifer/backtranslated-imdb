"Der Todesking" -Jorg Buttgereit's second full-length feature film (the first one was notorious "Nekromantik") has no central character or characters, but rather thematic continuity in the act of suicide. Divided into days of the week, it consists of a set of chunks, each containing the self-destruction of a complete stranger. Yes, the production values ​​are low and it is disturbing, but in many ways "Der Todesking" is very effective. It makes you think what is sometimes. more important than pure entertainment. Unlike the other Buttgereit's works, it is not a pity, but there are some unpleasant images such as the castration scene in the Tuesday episode, a debauchery and several suicides. The last (Sunday) episode is so depressed and full of pain! - It's great if you want my opinion.10 out of 10 - Look at this postmodernism shock! Disturbance of art in purest form!
