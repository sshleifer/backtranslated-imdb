I never think to write a review on IMDb unless I'm extremely surprised at how good, or how bad, a movie is. This movie falls into the first category. Every year I try to see all the nominees for Best Foreign Film at the Oscars, even those I know I don't like. "As it is in heaven, the bill seems. The plot sounds pure and sentimental and slow .... For my taste, running to original, dark and / or risky foreign theater (Michael Haneke, Francois Ozon, Very Modern Japanese / Korean Cinema) "Sounds Heaven" particularly interesting. It didn't release in the US, and I sat down to see a VCD I found in Singapore and prepared to get it off the list. After a dull start, "like it is in heaven" becomes that rare movie where you are really inspired by what is happening on the screen. Weaknesses: The characters in the movie are pure "stock" characters - the Wounded Dreamer, the Town Bully, the Astonished Woman, the Loose Woman Yearning for Love, the Suppressed Minister .... Fortunately, they are largely a nice forest, as well as well written and well done. Ingela Olsson, as the minister's wife, Inger, would have been nominated for an Oscar if her performance was in English. Strengths: The music is beautiful, and the lead song, sung by Gabriella, is truly dramatic and memorable. And keep an eye out for the demanding 87-year-old actress who plays Olga, who tracks the dance steps and younger ladies! I will not discuss the end, but I will say it makes sense. They are very emotional things happening in the last hour of the movie, and you are not quite sure why this is happening. Although nothing is spoken in words, it makes all sense, because the movies come to an appropriate crescendo. **** from *****. Probably the strongest Swedish movie I've ever seen.
