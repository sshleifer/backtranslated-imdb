There are enough sad stories about women and their oppression by religious, political and social means. In order not to reduce the films and stories about genital mutilation and reproductive rights, as well as inequality of wages, and marginalization in society, all in the name of Allah or God or any other ridiculous justification, but sometimes it is useful to just one take another approach and shed some light on the subject. <br /> <br /> The institution is the 2006 Iran-Bahrain game to qualify for the World Cup. Passions are high and several women try to disguise themselves as men to enter the game. <br /> <br /> The women captured (played by Sima Mobarak-Shahi, Shayesteh Irani, Ayda Sadeqi, Golnaz Farmani and Mahnaz Zabihi) and detained for prosecution are a funny and enlightening look at the customs of this country and most likely all Muslim countries. Their interaction with the Iranian soldiers who guarded and transported them, both city and villagers, and the father who was looking for his daughter, gave a few hilarious moments when we thought why they had such unwritten rules. <br /> <br /> It is mainly about a paternalistic society that feels it must save its wives from the cruel behavior of its men. Instead of educating the male population, they deny women's rights and rights. <br /> <br /> See the changes in responsible soldiers and the reflection of Iranian society. This is not the surprise, this movie will not play. Iran. But Jafar Panahi has a winner on his hands for those who can see it.
