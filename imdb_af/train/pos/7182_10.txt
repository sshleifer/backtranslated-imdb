I thought it did very well for a first episode of a first series. It was really fun and I thought the actors were brilliant. I think it's a crime for anyone to say it's bad because it looks like the right time. I find it really annoying when people say it was not historically correct, as it is supposed to be a Saturday night entertainment show, not a boring documentary history, so I think the costumes and settings were just right. A brilliant start and I will love what will come next !! I talked to many people at my school and they love the show! we all think it is brilliant entertainment and it has good stories to go with it.
