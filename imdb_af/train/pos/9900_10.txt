It's movies like this that make you wish you've never picked up the nerd at school. If you like this movie, then I suggest you watch Valentine. I just found out today that the man who played Marty (Simon) killed himself a little after the movie was released, which is a shame because he did a good job. I wonder if this is because of the role he played in the movie. It starts when Carol tries to get into the girls' toilet to act as they should. When he was in the showers, Carol's popular friends flung into the bathroom and prepared everything, camera, electric shock, pool. When Marty opened the curtain, he realized he had been knocked. He tries to cover the shower, but the children open it, grab Marty and start being with him while the camera rolls. They picked him up, punched his head in the toliet while it was being rinsed, and they (slightly) electricized him. When the children are in custody, given by the coach, 2 of the boys give Marty a joint that will pop him up. Skip one of the glass windows in the gym with a brick to get the teacher to excuse him. While Marty was thinking in the bathroom, he hit the Science Laboratory and mixes some things that look like cocaine, but not sure what it was. The lab is blowing up badly. Five years later, the children who tormented him that day received invitations for a 5-year-old school reunion at the old school that burned that day. One by one people are killed. I don't understand how the girl who drowned really drowned. she could have gotten back after Marty left. She almost came out the first time.
