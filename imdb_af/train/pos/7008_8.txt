WOW! What - a - movie !!!!!!!!!!! I am not a fan of contemporary Italian directors. Usually I don't like dramas. I'm not a Will Smith super fan, even think he's a very good actor ...... but this movie! It's such a big movie with such an original script and so good direction and so good acting ... wow ... it's stunning. This movie caught my attention minute by minute, and I didn't even have the pursuit of happiness (maybe also because I don't like the scene of Will's son, who is a very bad actor, while children usually all natural born actors look, I saw He also last night in "The day the earth stood still" and I confirmed my feeling that Jaden could not act). I don't want to write fairy tales and so I'm not talking about the story, but what I can say is that this movie is about love, death and other feelings I don't like to see in movies .... but this MOVIE is such a super good movie. If you have a minimum of heart, you won't regret seeing it
