Charming does not even begin to save "grace" it is absolutely irresistible! Anyone who dares in this movie will be annoyingly loud with their spirits. (Haha). <br /> <br /> Grace Trevethyn (Brenda Blethyn) has just lost her husband, but her problems are going to get worse. Her beloved room left her without money and outstanding debt. Confronted with losing everything, she must get a way to get a lot of cash ... fast! She gets an idea when her gardener, Matthew (Craig Ferguson) asks the city-renowned horticulturist to advise him on a plant he is secretly growing. Grace immediately realizes that her plant is dagga. Therefore, they decide to use her horticultural skills to win top quality. Then buy it to pay its outstanding debt. <br /> <br /> The most notable quality about "Saving Grace" is its similarity. Every character is very sympathetic and, except for the first 20 or so minutes, the film is without fear good cheer. Everyone wants a happy ending for everyone, even if it means a blind eye to some illegal activities. <br /> <br /> In addition, the acting is. Brenda Blethyn is one of Britain's best actresses, and here's why. She turns what could have been a caricature into an adult and breathing individual. She's a good lady, but she's not stupid. Craig Ferguson is as lovely as Matthew. He's a deadly loser, but he's so nice it doesn't matter. The rest of the ensemble cast also fits in this category, but special mention should go to Tcheky Karyo. The French actor always has an aura of threat over him, and it fits him well, but he also has good comedy skills. <br /> <br /> Nigel Cole finds the perfect show for "Save Grace." It's all about the charm. One of the problems I have with British humor is that all the energy has been drained from the movie. Not so here. The film is thoroughly likeable and always amusing. It's not to say that "Save Grace" is just a nice movie that will leave you with a smile and a good feeling. While this movie is not an out-of-out comedy, it boasts two or three scenes that are not hysterical. <br /> <br /> If there is any problem with the movie, the climax is a bit confusing. The questions are answered, however, and the end boasts an unexpected turn. <br /> <br /> See "Save Grace", especially if you have a bad day.
