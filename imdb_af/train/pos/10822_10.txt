I was lucky to see this movie in England many years ago. I've seen hundreds of movies, but I never forgot this one. Although Sinatra played an exceptionally sweet character, he was excellent in the role. Many people thought he didn't really come in. its own in its role in "From Here To Eternity", but in my opinion he was wonderful in Concho. The other role in my mind is that of William Conrad. I never saw or heard him before. Conrad plays a tremendous role in this film. I remember his deep and coarse voice and he used it beautifully to improve the few words he speaks with a threat that is the tone of his character. Also, I remember the music that both Conrad and and seemed to surround him when he appeared. An excellent movie and my only disappointment was that I never got the chance to see it again. It looks like it has disappeared from the ground. I see in the titles that it says the movie is black and white, but when I see it, it's in full color, I remember Sinatra's blue shirt.
