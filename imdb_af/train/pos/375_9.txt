It was one of the most moving movies I've ever seen. I was about 12 years old when I first watched it and when it was on TV, my eyes were glued to it. the play and plot are wonderful. It looks so real to reality and it gets so many controversial issues. I recommend this movie to anyone interested in a good drama.
