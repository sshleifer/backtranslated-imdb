Another example of what the British film can achieve: a simple story, tell and act well. Brenda Blethyn gives a layered and warming performance as the recent widow and finance grace, Grace, who is strongly supported by a solid support role. The ticket with a beautiful little town has been played in recent years, similar to many TV shows and films that have come from the British Isles in recent years (Ballykissangel, Hamish Macbeth and others come in mind). As in the foregoing, this film uses a wonderful, beautiful rural landscape, in this case the wet and wild Cornish coast. <br /> <br /> Some viewers may find the large-scale acceptance of cannabis use a little challenging, others may end up being a little too cute and safe. But it's a pleasant slit, to be sure.
