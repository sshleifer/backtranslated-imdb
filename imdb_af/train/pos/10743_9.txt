I read most of the comments here. I came to the conclusion that almost everyone agrees that 9/11 is a shocking piece of history. There are some who think the added narrative is poor and <br /> <br /> I agree that the narrative is weak and unnecessary. About two brothers find each other after the disaster and the stone hanger over Tony. But I don't think narrative is unnecessary. As I do many theorists I think our own lives are narratives. We live and make our own autobiography. So if we tell about our lives, it's always in the form of narration. We do not mention facts such as: Birth, Childhood, High School etc. We create a story about our lives. Being familiar with stories, we also want to put history in a story. . Because in the form of a story we can identify ourselves. We can better understand the things that happen in history when told in the form of a story. So that's the purpose of adding a story to the documentary. The story is bad, so be it, but we understand what happens. If that were me, I would worry about my brother. <br /> <br /> And second, make a flashy movie about it. True, it is recently getting a big 9/11 movie. Although there are a few on the subject, none of them like this documentary. But what about a movie in about 5 years? I agree it is wrong to make a lot of money out of 9/11. But I also agree that movies are one of the best ways to tell history. How many movies about World War 2 have we seen? If I didn't see these movies, my view of the WW would be completely different. I remember the Schindlers list, and I cried for an hour during the class. Movies give you a good picture of the things that happened in history, and while fiction is, it contributes to the memory of the disasters and the casualties. <br /> <br /> So my point: telling stories is not always bad, it lets us identify with the story and never lets us forget what happened.
