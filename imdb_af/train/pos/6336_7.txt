OK, so the FX is not a high budget. But this story is based on real events. Not throwing something together to make some rich actors, even richer! Like most books based on books, there is something that doesn't fit. Just a few people said that this movie is based on real-life events, not a beat as most people believe it is! This movie is by no means related to TWISTER! Unlike both movies, it's about tornadoes. <br /> <br /> For those who have problems with the science of tornadoes and storms in the movie, there are a few things to remember ... The real "Night of the Twisters" was June 3, 1980 So this movie is released 16 years after the actual events. Try to think how far storm research progressed at that time. It happened in a bigger town; Grand Island, Nebraska is the third largest city in the state. Although the film calls the town something else, it says it is a small town.
