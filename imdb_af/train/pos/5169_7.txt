I saw one night in the last five or ten minutes of this movie in 1998 or 1999 when I was a channel disorder before I went to bed and really liked what I saw. Since then, I was on the lookout, TV lists were shed, put on DVD / VHS shelves at stores, but until recently did not find a copy when I learned that some internet sales sold it. When I was a world-class acquirer, I never ordered it. Finally, I found a DVD copy in a Circuit City while visiting Portland, OR, a few weeks ago. Then it only took me about a month after I returned home before I sat down and watched. <br /> <br /> So what do I think about the movie? That's good. Not as good as I remembered and hoped, but still worth the $ 9.99 it cost me. After seeing the whole movie for the first time, I rate it as a 7/10, with the potential to become an 8/10. Then I will have to be less sleepy and have a better sound system to prevent it from rewinding to catch a dialogue.
