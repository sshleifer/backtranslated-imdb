Very good drama, although it seems there are some empty areas that the viewers leave to fill in the action for themselves. I can imagine that life is this way for someone who cannot read or write. This movie has simply struggled from the real world: the woman who is suddenly the only supporter, the inhabitants of life and their strife, the upset child who is beaten and then usually falls out of school, a Jackass man who nests egg and buy beer with it. 2 inches up.
