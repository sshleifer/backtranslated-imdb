I was fortunate to see some pieces of Aardman's original run of this show in the UK. It was always fun and always funny. None of the charms have been translated into the translation - it is as fresh as the people questioned - whether something is written or not, as it is rumored, is next to the point. It's always entertaining. <br /> <br /> Aardman Animations shows great imagination in the characters used for each voice, the single aspect that I probably most love about the show and its concept (the hostility between the pandas, the finger pigs who fear of needles, the therapy). Regulators also really grow on you, like the horse and donkey teens from Maryland, most every couple (the parrots, the insects, and the cats to name a few) and a sought after character, and I really came to dig the ferret! Monday is finally a day out.
