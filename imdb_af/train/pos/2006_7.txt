At this stage, it seems virtually unnecessary to declare that Jon Bon Jovi delivers a firm, strong, seamless performance like Derek Bliss. His ability as an actor was previously determined by his critical award, which was obtained in other films (The Leading Man, No Looking Back). But, if anyone is still wondering, yes, Jon Bon Jovi can act. He can act well and it will be expected of him. It's easy to separate Derek from the guy who hits hits on VH-1. <br /> <br /> In general, I won't watch a horror movie. I expected them to focus on sensational gore rather than dialogue and plot. What was most pleasing to me about this film was that there was really a viable plot moving together. The gore is not as much of the focus of the film and does not have a disturbingly realistic quality of films with higher technical effect budgets. So, gore fans may be disappointed, but story fans won't. <br /> <br /> Unlike an action movie like U-571 where dialogue takes a back seat for the bombast, we get the chance to know the good guys "and actually care about what happens to them A few scenes are left inexplicable (like Derek's hallucinations), but you get the feeling that some aspects were as they lay the foundation for a successor, unfortunately, with the lack of interest Hollywood shows in this movie, the successor never happens, these few cases are overdue to know that Vampires could be a continuous series. <br /> <br /> Is this the best movie I've ever seen in my life? a good way to spend about two hours, yes, it won't leave the person fearing horror movies with insomnia and it won't totally disappoint the horror movie lover as you loather somewhere between the horror genre and the horror genre. This movie is for you, it reaches a happy medium with the effects and story that balance each other. <br /> <br />
