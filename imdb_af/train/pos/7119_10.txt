My dad, dr. Gordon Warner (law Major, US Marine Corps) was in Guadalcanal and lost his leg to the Japanese, and also received the navy cross. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that my dad was the technical advisor of this movie and I hope he had an impact on the movie to make it look like it really was when I read in several comments made by viewers of This movie looked like real life. My father is a fanatic of facts and figures, and always wanted things to be seen, because they were so. I want to believe he has something to do with it. <br /> <br /> He currently lives in Okinawa, Japan, I have been married to my mother for more than 40 years (ironically, she is Japanese) and a few years ago, he has one of the highest commands of the emperor. Japan received for its contribution and activities to bring Kendo and Iaido back to Japan, as McArthur banned them during World War II. <br /> <br /> My dad was once a marine, but I know that once you're a marine, you're always a marine. And that is exactly what he is and I love him very much and respect him a lot. <br /> <br /> I would love to see this movie if someone has a copy of it. And I would like to give it to my dad for his 94th birthday this year!
