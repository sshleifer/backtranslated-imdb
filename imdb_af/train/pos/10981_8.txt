Right now, yours, TheatreX, found it cleared through the videos on the flea market, in almost new condition. When I read the back of the box, it was a bit of a cult hit, so of course it came home. me. <br /> <br /> What a strange movie. The aunt and cousin of former first wife Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis lives in this dilapidated 28-room house on Long Island (Suffolk Co) and shares the house with raccoon, cats, fleas (eye) and who knows what else. Suffolk Co. was about them to stay dirty and old Jackie himself came to fix things. Anyway, this is a strange couple, Big Edie and Little Edie. Edie (the daughter) always carries something over her head and dance, sings, and just gives a little to the camera that seldom makes much sense. Big Edie (the mother, age 79) likes to run around naked, and while we get hints of what it may look like, it's tasteful (?) Done to the point where we're graciously saved from it. These women talk and talk and talk, mostly about the past, and it doesn't make much sense, except for them. They live in absolute filth, cats do their business everywhere ("Look, the cat goes to the bathroom behind my portrait!"), And one bedroom seems to be the center of activity. When I close my eyes and listen to Big Edie's voice, it reminds me a lot of my own late aunt, who was from that area of ​​the country and had the Lawn Guyland accent. One scene, Little Edie has to make smooth repellent, lovely, you can see all the cats beating all the time so the place should be infected. The box refers to these two women as "eccentric", and I will have to say in this case it is just a euphemism for "wacked out of their gourds", but this movie is not without its moments where you really feel something to them . These are equal parts creepy, sad and disgusting, but I couldn't stop looking when I started. It's not my "normal" type of movie, but I've found it somewhat fascinating. However, this will not be guaranteed to everyone.
