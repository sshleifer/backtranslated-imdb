When my 14-year-old daughter and her friends come together for movie night, there is one movie they insist on watching over and over. You consulted it, K-911, the third installment in the highly successful K-9 franchise that everyone's favorite TV dad, Jim Belushi. <br /> <br /> People, I knew it was possible to carry out a VHS band, but a DVD?! It is so often played that it starts beating; without jokes! But of course you will have it if you have a movie so charming. It's so brilliant. <br /> <br /> Of course, we should thank the only Tom Hanks for introducing the beloved Cop-Dog genre. with Turner and Hooch; But even the film does not measure the sheer excellence that is offered in all three K-9 films. <br /> <br /> Some no victories say Belushi ran with this third movie in the series. Poppycock, I say. While you may suspect that a third installment - direct-to-video, might not be worth looking at at that point, you will prove yourself wrong after watching this quality movie. <br /> <br /> I won't give away the plot, but I'll say that Belushi and his pantry partner are still delivering their best performance - one that will make you laugh! It's a pity John Belushi doesn't live to see what great progress his brother made in the acting world. <br /> <br /> I recommend your teenage daughter to introduce this movie to her BFFs at her next slumber party. Don't forget the puppy chow!
