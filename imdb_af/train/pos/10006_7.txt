Gabriel (Robin Williams), a celebrated writer and a late-night talk show host, is enchanted in this critical, well-known psychological thriller by the sad story of a young listener and his mother-in-law (Toni Collette). questions arise about this boy (story), but Gabriel finds himself dressed in a burned mystery that conceals a deadly secret? "According to the official conception of the movie. <br /> <br /> You really need to read STOP this comment, and now look at the movie ... <br /> <br /> The" How did he lose his leg "End, with Mrs Collette planning her new life, must be cut down and sent to land with" scrapped scene ", which is too much. The true nature of her physical and spiritual ailments must be clear by the time Williams returns to New York - perhaps her blindness may be in demand - but a revelation can be made in the "highway" or "video tape" tones, which will benefit from a rework - how are you with a director's cut? <br /> <br /> Williams and Bobby Canavale (like Jess) don't seem to be credible initially as a couple, or a stage or two that established their relationship could have helped the stage. Otherwise, the role is exemplary, Williams offers an exceptionally strong characterization, not a "gay imitation." Sandra Oh (like Anna), Joe Morton (as As he), and Rory Culkin (Pete Logand) is all perfect. <br /> <br /> Best of all, Collette's Donna belongs to the creepy hall of fame. Mrs. Oh, it's right to say that Collette might be, "you know, like the guy of" Psycho. " There were several years when acting granting organizations reached women, due to a slight division. Certainly, they could have noticed Collette considering a grant. She's so good. And director Patrick Stettner definitely addresses Hitchcock. He even makes a sandwich from a retail outlet that is economical. <br /> <br /> Lastly, writers Stettner, Armistead Maupin and Terry Anderson deserve thanks to flight experts everywhere. <Br /> <br /> ******* The Night Listener (1/21/06) Patrick Stettner ~ Robin Williams, Toni Collette, Sandra O, Rory Culkin
