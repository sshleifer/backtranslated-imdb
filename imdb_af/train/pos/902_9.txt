I thought this movie was really great, because everything you see now is in India's theater, skin, music and bad acting. In this movie you see tradition, ethnicity and at least some degree of decency. some parts were a bit dramatic, guess what? that's what Indian theater is about! After watching this movie, at least you don't get a headache of all the hard-over-the-top music or any violence, it's just the truth, it's about love and of course caring for the person you love through life. think it was an amazing movie ... Children can undoubtedly see it and adults will enjoy the simplicity of India's certainty. Until all these rap hits, miniskirts and skin show became part of it.
