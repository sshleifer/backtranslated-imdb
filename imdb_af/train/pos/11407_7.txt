January 1, 2006 <br /> <br /> Parsifal is one of my two favorite Wagner operas or music dramas to be more accurate (Meistersinger is the other.) Although it's hard to be the "top of someone's appears ". The libretto, as usual by the composer, is a confusion of religion, paganism, eroticism, and even homosexualism, and its length can make it appear to the public like drying paint. <br /> <br /> Wagner, a famous anti-Semite, (Klingsor may be one of his surrogate Jewish villains.) Of course, the forerunner entrusted the premiere to an unconcerned (not for the will of RW! ) Hermann Levi, who was his favorite conductor! (Figure!) Kundry, a most mixed-gall and another probably Jewish surrogate, is both crook or benevolent, depending on the scene. <br /> <br /> Since many video versions of Parsifal on the stodgy look side, this movie of the opera is, in comparison, a fresh air. Hans-Jürgen Syberberg, the director, brought great imagination about it, but it's hard to know why he made his choices. For example, the infamous double-parsifals (of every generation!), The dolls, the death mask-of-Wagner set, and various dolls and symbols such as the Nazi swastika in one of the traveling scenes. (If I remember, the "real" Engelbert Humperdinck wrote the real music to hide the scene changes.) Although Wagner himself died too early to be a real Nazi, many of his descendants (as well as his second wife Cosima.) were at least fellow travelers, including their grandson, Wolfgang Wagner, who still operates the Bayreuth Festival at an advanced age. In fact, Wolfgang's son, Gottfried Wagner, tried to speak honestly with his great-grandfather, in contrast to his father. <br /> <br /> Syberberg also looks politically ambiguous about what I have read. In 1977 he made a famous movie about Hitler, "Hitler: ein Film aus Deutschland" (Sometimes we are called "Our Hitler" in English.). Since it is 8 hours long and not widely distributed, most people have not seen it (including myself). <br /> <br /> Armin Jordan, the conductor of the audio CD on which this film is based, plays Amfortas (sung by Wolfgang Schöne) Edith Clever (Yvonne Minton) plays Kundry, Michael Kutter and Karin Krick play the double Parsifals (Both sung by Reiner Goldberg!!) And Robert Lloyd and Aage Haugland play and sing Gurnemanz and Klingsor. <br /> <br /> Although the opera takes place over a long period and everyone (except Kundry?) is described as a significant aging between Acts 2 and 3, no one sees a day older at the end of the opera. (The magic of the Grail? In this opera, the Grail is the cup from which Jesus drank at the Last Supper and not Mary Magdalene, as in the past, an idea I find before!). <br /> <br /> Conducting and singing are all fairly serviceable and the DVD seems to have greatly improved the sound, if not the picture. (Yes, I agree that "Kna's" approach is superior, even on the second stereo version, but it's probably better than all recorded versions as a whole.) <br /> <br /> Not a Parsifal for All Wagnerites, but I think it works pretty well as a filmed opera.
