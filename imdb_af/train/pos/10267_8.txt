Much has been written about Mamet's "The House of Games"; Most of this good. I decided to look again at how it got up after 17 years and was amazed at how much I enjoyed it again. The film's success and durability probably has a lot to do with two main ingredients that are always on film; a good story and a good scam. Mamet manages to bring his signature flexibility and obvious histrionics to the film as we dispute the audience, the audience and the mark simultaneously. Then he declares the art of just doing it again, etc. All the time the story is built. "The House of Games", now a free beer on the cable, is a glimpse of the first timing and is a good show for Mamet fans. (B +)
