While being a better movie than 101 Dalmations (live action, not animated version), I think it's a bit short of what Disney can do. It was well filmed, the music was more suited to the action, and the effects were better done (compared to 101). The acting was perhaps better, but then the human characters in this sequel were given far more appropriate roles, and Glenn Close was really not missed, as in the first movie. She let it shine. Her poverty and overall shoulder sidekicks are great characters to play down and add to the spectacle Disney has given us. It's a good family movie, with little or no offensive material, yet it is fun and interesting for adults and children. It's bound to be a classic like so many Disney movies. Here's to hope that the third will be even better, because you know they're likely to make one. ;)
