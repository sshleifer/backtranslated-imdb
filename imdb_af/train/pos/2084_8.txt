My biggest problem with the movie is that it lasts too long. Otherwise, it's pretty good. Paul Muni plays a poor Chinese farmer who marries a regular marriage. Luise Rainer is a servant who marries Muni. They live with Muni's father on a farm and they do pretty well. When he finally gets money to buy more land, a drought and nothing grows. Everyone dies to go north through Muni staying first. When they leave and arrive at the village, they find that they are no jobs and they are worse than before. They even think about selling their youngest daughter as a slave to money, but decide. When a lot of people start plundering the village, the army appears and starts exporting people. Paul Muni does a good job and Luise Rainer won a second Oscar for this movie.
