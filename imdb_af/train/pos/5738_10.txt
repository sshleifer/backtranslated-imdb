I just bought and watched the DVD of this movie. The DVD transfer is from last year 2001. This 1988 movie is really a good movie. Overlooked by most people. I saw it in the theater in 1988 and have loved it since then. I love Pittsburgh's opening shot (not Baltimore, as another user said). Let Pittsburgh look like one of the most beautiful cities in the world! And I must say, Pitts' tour on the truck with Nicky is a very spectacular, interesting one! Tom Hulce, as everyone said, gives a remarkable, amazing achievement. The DVD is a good transfer, without extras, but a widescreen format. I recommend it to those who love the movie.
