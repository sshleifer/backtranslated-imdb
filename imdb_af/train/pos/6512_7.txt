My baby sitter was a fan, so I saw many of the older episodes while growing up. I'm not a fan of Scooby Doo, so I'm not sure why I left the TV when this show was featured. To my surprise, I found it pleasant. For me, Shaggy and Scooby were the only interesting characters * tomatoes plunged from the fans of the other * so I like them just focusing on the two. However, it can cause fans of the original shows to hate it. I like the voice acting, especially Dr. Phinius Phibes. I liked listening to him even before I knew he was Jeff Bennett. And Jim Meskimen as Robi sounds to me that he really enjoys his work as an actor. I also get a kick from the technicians with their slightly autistic personalities and their desires to play Dungeons and Dragons or to play plays from Star Wars (obviously not mentioned by the names in the show).
