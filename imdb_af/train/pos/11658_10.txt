Ireland's first animation film is also one of the best animation movies I've ever seen. It's a real wart and all story unlike any of the other Oscar nominees and any other movie this year or any other year. <br /> <br /> The plot of the movie has the Abbot of Kells, a village in Ireland building a wall around its village to prevent the Vikings from destroying the town if they ever attack. His cousin Brendon is a young monk who does the best he can, but meets his uncle's ears by doing things in his own time. When a legendary enlightener Aidan comes from a devastated monastery, Brendon drives him and his warm personality. Many of his uncle's chagrin offers Aiden to teach Brendon how to relieve. To help work Aidan on his big book, rescued from his destroyed monastery, Brendan goes out into the bush to get material to make ink. While outside the walls, he meets Ashley, a bush spirit with whom he develops a friendship. Unfortunately, the Abbot finds that he has gone outside the wall and there is hell to pay. But in the distance lies the Vikings ... <br /> <br /> Forget about what you think about this movie, you're wrong. Even what I explained is not doing this film justice. It's a simple story with so much more going on. It's a great movie about finding your way around the world, about the upcoming demons and finding the beauty of the world beyond the walls. (As the film says, the world is a dangerous place and doesn't stop even if you build walls). <br /> <br /> It's a movie that treats its audience as adults and deals with life, including darkness. There is death and destruction and joy and happiness. It is not sugar-coated. People die. Samples hide. (some of the kids have been eating out), but in the end there is hope. Frankly, the darkness in this movie is completely different from anything in a recent American movie. Forget the "grief" in a Pixar movie, it's the right thing, and its refreshing and it shows how homogenized even Pixar has become. <br /> <br /> It is a delight Tartakovsky-esquire (Samurai Jack) movie that is actually based on the Celtic art of the era. It's a movie that looks different to any other. Here is another movie that takes the film frame and uses it in every way possible. The pictures are designed to fill the available space as much as possible. Often the movie is manipulated to make it look like a page in Kells' legendary book. The beautifully beautiful and best described as art comes to life. <br /> <br /> Director Tomm Moore has made a masterpiece that is a masterpiece. I can't say more than that. This is a masterpiece. She's one of the best animation movies I ever overflow.
