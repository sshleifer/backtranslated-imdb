this movie should be seen. the truest picture of what's happening in the world I've seen since Darwin's Nightmare. Go see it! And if you're lucky to open it in your city, you should see it on the big screen instead of DVD. The writing is sharp and the direction is good enough for the ideas to come through, but almost perfect. Joan Cusack is great, and the rest of the cast is good too. It's inspiring that John Cusack made this movie, and I believe he should use his own money to do it. It is a wild, absurd ride, made naturally without the necessary resources, but still successful. Jon Stewart, Steven Colbert, SNL, even Bill Maher, did not show the courage to say what this film is saying.
