I love this anime! I laughed at all the jokes and the violence (mostly from Akane Ranma's hesitant but short-lived "fianc√©") is so slapstick, but Ranma deserves it, but he tries his best to make amends ... bunch. The main character Ranma goes to China to just train to fall into the cursed Jusenkkyo Spring and become a girl when it is splashed by cold water. From then on it is pure chaos one after another. Among the excursions are the hidden brother and sister duo of Kuno and Kodachi, the sexy shampoo, the pervert Happosai, who all cause problems for our hero / heroine. But it is Ranma's selfish father, Genma, who is the culprit most of the time. If someone wants an anime that's funny, it's the one. It's better and better with the Japanese dub.
