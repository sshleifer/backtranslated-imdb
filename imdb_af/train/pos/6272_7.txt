<br /> <br /> Once I saw No Man's Land (1987) - IMDB contact http://us.imdb.com/Title?0093638 - and found it well. The film is about a man who just steals Porsches. Gone in Sixty Seconds comes 13 years later and adds nothing to it. In fact, it has many scenes that are worthless. And the end is very, very bad. <br /> <br /> The Sphinx has a magnetic screen presence that should have been better used ...
