Occasionally, the movie no one has ever heard of is being released, and in a very short time, with very little money and resources, everyone is crazy and seems to be a surprisingly good one. It also happened in the '50s with quite a few small movies, many of which have never been heard. There are really some unknown big surprising little jewels from the 50's that are worth digging out. "Panic in the streets" is another movie that comes to mind. Both are movies that aren't really like the regular genre movie of their time and are also made with limited resources. <br /> <br /> I was really surprised at how much I finally like this movie. It really was a movie that got better and better. Like all 'old' movies, it tends to start so slowly, but as soon as you get into the story and it's characters you're in for a real surprise with this movie. <br /> <br /> The movie has a wonderful story. It involves spying, although the movie doesn't start like that. It starts out as this typical crime thriller with a touch of film noir about it. But "Pickup on South Street" is not really a movie by the numbers, so it starts its own directions soon. This ensures that the movie remains a surprising but especially refreshing one to watch. <br /> <br /> I also liked many of the characters in this movie. None of them are really good guys and they have all their mistakes and weaknesses. Actually human. It also has a good performance from Thelma Ritter, who even received a well-deserved Oscar nomination. It really should be one of the greatest female roles I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> Despite its somewhat obvious low budget, it's just one big, original, special little movie that is earned to see more! <br /> <br /> 10/10
