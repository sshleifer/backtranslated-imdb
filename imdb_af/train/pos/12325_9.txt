I only saw the movie when it was sent by the BBC by 1988 when I was working in the United Kingdom in 2000. My dad, Steve Parkhouse, recorded it on VHS and sent it to me. Up to this point I would have really seen the Shaw Bros kung fu movies, with their loud lighting (so the audience could see the movements clearly), so it was a revelation for me to see something that looked as if it was lightened by Ridley Scott comes from Hong Kong. It was also my first exposure to the movies of Tsui Hark (pronounced, apparently, "Choy Huk"). <br /> <br /> But for all the smoky, illuminated outside and ambitious special effects (Stop-motion? In a Hong Kong movie?) At the heart of the Chinese GHOST STORY lies a simple and moving love story, made increasingly by the outstanding acting talent of Leslie Cheung (which is a tragic, tragic waste of life!) and the beauty and elegance of Joey Wong. Dedicated Joey is beautiful, but it is her ballet hand gestures that give her character an unreachable erotica that is difficult to analyze. And although Joey is almost 20 years older (gawd, which of us isn't?), It would always be the lasting image of that actress. <br /> <br /> Some reviewers here said the movie is simplistic and lacks any surprises, but they miss the fact that this movie is based on a well-known Chinese story written by Pu Songling around 1700! It's a bit like complaining that Romeo and Juliet have a predictable ending and just copy WEST SIDE STORY. (Just wanted to get it off my chest!) <br /> <br /> For me, Chinese GHOST STORY is the distinctive romantic story. It has a high tragedy, because we know that Chio Sin and Sin Seen can never be together. It's about to grow up, because none of us can mature until we have experienced great loss. It's about sacrifice, because sacrifice is an essential component of true love. And Wu Ma's comedy style doesn't hurt a bit either. <br /> <br /> Enjoy Chinese GHOST STORY by not seeing it through a filter of Western culture, and you will just fix it. .
