A brilliant movie about family, guilt, sacrifice, betrayal and love. Macy is such a good actor. It was almost a pity to see him in the same screens with Campbell, who sees the part of a neurotic sex object, but does not have the links to work with him at the level the writer wanted. But he is such a good actor that he played at her level to make the screens work. I highly praise Tracey Ullman's verdict as the neglected woman. What did you know? Sutherland is also very good. The way he moves makes his character bigger (and even younger in some scenes). Almost everyone knew what they were doing. <br /> <br /> Macy's portrayal of the only situation in which his character cannot be careful is nothing less than complete mastery.
