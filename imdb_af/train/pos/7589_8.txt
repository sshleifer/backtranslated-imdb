Jay Chou plays an orphan who is staged in a kung fu school, but kicked out by the corrupt principal after fighting with a bunch of thugs in the service of an abominable villain. He happens at his trickster Eric Tsang, who immediately sees cash potential in younger skills. Basketball is the selected avenue for wealth, and Tsang offers him a place on a university team and promotes him in the media. General success leads to a basketball championship and a very nasty competitor driven by the same horrible villain from the front. <br /> <br /> It's all Shaolin Soccer, I don't think so strange or ridiculous - the plot is pretty close to sports movie conventions, delivering all the elements the crowd expects from the set-up. You've seen it before, but that's the kind of thing it never hurts to see again when it's done well. Luckily this is really well done here (some may say 'surprisingly' with Chu Yen-Ping in the director's seat ... I expect he has good assistants) - delivering the script and the presentation is slim and stylish. Jay Chou remains almost indelible, but so is his style, and when he leaves it, an emotion flickered over it could be a very good comic effect. Eric Tsang compensates with a larger character than he has played many times (for example in real life) that gets many of the movies the most emotional moments. <br /> <br /> Since the movie turns into basketball, it's good that the screens of basketball games are generating well. The movie shows some real skills, including Chou, and some well-done wiring and CGI adds that element of hyper-real kung fu skill that makes the screens even more entertaining (if you like that kind of thing) and justifies the movie's plot / existence. <br /> <br /> There is only one key scene in the movie, but it is a doozy in the one against many style. Jay Chou seems to be doing a lot of his own movements, and is very impressive - he is clearly pretty strong and quick for the rights, and Ching Siu-Tung's choreography makes him look like a real fighting player. I wish there was more, but at least it was a long struggle. <br /> <br /> So much the kind of Chinese New Year jump I hoped it would be from the trailer and recommended to watch!
