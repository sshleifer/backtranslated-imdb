How did I get it: When I started looking at this series on Cartoon Network, I must say that I have never seen anything like this and it was the best. But when I started collecting the series on VHS, and years later DVD sharing of Bandai's Anime Legends collections. It was wonderful, and it was worth watching. It had very explosive action that would blow you out of your seat. And of course, the theme songs "Just Communication" and Rhythm Emotions were the best. <br /> <br /> Characters, and Gundams: My favorite characters in the show were: Heero, Duo, Relena, Treize, Lady Und, Noin and Zechs. My favorite Gundams in the show I had the most is the Wing Zero and Epyon, and of course the Altron, and Deathscythe I, and II. <br /> <br /> Meaning of the show: What this series also tells us that in real life wars are very difficult and we can sometimes win or lose, but peace can also be difficult to obtain, and I believe the Gundam pilots are doing the right thing and are trying to bring about world peace. <br /> <br /> But this show is really the best of the best, so after this review, watch the movie endless waltz after watching this show.
