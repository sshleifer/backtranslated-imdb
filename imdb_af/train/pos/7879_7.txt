As with most of Eleanor Powell's films, this one plays alongside flashlights of the stands. For some reason - it is explained! - She was chosen to transport a magnetic mine to Cuba. Good guys and bad guys compete for the mine and who is getting confusing. But as always, Powell's dance is great and worth the admission fee. And in this one, Lahr plays his cowardly lion, explaining warm memories of the 1939 Technicolor film. A benefit advantage is heard by a young Frank, with that wonderful voice and slender vulnerability which he later abandoned to his wise men. In addition, the great drummer, Buddy Rich, has a wonderful time displaying his virtuosity. Take special care of his unique duet with Dorsey's trumpeter, Ziggy Elman. I say "unique", perhaps in ignorance, but I know of no other drum / trumpet sequence like this on film or records. This movie is fun. Even Skelton's goofy persona is relatively limited. Powell once again shows that she is the greatest movie dancer ever.
