My mom and I were on our way home from a trip to the North East (especially Massachusetts) when we decided to take a small detour to attend a Boston Film Festival. Now I don't know much about film, so I thought it might be a little educational. The first movie we saw was this one, THE ROMEO SECTION. Now I don't know about you, but I thought it was great! I'm from Texas and where I come from, we don't see too many moving pictures, so it was a pleasant surprise. My mother insisted it was too violent, but said I didn't know much about what she said, but it was a good picture. I was shocked by the battle order they were good at. Also, I'm a big fan when the good guys win, so I was excited when Romeo ladies killed all the bad people. It was a warning. I'm not sure when it's released on video, but if you get the chance, look it up. I think you will be pleasantly surprised. A word to the wise, it is, however, very violent and there are many coastal words so that you cannot watch your children. It's more for adults.
