When initially broadcast in 1984, my wife and I recorded it on our first VHS recorder. I still have that aging tape, which I try to look at every year. It was the year my first child was born and a Christmas Carol in this incarnation brings good memories of happy times. Many hours have been spent with this movie being played in the background. I finally broke down this year and ordered a DVD, which prompted me to write this short reaction to the movie. Charles Dickens's story is captured here in an outstanding way. George C. Scott is absolutely wonderful and completely credible as Scrooge. The supporting role is equally spectacular. It is a flawless production in my mind. Small details add a lot to the enjoyment. The game "Comparisons" Scrooge's cousin and wife play with their party guests is a neat item. (I've since created it with my high school English students as a short break from classwork!) Honestly I can think of a few ways to entertain myself over the holidays I enjoy more than enjoying in this CBS production . It was originally sponsored by IBM. (Incidentally, it's nice to see the old band with the original IBM ads ... which shows how many computers developed in 21 years. Amazing how things changed!) Bottom line: A Christmas Carol is a timeless story . version is a timeless classic. Enjoy ... and God bless us, every one!
