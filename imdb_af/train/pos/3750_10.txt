It's a big short. I think every voice is done by Jason Steele. (You just can hardly tell if you've heard his normal voice, so don't worry they sound the same. They don't.) It's about 15 minutes long. <br /> <br /> Edward the Spatula fights the war on spoons and he meets some strange people. In fact, everyone he knows looks pretty crazy. <br /> <br /> "edward!" "general peterson, we need to get you to a medical unit!" "No, I won't justify it." "Don't talk like that, I'm sure you'll be fine." "I'm a goner edward, and you know it. Before I go--" "Yes?" "Can I just have one kiss?" "umm, no." "Just come one, little, cock on the lips?" "I'm leaving now, sir." <br /> <br /> Soon there will be a movie. The date is in September, but it will probably be pushed back.
