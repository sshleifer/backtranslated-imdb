I was forced to write a review for Space Cobra, as it scored a good 7.3-star rating, but only a few reviews at the time of writing were especially positive. A strange situation and hopefully my positive review will show people to this old and mostly forgotten Anime movie. Space Cobra is the funky story of a smuggler and villain who gets involved with the three sisters of an old and dead planet and an evil force that the planets want to use. It's an old movie and the animation shows, but what it lacks in modern sophistication makes it an abundance of charm. Space Cobra is aimed at a western audience and very easy to watch. There is little or no reference to specific Japanese culture and ideal for Anime beginners to watch and enjoy. Space Cobra itself is spectacular and fun. I can't say how many of them are because of the English dub or the intent of the author, but it's one of the few Japanese comedy characters I really find funny. The style is very sixty Barbarellish with a fantastic soundtrack by Yello. The style is colorful and imaginative and there is constant action to move the story together. The strangest aspect of this movie is how it starts out as a comedy and ends on a very cunning dramatic note. I can't think of another Anime or general movie that could do so seamlessly and convincingly. You hardly realize this is happening, but it's done so subtly and looks quite natural. You also feel the characters have traveled and their lives have changed throughout the experience. See if you can.
