This movie is great! It touched my cold heart. I couldn't talk about the racial discrimination experienced by Antwone, because I live in my own country. I think it's really hard to be discriminated against. <br /> <br /> We watched this movie in our sociology class at New Era University, and I didn't know it was a real story, I thought it was created only by an intellectual who want to bring fresh air into the industry. It's very good. <br /> <br /> The part that shocked me was when Nadine sexually abused Antwone (what was six). If I were on his shoes, I could have jumped a ten-storey high building. I greet him because he is so strong! <br /> <br /> The scene that touched me here is when Antwone finally sees his mother Eva face to face. He didn't cut her, but instead he told her about the achievements he'd made over the years. (I think I'll do it if I get the chance to find my roots.)
