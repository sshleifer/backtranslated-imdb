Artemisia Gentileschi, the daughter of Orazio Gentileschi, showed an early promise as a painter. Artemisia was born in an era in which talented women have denied the right to see their work side by side, created by men. Her tragic life is corrected and compiled by Agnes Merlik in this biographical film. <br /> <br /> After reading the novel "The Passion of Artemisia" by Susan Vreeland, we explored the life of this woman, her work and her legacy. We also read Mary Garrard's "Artemisia Gentileschi", which must be a book for all art lovers. <br /> <br /> "Artemisia" presents the fictitious facts we have read about the early life of the young woman when she begins to paint. She was clearly influenced by the work of her father, by Caravaggio, Agostino Tassi, and other Florentine painters of that period. Her relationship and love affair with Tassi is the basis of the film. Artemisia unfortunately could not go as far as she could because of the prejudice against women in the arts. It didn't help either, or she caused a scandal where she was accused of being raped by Tassi. She had to go to Rome to satisfy herself from the unfortunate time of her life. <br /> <br /> Valentina Cervi makes a beautiful Artemisia. She is a wonderful being who has raised passion for men. Michel Serrault plays Orazio, her father. Miki Maojlovic is seen as Tassi, the man who wanted Artemisia, but ended up in jail. Emmanuelle Devos appears for a moment. <br /> <br /> The film has a glossy finish that captures the camera work of Benoit Delhomme in all its beauty. The picturesque spots of the film offer an idea of ​​what inspired the painting to show in their canvases. The music of Krishna Levy serves well what we see. Agnes Mostly pointed right by hand, showing a visual style of her own.
