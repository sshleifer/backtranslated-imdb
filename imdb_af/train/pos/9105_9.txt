Women have never looked as attractive and pathetic as in Salazar's film Piedras. Although the editor's track here and there can help the movie, it is exciting and enjoyable with an intense point from Pedro Almodovar's latest films. 5 different women handle their male partners and families. Start with a few different stories that need to be bound as the plot is underway. Salazar portrays his female characters in the same neurotic and borderline behavior known to Almodovar. A Kleptomaniac high-society lady with a greasy smaller shoe, a burlesque home, Mrs. Caring for her disabled daughter, a drug addict dancer obsessed with her former boyfriend and a taxi driver who takes care of the old men's disturbed children in Madrid in well-designed scenes. With the help of a few Almodovar's famous actresses, the director succeeds in giving depth to all the characters who share the movie and to create true sympathy for each one. The women control the plot line, and the men eventually have to be left together, eventually ... Surprisingly good for a first movie, and the time is worthy of any standard. It is noteworthy that Salazar hesitates in some essential guidelines for the actresses, but an impressive act is shown on the screen anyway, especially by Monica Cervera, who played in his former short film. <br /> <br /> A must for all Almodovar fans, and enjoyable for everyone.
