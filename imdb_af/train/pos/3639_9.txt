This movie, for me, is about family. Jimmy Morris not only lived his dream for himself, but for his family. I can't start telling you how I can tell my little girl that Dad goes to Kansas City to cover Priest Holmes and the Kansas City Chiefs. She'd think it's the coolest thing that Morris's son did. Living dreams with the family is what this one is about. I just think a father who has a close relationship with his family can truly appreciate what Jimmy Morris did.
