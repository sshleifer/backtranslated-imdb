I really look forward to seeing this movie as it is being advertised as a must-see movie for people who love movies about nature. The movie shows different climates and the animals that accompany it, starting at the North Pole and going to the south, as the movie progresses. The footage of this movie is often breathtakingly beautiful and I wondered how on earth they could take some of the shots under the water or in the air. But beautifully, much of the footage I've already seen in the TV series 'Planet Earth', is told by David Attenborough. I found that Attenborough's story of Planet Earth is much better than the story of Earth. 'Earth' is an easier movie. It shifts many of the scientific details covered by Attenborough in its Planet Earth series. For example, the Earth will tell you that a tropical sea is an ideal nursery for a young humpback whale, because there are few predators. The Earth will tell you that a tropical sea is a good nursery, because the water is low in oxygen and does not contain enough nutrients to support large animals such as large sharks. This is an important difference to me. This, along with Attanborough's distant superior voice, makes Planet Earth a much better documentary than Earth. Yet, I think the Earth is worth looking for the beautiful footage and the fact that it is easier to understand makes it interesting for children as well.
