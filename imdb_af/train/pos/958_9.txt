Wow! I've seen so many bad low budget movies over the past few years, but this one is wonderful. The very realistic portrayal of police life in a city on the East German coast is a strong contrast to other crime movies or series. I loved the main actress and the absolute rejection of a general clique on the police. This movie is realistic like a documentation and entertaining like a drama at the same time. A perfect set-up!
