Back to the 3rd room is the comic sequel to Shaolin's epic 36th room, in which Gordon Liu Shan Te, a young man who became a monk and awesome fighter, played. In this sequel, Liu plays an unfortunate loser who has to learn kung fu after his friends are beaten. He mimics the original Shan Te, trying all sorts of tricks to learn in Shaolin Temple to finally get some unique skills to fight bullying bosses. It is a classic light-hearted martial art story, featuring the Shaw Brothers bait production values ​​and Lui Chia Liang's legacy. The choreography is fantastic throughout, whether it's a fight or a slapstick comedy and Gordon Liu's performance, like the others, especially the sympathetic monk work perfect for the material. The film is less epic or deep than some of the star's other work and there are definitely bigger, more violent and versatile Shaw Brothers movies. But little has such a magical blend of slapstick, unique training and battles, with a subtle but warm story of a useless guy who makes good. Full of mild grief, it is impossible not to give the highest score.
