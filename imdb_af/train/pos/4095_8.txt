Now my friends, films like "La BÃªte" (Aka "The Beast" or "O Monstro") can only be done in the old continent. In this movie we all see: horses dirty sex, nymphomania, similar to gorilla, not senses, etc., etc., etc. ... In the serious terms, it is an allegory that men can sometimes be bribe, visceral and brutal Walerian Borowczyk (the director) shows us the loss of innocence, sexual violence, rape and brutality. It's an amazing movie experience, bizarre and full of grotesque scenes. For all fans of European shocking exploitation, I recommend this movie. If you like this one, I recommend "Orloff Against the Invisible Man" and "Alterated States".
