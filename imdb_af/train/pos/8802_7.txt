This is a very interesting project that could be quite brilliant. Collect 11 prominent international directors and allocate each of them 11 minutes, 9 seconds, and 1 frame to create a segment of their choice; anyone investigating the global reverberations of 9/11. Without a pampering I can say that Ken Loach's piece is the crown, and Mira Nair's short (segment "India"), based on a true story, deserves a full feature film. One also realizes, while looking at his brief, why Alejandro González Iñárritu is one of the best directors in the world? He is simply a master of the medium, who also has a profound understanding of the subject. Unfortunately, not all 11 parts have been made. Youssef Chahine, in his "Egypt" segment, assumes the Arab attitude of self-inflicted collective guilt, which may be the most interesting. He failed failed. Chahine's short is poorly written and performed badly, at least enough to cover, among other things, outstanding chapters of the film. Despite the imbalance in quality, I will give the film another 7/10 for draft, if not for execution.
