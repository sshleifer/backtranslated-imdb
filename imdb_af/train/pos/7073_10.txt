One of the biggest movies I've seen this year. Last perhaps before sunrise, which is also seen alone in the laboratory late at night. I like the idea of ​​the film, which represents the free will of man and our weakness towards fate. Over time, James and Kathryn are destined to fail and an indescribable sadness. I like the end. but a big question also comes. The virus will not be released again, if so? <br /> <br /> In the last scene at the airport. Jose is sent back to meet James again by future scientists. When he told him scientists had already received his message and knew someone else would spread the virus. And the two of them meet Kathryn when Kathryn tells James the real man is DR. Goine's assistant. So it is clear that Jose also gets the real information about the virus (James immediately remembers him, remember?) And he has teeth. So why is everything still happening? Why do future scientists do nothing after the truth is revealed? My biggest demand for the movie ...
