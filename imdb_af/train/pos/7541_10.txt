This Showtime movie really earns a much better viewer rating than a 4.5; I gave it a 10 based on the story and the acting of the two stars. After reading the viewer comments, I was amazed at how many people expected this movie to be comedy. Yes, I see that IMDb calls it as Comedy / Drama under Genre. It's probably misleading, isn't it? Luckily I saw the movie before I signed in to this site so I didn't have that expectation. In fact, based on the summary of what I heard, I totally expected it to be just a drama. I wonder if disappointment was not a funny movie, so many low voices. <br /> <br /> Another factor that can cause low voices is that this movie is 'character-driven'. 'Driving Miss Daisy' is an example of another character-driven movie that comes to mind. Someone's previous remark complained about a boring trial. Tom's (Danny Glover) screens have learned to derive from the real plot of the movie. This is how he gets the upward social climb of his family - or his personal troops, if you like. However, they served to establish credibility and justification as its right to move to Greenwich and move 'up' into the world. <br /> <br /> Tom's obsession has become a force. He proved that he would not stop mixing in the white area. His shame when another black person moved alongside was not due to skin color. It was because of everything that represented the "interruptor"; everything Tom left behind. In essence, Tom became an Oreo cookie: Black on the outside, but White on the inside. <br /> <br /> The last 20 minutes of this movie is one of the most powerful written, directed and performed (by Whoopi Goldberg) I have ever had the pleasure of witnessing. I realized that the climax of the movie was not the obvious event (it didn't want to give away). The climax is oral and Whoopi delivers it. I'm still not clear whether this is the conversation when she informs Tom which college Tom-Two is going or when she releases it, all in the middle of the night and Tom wakes up. Nevertheless, the unbundling is great. You know that life on that street will never be the same. <br /> <br /> My favorite type of character-driven movie: people go through trouble, pain, do their dance, grow, change and life goes on. As a member of the audience, I can learn or be inspired.
