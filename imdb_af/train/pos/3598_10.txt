Being a person who doesn't usually enjoy boxing movies, feels they are just focusing on the box and not the characters themselves, this movie really surprised me. I loved seeing the main character Diana (Michelle Rodriguez) by going so many things in such a short time, it was wonderful for me. Michelle (Rodriguez) played such a wonderful job, especially Diana, as it was her first acting experience, showed his true emotion and Princess depicted wonderfully. All actors got chemistry on the screen and made this movie even more amazing. I recommend this movie, even to those who don't usually watch boxing movies. 10/10
