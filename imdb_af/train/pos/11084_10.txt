<br /> <br /> I saw the Glacier Fox in the theater when I was nine years old - I struggled to take my parents back three times. I looked at it on video five years ago and finally uncovered a copy at an online auction station, but I would like to see it picked up and reread by a new distributor (I understand the original video ran small), or bought the rights through The Family Channel, Disney, etc. and regularly displayed. It is a fascinating film that tells you in the story of the life-match of a family of dragons in northern Japan, told by a wise old tree. The excellent soundtrack complements the film well. It will be a good seller today, much better than much of the poor children's film offer today.
