There are not many victory-the-chance stories like that of Christy Brown. Born with cerebral palsy in the 1930s Dublin, his parents thought his mind was both spiritual and physical. Although eventually properly diagnosed, Brown, in a lower working class family with nearly 20 children, had to press himself to be appreciated by his family. Through his only full-function limb, his left leg, he learned to write and paint himself, both of which he was able to develop. <br /> <br /> But what makes the movie version of Brown's autobiography "My Left Foot" such a great rethink is his humility. Both director / writer Jim Sheridan and star Daniel Day-Lewis told this story in a way that did not shout for attention and resort to melodrama. Cheeky struggles and screens of frustration as well as glorious moments of victory are easy potholes of a story that is so miraculous, but "My Left Foot" remains truly and intrinsically inspired. <br /> <br /> Day-Lewis is the easiest to highlight. Playing anybody with such serious physical disabilities should be a demanding task. Not only does Day-Lewis give us a complete picture of Christy, he also manages the growth, improvement, and inner change of character in various stages of his life. He plays Christy at 17 when he had limited language power and was emotionally brief as critical as he was to the intellectually learned Christy who was struggling to deal with why he could find non-platonic love. The latter theme is the strongest of the film and it would be nice for Sheridan and co-adapter Shane Connaughton to really flesh it out. Regardless, Day-Lewis gets us to understand and sympathize with all the elements, to deliver a performance that's so credible, that you often don't have time to think "Wow, he's such a good one actor. " These are the most commendable performances. <br /> <br /> Equally important, but through more subtle means, Sheridan's work on the film is. This story is about daily life and struggle. Although Christy has such a unique set of circumstances that impedes his life, his struggle is no different from our own and Sheridan fully understands the concept. Christy struggles with love, parental attention, questions of self-worth and ability. His struggle is only more physically revealed (literally and figuratively) than ours. <br /> <br /> Sheridan gives us moments that take the spirit of the great Brown family and Christy's unique place in it. Of course, the drama evolves when tension is the highest and humor comes in the same way. The dinner when Christy learns that his doctor / teacher - the woman he loves - marries his brother, is the film's best example of both Day-Lewis and Sheridan's efforts. It was built so well by Sheridan that it came out when we were ready and Day-Lewis took us from there with his beautiful work. <br /> <br /> The other strong component of the movie is Brenda Fricker as Mrs. Brown. I didn't know she won the Oscar, but there was something about her performances as Christy's loving and wise mother who just shouted Oscar. Her love for Christy and the constant fighting for him looks just as convincing and sincere and she deserves much sympathy for her situation. <br /> <br /> The emotional punch of the movie that gave the story is surprisingly minimal. Perhaps it was part of the sacrifice to create a film that feels organically human. The two must be compatible, but I think it's challenging to tell a story that feels lifelong and one that offers enough dramatic moments to take our emotions on a roller coaster. The choice to lower the latter was definitely the way one for "My left foot." Brown's circumstances speak for themselves - they don't have to be harmed by the more weighty dramatic impact. <br /> <br /> ~ Steven C <br /> Visit my website moviemusereviews.com for more
