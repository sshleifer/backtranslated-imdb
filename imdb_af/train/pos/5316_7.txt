This is the second film I saw from Ida Lupino as a director after 53's the hitch hiker. I think this one was a better movie than that one. This one has a girl who is about to marry and is then sexually assaulted and doesn't like everyone to look at her and talk to her. She walks away and is caught up by a family. I think Leonard Maltin's review is right to give only 2 and 1/2 stars.
