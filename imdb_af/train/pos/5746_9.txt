Words are serious enough not to convey the emotional power of this movie; This is one of the most beautiful things you'll ever see, but the end is one of the most loving, gentle, and emotional fulfillment you can hope for. Every actor in each role is awesome, especially a wise and underestimated Jamie Lee Curtis, a tight-wounded and anxious Ray Liotta, and a heart-blowing twist by Tom Hulce who had to receive him for every award in the book. (He is the # 1 for 1988's best actor in Danny Peary's "Alternative Oscars.") The last half hour borders on melodrama, but the movie deserves each of its tears - and unless you are made of stone, there will be plenty of them.
