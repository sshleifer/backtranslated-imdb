The Sea Is Watching is made from an original Akira Kurosawa script, and it is indeed a lush and warm movie. Look at it will be a pleasure! <br /> <br /> Director Kei Kumai is certainly not the same as the old but eternal master (especially the masses in the beginning of the movie have some terrible plays), but the overall mood and scenery are very pleasant . Another thing that is missing here: Kurosawa has always managed to make the characters so much more than they actually show and do. It was probably his magic on the set while he was shooting; and perhaps this script is not yet completely mutually exclusive. <br /> <br /> Maybe we just miss the eye of the master. <br /> <br /> It's a nice and sweet movie, but it's not Kurosawa. To expect this to be good is very stupid ...
