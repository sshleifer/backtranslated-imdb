Spirited & bold, she catches the heart of the millionaire's son, but violence, terror and sudden death are haunting her immediate future before she can claim the search for happiness. <br /> <br /> Mary Pickford is absolutely charming. in this beautiful, heartbreaking movie. She regards Tess as her favorite role and she fills it with all the mocking joy and enthusiasm that has made her the world's most popular movie star for many years. The story has all the essential elements for a modern fairy tale, with Maria, the lovely, sad heroine who is busy with all kinds of dangerous, stressful situations. The atmospheric is the first time, with the extravagant fishing stations very special. <br /> <br /> In the supporting role, Jean Hersholt plays out as the foul villain Pickford is trying to force him to marry him.
