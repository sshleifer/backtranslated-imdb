I have this movie today with my kids (boy, 10 and daughter, 4.5) at the 3rd annual Roger Ebert Overlooked Film Festival. After the film, the children in the audience were allowed to ask questions to the director, Tian-Ming Wu. He told (through a translator) various stories about his life and making the film. <br /> <br /> All the keys, both my kids, enjoyed this movie very much. Of course, I had to paraphrase many of my captions for my daughter, but much of the film is visually self-explanatory. <br /> <br /> I'll give nothing, but the bottom line is that this movie is as much better than 95% of the Hollywood crap (especially children's movies) out there. <br /> <br /> Cheers. <br /> <br /> ps There is a "real" / original King of Masks that can do 12 masks simultaneously. The actor in the movie trained and taught to work up to 4 masks at a time (then they would cut and change to 4 new masks).
