I gave it an 8-star rating. The story may have fallen about 3/4 of the way in the picture, but the performances remained strong throughout. "Men of Honor" is understandable of "Navy Diver" understandable. Anyone who has served in any branch of the armed forces will probably feel that "Honor" is an appropriate word to use in the title.
