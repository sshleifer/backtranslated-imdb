Despite the success in comedy or drama, the Turkish directors are failures in horror thriller. "Okul-D @ bbe" are good examples for the horrible horror Turkish movies. <br /> <br /> But if you look at "Gen", you'll understand it's a strike. The atmosphere of the movie is impressive and dark. The special features are also colorful and not cheap. The soundtracks fit the movie, but the script is not quite perfect and the theme of the movie is normal. <br /> <br /> As a result, "Gen" adds no difference to horror movies, but it doesn't disappoint thriller fans. In this respect, it is a success for Yesilcam and Turkey. (7/10)
