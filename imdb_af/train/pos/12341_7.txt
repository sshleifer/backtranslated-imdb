Although Lang's version is better known, Borzage's work is not important, and it is by far: his "heavenly" series are even better. The metaphor of the train (possibly borrowed from the end of Abel Gance's "la roue") is ultimately more convincing than the "top" heavenly world. <br /> <br /> Borzage's tenderness for his characters shows in Marie's character and love beyond the grave is one of his favorite subjects (the end of "three comrades"). The amusement park seems to be everywhere: we even see it when we are in Marie's poor home. I don't think the sets are so much cheese, they are styled to a fault. The fair of a distance almost gives a scientific feeling to the film. Borzage never forgets his social concerns: in the heavenly train, the empire cannot be mixed with the reef graffiti, but as "chief magistrate" says: "here there is no difference anymore." <br /> <br /> Not a great job for Borzage (also not Lang's version), but to find out if you're interested in the great director's career.
