I bought the DVD from this version to compare to the current BBC 2005 version (which is brilliant). The 1985 was adapted by Arthur Hopcraft, who adapted Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy for TV and died this year (2005). I remember great acting, especially of Rigg and Elliott, and the movement of music. (Music in the 2005 version is much more underestimated, but much told.) Just to pick up other commentators on a few points: Richard Carstone is Ada Claire's boyfriend, not Esther's. Esther had no uncle. Charlie Drake never played in any version of Krook, nor did he play Toby Esterhase in TTSS! Krook is played by comedian Johnny Vegas in the 2005 version. Toby was played by Bernard Hepton. <br /> <br /> Both versions are honorable and admirable adaptations of Dickens's great novel. Read the book now! It's not perfect, and the sentimentality can sometimes make you falter, but I defend you not to cry - and laugh!
