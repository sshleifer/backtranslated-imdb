There are other reviews here, so I don't have to say how good it is or what it's about. My point is: I've heard of this movie ages before it was shown. I can't even remember how I just knew it was through the internet. The distributors went down before it ever hit! For months I moaned and complained. Please note that this page is a link to purchase this movie and the only highlighted area is VHS at Amazon.com in Germany. You can use Alta Vista's Babelfish to translate. I know it is PAL format and they have changed the text on the screen to German and there is a little bit of narration at the beginning, which is also dubbed German, but just as screaming and champion like this movie. It really makes it funny. ! If you want to see this movie and you have a place close by, it's worth it! It costs about twenty dollars or so to come to the US from Germany. Trust me, it seems to be spending a lot on a movie, but if you are in corny b-flicks, you blow money left and right to get conversions for your friends!
