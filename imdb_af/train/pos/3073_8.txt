This is the kind of movie that Hollywood needs to make more of it. No extravagant props, no car hunters, no smart one-liners. Just people who keep people busy. <br /> <br /> William Macy plays an unlikely hitman working for his father, Donald Sutherland. Macy is the conscientious son, Sutherland is the dominant father. Son wants to be out of business, father will not allow him. Macy loves his own son, beautifully played by David Dorfman ("The Ring"). He also falls in love with Neve Campbell, a girl he meets in the waiting room of his psychiatric office. <br /> <br /> It's an interesting compilation of characters and the movie follows the reluctant killer while balancing his own needs with that of his family. There is a lot of touch tone, especially between Macy and his boy. And as you'd expect in a movie with William Macy in it, there's also a bit of humor. <br /> <br /> Excellent work around the world, actors and directors. Nice to know they can still make a good movie in Hollywood on a small budget.
