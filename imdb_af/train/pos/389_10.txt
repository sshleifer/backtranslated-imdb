yes right. Sammo Hung has been in the lead role of the "Magic War" in 1983's "Zu Warrios". Now, 2001, he does it again with "Zu Warriors". But this time he does it right. You rarely see him in wuxia, more often in classic eastern or criminal slapstick. But this role simply fits him! The ancient Chinese legend is not often represented in movies (as far as I know of films translated for the west). Although legend contains a large number of interesting stories and possibilities. Straight out: you haven't seen a story in a modern movie yet! And it makes it so nice! And wow: all the colors plus the very deep, right-in-heart story immediately make you into the movie. The first time I looked at it, I had to see it again, and I did it. OK, I didn't understand it for the first time. But it just makes it better! You know, you didn't understand it because there are so many spices in it! That is why it is a pleasure for one to look over and over again. And yes, it grows deeper in your heart, the more you see it. <br /> <br /> Summary: A story to love, characters you cry, and really: a movie you never forget! - Editors note: Well, I think I should look at it again: D
