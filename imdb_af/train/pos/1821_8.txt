When I was a little girl (and my dad owns a video store), it was under my favorite movies. I didn't hear anything about it yet, and I didn't remember anything, because it was forgotten in the wake of Don Bluth's other, probably better movies. However, I found it a few weeks ago and was pleasantly surprised. In New Orleans in the 1930s, the animation is delightful and the songs are memorable. There are a few goofs in continuity when you look hard enough, but they usually do not detract from the storyline that makes you smile (and maybe even a little foggy when you are an animal lover). The characters are credible (maybe even a little too big for younger viewers). Two feet, and for those of you who haven't seen it, it's definitely worth looking at again.
