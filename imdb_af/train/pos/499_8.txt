Enterprise pilot has been missing one thing since the original Star Trek: a dose of realistic, flawed personalities. The Utopian characters of the Next Generation became tired, they were so noble that it was incredible. I also like the sub-plot that people are bitter to the Vulcans. It's funny to see them as pretentious snobs. It makes me look to see when man becomes the dominant race between the two, although I don't think it will work in the timeframe of the show. The only negative impact that jumped out of my mind was the "end-to-end fast cut-off", the end of the end, which is common among many of the Trek shows. The second was the shameless digging for ratings by some senseless sexy scenes. It was out of place, a good science fiction program should be able to stand on its own without trying to protest the teenage audience with some skin. But it's not my job to make the show profitable, as well. <br /> <br /> Let's see how the next episode does it.
