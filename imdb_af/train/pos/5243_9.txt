I searched for this movie because I'm a new Frain fan and wanted to see more of his work. First, his Irish accent is great. He has a sharp ear for dialects, it seems. His acting was wonderful as usual. James Frain aside, I thought the movie was very well done. This has shown the conflict in Northern Ireland as the * mess * it's really. Both sides are guilty of serious injustices, and the men who have been in the conflict usually have very little of their circumstances. <br /> <br /> It is also interesting to realize that not every man (or woman) it is who allegedly fights for his country, * really * does it. For example, when Kenny (James Frain) Ginger (Ian Hart) asks why he "does it", Ginger can't come up with a morally acceptable answer. Why? Because Ginger is not about the noble cause of protecting his country or the rights of his fellow Protestants ... Ginger is in for the pleasure of murder. He's full of bloodlust and it's the perfect job for a guy like him. In a battle like this, there are guys like Liam (John Lynch) who just want their daily lives and have to enjoy their families ... guys who see all the battles just get more fighting. There are guys like Kenny who are born leaders of charisma, and they add fuel to the flames, rather it or not. Kenny also really believes in the "cause". He believes what he does will make a difference in the future ... which is a bit strange, because his character seems too intelligent for all of this. But, like many other seemingly intelligent men, he is sucked into a gang of lifestyle, not even realizing ... Until it's too late. Then there is Ginger, a pure psychologist who is not for the other reason in the fight, but for the sheer excitement, which in a war of gangland makes him a valued asset, some can argue. But now, in this movie, Ginger has endured his worth and has become a very dangerous loose cannon. <br /> <br /> Everything boils down and predictably the end is a tragic one. What makes this movie worthy is that both sides of these ages are displayed in an old conflict. To be American, I can't quite understand what all the struggles are about. But I know there must be a better way. <br /> <br /> All in all, a well-activated, touching ... but disturbing movie.
