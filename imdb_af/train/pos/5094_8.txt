If you are a purist, don't waste your time - otherwise, hold your hat and enjoy the adventure. I loved the Stewart Granger / Deborah Kerr version. I've seen it dozens of times, but this movie is just as good, just different. I won't explain the differences because it will spoil the movie. Also, it's a pleasure to see Alison Doody again (I'm a great Indiana Jones fan), Patrick Swayze is good as Quatermain, and the supporting role is excellent. I find the quality of the supporting cast one of the hallmarks of a Hallmark Production and this film was no exception. The cinematography is great and the score is perfect. If you are looking for entertainment, you will not be disappointed.
