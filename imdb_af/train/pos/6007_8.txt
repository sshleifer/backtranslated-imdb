If you haven't heard of this Walt Disney Pictures movie, don't worry about it. It will be classified on other Disney films intended for educational purposes such as "Family Planning". <br /> <br /> It was produced with Kotex to teach pre-teen girls about menstruation, presumably. It is only raised on a superficial level, so it does not include the clear details for the animated "Ram's Head" / Reproductive System sequence. <br /> <br /> The movie shows "The Wonderful World of Disney" elements like turning the page and using animation to tell the story. <br /> <br /> This movie is impossible to find, so if you can get the movie you will be very lucky and enjoy.
