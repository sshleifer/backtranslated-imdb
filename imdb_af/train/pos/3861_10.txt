2 WORDS: Academy Award. Nuff said. This movie had it all in it. Comedy to make me laugh, Drama to make me cry and one of the biggest dances to make rival. Breakin 2: Electric Boogaloo. The play was the top of any independent film. Jeremy Earl was best seen long ago since stinting at the Joan Cusack Show. His lines are lined with dynamite precision and funny white that was last seen in a very young Jimmy Walker. I thought I saw the next rise of a young Denzel Washington when the line "My bus !! This is .... Gone" This was the real turning point of the movie. My grandmother loved it so much that I bought her the DVD and recommended it to her friends. It will bring tears to your eyes and warmth in your heart as you see white Tony Donato and American American Nathan Davis. Through the thick (sticking to the knife point) and thin (Nathan gives Tony tips on women) the new dynamic duo arrived and won Hollywood.
