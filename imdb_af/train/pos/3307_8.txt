Let's start by saying that this movie's English title "The Power of Kangwon Province" is an absolute misunderstanding. This is because in Hong Sang Soo's film there are no real shots of wars, problems and conflicts. So the idea of ​​power of a province is not appropriate or valid in the context of this movie. If we judged this movie with its Korean language title, "Kangwon-do ui him" would appear as a cryptic statement about emotional unrest of his young protagonists whose thoughts are not at rest. Hong Sang Soo has also addressed a highly productive visual document on volatile choices made by people in their lives. The people involved are some young girls who are constantly displaying their moods. If a movie is made out of nothing, as a filmmaker's meritorious virtues, Hong Sang Soo may be greeted as a brave filmmaker whose films speak volumes of ubiquitous nothing of human relationships, sentiments and lives. Which one likes or not, it is the only fair conclusion derived from this particular movie.
