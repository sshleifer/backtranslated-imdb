In the ten years since Wildside broadcast, nothing really came close to its quality in local production. This includes the two series of enjoyable, but over-rated Underbelly, which brought life events into Sydney and Melbourne's recent criminal history. The miniseries Blue Murder (who also knew Tony Martin, but if someone on the other side of the law) could be the exception. <br /> <br /> Wildside is being repeated on the ABC late at night. I haven't looked at the show for a long time, but I'm still impressed with its uncompromising story lines and many human characters. The movie is excellent: Tony Martin is a detective pursued by the disappearance of his son, Rachael Blake (who later became Martin in real life) as a community worker struggling with alcoholism, and Alex Dimitriades as a young police whose vision is gambling. Equally supportive roles are provided by Aaron Pederson, Jessica Napier, Mary Coustas (yes, Effie himself) and a young Abbie Cornish. <br /> <br /> The ABC has inexplicably released only the first three episodes on DVD, a few years back. The logic of this kind of marketing is beyond me, but I suspect it might have something with license differences with the original producers. <br /> <br /> A great range that is remarkably well-aged. Here's the hope that the ABC's DVD section gets its act together. <br /> <br /> (According to a moderator on an ABC message board, there is a further DVD release in December 2009)
