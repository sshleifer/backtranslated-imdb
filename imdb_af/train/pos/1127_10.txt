I only saw IPHIGENIA once, almost 30 years ago, but it has haunted me ever since. <br /> <br /> One series especially takes into account, and could only be formed by a great director, as Michael Cacoyanis is undoubtedly. <br /> <br /> The context: the weight of history and a mighty army and fleet are all on King Agamemnon's shoulders. An act of sanctuary attacked the sea and threatened its great expedition in Troy. He is told he must sacrifice his daughter Iphigenia on Apollo to get the winds for the sail of the Thousand Ships. He initially resisted him but came over and pushed his wife Clytemenstra to bring their daughter to the Greek camp to marry the greatest of all warriors, Achilles. <br /> <br /> Clytemnestra and Iphigenia arrive, find out about the sacrifice and rage the gods for protection and revenge. Meanwhile, the proud Achilles discover that his name has been used in this deceptive, dishonest way. He climbs a hill to tell Iphigenia that he will protect her. <br /> <br /> The shot: The camera circles the two young people without looking directly at each other. They strive for their destiny, and the weakness of men who deceive their loved ones and desire the lust of war. Suddenly they look at each other and for a moment we feel their power and beauty, and the undoubted - except by the camera - irony that they might love and be married in another time, in another place. It is a sharp and sad epiphany that lasts only for a moment. <br /> <br /> What direction! Which camera! What storytelling!
