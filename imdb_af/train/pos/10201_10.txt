It is a very good movie, not only for the fans of Lady Death comics but also for those who love animation movies / series of adventure and fantasy. <br /> <br /> The film is about an innocent girl who is dying for something she has not done, but for whom she is the daughter of the ruler, Lucifer himself. <br /> <br /> Then she seeks revenge ... and the rest, you see it better from the movie. <br /> <br /> I like the movie a lot, the characters are like the original comics, form Chaos. I never had the chance to read the first parts of the story in cartoons, just the last, to the passages in the movie, so I can't tell if the events are exactly like the cartoons, but ... one somehow another is the story of Lady Death!
