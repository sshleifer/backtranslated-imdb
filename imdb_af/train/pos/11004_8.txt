In a near future, the ordinary man above any suspect of the suburb Morgan Sullivan (Jeremy Northam) is hired by Digicorp, a large corporation, named as spy and stealing secrets from their competitors, Sunways. During his training, Morgan brainwashes, accepts a new Jack Thursby identity and travels to boring lectures. In one of them, he is approached by the beautiful and mysterious Rita Foster (Lucy Liu), who advises him that nothing is what it seems. Morgan acknowledges a new reality where he does not know who can be trusted. <br /> <br /> The unknown "Cypher" was a great surprise to me. This movie is not released in Brazil, but the enticing and exciting story is quite complex, with lots of plot points, with great screenplay, direction and performances. In the last turn, I remember Arnold Schwarzenegger's "Total Recall". This movie has to be watched more than once, and I really didn't have the last scene, when the independent spy has the disputed disc in the sea. Just know the director Vicenzo Natali of the fantastic "Cube", and this second work I see is also stunning. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Not available
