A real anomaly in the French cinema, this desperate work has no counterpart in contemporary production. ' One should rather look at the side of Louis Malle's "le feu follet" (1963) (the fire inside) to find something completely different not Harel's attempt. Cruel and cynical, after losing all his illusions, the hero, a computer scientist, has no reason to live. Absolutely no. From the human gender he seems to study his life as a kind of entomologist. His colleagues. One of them gets his attention: Tisserand Jos√© Garcia plays the most humiliating part of the decade. Then Tisserand becomes some kind of prey: all his pessimism will rub on this poor man. The scene is the night club climbs the strange relationship: the hero tells his victim that his life will always be unfinished unless he .... Well, the movie takes a more conventional turn to say so (Clouzot's misanthropy maybe) but only for a while. <br /> <br /> The shape is weird beyond comment. There is t wo voices-over, one for the narrator who always refers to the main character as "our hero", one for the aforementioned hero. The story takes place, now in Paris, now in Rouen, Guy de Maupassant's town. In a scene with his shrinking, the hero says the author's madness was just the expression of his dislike for man and he draws a parallel between his despair and Maupassant's one. <br /> <br /> This depressing movie is only suitable for an informed audience. Not for the very short extracts of X-rated movies, but because you can feel it in the slopes, you can watch it.
