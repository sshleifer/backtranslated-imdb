All right, I saw this movie as a child and really loved it. My parents never bought the movie for me, but I think I'm going to buy it and buy it now. I'm a sucker for pre-2000 animated movies. Anyway, on the real review. <br /> <br /> WHAT I LIKE: There was a real portrayal of heaven and hell, one of the mines I saw in animated films. Character development exists! It's easy to classify characters in this movie (namely: Charlie is the selfish mutt, Itchy is cynical, but believes Charlie, Carface is, of course, the relentless villain, etc.). I also loved King Gator's song. I always loved loved hard, annoying, flamboyant guys. This song might have been random, but it was so nice. Finally, the detail of the animation was beautiful. You can say Charlie was all gruff and things and the backgrounds were beautiful. <br /> <br /> WHAT I DID NOT LIKE: The real portrayal of heaven: The way Charlie responded to it, "no surprises whatsoever", made it look really boring. He denied a place in heaven and eventually returned. I remember a few lines of some songs like "... you can't keep a good puppy", "... let's make music forever" and "... welcome to be dead" but I can't remember the majority of any of them. The songs were not so exciting to be honest. Whippet Angel: She's annoying and that NECK! OLD! <br /> <br /> WHAT PARENTS MAY NOT LIKE: Some very scary (depending on the viewer) images of hell are shown during the movie. Carface is very threatening. Beer is also implied, but not actually doubled. Gambling is an important element in the movie. The good guy dies. <br /> <br /> GENERAL: I love this movie, even though it's a little forgetful. The rare kids animations are always my favorite kids. It was created at a time when producers and writers were not afraid to frighten children from time to time. Today it will probably be rated PG. Children under the age of 8 (or easily disturbed children) should not see it. Other than that, I give it 9/10. :) <br /> <br /> Happy Viewing!
