I ran over this movie on the TV and couldn't switch it off. Peter Sellers plays an unlikely fellow who falls for a very hot and cute Goldie Hawn (who wouldn't?). The way Goldie's character finds herself from the beginning of the film to the end is still unbearable today. This movie gave me a different angle in human relationships and I also found it very funny. Peter Sellers' role was a tough sale, but I think he pulls it off well.
