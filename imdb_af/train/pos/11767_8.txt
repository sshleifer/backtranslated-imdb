What a great movie! Made Men is a great action movie with lots of turns and turns. James Belushi is very much like an ex-chap who stole 12 million from the boss, who must disappear from gangsters, hills and his wife and local sheriff (Timothy Dalton). You won't be disappointed, jump aboard and enjoy the ride. 8 out of 10
