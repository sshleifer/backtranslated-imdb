My Tasks: Make use of his well-known plot with fine performances and some genuine moments of excitement. <br /> <br /> The plot is known. An innocent man was designed for a plot to kill the United States president, the first traitor in the United States secret service. As his co-secret service agents pursue him, he tries to prove his innocence. Of course we know his innocent, and the real culprit is just around the corner, but I was still entertained by THE SENTINEL. At this time when thrillers are being reduced to being ridiculous and too much in action, the SENTINEL is a good blow to all the good old-fashioned political crime thriller. The well-known plot is elevated by neatly exciting sequences and fantastic performances. <br /> <br /> Michael Douglas, the perfect man for the job, is a long-time Secret Service Agent, Pete Garrison, who is a member of a plot. To kill the President. Former colleagues in the secret service (Kiefer Sutherland and Eva Longoria) follow Harrison while trying to find out who is behind the possible assassination and traitor in the Secret Service. This leads to many hunting scenes that are surprisingly (and thankfully) never incredible. The script also provides a subplot in which Garrison has a relationship with the First Lady (played by Kim Basinger). Unfortunately, this is not unnecessary, as most subplots are of these types of movies. <br /> <br /> The film director is Clark Johnson (S.W.A.T) who looks good at the movie. Although many have criticized it as "had to be a TV movie", I have to disagree. Agreed, this is not a perfect movie, and much of it is inspired by other action thrillers and political intrigues such as IN THE LINE OF FIRE, or an episode of the TV series 24 (which this movie now looks like for style and star Sutherland), but even so, this movie takes its plot in serious heights and does not even leave its smaller details. The performances are fantastic (with a top cast, it is bound, even with the by-the-numbers writing. <br /> <br /> All-in-all, I give it *** 1/2, not perfect but not far from it. <br /> <br /> Rating: *** 1/2 out of 5.
