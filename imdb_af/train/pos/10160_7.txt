I went into this movie and thought it would be a crazy b-rated movie. I was surprised and very amused. Eve was good, but Lake Bell stole the show. She had wonderful comic timing. The jokes in this movie were surprisingly original and really funny with one or two flat jokes in between. The plot was enough to tie it all together, a woman (Eva) dies on her wedding day and comes back to fetch the woman who is with her husband, it sounds far-fetched, but it actually works pretty well . <br /> <br /> 7/10 - Overall, it's a good cinema, if it doesn't come on DVD when it comes out.
