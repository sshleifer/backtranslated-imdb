Okay, it's basically a popcorn slide movie, but from the beginning it is clear that it has a lot of intelligence. You can count over 10 clicks on which the movie builds, but it delivers just about three of them, and some of them have a twist for those who let you know that the director didn't assume you're not an idiot. Kurt Russell's play is really great and brings a depth of character that is surprising and rewarding. Recommended if you just saw something really stupid and want to rebuild your faith!
