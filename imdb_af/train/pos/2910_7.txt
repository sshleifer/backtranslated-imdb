It's a great movie for McCartney and Beatles fans! A wonderful time is guaranteed for everyone. The audience (such as Nicholson, Cuzak, Michael Douglas, Nicholson, Cuzak, Michael Douglas) is, as always, wonderful: from small children to old campaigns of the sixties. They know the words of all the songs of heart, and some of them cry when Paul breaks in a "blackbird", "yesterday" "all my love" and all the treasures of his catalog (who can save John Lennon and Dylan such a repertoire claim?). There are two particularly moving moments: <br /> <br /> - The double tribute to Lennon and Harrison; only "today" performed solo (the title was included in "tug" 1982 and was his best job), then "something" when Paul used a ukulele. <br /> <br /> - "The long and winding road" version, an important moment when Paul's voice cracks, while moving to tears in the heart holds the members of the tour officer in front of the stage. <br /> <br /> I remember, in the early seventies, when people despised Paul because he was not involved in politics, as his former partner. They had to change their minds because Paul is a dedicated artist: "Glory is great because it allows charity." The film shows different aspects of Paul's activities, an artist who is anything but selfish.
