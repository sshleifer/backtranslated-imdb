I really think people are taking the wrong approach here. First, I find this short film very entertaining and interesting. I just take it for what it is. I think the tension and mystery are ingenious in their insinuation on the viewer. Another thing that caught my fiction is that it immediately hits the viewer, although there is no clear story, just hints and pauses and emotions played by the characters give you the impression that there is a story for everything What is happening. No one else could have done better than Lynch. This is the essence of lynchianism at its best. Certainly, I will agree with anyone that people who start it with the desire to be entertained without any real imaginative work on the part of the viewer will be disappointed. And in good law. Lynch is not about it. At least this is not Lynch's side. The one who helped Lost Highway / Mulholland Dr. is quite down to the point and people who just expect to be entertained as they will look something else will just not get what it is about. My opinion is that Darkened Room is about your animal core, your instinctual self, by giving you the means (image, sound, situation) through which you instinctively respond. It's not about any pleasure, it's about getting the desired response from you. And this, my friend, is pure art.
