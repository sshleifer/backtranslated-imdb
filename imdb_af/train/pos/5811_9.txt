Just a 9/10 of mine, would have been a perfect ten if there was more of the picture, but still Moonwalker is still a fun festival for music, dance and entertainment. Starting with video clips from Jackson's long career, it reminds the viewer why he is often regarded as 'The King of Pop'. From his hit "I want you back" to "We are the world" is the award-winning charity record for Africa's sake. This is followed by a short film of all kinds, although it is in an Oscar winner, but it offers a fantastic and entertaining drama for the audience. Ends with a perfect (sexy!) Version of "Come Together". Something that the whole family can see and enjoy.
