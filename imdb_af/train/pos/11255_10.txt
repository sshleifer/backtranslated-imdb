It is without a doubt my favorite Le Carre novel and it is transformed into the silver screen with all the love and care one can wish for. I read a review on this site that looks like the characters are ominous, but I believe it misses the point. All Le Carre stories are essentially love stories and that is no exception. This is an accurate reflection of the period in which it is set. Betrayal is the key of everyone for the good of no one. Pym education is so close to me that I watch it cold. Peter Egan is in his best role and the late-complained Ray McAnally is incredibly good. Even the smallest roles played by Andy de la Tour, Tim Healy and Jack Ellis are on the point. This role is a theater impersonator's dream. The story should not be spoiled by a badly informed description, but it is enough to say it relates to a young man, but slow and unrelenting destruction and descent into spying and treason. All my sympathy lies with Magnus Pym and his only (non-sexual) love for Poppy (RÃ¼diger Weigang - as wonderful as ever. His only true friendship, but also by definition another in the long betrayal.) EXCELLENT! Hire it, buy it. crazy about it.
