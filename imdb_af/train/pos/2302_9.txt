Reese Witherspoon's first outing on the big screen was a memorable one. She looks like a fresh, scrubbed face "tween" slightly and firmly, but undoubtedly Reese. <br /> <br /> I always liked her as an actor, and didn't know she started this young with her career. I actually got some respect for Reese to know who she was so early on. I say this because, if I have seen her, the characters have so far also appeared in her depiction, she has her own persona, who actually lived with that character. <br /> <br /> Anyway, my first movie experience with Reese was the Little Red Riding Hood parody Reese came with Kiefer Sutherland, somehow I assumed it was her first time on "at bat" Not so , well done Reese
