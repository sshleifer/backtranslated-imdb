I didn't expect much from it, but I have to admit that I've been on the ground a few times during this film. If you are not seriously insulted in the first ten minutes, it may be a movie for you. It's like enjoying the type of Amanda Peet shuffling cards for an hour and a half. This is certainly not a noteworthy work of comedy, but with the low-budget in the genesis it is masterful. To compare the playing field for comparison, imagine all the studio movies with their budgets by a factor of 100 or so, and see what you get! Kudos told Peter Cohen and his network to see it through. I'm looking forward to his next attempt.
