I was quite surprised to read honestly the comments on this work. Some people were looking for a plot ??? OK, when this video came out more than a decade ago, I watched it for what it was: a collection of music videos. It's not a movie. It does not have a plot or central storyline. This is a rather artistic antology of mostly long-standing videos, all of them are clever or creative. Michael Jackson can be considered a freak today, but it was the man who gave us Thriller (considered by many to be the best music video of all time) and set trends with Billie Jean and Beat It. With Moonwalker, he and the filmmakers and artists who worked with him embarked on his music and dance moves to create entertaining things, including clay, special effects, live shows and even self-paced (the "Badder" series). And for those who wonder what Joe Pesci did there, this video came out a little before becoming a household name, and was one of his most memorable appearances on film. And, IMHO, I think the Smooth Criminal Sequence (the choreographed section) knocks anything else Michael Jackson has until that point!
