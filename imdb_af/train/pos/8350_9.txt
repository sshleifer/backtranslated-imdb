As with that movie, we follow the indisputable if we always enchant the adventures of the 2 main characters. But while C + J has sex for a girly journey back in childhood, these couples in their carnality even boast to the point of examining homosexuality. Most of the generation they get from reluctant or unwilling partners, yet, despite their deep PC behavior, everyone comes to the fore. Like C + G, they all remain innocent of heart, rebels against quotidine, the bourgeois, the restrictive. As someone else commented, I do not want to know this 2 and it is a small miracle that their journey brings scenes of mostly comedy and very little tragedy (and what can not be laid with them) and therefore reason, it cheated on me, but with a nice taste in the mouth. Dare I say that only the French can get away with such movies. And it's part of their genius.
