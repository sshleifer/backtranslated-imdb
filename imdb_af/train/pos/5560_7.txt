SPOILERS <br /> <br /> A friend of mine said NEXT MOVIE was the best Cheech & Chong movie and got out of his way to borrow me and the BLUES BROTHERS. NEXT MOVIE has no plot, has no pacing, really has nothing of what a movie defines ... but it's funny. And for what it's worth, Cheech and Chong show a heart. <br /> <br /> Well, in this little paragraph I'm in the plot, but it's four-fifths of the movie, nothing happens that usually won't start a story. I won't say that Cheech's cousin pops up. <br /> <br /> Wasn't there another finer moment when Chong Cheech pressed twice? What about the cock? Was it Pee-Wee Herman's first movie appearance? You will have to watch the movie yourself to enjoy it. I don't think NEXT MOVIE has strong enough balls to make it great, but the movie has heart and soul, my partner has lent me so it gets a 7.
