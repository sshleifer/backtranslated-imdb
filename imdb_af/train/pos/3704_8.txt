In general, it is difficult to judge these cut and paste films. Some of the segments may be reasonably good, while others may reduce the value of the overall product. In this one, for example, the whole girl scene in the doctor's office was very exciting ... one of the best in the viewer's (limited) viewing history. Then there is Asia's segment ... the lady is always entertaining. And the story that binds the whole was an interesting concept. The swap scene that closes the offer is also not bad. Technically, the production values ​​are quite high. Recommended.
