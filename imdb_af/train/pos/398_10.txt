I'm stunt, I have to admit I've never seen a movie with such a good story and no one stops with a high special effect martial arts fighting scene. If you like the fantastic genre, like me, you'll definitely be more than happy! All character has very cool power and the special effect is near perfection, in one word, flawless! The next year I will listen to this movie a lot.
