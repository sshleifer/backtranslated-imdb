Moving forward through the terrible song, you'll find a classic fairy tale below. Christopher Walken is very humorous and surprisingly good at the role. His acting style of acting works well for the smart Puss in Boots. The other actors are good for their parts. I didn't find any of the acting fake or uncomfortable. In particular, the king seems to be a real dunce, and I wonder if he is supposed to be. I can't remember the original story. The special effects are typical of the eighties, but at least they are not too fake like some of the computer-generated savings we see today. Overall, I recommend this movie for children and adults who are a child of heart.
