Daniel Day-Lewis is Christy Brown, a victim of cerebral palsy using "My Left Foot" to write and paint in this amazing 1989 film. The film also stars Brenda Fricker as Christy's mother, Ray McAnally, Fiona Shaw and Hugh O'Conor. Their brilliant performances, great writing and wonderful direction by Jim Sheridan help to paint a lively portrait of Christy Brown, an artist and writer who died at the age of 49 in 1981. <br /> <br /> Brown is in a lower-born middle-class Catholic family where his mother was constantly pregnant (22 children in total, 13 of whom survived). His father thought Christy mentally and physically disabled, but he didn't want his son to go home. The children in the family will take goodbye to him every day while they go to school, and then his mother will feed him and talk to him. <br /> <br /> In the movie, Fricker carries the feel of a woman who, despite being surrounded by a large family, needs someone to talk to. Christy doesn't talk back. Eventually there was a car for him to drive in, and the nearby kids, who all knew him since he was a baby, included him in all their activities. The only part of his body that works really well is his left foot, and when the kids find out how well he kicks, they just put him in soccer matches. One of the most beautiful parts of the film is the relaxed way in which the other children treat him. <br /> <br /> There are many powerful scenes, but nobody is as powerful as Christy writing "Mother" on the floor and a piece of chalk between his toes. "He's a real brown," his father said, lifting him on his shoulders and carrying him to the bar. In the bar he goes on, "My son is a genius." Things change when Christy gets older because he has a young boy's desires and emotions. He develops breaks, is rejected and goes more into himself, turning to painting. Eventually, he goes to a nearby clinic therapy and works at a therapist, Eileen (Fiona Shaw). He falls in love with her. If he finds out she's engaged, he's almost crazy. But he survives to live, paint, write (three books in total) and to love again. <br /> <br /> Because it's a movie, certain things need to be left out and characters combined. Brown was not actually diagnosed with cerebral palsy, which was left out of the film. Therapist Eileen is actually a combination of three major therapeutic figures in Christy's life and although we know his mother believed he had a good idea, she really worked very hard with Christy when he was a child taught him the alphabet. Also, before Mary, Christy had a 12-year relationship with the woman he dedicated "My Left Foot." And the typical Hollywood ending, 9 years before his death where his wife had been neglected, could not complete the story. <br /> <br /> Despite this, Christy Brown's biopies are incredibly powerful, all the more because of two appearances: Hugh O'Conor as young Christy and Daniel Day-Lewis as the mature Christy. O'Conor's facial expression and the way he dragged his scratched body were giddy. One was exhausted for him and exhausted at the same time. <br /> <br /> And what can be said about Daniel Day-Lewis, one of the greatest actors in the world - he brings Christy to life, a full fleshed, intelligent man capable of cursing, becoming angry, bitter, drunk, obtrusive, lecherous, funny and loving. A well-deserved Oscar won in the same year that Tom Cruise was nominated for "Born on the Fourth of July." I remember somebody writing a letter somewhere to the editor who was so sensational, what was wrong with the academy? Uh, nothing for a change. Nothing. <br /> <br /> Brenda Fricker is wonderful as Christy's mother, who never stops believing in him and what he can do and who keeps her family and husband together in the difficult times. The wonderful thing about Fricker's performance is that the support, love and work ethic of course come to the mother. The character will never regard her as a heroine or if someone does something extraordinary. Fricker shows us a religious but not fanatic woman who believes her duties on earth is a good woman and mother. And no matter what, even when her husband is out of work, throw her daughter out of the house for pregnant, whatever she controls. She saves money for Christy's wheelchair, she receives pictures of her daughter and baby, she starts a room for Christy in the back of the house. All part of a day's work. A show worthy of the Oscar she received. <br /> <br /> Brown's life was more complicated than this inspirational movie, but it is an incredible achievement by all concerned and a must-see.
