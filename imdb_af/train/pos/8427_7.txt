It is one of the strangest movies of the Zat么ichi series due to its very unusual pacing and the role that Ichi plays in the film. Interestingly, it was the first Zat么ichi film made by Shintaro Katsu's new production company. Now, instead of just playing the blind swordsman, Katsu is in charge of film making. This can easily explain why this film looks so different in the previous 15 films. Regarding the role of Ichi, the film is very different because he is not as much as in the movie. He is also easy to fool and actually does a lot to harm people instead of helping! <br /> <br /> "Zat么ichi R么yaburi" starts with Ichi talking to an old lady trying to take advantage of his blindness. Strangely, in this scene Ichi says he's blind since a toddler, but in an earlier film he says he was blind when he was 8. It's a slight mistake and just a crazy fan like I'd noticed. <br /> <br /> This movie takes place over a period of at least six months and is more likely to take a year - so you can see what I said about strange pacing. Most movies in the series take place in a few days or weeks. Ichi comes to a town where there is a boss (Asagoro) who is trying very hard to be Ichi because he knows the blind's reputation. The boss is quite charming and surprisingly, Ichi is overtaken by the evil man. At the same time, he meets another boss (Shushui) - a kind of guru for the poor. Shushui admonishes the people to leave all violence and even Ichi falls under his instruction - giving his blade for many months. Shushui's teachings are very similar to Daoist teachings from China - non-violence and acceptance of life as it is (for good or bad). <br /> <br /> Months after leaving this town and thinking everything is fine, Ichi learns that as soon as he is gone, Asagoro has shown his true colors - women are beaten, the poor are suppressed and a mundane jerk. In a way, Ichi is responsible for this, as he helped Asagoro and counted him as a friend. Asagoro has captured Shushui and several innocent people have killed themselves because of the evil boss's actions. <br /> <br /> When Ichi returns, he does not automatically assume that Asagoro is good or evil, but tries smartly. This little scarecrow is inspired and leads to a final where, what else, Ichi makes the badly deadly and free Shushui. This final was very good and took place in the rain. Then the final scene with Asagoro and the rocks is awesome, though the shelter is a bit cheesy by today's special effect standards. <br /> <br /> Pluses for the movie are that although it's poor, it's different and can't be wrong. the previous 15 (which often looks very similar). In addition, it ends very well. Minuses (apart from pacing) is that some may not see that Ichi is so illegible and that the scenes with Ichi and the other blind men included for comic relief fall flat ... very, very, very flat. They are tough and unfunny ... it's the kind of flat it is.
