An extra is asked to play a general in a movie about the Russian Revolution. However, he is not an ordinary extra. He is Serguis Alexander, former commander of the Russian armies who is now forced to revive the same scene, which he had professional and personal tragedy, to satisfy the director who once was a revolutionist in Russia and humiliated Alexander. be. It can be time for this broken man to finally win his penultimate battle. It is a powerful movie with a careful direction by Von Sternberg, which gives the greatest irony in Alexander's character in every possible way. Jannings deserves his Oscar for the role with a very moving show that plays the general on its peak and in its deepest valley. Powell gives a sinister support as the revenge-directed director, and Brent is perfectly in her role with her face and movements that show so much expression than Jannings love. All around brilliance. Evaluation, 10.
