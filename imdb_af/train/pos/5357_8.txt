This cartoon style film is funny, has a beautiful action and a good futuristic style. Author Steven de Souza, who also wrote Commando, gives Arnie many lines to cut out: "Send me a copy," after you have signed a contract and put a pen back in the lawyers; "What a pain in the neck," after hovering with barbed wire; "He had to divide," after he cut his body between his legs; And finally, as Killian hit through a sign with his own face, Arnie concludes: "Now the place has hit." Funnily enough, remember a few similarities, another sci-fi movie starring Schwarzenegger.
