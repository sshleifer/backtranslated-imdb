Children - of whatever age - don't want to know about their parents' sex lives. And adult children are often seriously amazed and confused by any evidence that older parents have an active libido. Lastly, many filmmakers are very uncomfortable looking at a dull, frumpy widow who unappreciates almost everywhere, discovers her pain and needs for passion with a handsome man half her age. <br /> <br /> "The Mother" is a challenging look at a scarcely filmed reality - a woman who is not ready to stay at home, looks at the telly, and plants her for nearly three decades. and a controlling dominant boyfriend, packing it with a massive heart attack. <br /> <br /> May (Anne Reid) and her husband have two children, each dysfunctional in his or her own way. The male boy lives with a beautiful woman who will manage him well to the Bankruptcy Court with her exorbitant commercial venture. Paula (Cathryn Bradshaw) is a teacher with aspirations to succeed as a writer. She is attractive, not pretty, and she immediately looks close to mom. <br /> <br /> Back at her home after burying her husband, May decides not to stay there. Refusing typical widowhood with his legacy of boring days and no adventure, she will stay with Paula with a young boy. Paula's boyfriend, Darren (Daniel Craig), is a very attractive contractor who seems to take a very long time to complete an addition to May's son's home. May be taken with hard-drinking, cousin Darren whose treatment of Paula had warned that he was certainly a fellow of the Royal Academy of Cads. <br /> <br /> What follows is a rage relationship between Darren and the occupied and now bubbly alive (dare I say born again?) widow. The love stories are graphic, but second for amateur artists. May's pen and ink sketches of their trysts, which then play a role in the expanded drama (or debacle, choose your choice). <br /> <br /> The theater in Manhattan was packed for today's early afternoon, showing more than half of the audience in May's series. That some were shocked or disturbed to see that she had challenged herself with erotic abandon in the arms of a much younger man is an understatement. <br /> <br /> This blindly honest look at an older woman's awakened passion after decades of obedient obedience to her husband's desire to stay home and raise children (she also says he didn't like her friends to have - what a man raises a number of issues. While May's dalliance with Darren does not form an incest, there are real psychological dimensions, and problems, with a mother covering her daughter's lover. And Paula is not made of the very first things to start with. The case, once announced, opens the opening of the mother-daughter relationship, which left something to be desired from Paula's point of view. Mrs. Bradshaw is excellent in the role of a daughter who wants her mother's support as well as her love - she is not a terrible hand for life, but neither is it a bed of roses. <br /> <br /> May is strongly in her mission to acknowledge and expect both her sexuality, indeed a future of happiness. But she is also inevitably vulnerable. She is fishing in unprecedented emotional waters. Who controls her relationship with Darren and why are difficult issues for her to understand, much less solution. In her sixties she is still working. <br /> <br /> "Something's Gotta Give" has recently shown adult sexuality, but in an amusing antiseptic way to ensure no viewer, it would be denied. This is Jack Nicholson and the always beautiful Diane Keaton who cavorting in the world of the rich. And to ensure that no serious psychosocial issues are being investigated, Keaton's young girlfriend Amanda Peet, the daughter of Keaton, has just triumphed, but assured the audience knows she and her parent would never be in the pocket . <br /> <br /> Not easy outside here. Anne Reid's inspired performance uncomfortable for a while and respects others. Her naked body bursts out with sexuality for some and looks absurd as an object of physical attraction to others (the comments of hearing aids that leave today reflected all these views.) <br /> <br /> Kudos to director Roger Michell to tackle a fascinating approach story with envy and empathy. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
