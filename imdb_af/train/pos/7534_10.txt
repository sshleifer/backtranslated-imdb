I totally disagree with the other reviews. Even though it is basically negative. I went to this movie and was glad I did. Do indeed go. I couldn't find anything wrong with that. No period. The script is original. The actors are all nice and convincing. The Smart reminded me of Marcia Brady of the Brady Bunch. But this gall really can. The Australian Outback institution is perfect. Unbeatable scenery. Great soundtrack, ie Paul Kelly. God bless Paul Kelly. The Cranberries are also here. I saw this movie twice in less than 24 hours. I'll probably see it again. This is interesting. It makes one think. It's probably better than nine-tenths of the so-called Hollywood blockbusters. It was also during this time. The back is a loved one. Well photographed film. I couldn't find anything wrong with that. Look it out! My first review!
