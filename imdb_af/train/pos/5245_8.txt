I thought this movie was LOL funny. It's a pleasure not to be taken seriously, film about one man's twisted view of life, love and ... well, ladies "from the low bus station to the high-class debut ... bus station shank." Tim meadow plays a guy (Leon Phelps) performed by a Hugh Hefner-esquire father figure in a Playboy style house, constantly surrounded by beautiful porn models and actresses. When his "father" kicks him out on the street, he must learn to keep him with nothing but the chauvinistic outlook on life his youth taught him ... this and an incomprehensible, almost mystical level of charm and dumb happiness. And so the hijinx starts! If you haven't seen this movie, and you enjoy a light, semi-mindless, comedy / love story, then I recommend the "Ladies".
