I just saw this movie in Santa Barbara. My friend knew someone who worked on it, so I thought I'd look it up. I thought it was a very beautiful movie and couldn't wait to watch it again. The actors were really good and I loved all the music! There wasn't much talk in the movie, which initially felt a bit strange - but when I entered it, I thought the story and acting were really emotional and meaningful and thought it left much to the imagination . I want to see the movie again because there is so much going on that I forgot very little things, but know that I left the theater over the film. It was beautifully shot and the whole thing was really unique.
