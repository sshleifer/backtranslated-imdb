Election points the 2nd trial society themed movie directed by Johnnie To. <br/> <br /> To cast marvelously Simon Yan and Tony Leung Kar Fai as Lok and Big D, as the two trial members selected as candidates for the position of the chairman of the Ho Sing Society, a 100-year trial association. <br /> <br /> While Lok is a man who keeps cool at all times, Big D is not only impatient but also believes he is above all. Lok has been elected as the next chairman for 2 years. To have the total control of the gang, the newly elected chairman with a Dragon Baton, representing power and authority, must be transferred. Big D was extremely unhappy with the results that he was not chosen to be the next chairman after paying an attractive bribe to councilors. He ordered his husband to get the Baton before falling on Lok's hands. <br /> <br /> While Big D gets the Baton, Lok has other plans for him. <br /> <br /> This is one of the storytelling theme movies where not much bloodshed is needed. Johnnie To place the greed of the people in the movie, where bloodshed is commonly used in other fellowship themes to show how people's greed can cause death or demise. However, no single bullet is used, and almost no gangfights are involved in the election. This is the battle of the mind that stands out. <br /> <br /> In addition to Maggie Shiu, the only actress in the less than 5-line election actress, masculinity rules the whole movie. Louis Koo and Nick Cheung, who were seen in To's previous film, are thrown as a sub-captain and a gangster who sold his life to the gang, respectively. Along with some of the veteran actors who make their appearance in the film and the excellent screenplay, it is the only HK movie to represent Cannes Filfees 2005. <br /> <br /> Election has hardly failed any critics who want another trial society themed movie.
