King of Masks (Bian Lian in China) is a shockingly beautiful and profound film. Winner of 16 awards from around the world, this film based on a true story, focuses on Wang Bianlian, a street artist in the 1930s China who is older, but has no heir to present his art of face-change operation. He has a unique talent of fast-changing masks in performance, and no one knows how to do it. He has a desire to have a grandson, because his art is a family heirloom that can only be passed on to a male heir. We then go to the streets and see people sell their children because they can't afford to care for them. Some even ask their daughters to use for free, because girls are not worth much in this society. The story of Wang Bianlian is from there. <br /> <br /> The movie was so amazingly good, the acting was great and the issues were so weighty and well addressed. There is the gender inequality and the depressed fact that no one in this time and place wants a little girl. It is also interesting to note the fact that the famous opera actor, who always plays a woman and is called the Living Bodhisattva, is a man dressed as a woman, and while he is known and respected, he considers himself something low and half a woman. As we move on in the film, face the issues of human slave trade and its claim and therefore the lack of a possible solution to it, the brutality and corruption of the army and the police, and the helplessness and lack of power any individual may face due to unfortunate events or even good intentions. <br /> <br /> It's definitely one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life, and Xu Zhu, the actor who plays Wang Bianlian, offers another beautiful show. .
