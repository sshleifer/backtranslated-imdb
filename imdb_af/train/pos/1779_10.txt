I love this movie! 10 out of 10 hands off! It's a pity! I'm not much of a fan of movies, but I have to tell you this one opened my eyes. Surprising color and fast energy. I was lucky to catch it during a show during the Zoinks! Film Festival in Boston, and the story enchanted me from the start. It had many adult themes and character and when it ended, I wanted more. I hope they make a successor. That would be nice. My only problem with this is the performance of Melissa Connor as Anya. UGH! She sucks! I saw a block of wood that made a better performance. I don't know what the director thinks when he throws her. But if you ignore her, you can't help but give this movie a big ten !!!
