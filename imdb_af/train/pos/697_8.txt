This is one of the first independent movies I've ever seen. For such a very low budget it is well done; As a crap I can sympathize with the main character, although my sleep problems have never been so intense or so disturbing. <br /> <br /> Well-directed, well-maintained, from a box I didn't see much in theaters, lighting and both perfect for the movie setting. There are few striking goofs, but they can be meant; You will see after watching the movie. The movie is very personal and worth watching twice. No movie is flawless, but a Hollywood version can't do the story better. All in all, 8/10.
