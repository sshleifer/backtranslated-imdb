Anyone who finds this movie boring is a hopeless bonehead that has to keep up with movie stories and romantic comedies. This movie is sounding and doesn't have a boring moment. Why? Because it largely consists of an intelligent dialogue between real people in a moment of crisis and details of their efforts to survive the crisis. I repeat - intelligent dialogue! This is what characterizes almost all of Rohmer's movies, so many don't like it. They prefer action. Fine, let them spend the rest of their lives watching active movies, while those of us with taste and discrimination will continue to seek out movies like this. <br /> <br /> Rohmer has always been accused of being "talky". Well, he is, but to me it's a compliment, not a criticism. Shakespeare was also talky. Is there a voice player like Hamlet? When the subject or theme of an artwork consists of ideas and conflicts about values, it must necessarily be a discussion of these ideas and values, which are largely about this film. Aristocracy and noble birth against egalitarianism; loyalty to old friends who are put to the ultimate test when that friend takes what we believe is the wrong way; the value of human life and the responsibility to save that life, even if the person who owns that life is not so good or even horrible. (Who ever heard of Dostoyevsky, or "Crime and punishment?") What this movie is about. <br /> <br /> The two clues in this movie are impeccable, as if they were born to play these roles. . Lucy Russell, who is English and speaks French as her second language, is particularly brilliant. Do yourself a favor and see this sound movie. This can be the last movie through this Master screen.
