This is the true story of how three British soldiers escaped from the German war prison during the Second World War, Stalag Air III. It is the same POW camp, it was the scene of the great escape, which led to the murder of 50 prison officers by the Gestapo (and later made in a very successful film of the same name). <br /> <br /> While the other POWs in Stalag Air III are working on their three massive tunnels (known as Tom, Dick & Harry), two enterprising British prisoners have been given the idea of ​​riding a wooden vaulted horse. build that can be placed near the compound wire fence and shorten the distance they need to tunnel from this starting point. The idea of ​​building their version of the Trojan horse came with them while discussing 'classic' escape attempts and seeing some POWs in the jumping crawl composition. <br /> <br /> Initially, one, and later with two POWs inside, contains the wooden horse in the compound and placed on a daily basis in almost the same position, near the fence. While the voluntary POWS vaulted over the horse, the escapes were digging within the horse a tunnel from under the vault while being placed near the wire, under the wire and in the bush. <br /> <br /> The story also describes the dangers that two of the three escaped POWs faced while traveling through Germany and occupying Europe after emerging from the tunnel. All three POWs trying to escape actually hit homes (successfully escaping their home base.). The Wood Horse gives a very accurate and true feeling of the tension and events of a POW outbreak. The movie was shot in real-life places along the route and the two POWs traveled in their escape. Made with far less budget than the great escape, the wooden horse is more realistic if it is no longer exciting than the great escape and you fail to keep yourself from the edge of your seat and row for the POWs for their escape to make good. <br /> <br /> The story line is sharp and the acting rings are true and naughty enough to keep the tension completely through the film. The Wood Horse is based on the book of the same name by one of the escapees, Eric Williams, and is by far the best POW escape ever made in a movie. Actual POWs were used in the film to repeat their existence as prisoners in Stalag Air III. I give this movie a well-deserved ten.
