It is a fine drama and a nice tempo change from today's more perpendicular and hard movies. It is another real store based on a real base, which still means that much of it can be used for dramatic purposes. Frankly, I don't know, but I kept the story. <br /> <br /> The story is about a young man back in the fifties who is interested in rocket and wants to enter that field instead of working in the coal mines. as everyone, including his father, does in this West Virginia town. The big problem is the conflict it causes between the boy and his father, which I think was exaggerated. I'd like a little less tension between the two. <br /> <br /> The young man, still a boy, is played by Jake Gyllenhaal, one of his first starlings, I think. He is nice, just like his schoolmates in it. It is nice to see beautiful children in a contemporary film. The two other major actors in the movie are Chris Cooper (the father) and Laura Dern (the child's teacher who always encourages him.) <br /> <br /> The cinematography is decent the 1950s soundtrack is fun to hear. Again: I wish to make more of these movies today.
