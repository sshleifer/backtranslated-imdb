Being half Portuguese does not give me half-blind (or half-disadvantaged) if I discuss Portuguese films. Not that I have to do it very often anyway. But this movie was such a rush of adrenaline! Yes, that's right - it was mostly accurate as far as history went, but it didn't struggle to pull out of the ordinary Portuguese movie area: things like using real places in the middle of the traffic-pile Lisbon and Recruiting a real crowd stands for the right crowd of almost 30 years ago. And through God they did it! OK, to sum it up: very emotional if you lived through it, but you will see little improvements that can be made as well as the necessity needed. If you see it randomly, you're in for a good historical skirt, just from the very recent history type and a little more thoughts than usual. Even according to European standards, yes.
