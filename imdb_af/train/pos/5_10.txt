I came in the middle of this movie, so I had no idea of ​​any credits or even his title until I looked at it, seeing that it was received by your commentators mixed reception. I'm on the positive side of this movie, but one thing really caught my attention as I watched: the beautiful and sensitive score written in a Coplandesque Americana style. My surprise was wonderful when I discovered the score written by none other than John Williams himself. In fact, he wrote sensitive and attractive scores like Schindler's List, but one usually associates his name with such bombings as Star Wars. But in my opinion, what Williams wrote for this movie, everything I've ever heard out of his sensitivity and beauty surpasses the soft and delicate plot of the movie. And another recent score from his, for Catch Me if you can, shows even more intelligence and sophistication. Regarding Stanley and Iris, I like educational films like How Green was my Valley and Konrack, those with John Voigt and his young African American charges in South Carolina and Danny deVito's Renaissance Man, etc. They tell an essential story of intellectual and spiritual awakening, a story that cannot often be told enough. This one is an excellent addition to the genre.
