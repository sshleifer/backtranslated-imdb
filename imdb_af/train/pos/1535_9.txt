Fortunately, as a student I have been able to watch "Diagnosis Murder" for a number of years. It is mainly about a doctor who solves murders with the help of his LAPD son, a young doctor and a pathologist. DM offers 8 seasons of exceptional entertainment. What made it different from the many other cops and was worth looking at many times was his favor and quality of writing. The main film produced good performances and Dick Van Dyke's entertainer roots shone through magic, dance and humor. The best aspects of DM were the quick pace, witty scripts and of course the tone-tapping score. Unfortunately, it is unfair compared to "Murder, she wrote". DM is by far better with more difficult puzzles to solve and more variety. Now it's gone TV is a worse place. Gone are the days of feeling, family friendly police shows. Now there are only depressing 'gritty' children.
