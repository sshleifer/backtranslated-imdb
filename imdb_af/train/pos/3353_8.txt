This film makes a strong comment on the Italian people of the time. The use of the mirrors to enhance the revelations of the characters is beautiful and I cannot call the beauty and beauty of Sophia Loren and Mastroianni. I love them both. Their way of interacting is so beautiful and of course you may be able to ask if the camera is actually there or not. The man, in his short role, is also excellently portrayed as the fascist Italian who instructs his wife and children, but in his own way a loving father. The start scenes with Hitler in Piazza Venezia with all the Italians are incredible and really put the film into history. I loved the movie and I also agree that it is funny, it is no longer known.
