But the pleasure is in the journey. <br /> <br /> I found this movie to be extremely enjoyable. Both are very easy on the eyes, the humor of the supporting role and the jokes really made me laugh a few times. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's predictable, and yes, it's a clich√©-romantic comedy. But the point is that it is a lovely story. The message of finding one true love also holds true in many ways. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is dead and the acting is well done on all parts, and over for the comic effect. The Bulgari scene is worth the weight in gold, the actress deserves honorable mention! For those who predicted to be predictable - If you want a movie with turns and turns that guess ... then you want an excitement. It's a romantic comedy. It touched my heart and made me realize that I was fortunate enough to find my true love in life, and it was already worth the effort to be on the road. <br /> <br /> Great date movie, good movie for a happy cry ...
