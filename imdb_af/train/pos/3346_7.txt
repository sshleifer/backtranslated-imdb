In the Old West there are always the men who breathe and the women who breathe. A well-known ¨town tamer ¨ Clit Tollinger (Robert Mitchum) is hired by the burghers to dismiss the gunslingers (Leo Genn, Claude Atkins, among others), Baronland's hoodlums. There he meets the blacksmith (Emile Meyer), his daughter (Karen Sharpe), her boyfriend (John Lupton), the marshal (Henry Hull) and the Saloon owner (Ted De Corsia). Clint as legal representative is appointed as deputy to bring peace and propose cartels that say: ¨ Warning, carrying guns or other weapons in the town is banned. Check all the hardware at the marshal's office ¨. Clint finds his ex-girlfriend, a local lady (Jan Sterling) in charge of the Saloon girls (Angie Dickinson, Barbara Lawrence, among them). But the city council feared the raw methods performed by Clint. At the end, the Kingpin landowner appears and tries to kill Tollinger with his own hands. <br /> <br /> This is an incredibly exciting story of a sheriff for killing just one more time. It starts out as a slow-moving Western, but follows us to surprise us with dark characters and solid plot. The story is almost grim, a pacifier comes just in time to a village to make sure its citizenship, but later the events get worse. The highlights are the saloon at Saloon and the end of the climate. Phenomenal and big role for Robert Mitchum as prisoner angel and bitter gunman, he's the whole show. Vibrant and vibrant musical score by Alex North (Spartacus, Cleopatra), Black and White Atmospheric Cinematography by Lee Garmes. The movie is amazing by Richard Wilson (Al Capone, Three in Attic) who made good Western as Invitation to gunfighter and Zane Gray episodes. Stable results for this cute Western.
