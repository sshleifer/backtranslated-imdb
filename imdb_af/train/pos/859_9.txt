It's so rare to find a movie that offers a plot that can't be figured out in every turn. A few things I can't quite understand are that you have the main female character playing the "good girl, hard worker" and eventually ending up being an anti-social risk taker. It wasn't enough to let me down, but it gave me a break. <br /> <br /> The other thing I couldn't find was the old man who was chased away by the police. the movie. I never got who he was or what his problems were. If anyone has any ideas, I'd like to hear what they might be. <br /> <br /> The movie was exciting and fun throughout and always made me guess. Worth to see.
