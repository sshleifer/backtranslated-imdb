This movie is of almost generational importance to some of us born in the early post-war years (and especially if you were born between 1946 and 1953 and loved to spend your afternoon movie at your neighborhood movie house). definitely seen it. . And the memory to see it probably stayed with you. His style is the things of a short and somehow glorious exciting moment in our growing up. <br /> <br /> It had a modern, space-age storyboard for the audiences of its time. The set was a town with a supermarket and a kiosk that would be packed for a Friday midnight. It has hot rods and rebellious youths, but in the "why can't they make us fun" rather than the disturbed, histrionic rebel-without-a-way way. All characters were identifiable to us - teenagers, parents, the old man, the doctor, the nurse, the mechanic, the boy, the puppy, even the police - were sympathetic to us. We can all relate to them <br /> <br /> It had a distinct horrible monster. It is the first victim to hear that it hurts. It hurts. And we were convinced and scared. The threat is constantly growing through the story. There are intense periods of tension, colorful effects, a wonderful edge in McQueen, and moments of humor, planned and not. It even had an almost exaggerated sadness to make the more sensitive of us feel like crying. <br /> <br /> I saw it in the summer, age 9, double doubled with "I married a monster from outer space," and was so excited about the experience of this dual feature that I returned a few times before it was gone. Everyone I knew saw it. Everyone I knew loved it.
