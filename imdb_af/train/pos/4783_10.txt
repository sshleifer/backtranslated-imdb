"The Straight Story" is a wonderful film about an elderly man named Alvin Straight, who drives his lawnmower across the country to visit his estranged, dying brother. But that's just the basic synapsis ... this movie is about so much more than that. It was Richard's Farnworth's last role before he died, and that's definitely one he'll remember. He is a stubborn old man, unlike many of the old men you and I probably know. <br /> <br /> "The Straight Story" is a movie that everyone should watch at least once in their lives. It will come down and touch a part of you, at least if you have a heart, it will.
