Road to Perdition, a movie that was unforgettable over that year. Oscars is the second work of Sam Mendes (and in his opinion the best work), a director who won Oscar for his well-known but controversial American beauty three years ago. It's a terrific movie, and at the same time sad and sad. <br /> <br /> It's a story of a relatively rich and happy family of outward appearances during difficult times of depression when Michael Sullivan, a father of two children, played by great Tom Hanks (I'm not his admirer, but should say so) is a hit for local mafia boss, played by Paul Newman. His eldest son, a thirteen-year-old boy Michael Sullivan Jr., who is perfectly played by young Tyler Hoechlin, has for many years found blissful ignorance of his father's work and of what money their family lives. Asked by his curiosity and his quest to learn the truth, he accidentally knew a witness of a murder committed by John Rooney, son of his father's boss. Such a discovery strikes an innocent soul and it has caused many events that have changed its life forever. The atmosphere of the era, all the backgrounds and decorations are perfectly created, editing and cinematography are almost flawless while the story is well written. But the lead role of the movie, the key moments and points of the movie and the key factor of movie success are difficult father relationships in bad times. They are shown as deep, strong and credible. Tom Hanks is doing great and has one of the best performances of his career in a very unusual role for him and everyone acting across the board is wonderful. In the end it is worth mentioning a very good score from Paul Newman and in the result we get an excellent job of all the people involved in making this beautiful masterpiece. I believe Road to Perdition is one of the greatest achievements of this decade and undoubtedly one of the best films of the year. <br /> <br /> My grade 10 out of 10
