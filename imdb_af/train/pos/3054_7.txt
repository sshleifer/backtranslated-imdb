"Panic" is sort of a crime comedy drama with leading William H. Macy, Donald Sutherland and Neve Campbell. Alex (played by Macy) is a man who kills people for life. But at the moment he is facing a depression and therefore he sees a therapist. That's where he meets Sarah (Neve Campbell) and he falls in love with her. He also has another problem: he wants to end family operations (the murders), but he doesn't know how to tell his father. <br /> <br /> What follows is the story of a man during his midlife crisis experiencing regular problems: falling in love with a pretty young girl and everything that goes with it. <br /> <br /> Pretty good acting performances by the cast. Macy is excellent as the depressed Alex. I had high expectations for this one and it was a good movie, but he didn't quite deliver. The story was rather flat and clich√©. <br /> <br /> 7/10
