It's one of the few movies I've watched twice in the theater. I really love this movie for his atmosphere and the story of the life of the tragic hero Esteban Trueba. He makes so many mistakes, but gets a chance for salvation. Isn't this a little comforting? <br /> <br /> When I first looked at it, I thought the movie would end after the election. I didn't know the book. So boy was I wrong when the dramatic highlight would come! I was literally swept away by the sheer power of the last half hour of the film. <br /> <br /> Many people don't really like this movie here. I can't understand that one piece. Perhaps those who read the book first, just as often with the screen adaptations of novels, are just disappointed that so many things have remained unexplained, invisible, inexplicable. But as a movie telling a pleasant story - the story of a family, the rise and fall of a man, the deep compassion of a woman, the strength of love and the madness of hatred (and conservatism) - this movie is simply beautiful! Furthermore, the soundtrack is incredibly good and the movie is also great - especially Winona Ryder and Jeremy Irons. <br /> <br /> So definitely one of those movies for which cinema was invented!
