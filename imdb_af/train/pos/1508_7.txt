This movie is good for what it is and unpretentious; But I won't be watching it twice, but I'm a Peter Cushing finalist and that's why I watched it. The best asset of this movie is: BREVITY and EFFECTIVENESS. Compared to other similar films, it does NOT carry its feet forever, as each of the four (plus one) segments under 30 minutes lasts, with the last one under 10. Good, unpleasant vibes. In the first segment, scare writer who suffers from 'writer block' moves to remote old house that inspires inspiration. He finds it even too much when he begins to visualize one of his fictitious people. Plot contrivance similar to PREMATURE BURIAL. Good use of the point-of-turn: the writer becomes mentally ill ... or (as the end shows) his trophy wife wants her lover to play with the man's phobias to make him angry and secure his estates. .You will survive the scary bimbo to enjoy the fruit of her ingenious plan? <br /> <br /> In the second segment, two long lost friends gathered in the same secluded old house, but can't help visiting a bizarre horror. museum with the wax image of the long lost love of their youth, which they once separated. From the Gothic museum ranger, they teach the woman being portrayed is a dead ax-killer ... or was she? <br /> <br /> For me, the third segment was less interesting. <br /> <br /> The fourth shows a horror movie actor - who thinks he is the best of all - sank to the depths of low budget C movies. Looking for a costume to give more credibility to his fictional vampire, he gets the right deal. This segment also does not have the solidity of the first two. <br /> <br /> It's fair, with the 2 initial segments making the most of it. Good movie, taken with a salt grain. Not the best Cushing, or Lee ... but worth watching.
