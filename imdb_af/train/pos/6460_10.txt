If the scriptwriter and director are meant to open hearts with the movie as the musician wanted to do with his music, they passed with me. Common human situations have become original, personal and immediate so that I have personally touched every situation. I believe I combined the power of music with the point of view of the person writing the movie. Without spoiling I can say that I was very moved by the film's approach to life. Didn't I actually cry out? empathy? just deep emotion? in a very long time. I'd love to find a way to show it to others. Seen it at the Seattle International Film Festival.
