CHANCES ARE is a beautiful romantic fantasy about a woman (Cybill Shepherd) whose husband (Christopher McDonald) died shortly after her death, she is pregnant. We then see the man in heaven who tells the powers that he was taken too soon and that his wife needed him. He is told he can return to earth, but not like himself. At the age of 19 we see Shepherd's daughter (Mary Stuart Masterson) who prepares to retire from college and meet a young man (Robert Downey Jr.). It is evident from her reincarnation. The movie is a bit on the predictable side. The story is about all the places you expect it to be, but it is so beautifully played by an energetic player (especially Shepherd and Downey) that you can't help but it's wrapped up in the fun Shepherd is rarely better seen, and she and Downey are supported by a talented group of character players in supporting roles. A lovely and beautiful fantasy that will delight and enchant you.
