This one tends to get through a lot of critics and Kurosawa supporters, but I thought it was great. This is an episodic multi-character study of Tokyo's poorest, living in a city literally created from garbage. Though it looks like an A-Bomb has just hit, the movie has some kind of tranquil beauty thanks to the glorious use of Technicolor. The title comes from the sound made by the crazy young man who manages an imaginary trolley through the slum. All the characters were wonderful and all the stories were staggering, but perhaps the most tragic about the man and his young son living in a deserted car. When they do not search for food, they spend their free time using their imagination to build their dream home. An emotional moving and beautiful movie.
