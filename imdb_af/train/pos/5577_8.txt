I didn't laugh so hard for a movie in a very long time. The garbage that Hollywood recently exhausted drives me up a wall! This one was definitely fresh and witty. If you look at the demographic ratings for the ratings, only a few women voted! I don't want to ruin the movie for you, but I'm sure every guy who saw it ran to their computers to judge it and gave it a bad score, why? Because the film puts men in their place, that's why. If more women vote for this movie because they are real humor value and not because it is harmful to men ... it can easily be a "7" rated movie!
