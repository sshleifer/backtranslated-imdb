This movie is nothing but a dark, eager masterpiece. I can be biased, as the Apartheid era is an area I have always felt. But I'll say it's upright with Cry Freedom and crying the beloved country. Unfortunately, I've never heard of this movie a few days ago. Inside is one of the most underrated movies of all time, probably because it was a small movie company, I have never heard of it. Eric Stoltz, one of my favorite actors anyway, is credible and dramatic. Nigel Hawthorne plays well. Don't look for humor in this movie, there is no one. It's really, cruel and fierce to the last, and for the sensitive I want to say bring a box of tissues. But movies as big as it makes you wonder, why is it that the biggest movies are often never heard?
