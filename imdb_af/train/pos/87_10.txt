This Oscar-winning short film can be among the largest of the genre. Completely without dialogue, it's a visual surprise over a young boy buying a goldfish, lovingly sitting in a bowl, then going to school, unprotected the goldfish and a window indifferent. After a while, a neighboring orange tabby came around, came through the window and headed slowly for the bowl. The fish apparently knows something and is excited. As the cat comes very close to the bowl, the fish jumps out. The cat caught the fish, dropped it back into the bowl and went out the window he had come in, just as the boy returned, not knowing what had happened. It was incredibly filmed with real animals; How Cousteau behaved in this way is remarkable. I just wish this movie is now available for people to watch; I only saw it once, in 1959 when it was originally released, but it remained unforgettable.
