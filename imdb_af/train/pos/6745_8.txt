???? A Turkish Bath order in a film noir located in New York in the 50's, it should be a hint of something! Something strangely, in all the previous remarks, did not point anyone out, but it seems to me essential for understanding this movie <br /> <br /> the Turkish bathing range: a back street at night, the entrance from a sleepy sauna, and Scalise wrapped in a sheet, to massage his thighs. Steve, the masseur of the young rough boxer (Beefcake!) -Type, and another guy, a bodyguard? Finish Dress Up. Of course, Dixon hates what he sees there and immediately gets rough. We know he has a reputation for the riot of suspects. Good policeman, but easily out of control. Why is it that he hates them so much? <br /> <br /> It may be that he hates himself. He inherited this part of himself from his father? The dark side that could lead him to the right at the end of the pavement, into the gutter? What if the dark side sneaks into a "cupboard"? Remember: when Dixon meets Scalise (3 times), the man lies on a bed, and he only has men around him for the company (the irony of the "Girls" poster trapped on the wall near his bed!). /> <br /> Scalise acts are funny: affected ways, arrogant neck in the neck, his inhaler (poppers?) hit his nose every time he speaks to Dixon. Dixon, with a vengeance, was bent on Scalise who did not understand: "I have never hated a man as you have seen. I see it almost humorous as you come to me alone." Four years jumped at me. as if I was special! Why? "Because Scalise is indeed someone special, he is the direct heir to Dixon's father:" Your dad loves me "," Your father put me in business. "He stands as Dixon's criminal brother, his dark side incarnates. And above all, he prefers the men of men. Dixon knows it well:" Who killed him (Paine)? You or one of your playmates? "Playmates! Notice how each time they meet, Dixon manhandles Scalise: he picks up the address book from his jacket, hits his face, hits him. Scalise:" I warn you not to touch me! Dixon's homophobia is obvious. Or put differently: his unspoken homosexuality. Dixon, aka Dixon's Child, is the thief's son. In response, he decided to become a policeman, but there is something about The criminal in him, a dark side: he is a violent buyer, a murderer, a liar. In addition, he is not married, he brings a dizzy blonde to his famous eatery, and then nothing else. The waitress said he didn't know how to love a woman. Dixon has a deep sense of guilt and hates himself for those reasons. "A hood and a gang like his old man will tell blood." Finally, to reach salvation, Dixon decides to sacrifice himself: if he gets his alter ego Scalise to kill him, he will freeing the debt and also releasing the girl and her father. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie brings us back to the opening sequence: Scalise is pushed into the gutter and Dixon deserves the right to walk the pavement and win the love of the woman. He is straight. <br /> <br /> The unspoken theme of the movie can be very good for a man who wants to experience a woman's love (Jean Douchet) to cover his suppressed feelings. <br /> <br /> (These notes are guilty of a lot after the movie commentary by Jean Douchet in the French DVD edited by CarlottaI
