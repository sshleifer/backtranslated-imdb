One of the best, if not the best, rock'n'roll movies ever. And it's not just indifferent fun. There were really very clever jokes in it. Of course I love the Ramones. But with all the "anarchy" and the "I hate high school" themes, the film doesn't take him too seriously, what's good about it. <br /> <br /> I only saw the movie in the spring of 1980, and I recently saw it. Since I went to high school in the late 1970s, it made me nostalgic. <br /> <br /> As I said, this movie does not take him so seriously and is not pretentious like so many other teenage money from the seventies, eighties, and nineties. And to talk about, it's not really dirty or disgusting. Only PG rated. It's hardly for a movie in this category. A great cult classic and an incredible time hairstyle.
