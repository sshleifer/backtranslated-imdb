This movie is a perfect portrayal of The Nutcracker; The dance is wonderful, the scenery in the background was excellent and I had the flowing bed. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the costumes ... I especially loved Marzipan's, the tutu was rich. The special effects were very well done (eg the tree, the bed, etc.), and I really enjoyed the rats. I love how they didn't make them scary, but cute and handsome. Except for the king, I think. <br /> <br /> If you are a thorough male, you will not enjoy it, but it is a very good movie for all ages - just not all levels of testosterone. <br /> <br /> But I have a few complaints. <br /> <br /> First, why did they have to put the Sugar Plum Fairy's partner in those terrible slippers? It would hardly make a difference if he were naked! And secondly, why did they make EARTH Culkin's outfit PINK?
