I'm ashamed to say I missed the "Mother" when it was in theaters. I saw it tonight on DVD. I gave it 10 votes, one of the few I gave here. This English independent is filmed with so much care and quality. It brought me relentlessly. The story, with a low key and pure human, is brutally honest and completely absorbed, thanks to the acting of Anne Reid, Daniel Craig and Cathryn Bradshaw. The cinematography is amazing. The score is hard-wired to the plot. The storyline is epic, brilliantly dressed by author Hanif Kureishi in everyday life. This story addresses great problems with the subtle of an impressionistic painting. And some of the big issues are very controversial, which probably explains the lack of awards despite many nominations. It's just one of my all-time favorite movies.
