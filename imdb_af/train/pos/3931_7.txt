A somewhat fictionalized biographical portrait of Abraham Lincoln's early years of director John Ford, which focuses mainly on a trial in which the young lawyer accused two brothers of murder accusation. <br /> <br /> The film presents an interesting representation of this important American figure and the film is well made, but looks somewhat incomplete without any of the great moments of its presidency or even its debates with Stephen Douglas. The obvious intention was to portray Lincoln as a young man who developed the qualities that would make him the great man he would become. But the result for me was that while admiring the depiction, it just wasn't as satisfying as I thought it could have been with a larger scale. <br /> <br /> In the role of Abraham Lincoln we have Henry Fonda who Effectively displays a quiet power. Fonda's performance includes a few gang ways and others that are fairly effective at presenting a showcase of Lincoln, especially when combined with an effective makeup and the costume that is sometimes exaggerated. <br /> <br /> The supportive cast is solid and surprisingly does not include many of Ford's regular supporting cast (sometimes referred to as his stock company), but we have Ward Bond one of the most productive character players in Hollywood. Bond appeared in more of the AFI Top 100 Movies than any other actor, both original and revised. He also appeared in 11 Best Picture Nominees. <br /> <br /> The movie has one scene that would inspire a very similar scene in 'To Kill a Mockingbird', where it would be even better if it is here, even if that scene is one of the most effective in this movie.
