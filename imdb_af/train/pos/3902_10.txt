I heard from Eddie Izzard but never saw him. I knew he was a transvestite, and when I saw him on HBO one night last night, I touched it, not knowing how my husband would react. Well, he blew us away. He's better than Robin Williams ever was. He has total control of the audience; When he dies the Englebert - no he is, routine, the audience does not know what to think at the end. God as James Mason is also an inspired touch, and his version of the Python Spanish Inquisition performed by the Church of England - "Cake of Death?" is invaluable. My jaws got in laughter at the end of the show. We sanded the TV list months later to see him again, and was fortunate to paste him the next time he went. If you get the chance to see this show, cancel everything and paste it, you won't be disappointed.
