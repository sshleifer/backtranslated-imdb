The man in the white suit is one of the great comedies Ealing studies made in the 40's and 50's. The plot of this one follows a man who finds a cloth that does not become dirty or broken. This is, of course, a major breakthrough in the world of textiles. However, this is not that easy, as the sheet will obstruct the lives of many people, including cloth manufacturers, the patchwork workforce and even an old lady who was her every week. The white suit man is a film about scientific advancement, and the way they don't always help; As the old woman at one point in the movie says, "Why can you just release scientists?" <br /> <br /> Like many Ealing comedies, this one star Sir Alec Guinness. Alec Guinness is a fantastic actor; He has the ability to lift the screen with his presence (and he does literally in this movie), but he also manages his characters in an abyss and credible manner. He is properly creepy in this movie, and he just takes the right atmosphere for his character; an intelligent and ambitious but slightly naive scientist. Along with Guinness, The Man in the White Suit, Joan Greenwood, the deep-fledged actress with Guinness in the simple divine "Heart Hearts and Coronets" and Michael Gough, a man in action, plays. of Alfred in the Batman movies. The acting in the movie isn't always nice, but it's always decent, and it fits in with the movie. <br /> <br /> The Man in the White suit is an intelligent, mind-boggling and witty comedy with a moral. The comedy is not always obvious, and it does not always work, but the film is not meant to be a movie that makes the stomach laugh, so it is forgiven. I recommend this movie, basically to everyone who is a fan of movies.
