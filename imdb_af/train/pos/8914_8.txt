I grew up in Royersford, Pa. The town where Jerry's market was. I remember my whole family going out to watch the filming. I remember a man showing the "Blob" to me and my brothers in a bucket. I would also like to share that my mother was in the movie. Her hairstyle was the same as Aneta Corsaut's and she was sick one night and they saw my mother and asked her to sit in the car with Steve Mcqueen for a few shots from behind. They paid her $ 25.00 and gave her a story to tell until she passed away last August. My mother wasn't a teenager and she was a few months of the birth of my little sister.
