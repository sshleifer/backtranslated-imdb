You will marvel at the incredibly sophisticated computer animation, and the novelty will probably not turn off at the first, second or third look, but you will be recorded by the characters who are so simple but intriguing that you can actually find yourself caring for them in an unexpected way, which may or may not make you feel a little childish because of the medium. <br /> <br /> Disney still holds the title of "Greatest Animation in the World", with "A Bug? s Life" being one of their greatest achievements. One of the innovative attachments is the wonderful "out-tasks" that are added at the end of the movie. The DVD has two sets of these outputs, where as I said to the VHS cassette, there is one varying version per band. The DVD also features Gerry's Game, which is a beautiful PIXAR card that was also shown in cinemas before the movie. <br /> <br /> Is it by far the superior insect film compared to Dreamworks? "Antz", which is fairly good in all fairness, but lacks nothing in the animation and in story development and characters. Watching the Star Voices of Both Movies, "Antz" is largely cast with big names "movie stars" with some well-known "TV" star voices, where "A Bug's Life" is just the opposite, loaded with "TV" stars with Kevin Spacey as the only exception. But the difference in quality is clear and obvious. <br /> <br /> Dreaming, however, cannot be blamed or surprised. If you go with Disney, you need to cut your work out for you. This is the kind of movie that I almost wish I had children to share. Don't think for a moment it's just a movie for kids.
