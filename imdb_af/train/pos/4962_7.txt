"The Brak Show" is good. Probably not on the same level as "Aqua Teen Hunger" or "Space Ghost Coast to Coast", but certainly it has very brilliant moments. Basically, it follows the life of Zorak and Brak who have normal lives. and going to school, living in an environment on the style of the 50 'sitcoms. The humor and animation of this show is much like "Aqua Teen Hunger" (and in one episode you can see Meatwad) with bizarre situations and strange characters. But it's good, it has funny parts. Some of the songs are wonderful, others not many, but I like this show. The funniest character is the father of Brak. (this is a man, no one knows why)
