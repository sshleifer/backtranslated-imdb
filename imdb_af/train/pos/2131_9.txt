It's a movie that gets better every time I see it. There are so many nuanced performances in this. William Tracey, as Pepi, is a delight that brings sharp comic relief. Joseph Schildkraut as Vadas, is the only "villian" in the movie, and his oily charm is well used here. Frank Morgan, lovely owner of the title shop, Mr. Matushek, and his well-known way is well used here. I especially liked Felix Bressart's performance, as Pirovitch. Very credible in every facet of his role. <br /> <br /> The two leads are equally accomplished, with Margaret Sullivan a great job of portraying a slightly desperate, neurotic but charming and attractive woman. <br /> <br /> However, this movie belongs to Jimmy Stewart. The movie is presented from its point of view, with the action surrounding it. Mr Stewart is more than the job of carrying the movie, with an incredible display that uses a wide variety of emotions. Just look at Stewart if he gets fired from his job because of a misunderstanding. He is able to transfer the shock, anger, fear and embarrassment that causes such traumatic events. In my estimation, James Stewart is without a doubt the greatest movie actor in the history of the medium. There is no one else ever caught on film that can convey what he feels to an audience. By the time he made this movie, he had most of his career ahead of him, but he was completely master of his craft. It's one of Jimmy Stewart's best movies, and also one of the loveliest, most enjoyable romantic comedies you'll find. I recommend this movie, especially for those who appreciate Stewart's work.
