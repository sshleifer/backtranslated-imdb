Author / Director / Co-Star Adam Jones is looking for good stuff. This is the idea I had after seeing his movie "Cross Eyed". Rarely does an independent film make me as good as he did. Written and masterfully directed, "Cross Eyed" keeps you engaged from start to finish. Adam Jones may not be a famous name, but he will be. If this movie had one or two "named actors", it would be a Box Office sensation. I think it's still a chance to be seen through a mainstream audience if only one filmmaker takes the time to work this movie. No matter where it ends, if you get the chance to see it, you won't be disappointed.
