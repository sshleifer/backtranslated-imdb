I only saw the Saint Strikes Back for the first time and found it very good. It was George Sanders first appearance as the Saint, replacing Louis Hayward. <br /> <br /> In this one, the Saint is sent to San Francisco to investigate a shooting at a nightclub. With the help of his expert, Inspector Fernack who came from New York, they help a daughter of a crime boss. <br /> <br /> Together with Sanders in the movie is Wendy Barrie and Jonathan Hale. <br /> Not a bad Saint movie. Appreciate to see. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 stars out of 5.
