1991 released the two best successors of all time: TERMINATOR 2: ARREST DAY and BILL & TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY. From the two, I always liked BILL & TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY a little better. TERMINATOR 2: EVERYDAY DAY is made better, but there's nothing like Bill and Ted. In addition to Chris Farley and David Spade in TOMMY BOY, it is difficult to think of a larger comic duo than Bill and Ted. They are one of a kind. <br /> <br /> Influenced by National Lampoon's O.C. and Stiggs, Bill and Ted were created by Ed Solomon and Chris Matheson, two incredibly talented writers who invented the duo while in the 1980s at a local theater in L.A. The two quickly started writing a script over two and before. BILL & TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE was born. The film, which was shot in 1987 and released in 1989, has become a great box office and an instant classic. It wasn't long before the work started on the sequel. Stephen Herek, the director of EXCELLENT ADVENTURE, was not keen to work on the successor as he regarded it as common and, unlike the first one, Peter Hewitt, who made his film debut, brought in the successor. There could not have been a better director for the job. BILL & TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY is wonderful. It is filled with its own unique style and energy that does not match. <br /> <br /> What makes 'BOGUS JOURNEY' one of the best successors ever, is while it's darker than the original, it's just as fun. It doesn't change the characters like most successors. Bill and Ted are the same lovely characters that they were in the first movie. This is because it was written by the original authors. Most successors are not written by the same authors as the first, but since BOGUS JOURNEY had the same authors, it eventually became as good as EXCELLENT ADVENTURE, if not better. Just like the first one, 'BOGUS JOURNEY' is absolutely hilarious, well written, fun, and above all, original. It's filled with spectacular special effects and fantastic comic performances by Alex Winter, Keanu Reeves and William Sadler. This is a memorable 'journey'. 10/10
