Certain DVDs own me until I just have to go out and buy. It was one of those movies. Like many here, I remember it as a child and loved it. I never knew there were scenes and musical numbers cut, so I was intrigued to see what they might be. I would agree that the "Portabellow Road" series is now a bit long (like the soccer game), but otherwise, I didn't find any harm with the remaining scenes that were put back in their respectable place. Perhaps Disney should tilt the original version (which is the restored version) on the one side with the restored version, then people can choose what they want to see. All in all, it's still an entertaining movie that still reminds some of my childhood.
