Overall, I'm not a big fan of stop-motion movies and initially, RUKA didn't catch my attention. Knowing that this film was made in the repressive Czechoslovakia during the Soviet era, the more I watched the film, the more I realized how subversive this innocent little movie was. This subtitle really made the movie come alive and it really excelled as both a work of art and a political statement. <br /> <br /> The sad movie was done without dialogue, but it's pretty clear what happened. A cute woodman makes a clay pot and has a nice time when suddenly a disturbingly animated hand appears and destroys the pot - rather it makes it into a craft of a hand. Well, the timber man tries to chase the hand time and time again and do his own thing. But over time, the hand becomes increasingly persistent and eventually the man. And by the end, the man was killed by the tedious hand and the hand, in a sign of true hypocrisy, gave the man a hero's funeral! <br /> <br /> As I said, this film is a clear attempt by the brave Jir√≠ Trnka to criticize his dominant government. Not surprisingly, although Czech loved the film and gave it critical praise, the state (ie, the hand) banned this little parable. Unfortunately, Trnka did not live to see his nation liberated a little over two decades later during the so-called "Velvet Revolution".
