Watching this movie last night on the video, I got these tents that told me this one would endure. I have the feeling that I will be watching it again and again for the coming year. <br /> <br /> It has all the timeless features you can ask in a story / movie. And although some cultural references are unclear to me, a Western viewer, at heart, is a universal story.
