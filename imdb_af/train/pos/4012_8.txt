After a few problems, Johnny Yuma arrives at his cute uncle's farm to take over daily activities, just to find out that the old man was murdered by his beautiful gold digger and the woman's evil brother. <br /> <br /> Good production values, a good performance by Mark Damon and a broadly handy packaged font combine to make it an entertaining, if not extremely deep, over-average addition to the spaghetti western genre . <br /> <br /> Coaster Rosalba Neri is one of the hottest European babies ever to enjoy. Here she is absolutely perfect as the cold user (and abuser) of poor men. <br /> <br /> Damon and Neri appear together in at least one other picture, The Devil's Wedding Night, a pretty good horror movie of special interest to those who want to see what is under Rosalba's dresses.
