Rohmer returns to his historical plays in the real story of Grace Elliot, an English woman who lived in France at the height of the French Revolution. One had always suspected that Rohmer was a conservative, but who knew he was such a red blood reactor. If you can put aside Rohmer's unashamed defense of the monarchy (and it's not an easy thing to do, as the French lower classes are portrayed as terrible louts here), it's actually an elegant, intelligent and polished movie . Instead of the money for a large film recreation of the 18th century France, Rohmer instead played the actors against obviously painted cartons. This is a blatant artificial notion, but it works in some way. And newcomer Lucy Russell manages to be sympathetic to a character that should not be.
