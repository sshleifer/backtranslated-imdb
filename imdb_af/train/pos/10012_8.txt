The Night Listener is probably not one of William's best roles, but he makes a very interesting character in a somewhat strange but very different film. I can guarantee that you have never seen this kind of movie. Some may not like the slow pacing of this movie, but I think it's the big plus of the movie. This is definitely one of the top movies released in 2006. It has an intriguing performance in a movie with a great content, dramatic feel. It's not an American movie. It's also not a predictable movie. You just feel it's a movie that has secrets that you find difficult to determine its outcome. It's not an excellent movie that has everything but hell, it's a damn good and very original movie.
