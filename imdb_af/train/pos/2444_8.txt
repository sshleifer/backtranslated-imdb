"GEORGE LOPEZ," in my opinion, is an absolute ABC classic! I didn't see every episode, but I still enjoy it. There are many episodes I enjoyed. One of them was where Amy (Sandra Bullock) walked in a moving piece of machinery. If you want to know why, you should have seen it yourself. Before I upload it, I would like to say that everyone always gave a good performance, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well designed and the writing was always very strong. Finally, although new episodes can now be seen, I strongly recommend that you catch it only if it goes well.
