Beautifully finished. Much anxiety. Friendship may not tolerate everyone, but in the end it is all that matters, or such a group of friends learn. I watched it over and over. The music is also wonderful. When Kei loses one friend, he continues until he meets Sho, an orphan who is not repelled by his true nature. In the lawless streets of Mallepa, they struggle for their own place under a melting pot of Asian races, learning that sometimes you can cost more than you are ever willing to pay. A surprise ending that grabs as much as the entire movie does. I couldn't get enough of it. Gackt and Hyde do a wonderful job of acting, proving that they are more than beautiful boys singing.
