"The Gingerbread Man is the first thriller I've ever done!" ?? Robert Altman <br /> <br /> In 1955, Charles Laughton directed "The Night of the Hunter", a ghostly piece of Southern Gothic in which Robert Mitchum plays a frightening serial killer. One of the best-known sequences of the movie consists of two children escaping from Mitchum on a rowing boat, the children rowing madly while Mitchum blows them like a monster. <br /> <br /> Seven years later, Mitchum played an equally ghostly killer in Cape Fear, another movie based in the US. That movie had a local lawyer trying to protect his family and also ended up with Mitchum who terrorized people on a boat. In 1991, Martin Scorsese, who is trying to tackle and tackle something more mainstream, again made Cape Fear, boat scene and everyone. <br /> <br /> Now we have Robert Altman's "The Gingerbread Man", another small town of Southern Gothic. Altman says he consulted the "Night of the Hunter" for inspiration and tackled such a mainstream movie purely because he wanted to spread his wings and try a popcorn photo, "but what he secretly tries to do here deconstructs the canonical movies of the Southern Gothic genre. <br /> <br /> Instead of a riot on a small boat, we get a show on a giant ship, instead of having two kids abducted We are two children who are safely returned to the police, instead of being hid from money, we have money that is readily given through a last will and testament, instead of the fair attorney of the 1961 film and the Deplorable attorney of the 1991 remake, we get a rather three-dimensional attorney in Kenneth Branagh, instead of the family rushing monster, we get the hero behind the bad guys, instead of the monster breaking into the family's houseboat , we have the hero drill the monster d of the monster's "house ship". Similarly, instead of a murderous killer, we get an innocent weirdo played by Robert Duvall. . .etc, etc. <br /> <br /> Altman goes on and off, just turns slightly slightly, pulls on the edges and does his own thing. His touch is clearest during the first half hour of the film. The film consists of an awkward space between conventional plot-driven film narration and Altman's love of overlapping dialogue, accidental narratives, cake movement and the way characters are not so much. introduced because they are just part of what is going on. <br /> <br /> Yet, despite Altman's best intentions, the film never rises above mediocrity. Altman is also bound to the "thriller-format" conventions to do a lot of damage, his style is too slow to generate tension and the movie is simply not radical enough to contrast other canonical films in the genre. "Gingerbread Man" is therefore too mainstream to work as a pure Altman movie and to Altman to work as a mainstream thriller. <br /> <br /> However, the film is not a complete waste. Robert Downey Junior, Kenneth Branagh and the usually unbearable Daryl Hannah, all turn out to be juicy. The film also has a nice atmosphere, against an approaching hurricane, and the final act contains some interesting twists and turns. While it is not the complete disaster that Scorsese's "Cape Fear" was, the role has never been something special. <br /> <br /> 7/10 ?? In the late 90's, Altman made 3 consecutive films in the American South: "Kansas City", "Gingerbread Man" and "Cookie's Fortune". Unlike the "Gingerbread Man", the "Kansas City" and "Cookie's Fortune" tackle the broader, more loose-fitting diapers that Altman was most comfortable with. <br /> <br /> "Kansas City" is the most important of these two films, its hierarchy of class, politics and crime, and the desire to radically break away from typical gangster genre frameworks will be influential on all serious 21st century film crime writers (see, for example, "The Wire"). It is said, "Cookie's Fortune", while a much lighter story might be the better picture. <br /> <br /> Note: Altman claims to be his first thriller, but he has 'Images', an artillery racket, in 1972. <br /> <br /> Worth a visit.
