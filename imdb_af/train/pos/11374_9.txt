There are some excellent comments and observations on this movie. I was delighted to note the comparisons with Fritz Lang's "M" (forget the 50-year-old apostate remake with lightweight David Wayne). The real villain is not the torture of torture (exceptionally delicate performance by Jeffery DeMunn). He takes out his sexually frustrated anger on his victims - mostly children. He's the target. The real villain is the suffocating bureaucratic Soviet system, drowning in its own corrupted incompetence. The frustration of a compromise dedicated man (Rea in his best role since "The Crying Game"), an easy pragmatism who is willing to use the system to his advantage (Sutherland always succeeds in this kind of role), hesitation, fear but determined psychiatrist (the unforgettable Max Sydow), the engaging bureaucrat of a prosecutor (brilliant Brit actor John Wood) and the quiet, supportive woman of the driven investigator (wonderful supporter, Imelda Staunton). This is a damn fine movie. The darkness and paleness are supported by the depiction of a corrupt, incompetent system that works against success. It is not necessary to double in gore drawer cut a gambling sensation, which has characterized so many recent films. Gore is present - it's a horrible story - but it adds to the portrayal of a pathologically distorted person. The success of the story is precisely this: it was acts committed by a person, a person like you or I. Wherever you and I choose to avoid our frustration reasonably, Chikatilo has exhausted his anger at the most innocent and vulnerable of us, our children. The wonderful premise of this story is shown by equally excellent role players of excellent actors. - I also notice that our Australian friend did not hold the speech and it would certainly have preferred to hear them speak in Aussie dialect. Well, bad. This fine movie probably worked for me and everyone I spoke to who saw it.
