It saw my last day at the festival, and was glad I held that extra few days. Poetic, moving, and most surprisingly, funny, in its own strange way. It is so scarce to see directors working in this style, who can find real strangeness and humor in a hyperrealistic world, without being precious or disturbing the balance. Manage both improvised, but totally controlled. I hesitate to make comparisons, because these films really consumed their influences (Cassavetes, Malick, Loach, Altman ... the usual suspects) and found their own unique style. But if you like modern directors in this tradition (Lynne Ramsay, David Gordon Greene), you're in for a real surprise. It's a great movie, and I hope more people will see it. If this movie is playing at a festival in your city, go! go! go!
