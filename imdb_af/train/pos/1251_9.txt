This documentary explores a story published in Pilger's latest book "Freedom Next Time", published in 2006. It shows the shocking expulsion of the natives of Diego Garcia, one of the Chagos islands in the Indian Ocean. <br /> <br /> The islanders are technically British citizens, as Diego Garcia is a British colony, such as Mauritius, the nearby island where the natives were wiped out. But the British government has ignored their plea to return to their homeland, as the island is now a military base for the US army. It used it as the basis for the bombing of Iraq and Afghanistan. <br /> <br /> As usual, Pilger's cover is shocking, especially as he documents the treatment and current impoverished living conditions of surviving islanders. His interviews around are excellent, and his turn from a Parliament representative where he uses the government's own information to cut him off is one of his best. <br /> <br /> Pilger also uses dramatic reconstruction to analyze a series of recent released documents that fully relieve British conspiracy to expel native people. The weaving of these footage with the interviews and the island music game increases the film's impact. <br /> <br /> It's not easy to watch, but a nation steals "is John Pilger at its best. Recommended.
