I expected it to be the same kind of shock as the previous Modesty Blaise movie, so I didn't leave it that long for so long, but I was very pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> Far from a sequence of foolish rifle battles and car / boat hunting, it was an almost thorough analysis of how a pretty girl gets as hard as nails, with no over-emphasis or over-rationalization. <br /> <br /> It is likely that the Budget Restrictions actually helped it: less time and effort was spent on finding blunt ways pretending to sting to die and more was dedicated to the movie worth looking at. Hell, the biggest rifle battle takes place - and the scene where it is heard is already better for the background noise, which adds tension - who wins? Who's dead? <br /> <br /> Alexandra Staden may not be as deadly as Monica Vitti, but little, and she certainly has every ounce of class and fire needed to make the character work - and the shape of her face, her hair and her long, slender body could be picked up directly from the cartoon chart. <br /> <br /> Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau was the perfect choice for a bad guy in the Blaise. that he made the character interesting and enjoyable to look - even fun (and I doubt I would consider taking many brutal, psychopathic killers as drinking friends). I can't think of one of Hollywood's "former waiters", who could pull the role so well. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Blaise always dies bad things, finally (there are no spoilers!) a very good thing, because all the girls who spent their time on such a disgustingly attractive and interesting hunger can now establish our ordinary Joe pragmatic.
