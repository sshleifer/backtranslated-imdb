It's a good movie. I say that some people think that this is not a true story. It doesn't matter !!, the movie is great, and all you can think of is not why a mermaid balloon ends up flying into the lake city, and instead of thinking that little daughter's wish has come true 'This means that all our peaceful dreams will come true if we trust in us and do everything in this world to make them true. The little girl (Desi - in the movie), and her mother, were the best actors I've seen long ago. Good for them, for all actors, all for the director. If anyone can tell them, please tell them: "A 25-year-old man from Romania says thank you for making this movie."
