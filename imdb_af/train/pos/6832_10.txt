Beautiful film, pure Cassavetes style. Gena Rowland gives a beautiful display of a falling actress dealing with success, aging, loneliness ... and alcoholism. She tries to escape her own subconscious ghosts, embodied by the ghost of a young girl. Accepting yourself, from human condition, though its common problems, is the real purpose of the movie. The parallel between the theater series and the film itself is mysterious: it is as if the stage has become a way out for Heroin. If all American films can only be top quality, dealing with human-level relationships at an adult level, not to infant and standardize feelings. One of the best dramas ever. 10/10.
