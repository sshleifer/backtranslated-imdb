This movie is much better than the original The Jerk. I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes humorous humor. We've included almost as many lines of this movie in our day talk as we have from Monty Python. <br /> <br /> The card game with the oboe and then with Mr. Suicide. The scene at dinner and its departure for tortoise soup. The original The Jerk was choreographed and performed. As I love Steve Martin, he seemed to have tried hard. The Jerk Too is a spoof and will be enjoyed by anyone. The Jerk Too is family-friendly, unlike the original The Jerk.
