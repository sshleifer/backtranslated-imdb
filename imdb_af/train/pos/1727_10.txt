The Wooden Horse is a very clever film about a very clever and successful escape plan worked out by British POWs during World War II. It is beautifully performed with a keen sense of humor, especially the lines expressed by the acid-tongue Leo Genn. Anthony Steele and David Tomlinson (later George Banks in Mary Poppins) are wonderful as the two heroes. The direction is firm and fast moving throughout. Highly recommended.
