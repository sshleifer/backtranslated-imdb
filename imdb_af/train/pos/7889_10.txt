The movie Freddy's death, the last nightmare is just as horrific and disturbing as every other nightmare on Elm Street, yes, it has a comedy essence about it, so have all the other movies, but how can anyone say you are not Freddy Krueger will find. scary, if you were to overcome this man in your dreams, you would not find him scary anymore with a comic creature about him, because his comedy shows he does not care to kill you because he finds it very funny, and Freddy also plays comic mind games with them, which is very disturbing in his own way, using his funny ways I think make horror movies Nightmare on Elm Street what they are today. The authors are extremely clever and make Krueger comic strips and scary Unlike Jason Vorhees, who says nothing and doesn't have the reason to really scare his victims, this movie is about as good as Freddy's white and I will Recommended to anyone with a sense of humor and by the way "Don't fall asleep!"
