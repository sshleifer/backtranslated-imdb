I'll come clean. The only reason I even came across this DVD was because Dominic Monaghan is my favorite actor. When I heard the title of the movie, I thought it would be ... otherwise, maybe not so good. <br /> <br /> But I went wrong. After reading what few reviews were out there about this short, I was actually excited to see it. I sent my copy as soon as possible and received it a few weeks later. Needless to say, I was not disappointed. <br /> <br /> The movie follows Jack, an insomnia often afflicted by conditions that cause him to doubt what the reality is and what everything is in his head. I won't throw away what's happening, but I'll tell you that the movie can be terrifying in its realism. <br /> <br /> Directing is fantastic, focusing on what is essential to the story without losing any entertainment or thoughtful moments. <br /> <br /> All in all, I give this amazing movie 9 out of 10, because I've gone far beyond what I thought might be short.
