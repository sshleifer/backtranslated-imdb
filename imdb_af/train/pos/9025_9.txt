The movie belongs to Inventor - Underdog genre. Jake Gyllenhaal, Laura Dern and Chris Cooper bring a little acting story to story with several standard elements. Well filmed, well edited, with very well maintained secondary roles. <br /> <br /> Some have declared this movie as classic American hokey. This is it and more. I agree with those who say, "The movie celebrates the excitement of youthful inspiration." <br /> <br /> The movie is a pleasant reminder that ordinary roots can be born. <br /> <br />
