I loved this movie from the start to the end. I found the director / actor's style to address me / the audience directly. <br /> <br /> What I found the most exciting and refreshing of this movie was the ignore - and therefore challenging - of gender and class stereotypes. Characteristics of the characters are portrayed as strengths, and the absence of judgment - and the characters' acceptance of themselves and each other - enabled me to embrace them and allow me to be drawn into their world. Without the sermon and with intelligence and soft and loving humor, this movie has the power to open up to new possibilities and hope for a world in which people see and accept one another as unique and precious individuals. I'm looking forward to more offers from this creative and talented director.
