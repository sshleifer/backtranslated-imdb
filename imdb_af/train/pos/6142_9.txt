Nice Disney movie with Angela Lansbury in fine shape as a middle-aged spider whose interest in witchcraft in World War II revolves around England. <br /> <br /> Lansbury was about 51 years old at the time of the film and she's just perfect for the part. She is again Jessica Fletcher, but this time it is for the benefit or children and for mother England at a time of great danger. <br /> <br /> The movie follows the adventures of Miss Price (Lansbury) and David Tomlinson as witchcraft professor to obtain some magic information. These 3 little darlings sent to live with Price to escape the London bombings are just wonderful in this enchanting movie for all of us, regardless of age. <br /> <br /> Badly, Tessie O'Shea, Roddy McDowall and Sam Jaffe are being given so little in this impressive movie. <br /> <br /> I really thought of the Ben Stiller movie, "Night at the Museum," at the end of the movie when the remains came to life to wage war with the Nazi invasion of the small british coastal village.
