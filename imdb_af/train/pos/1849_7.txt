"Antwone Fisher" tells of a young black US Navy-designated man and a product of child abuse and neglect (Luke) whose hostility towards others has caused him to find the basic shrinkage (Washington), leading to introspection, self-evaluation and a return to its roots. Pat, purified and sentimental, "Antwone Fisher" is a solid feel-good movie about the reconciliation of the past's regret and closure. Good old Hollywood style entertainment family appreciates entertainment with just a hint of wheat. (B)
