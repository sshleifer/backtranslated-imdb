It's not Bela Lagosi's best movie, but it has a good old style approach for about 40 horror. <br /> <br /> Brides fall dead on the altar like flies. I think I'll postpone the wedding until the enemy is caught, but it's a horror movie, so I think people are ignoring the danger for some reason. Anyway, Lagosi is a crazy doctor, who needs young female blood to keep his aging, sick woman healthy and happy. He always evokes the Keystone Cops by hiding the bodies in a hearse (which would think to look like a corpse in a hearse?), And the brides just keep getting zaps. <br /> <br /> No movie like it would complete without a Lois Lane-type female reporter who wants to catch the criminal on her own. Good to fix crime, bad to keep her mouth at all wrong times, guess who's choosing Lagosi for his next intended victim. I love the "haunted house" little where Lois Lane is stranded by a thunderstorm as a guest at Lagosi's sinister home. Hidden corridors, a vampire-like woman, an evil dwarf Igor assistant, and so on. Good things. <br /> <br /> Well done, keep moving the movie, and the story loosens it in a typical but satisfying way. If you like old horror movies, this one is worth a watch.
