House of Games is game binding. It is so nice to see movies from time to time that are perfect tens. There are a few movies I've seen that can grab you so quickly. From the opening scene, this movie just gets you. <br /> <br /> I'm trying very hard not to give away too much to those who haven't seen it yet, but there will be some spoilers. Read on if you don't want to know. <br /> <br /> I'd say House of Games is not just a great movie, but it's the best movie about artists I've ever seen. From the moment the movie is over, it is played again. <br /> <br /> Lindsay Crouse as Margaret Ford is simply perfection. From her ways to the clash of her voice, she immediately became involved. Joe Mantegna was also wonderful. The dialogue in this movie has an unprecedented, almost indescribable quality and these two people communicate as much in a look as they do with their voices. I also loved how the movie was filmed, in that grainy, surreal way, it fit perfectly and helped to make the movie what it was. <br /> <br /> There were some movies I saw and loved that it reminded me to include The Grifters and The usual Suspects, but really, House of Games is totally different. Margaret and Mike are two of the most absorbent characters I've seen on the big screen. They not only have chemistry that is strong and tangible from the moment they meet, but the build-up that starts from the moment their eyes are electrifying on each other. You know something is going to happen, but you have no idea what. And just when you think you've guessed what the "something" is, you realize you didn't even scratch the surface. <br /> <br /> House of Games is one of those movies that can be slapped. in a certain genre of movie type, but is essentially a film about human nature. The character study is not just about the mind of the artist, but also the victim. As the movie moves and gets to know us more and more of the main characters, we are not just learning what they are saying, but how they say it. It is a wonderful character study and is flawless in the way it comes to conclusion. <br /> <br /> Finally, I want to arrange it 10 out of 10, call it (although not my absolute favorite movie, pretty high on the list), definitely outstanding and will go so far to say that is one of the best character studies, and contains some of the best "turns" I've ever seen. Although I like all kinds and genres of movies, it really is not much better when it comes to the movie of the human psyche. See this movie.
