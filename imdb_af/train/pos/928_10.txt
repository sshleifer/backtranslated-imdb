I watched so much from the series that I could watch on television, but unfortunately I started a job that had my working night. I managed to record some recordings of this, and of course I bought the recently published DVD of the full series. Looking at the DVD, you can see that the animation was first smashed, but they took a fair number of errors after the pilot had finished. The voices are well-suited to the characters, and the writing is excellent. It is quite refreshing to see that the animation gets back to the roots by resetting adult themes. Thing is, with the way in which society came in the last century, today you need to take more stand to recognize it as an adult-oriented show. The characters have many realistic personalities and are placed in parallel situations that we often experience in real life. This is your typical sitcom in that respect, but the humor is more like what you would expect from last night's television, like a speech show or Saturday night Live ... back when SNL was actually funny. Good work, Dreamworks. Perhaps you should work with one of the more liberal networks to continue this series ... and also improve the merchandise marketing for the series to help afford the high cost. However, it is a challenge to do this for an adult nature painting. Hmm ...
