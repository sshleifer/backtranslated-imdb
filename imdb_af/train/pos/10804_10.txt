Stuck in a hotel in Kuwait, I happily switched to the channel that shows it at the beginning. The first Pachelbel cannon brought a lump in my throat, then the eye of a Tiger Moth (who flew my grandfather, my dad and I all) created a slight moisture around the eyes and Crowe's name gave me completely chopped. I was captivated by this movie, Crowe's performance (again), the subject (and yes, what debt our guilt), how various issues were addressed and treated, the flying rows (my dad also flew Avro Ansons), the story - and, as another contributor pointed out, Crowe's recitation of High Flight. I won't spoil the movie for everyone, but as an ex-army officer deployed in a few wars and as a private pilot, I cried a few times a few times. Buy it, rent it, load it, beg, borrow or steal it - but watch it. <br /> <br /> PS Did I play a Bristol Blenheim (in yellow training colors) on the ground? Looks like a twin-engine twin -303 Brownings aircraft in a dorsal turret.
