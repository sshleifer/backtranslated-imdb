Nine out of ten may seem like a high point to go straight to the video sci-fi movie devastated by the US cash office and critically criticized as the poorest movie of Kurt Russell's career. <br /> <br /> I have my reasons. <br /> <br /> First, if you read negative reviews of this movie, they usually start with the type of Russell's interpretation of Todd, the one-day soldier. I'm also going to start here, with my surprising statement that it might be the best piece of acting I saw Russell pulling off. Todd is an emotional cripple and suffers from intense PTSD - this movie written before the phenomenon is so widely recognized as it is now. <br /> <br /> The portrayal is on the point. Todd is withdrawn, priceless and lonely. He suffers from irrational anxiety - tackled at a chorus of training that teaches him to analyze every move and interaction with another person for signs of betrayal and danger. His hyperfocus brings an inability to grasp the larger continuum that goes into the tasks he has given to do - there is a scene where he cuts himself, cuts roots and still works untouched, does not cut or clean blood. Many interpret this as a sign of its physical toughness and focus on the job at hand, but it is also a sign that it simply performs the requested task through rot. He does not understand the relationship between the vegetables he prepares and the food that will be. <br /> <br /> Todd's dialogue is spartan to say the least. The two great talk shows he gets are central to the plot of the movie and both underline the dark nature of his existence. Fear and Discipline are told to us. Always. Fear of stopping him from a hyper warning condition where the smallest detail will not pass him, and keep him ready to respond to a knife edge. Discipline to hold him by his fear, to overcome it and to act tactically. The conclusion is that he doesn't have time to think and afford feelings. Many viewers have different interpretations of his reaction to the hug of Nielsen's Sandra - but I believe you should interpret it from the perspective of a person who has only the experience of embrace in the fight - the tremor represents him Battle / Flight Institutions Responding to the Fear of Wrestling is Limiting its Movement and Vision - Fear and Discipline indeed. <br /> <br /> Then there is the sub-text of his abandonment (Twice in fact) - so representative of the way our society tends to throw infantrymen on the garbage dump of society when they have served their terms. 40% of the unemployed are ex-military in our world, in HIS it can only be worse. Russell quickly took up the mace of Mace's responsibility to his wife and child - desperately needed a mission, even one with such a high probability of his death. <br /> <br /> There is also the military subtext - the conflict between Busey's Church and HQ's hotshot, Mekum. Mekum's new men are faster, stronger, more accurate and aggressive. Any one of them can beat Todd in the ground - but it's not about the tools you have, that's how you use it. A stimulated Todd who gives the freedom to exercise his initiative and without the stunned effect of perceived superiority, uses ambush tactics and messy tricks to lower a swathe through the new unit - sent without support, coverage or exploration . It is a reminder that military might not be able to make a failure in leadership. <br /> <br /> There are many other subtle themes. When shooting a movie and writing so little, it leaves a lot of white space for your own interpretations to make root. See Soldier with an open mind and see what it teaches you.
