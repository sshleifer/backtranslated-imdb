I know the snobs of the movie sniff. But if you're looking for a surprisingly fun ride through the B movie jungle, try "Jake Speed". <br /> <br /> A bit thin at times, but its one-liners and the place more than make up for it. John Hurt (God loves him) seems to be doing his part as the ultra-evil white slave. The nemesis of Crawfords, Jake Speed. He adds a dimension to the movie that can only offer a pro like Hurt. Crawford and Dennis Christopher (Jakes sidekick) are a good team, although you wonder why they both put together. Yet, Crawford and Christopher have a team that is just as much fun if you can come to yourself for a moment, you can find yourself again as a child in the situations and inherent tensions they offer. The lovely Karen Kopins does a good job as the girl in distress who is more concerned about the motives of her savior than her evil one. <br /> <br /> I have another movie that is so much fun without preaching, or cheating the movie by trying too hard. Not every movie should be the latest "Citizen Kane". And trust me, Wells was an original. So we can remember that sometimes movies are fun. Not social commentary or attempting to swing an audience politically. But just for the pure fun to be alive and live in a time when our hero lives in a celluloid dimension.
