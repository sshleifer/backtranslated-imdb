If you didn't see Eva Longoria from the TV show "Desperate House Wives", don't miss out. Eva will be one of the biggest Latina stars and you will soon see her in the theaters. It was Eva's first movie and she did a fantastic job. She was 24 when she shot it, and then looked hot. Regarding this low budget film, it's pretty good for the first time director, who has released another movie, "Juarez, Mexico" currently playing at various film festivals in the United States. In fact, it seems that it may have some limited release from some news. What would be nice to see is a "Snitch'2" with a higher budget.
