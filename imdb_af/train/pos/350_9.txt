I wanted to see Valentine since I saw that Denise Richards and Marley Shelton were in it because they have ever played in my favorite movies. When I looked at Valentine, I was amazed at how big the story line was. It kills me to see that it has a low rating because it was not terrible at all. The actors and actresses played the parts wonderfully and the way it ended was so brilliant and clever. Some scenes were a bit unbelievable and or poor, and I admit on a few small parts that it was just a little boring, but overall it was constantly entertaining and exciting. It has a thought-turning story line that made you guess the whole way through and it doesn't earn all the crap it gets. I recommend watching this movie anytime, but especially on Valentine's Day because it's sure to give you a lot of chills. Oh, and don't even pay attention to the trailer OR rating, please, don't ...
