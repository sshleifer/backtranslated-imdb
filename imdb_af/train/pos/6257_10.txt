This documentary by Marian Cooper is absolutely wonderful. I saw it tonight on Turner Classic Movie channel. I think I will see if I can order a copy of it on DVD. The movie material does not look all vague and lean as you might think of 1925 B&W silver film. In 1925 in Iran, the nomadic tribesmen left the desert in the documentary, crossing a raging river, men, women, children, animals ... Then and across a snow-capped mountain pass all Kaalvoet. It is sinking or swimming and climbing or dying. Looking for grass for their animals. They have cows, goats, dogs, horses, mules. In one scene a man has a mule, which is too sick to climb the mountain. The children in the documentary all look happy and healthy. They had such a hard life. I wonder if the nomadic tribes of Iran are still alive. Appreciate the modern life in the USA.
