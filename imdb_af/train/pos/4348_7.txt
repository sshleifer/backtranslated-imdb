Paul Reiser steps away from the upbeat comedy spotlight to write a warm humorous and gentle tear story about family - what we see and what we don't see, what we expect and what we surprise. The thing about my peoples does not set new standards for film, but it is a fine little story that is well told that we are reminiscent of the meaningful connections that the family represents. <br /> <br /> Sam Kleinman (Peter Falk) was a work colleague, and sometimes has his wife, Muriel (Olympia Dukakis), his daughters (Mackenzie Connolly and Lydia Jordan) and his son Ben (Paul Reiser) printed the background. One day, Muriel left a note that she left after years of marriage! Her daughters, along with Ben's wife, Rachel (Elizabeth Perkins), immediately began their search for her whereabouts. They leave the confusion back and forth and upset Sam to sort things out on a road trip with son Ben. The road trip becomes a time for the two men to learn who are each other and what they each mean for their status as father and son and as family members. Sam relaxes for the first time in his life and presents the trendy Ben to the fun and delicacy. The journey ends with a call about the stay of Muriel and why she is gone and the regrouping of the wiser family is drawing the hot end of the story. Everything is not what it seems: it is better and, well, different. <br /> <br /> Falk and Reiser play each other the benefits they are, but in many ways the movie has to the short moments when Olympia Dukakis is on the screen, reminding us that she is one of our strongest matriarchs on film is. Worth watching. Grady Harp
