Easily the biggest low budget horror movie of all time. I only saw the movie when I was about nine years old, and I have to say that it scares hell out of me. Now that I've all grown up, I see this movie for what it really is ... a work of genius. Everyone, or at least everyone with any taste, dreamed that a snowman was going to kill people, even if they didn't recognize it. I always found something really scary about snowmen, of course, for a horror junkie like myself, thismovie was a dream come true. Some people say that this movie is stupid or otherwise nothing of any intelligence. It's a movie about a serial killer snowman, what did you expect? Anyone who has given this film a low score is of course too strong to sit back and have a good laugh on stupid one-liners and cheap gore. I love this movie for what it is, a comedy, and increasing to the film industry and making a serious horror about a killer snowman (which unfortunately seems impossible), I will always close this great piece of Indian horror love my heart. .
