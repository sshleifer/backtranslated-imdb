First of all, I just want to film this movie more than any of the recent crap says that Hollywood boiled out of its bowels. McBain is a true action movie with more violence than most viewers can handle. It has all the classic elements of the action film of the late 80's / early 90's. The random, gratuitous acts of violence (ie when Walken and the crew are going to confront the drug dealers to get money, are just turned up and murdered rather than having them live and just taking their money), sobbing necks, the guys on fire, the guys blown away from buildings and, of course, the guys on fire, are blown off buildings. Walken is at its best in this photo that delivers memorable lines like: "Let's sit down .......... on the deck." and others who buy this movie a top of the clearence rack at the local video store. If you have a bloodlust for unnecessary random acts of violence, rent this movie today and satisfy your thirst.
