In this movie, the year 2022 looks much like the seventies. It's amusing at first, but soon the viewer sees how different that decadent futuristic world is in spite of its appearance, how many things we take for granted cannot be available. <br /> <br /> Characters often vary in a strange way, without tact or manners or respect. I believe it is intentional, not bad. After all that testifies to the social changes in the 60s and 70s, it can be assumed that by 2022 such an overpopulated city's inhabitants behave in this way. <br /> <br /> I didn't have most of the action scenes, apart from the death of the priest: too cheap even for the seventies. The plot is not too polished. But the great scenes and ideas - such as the death of Sol, the way rioters and corpses are tackled, the "furniture" - heavier than the shortcomings of this film. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10.
