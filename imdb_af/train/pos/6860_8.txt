Psychotic Transsexual Bobbi kills the patient (Angie Dickinson) from a prominent doctor (Michael Caine) and then follows the high prostitute (Nancy Allen) who caught a look at Bobbi in the elevator. Liz (Allen) suspects the crime and teams with the patient's son (Keith Gordon) to catch the killer. <br /> <br /> It can be summed up in a few words: it's very sexy (Dickinson and Allen look good), it's very bloody - with the kind of gore usually reserved for spectacular movies, and the boy is good made. Author / director De Palma's script is OK, but it really takes a backdrop to the man's film ability. It is very successful at a visceral level and I actually get involved / interested with these characters. I can fly the standard De Palma home to Hitchcock - at least one of the Master's photos. <br /> <br /> And above all, it has a professional and credible role. <br /> <br /> It was De Palma's third film with former wife Nancy Allen (after "Carrie" and "Home Movies".) <br /> <br /> Incidentally, dancer-turn actress was Rachel Ticotin one of the production assistants. There is a little trivia for you. <br /> <br /> I don't think a thriller can be classic and bloody at the same time, but this photo pulls it off. <br /> <br /> One of the best things about this is a typical striking Pino Donaggio music score. <br /> <br /> 8/10
