Once in a castle ...... Two little girls play in the castle of the garden. They are sisters. A blonde girl (Kitty) and a dark head (Evelyn). Evelyn steals Kitty's doll. Kitty strives for Evelyn. Through long corridors, they read the room where their grandfather, sitting on an armchair, read the newspaper. Kitty complains about Evelyn, while Evelyn is interested in a picture hanging on the wall. Evelyn repeatedly says: "I am the red lady and Kitty is the black lady". Evelyn suddenly grabbed a dagger lying close and stabbed Kitty's doll and then cut her head (the doll). A fight occurs. And Evelyn uses almost the dagger against Kitty. Entering the grandfather and avoiding the worst. <br /> <br /> Later, their grandfather told them the legend related to the picture hanging on the wall in front of them, in which a black-dressed woman stabbed a lady a Red lady and a black lady lived in the same castle. They were sisters and hated each other. One of the jealous reasons was that the black woman entered the night. The red lady's room stabbed her seven times. One year later, the red woman released her grave. She killed six innocent people, and her seventh victim was the black lady. Every hundred years, the events repeat themselves in this castle and a red lady kills six innocent victims before killing the black lady herself. <br /> <br /> The grandfather ends his story by saying that, according to legend, the red queen must come back sixteen years and kill seven times. But he assured them that it was just an old legend. <br /> <br /> Passing sixteen years… <br /> <br /> This is the beginning of the movie. There are many twists and turns in the movie. It's better for you to forget logic (if you really analyze it, don't make sense of the story) and just follow the movie with its amazing colors, the beautiful women, the clothes, the tasteful decor, the lighting effects and the beautiful soundtrack . <br /> <br /> Enjoy Barbara Bouchet, Sybil Danning, Marina Malfatti, Pia Giancaro, among others goddesses. There is a nude by Sybil Danning lying on a bench that has something to dream about. And don't forget: The lady in red is dead seven times! <br /> <br /> Watching La Dama Rossa also watch "La Notte che Evelyn uscì dalla Tomba".
