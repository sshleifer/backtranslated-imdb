I enjoyed watching Cliffhanger, at the beginning when that woman (Sarah) was scared when she slipped, I thought it was a scary scene because I would think that when you see that, your nerves in your body come to you because It makes you scared and your heart beats faster. I liked watching Cliffhanger, and I think Silvestar Stallone is a good actor and I think he will be known as Rambo and Rocky.
