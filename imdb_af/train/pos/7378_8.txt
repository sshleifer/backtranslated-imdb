After watching this movie on Sundance last night, I realized that many of Nakata's style was first made in this movie. Here we have many of the same elements of the RINGU series, especially the idea that the media is the source of the supernatural. Instead of the cursed videotape, we instead have a ghost studio and weird images that appear on film. In fact, the strange images appearing on film immediately bring the cursed videotape into RINGU's mind. The only thing missing was the obsession with water running through Nakata's later films. The final scenes are pretty cold, with a wink to Murnau, opening the door and entering the ghost into the room, reminding me immediately <br /> <br /> NOSFERATU. A cold movie that will make you think twice about a catwalk.
