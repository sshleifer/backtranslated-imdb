The key to the 40-year-old Virgin is not only that Andy Stitzer is a 40-year-old virgin, but rather the way Steve Carell introduced him. In a genre of crass "comedy" typified by its lack of humor and engaging characters, the 40-year-old Virgin offers a colorful cast and an intelligent, sincere writing that does not use its main character as the stocking end. of cruel jokes. The fact that Andy is still forty years old is not so much a joke, because it is a curiosity. <br /> <br /> Carell, a veteran of Team Ferrell in Anchorman and an old-day guide cast, uses the concept of the film to expand his character? we understand how Andy is the way he is. It's the little things this movie does. When Andy's co-worker at an electronic store asks him what he did this weekend, Andy describes his failed attempts to cook. When Andy drives his bike to work, he calls his turn. He doesn't just decorate his house with action figures? He paints them and talks to them and reveals that some of the many elders have belonged to him since childhood. A lower comedy will not even begin to focus on all these things. <br /> <br /> The plot is pretty simplistic ?? Andy's co-workers find out he never had sex and they make it a personal quest from them to get him into bed with a woman. It's a childish idea and the film doesn't try to hide its youthfulness. <br /> <br /> Andy's friends are complementary to his neurotic nature: David (Paul Rudd) broke his girlfriend two years ago, but is still obsessive with her, Jay (Romany Malco) is a female ladies and Cal (Seth Rogen) is a tattooed sexaholic. Their efforts to get Andy in the bag many times, and each time make Andy feel less and less optimistic. <br /> <br /> Finally Andy meets single-man Trish (played by Catherine Keener) and much to the crisis of his distressing friends who claim mothers are not worth it, he falls in love with her. They start a relationship and agree to have twenty days of sex ?? Trish is unaware that Andy is still a virgin. <br /> <br /> The 40-year-old was run by Judd Apatow, the man who made Anchorman and The Cable Guy. He started the shorter TV show. Freaks and Geeks. Apatow is known for his unique sense of humor, and the writing ?? co-written by Carell ?? offers a lot. <br /> <br /> In the end, however, the most interesting and (indeed surprising) aspect of the 40-year-old virgin is his maturity. By now you are probably well aware that the film has received glowing reviews from critics and I was even surprised at the warm reception. But after watching the movie, it's easy to understand why. We love Andy. We care about him. He's not just a cardboard cutout sex comedy clich√© ?? He is a true, living, breathing person. Its neurotic features combine the best Woody Allen with childish naivety. His friends are not unlikely, and his romance is noisy and bittersweet. It agrees with the audience. <br /> <br /> Although it is far from a perfect movie and certainly contains a little bit of crude induction and sexual humor, it does not interfere to the extent that other genre entries may have. because we love the people on the screen. The best sex comedies work this way ?? from risky business to American tart? And this is the big difference between something like the 40-year-old virgin and 40 days and 40 nights.
