If you're looking for a Hollywood action-packed child with the common bad language and violence, it might not be the movie to sit down. If, on the other hand, you are interested in seeing a movie with your children that actually has values, such as showing the importance of friendship and truth, it is the movie to watch. Look at the program guide, which is, of course, what millions of other viewers have found. Not many low-budget independent films have ever been broadcast so much. Atlas not. The movie is really funny and warm-hearted and shows some beautiful places masterfully captured by the sharp eye of the obviously brilliant movie maker Suki Medencevic. Even if you are interested in watching a muscular fellow, the ladies can get an eye out. Let's support those who make good children's movies and buy their videos and watch their products on TV. enjoy
