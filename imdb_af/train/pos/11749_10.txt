Eventually we get a TV show where we see the acting talent! Episode 1 was excellent! The writing gave us a little more than usual, yes, there was still the "I'm not your dad - I'm your father and you also cheated!" garbage, but the writing allowed the actors to really feel and live those real moments, rather than showing us how so many TV soaps would feel. <br /> <br /> The camera work also gave us a little more than usual, but there were no boring shots of repeated angles for hours, but there were no unnecessary 'shots within shots or handcuffs' around a "artistic" edge has given us what we needed to see and beautiful scenery too! <br /> <br /> Nothing was too dramatic or melodramatic. They were real people in a real place dealing with real-life situations, the show lacked nothing in drama and was quite relevant. It was such a relief to be exposed to real actors and so nice to show our country how talented our actors can be when they get a real script, a real opportunity! Thanks Tony Tilse, Sam Miller, channel ten and all throw and crew wonderful work !! please continue with what you do, your efforts are greatly appreciated and do not stay unnoticed!
