Like many of you, I'm a big fan of the right thing - the 1940s noir movies - but Red Rock West was a great surprise to all of us who long for the past. The term "neo-noir" has been used so often in the past ten years because it has lost its meaning and its impact. John Dahl's film, on the other hand, is really deserved to be described as such. The casting is perfect everywhere and would feel at home with Tay Garnett or Jacques Tourneur. The plot is so firm that you are addicted within the first fifteen minutes. James M. Cain would appreciate it. Many contemporary films make me wonder why they don't make them as they used to, and I'm not even that old. Movies like Red Rock West give us hope for the future as we pay tribute to the past.
