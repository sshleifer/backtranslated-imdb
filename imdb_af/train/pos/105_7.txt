Gotta start with Ed Furlong on this one. You have to. God blesses this child. $ 5 dollars says the character he plays in this movie is what he really likes in real life. He has a one-liner or two that makes me sniff because of the subtle humor in the screenplay. You know all the trials this man has done in recent years and it doesn't even look like Furlong is even acting. Maybe that's why his performance was good. Same with Madsen. You think, "I'm sure this man is really in the real life." Should Madsen even act? Just natural. Vosloo obviously acted on the mummy guy. I think the biggest surprise for this movie was Jordana Spiro's performance. Her reactions are spot-on in this movie. I struggled if she was hot or not, but realized I would just like to see her. <br /> <br /> Not a big fan of shoot'em out / hostage type movies. But what I'm a fan of is movies with lots of twists and turns trying to guess you. It's not just your standard robbers taking over a bank, they are killing hostages, and the good guys are finally winning some kind of movie. The coils are coming ... and coming. <br /> <br /> The cafe scenes work best with the handheld camera, to show how it's really there. Not painted a little. Think like Bourne Ultimatum "lite" style on some screens in the cafe. <br /> <br /> And for those Bo Bice fanatics out there, actor Curtis Wayne (who plays Karl) will make you a double task. These guys are twins. <br /> <br /> Looking at me, I wondered why some of the actors had offshore accents and what they did in this small town. In the end, it felt that these people had smuggled things into other countries / states so they could have these accents. But more is revealed in the bonus features of how some of the producers wanted to make this movie for international audiences with some of their stars we might not have heard. And some of them are hot. Moncia Dean? Must I say more.
