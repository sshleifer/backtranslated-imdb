I only saw this version of "A Christmas Carol" when it first appeared on television. I actually expected to see the movie when it was advertised and it met more than my expectations. I bought the DVD now and plan to watch it every year. With the exception of "This is a wonderful life", I consider this version of "A Christmas Carol" one of the best Christmas movies ever made. George C. Scott is excellent and a great roll under the direction of Roger Rees surround him! Scott proves once again that he is one of the best actors of our time. Scott has the artistic talent and acting ability to play any role and keep the character unique to himself. How can anyone be remembered as both Patton and Scrooge? Scott does it so easily. The direction is wonderful with the fine sets, costumes and music that give the movie a special feel about the time, place and era depicted. You will simply love this movie and place it under your favorites to watch the holiday season.
