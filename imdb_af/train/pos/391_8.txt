"Zu: The warriors of the magical mountain" was and is an impressive classic! You never guessed it was made in 1983. Tsui Hark's use of special effects was very creative and inventive. (He did it in Chinese Ghost Story trilogy and later productions.) Even now, it can measure on other movies in this genre. "Legend of Zu" is connected to "Zu" warriors of the magical mountain! It is not necessary to see this movie to understand the plot of this one. The plot is a bit difficult to follow. But to be honest doesn't mean it doesn't matter. It's all about the action and adventure! I always wondered what Tsui Hark would do if he got his hands on CGI. Now we know he made this movie. Maybe it's too much sometimes, but the overall result is so beautiful that I won't be criticized for it. There is so much happening on the screen, you simply won't believe it! I think it's a pity that this movie is not shown in theaters here in Holland. The movie screams for screen time in theaters! This movie can easily beat huge Hollywood productions such as 'Superman Returns' or Xmen 3. The only thing I must mention is the lack of humor! In most of the Tsui Harks movies, he combines drama, fantasy, martial arts and humor. Somehow, this movie is missing. Again, I'm not going to be picky. "Legend of Zu" delivers on the action front with the most beautiful special effects you will see. A true classic!
