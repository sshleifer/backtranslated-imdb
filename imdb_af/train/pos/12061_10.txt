Every time in the wonderful world of horror, diamonds are made, and one is completely amazed by its shiny glare. It's no less than a diamond !! It's a movie of honesty, cold anticipation and dark atmosphere, and I think it's safe to say, one of my favorite horror movies of all time! And, of course, it probably contains the simplest, flat out, terrifying sequence in the entire horror history! Every time I see the movie and it comes to the point where you know it will inevitably happen, I try to remember exactly when I will be frightened out of my mind, but it will never happen; I never get it right, and I find myself as terror as the first time I saw it !! Now it has to be said to scare such a horrible horror fan, it is nothing less than pure perfection. Unlike the Americans, the British know their subtleties, they are proud of the art of acting, they need no special effect to convey atmosphere, they rely on the power of the powerful story and the creepiness (in this case) of suggestions and anticipation. Every single element is impeccable, of the pieces, the play, the story, the threatening atmosphere. Pauline Moran can make the devil decide, that's for sure! As a final note, if you do not like this piece of madness for some demented reasons, you honestly do not know what horror is, and frankly it does not deserve to know it. Thank you!
