I only saw this movie on HBO, and it was really good ... a tragic love story indeed! I appreciated the fact that the man in the heart of the story lost the use of his legs in an accident. It is rare to see a love story involving someone who is physically disabled. The love that developed between that character and the woman who comes to life has nicely depicted how I think that love can heal someone's heart. Laura Leighton ... all 27 when she made this movie ... was great if the woman so full of life could revive her heart. Unfortunately, as his family is rich and not her, "problems" develop. <br /> <br /> This is several times more on HBO this month.
