As I understand it, the Chinese, the Chinese, took over Hong Kong. 3 Hong Kong movies kind of disappear. At least until now, and what an amazing movie this is. I knew it was a rough crime drama, but I was the first cat. 3 I recently bought it, I wasn't sure what to expect. <br /> <br /> A Cambodian hit goes to Hong Kong to knock the woman off a judge, who is also a lawyer. . The judge made arrangements for the hit because she divorced the judge and threatened to take all his money. It's all known within the first ten minutes, so nothing is given away. After the hit, the police find the hit very fast, but in the attempt to arrest him, several police officers and civilians are killed. He kidnapped the police and now the race to catch the man before escaping to Cambodia. It's a movie that never stops, and hardly gives the viewer a chance to breathe. Yes, it is very violent and intense, many police are being killed, as the hit is very difficult to find and take down when they seek him. Along the way, the hit tries to hide in a spill, a woman finds rape and abuse by someone. He helps her and saves her from the guy, and she persuades him to go with him in his escape. I loved this movie, it's like a roller coaster just moving and moving at high speed, like one incident leading to another, and sometimes the police are just as bad or worse than the hit. The acting is exceptionally good, and the location filming and photography is breathtaking at the moment. There is no resurrection in this movie, not even the very incredible end. The end is almost incredible, and also an appropriate end to all the action and violence. Yes, violence is sometimes brutal, but it is a very insignificant crime drama, which turns off your socks. "Dog Eat Dog" definitely needs a wider distribution, including an R1 release. Great movie, highly recommended.
