I don't know what the previous reviewer looks like, but I think that's what reviews are, personal taste. Missing in this movie was the depth, a very deep film, very low emotion, which influenced. Undercurrent of withheld love due to submission to social beliefs, taboo of times and classes, racial relationships not in a very good state of equality, guilt, longing, hatred, confusion, very dark emotional I thought under the skin, you has a flowing movie, not slow as before, fixes yourself on the flow of the movie, the emotions will show themselves, characters reveal their mistakes, their nasty inside, excellent and actually very cruel!
