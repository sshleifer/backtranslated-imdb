With the current trend of brutal humor, this film is the grandfather of them all. While some of the humor is dated, every shit will shock, repulse or make you laugh aloud. Most memorable is the comments of the sexes and of course the VD commercial. It doesn't always work, but pays off when it does. I give it a 7.
