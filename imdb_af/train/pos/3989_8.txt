"The Mother" tells of a recent widow of the 60-year-old mother of two adult children (Reid) who, on the heels of her husband's death, awakens her from a sleeping life, as she has a relationship with " a young carpenter who is also her daughter's married lover. The film lives on the quiet passive mother, her confusing relationship with her grown-up son and daughter, the silent needs she tries to grieve in bed with her young lover, and the twists and turns that arise from it. A somewhat antiseptic drama with rumbling psychodramatic downstream paws, "The Mother", offers an excellent work to deal with uncomfortable problems realistically, without avoiding enjoyable sensation. Will play best with more mature audiences, possibly women, who can better empathize with the central character, her needs and issues. (B +)
