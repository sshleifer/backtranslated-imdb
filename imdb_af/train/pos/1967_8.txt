I don't understand why the reviews of this movie are so universally bad, unless I'm just off my rocker. I found it sick, brilliant, twisted and psychologically sophisticated. You won't get deeper into the minds of a criminal psychopath in a Hollywood movie than that. It has low in low, nuanced plays by Stone, and a plot that will make you guess even after it's over. People need to know that Sharon Stone is 48, and Michael Douglas is not in this one. I predict this movie will be a big hit on DVD as soon as people see it and stop paying attention to the brave professional judges being postponed. Give it a shot, you'll be glad you did it!
