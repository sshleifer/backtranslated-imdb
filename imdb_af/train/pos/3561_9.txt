At least something is good about Damon Runyon's wrong attempt to sentimentate the Mafia. "Guys and Dolls", the seemingly indestructible theater music, was captured in 1955 by Joseph L. Mankiewicz ("All About Eve") in a film in a colorful, enjoyable film featuring an all-cast film including Vivian Blaine ( of the original Broadway show), Jean Simmons (whose character has a strange deal with Audrey Hepburn in the Roman holiday) and two of the very best great men, Frank Sinatra and Marlon Brando, both of whom are best supporting actors won. ("From here to eternity") and best actor ("on the waterfront") and was on top of their game. One listens to Brando who sings, "Luck Be a Lady Tonight," talking volumes about where the early Dylan got his voice. Stubby Kaye steals the show as Nicely Nicely Johnson, bringing home with 'Sit Down You Rocking The Boat'. The ubiquitous Sheldon Leonard adds another page to his villain's gallery of gangsters. The film has a bright, cartoon-like appearance, which the Pop Art of the early 1960s predicted. The characters speak in a stylized patois, apparently based on Yiddish idioms. Although the film's social attitudes and gender roles are dated, it is very nice, and even the gentle rascal of the Salvation Army is harmless and does not reflect true hostility to organized religion. Watching Sinatra and Brando in the same movie is enough to watch this movie, but it offers many other attractions during its 149 minutes.
