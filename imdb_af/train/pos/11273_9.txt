A year after beautiful Jane Parker (Maureen O'Sullivan) lost to lose the rival Tarzan, hunter Harry Holt (Neil Hamilton) returns to the jungle to get another bash to win the dark baby's heart . He mutilated things with pleasure and also plans to grab an ivory from the elephant cemetery that lies outside the Mutia escarpment, Tarzan's bumping ground. <br /> <br /> Accompanied by his clever, female pal Martin Arlington and a group of consumer carriers, Harry finally arrives at his destination. He immediately killed death in the hands of wild natives and rock-hurling monkeys. Just to find out that Jane is still saturated with her muscular yodeller, and even worse, Tarzan refuses to let the hunters go. take an ivory from the cemetery. <br /> <br /> Nare Arlington decides to resolve issues by ambushing and shooting the monkey and then telling Jane and Holt that Tarzan was attacked and eaten by a crocodile. Of course, Tarzan is not dead, just wounded; Returning to the Cheetah (!), He just swung back in action to save Jane from a strain of malicious lioness that attacked Holt's expedition. <br /> <br /> Tarzan And His Mate, the second film to die Weismuller as the jealous man with few words, is often cited by fans as the best of the series. Although I prefer the original slightly, I can certainly understand the movie's popularity: it's damn sexy and there are some good action sequences! The unmistakable chemistry between Weismuller and O'Sullivan is fantastic and leads to some beautiful steaming scenes. With both stars wearing one-of-a-kind outfits throughout, there is a treat for both viewers of both sexes to enjoy (despite O'Sullivan's much-spoken underwater nude scene actually performed by a body double, the beautiful burden shows still very skin, even a 'Sharon Stone' at one point, while her cloth is sticking on one side!). <br /> <br /> The film's most exciting moments come in the form of a wonderful underwater battle between Tarzan and a crocodile, and the spectacular final where Jane is attacked by lions and natives, but is saved by her grandfather, she monkey friends and a cargo of elephants In abundant lion-crushing mode (once again, the violence is sometimes surprisingly dirty, although for me, nothing is as shocking as the evil pygmies and their gorilla pit from the first movie). The Cheetah also has its fair share of excitement, killing rhinos, crocs and big cats riding on Tarzan's back while crossing a river and even jumping on an ostrich on a ride. <br /> <br /> As it is predecessor, Tarzan And His Mate suffer slightly from bad effects and unconvincing props. Dodgy back projection, a few laughing monkeys, more Indian elephants hiding their African nephews and badly disguised trapeze swings, but it shouldn't spoil your enjoyment. of this very entertaining movie. If they do something, they make it even better! <br /> <br /> 8.5 out of 10, rounded to 9 for IMDb.
