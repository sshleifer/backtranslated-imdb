I will always have a soft spot for this Disney movie, another part of their life activity / share animation entries that try to restore Mary Poppins' success and never made it right. When I was in high school, we had a movie day each time, where the whole school in the cafeteria would be crowded, and a movie would be projected in the old fashion, multiple roles and all. At the time it looked like it was a great opportunity when this day arrived, and "Bedknobs and Broomsticks" is one of the movies I can remember to see like that. <br /> <br /> And from what I remember, it's pretty charming. Angela Lansbury never gave her name to something that was not at least competent, and she wins here as a witch with a magical bed (son, who can be wrong, can not?) What her and a few boys can do Take children on magical adventures to distant places. Come on, what kid doesn't want such a bed? <br /> <br /> Degree: A
