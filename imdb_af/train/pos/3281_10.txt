Who would have thought that such a dark little movie might be so haunting and touching? I'm really impressed. It's a shame that more people haven't seen it. I always loved Hans Zimmer's score. And what a director debut by Bernard Rose! Yet I wonder if I should call it a horror movie. It can easily be argued that it is also a fantasy or drama. Well, regardless, I love the interpretive potential it has. Everything and everyone in Anna's (played by Charlotte Burke) dreams represents a real conflict in her life ... the house itself, the tree, Mark, the lighthouse, etc. These are the many details like those that make the movie so good for repeated views. I hope I will come across a little movie as loaded with emotion and psychological meaning like this one soon.
