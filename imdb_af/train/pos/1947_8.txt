Destroyers. Like other posters, I felt the end was a bit sudden. I would like to see the crew return to life after their return. I suppose the authors expected this problem by loading a Voyager on Earth's rows at the beginning of the episode. (Of course that timeline has been cut, so it's all.) I did how Admiral Janeway died for the Voyager team. As fans, we get our cake and eat it, by making Janeway the ultimate sacrifice and living. I admit that the scenes of Janeway and her older self-talk were bizarre and so easily crossed the line in the camp. Luckily Mulgrew (s) pulled it off.
