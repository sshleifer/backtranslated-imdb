The title somewhat dominates the content of this movie, which can lead to unrealistic expectations. Honestly, there is very little "panic in the streets" to see here. In fact, throughout the film, many people know that there is a killer on the loose who can best spread the pest to everyone and anyone he meets. We said here, what we are doing here is a very well-told story with some tension that is pretty high anyway (because, unlike the people in the streets, the viewer knows what's going on) and that director Elijah Kazan builds very deliberately. As the pest-infected killer is sought, one of the more interesting sidebars I found was the developing relationship between Dr Reed (Richard Widmark) and Police Captain Warren (Paul Douglas). At first, the two don't really like each other, even though they have to work together. Towards the end, they forged a true bond of respect for each other. Kazan did it well. <br /> <br /> Lots of achievements were excellent. Widmark and Douglas were wonderful, and I was completely taken with a very early look at Jack Palance to play what would become his typical "heavy" role. I found very little to criticize here. Perhaps Barbara Bel Geddes looked a little flat as Reed's wife Nancy was, but her role wasn't really central to the story. All in all, an excellent piece of work. 9/10
