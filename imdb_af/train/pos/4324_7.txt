You don't need to read this review. <br /> <br /> An earlier review by pninson from Seattle has identified all the major shortcomings of this production. I can only reinforce his basic arguments. <br /> <br /> Bleak House was a relatively late Dickens novel and is much darker than its previous work. It is taken too literally by director Ross Devenish, who falls on the gloom and too much. When Ada, Rick and Esther appear half an hour in the opening section, it's a relief to be in the daylight for the first time. In some of the murky scenes, it was difficult to see what was actually on my TV screen. I watched the whole thing one day, beginning mid-afternoon. As daylight fades, it has become less of a problem, but I have a good TV and I've never had this problem before. <br /> <br /> The pacing is very deliberate (ie slow). I'm sure it was intentional, but it's overdoing it. There are numerous shots of people slowing down the muck and gloom of Victorian London being held longer than needed to establish mood and atmosphere. A good editor can probably take a few minutes out of every fifteen-minute episode, without losing a dialogue, just by trimming each of these scenes. <br /> <br /> I don't want to overestimate these two issues. . You quickly adapt to the look and fit of this production. The more important issue is that it doesn't always tell the story very effectively. Earlier, Dickens novels are as long as Bleak House, but aren't nearly as complex as planned. For example, I recently read Nicholas Nickleby again because I was watching Douglas McGrath put an 800-page book in his two-hour movie. The answer is simple: the book is full of stuff. McGrath cuts large parts of the novel while preserving all the essential story elements. It won't be possible with Bleak House. <br /> <br /> This production requires its seven hours. Probably, it needs even longer, because many elements of its complicated plot are not sufficiently clear, or handled as well as needed. A few random examples will illustrate the problems. <br /> <br /> The girl, Rosa, is out of nowhere without background, so Lady Dedlock's seizure of her is largely unmotivated. <br /> <br /> Sergeant George's leave in Tulkinhorn's demand for an example of Horton's handwriting is somewhat fudged. <br /> <br /> It's not made clear enough that Esther actually falls in love with Woodcourt when she agrees to marry John Jarndyce. It's also not clear that they have agreed not to announce their involvement, or why. <br /> <br /> Ada and Rick's secret marriage is omitted. In one episode they are just loved ones. In the following people suddenly referred to them as husband and wife. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Rouncewell is only introduced late in the story and Sargeant George's alienation from his family. is inexplicably left - and this is the way she is discovered. <br /> <br /> Tulkinhorn's commitment to maintaining the honor and respect of the Dedlock family has been underestimated, so its motive to prosecute Lady Dedlock is more obscure than it needs. be. <br /> <br /> The involvement of brick makers with both Tom and (later) Lady Dedlock is somewhat opaque. <br /> <br /> It is not obvious that Guppy renews his offer to Esther because her smallpox scar has all but disappeared. <br /> <br /> This is just a choice: there are others. They are not big problems and the mainstay of the story is clear enough. Nevertheless, it is small irritations that detract from the power: you don't have to puzzle over small plot points. However, there are more important structural problems that weaken the story in its later stages. <br /> <br /> The entire business of Tulkinhorn's murder is somewhat discarded. Bucket instantly shows Hortense as a suspect, which undermines the tension of Sergeant George's predicate and the importance of Mrs. Rouncewell. It also reduces the impact of the subplot in which suspicions are thrown at Lady Dedlock and weakens the scene in which Hortense is unmasked by Sir Lester. <br /> <br /> A more serious problem is that the murder, its investigation and the subsequent search for Lady Dedlock, dominate the story for over an hour, during which time we completely obstruct the other head lost: the case and its effect on Rick. His failed finances, his acceleration by Vholes and Skimpole, Ada's despair, his declining health, and so on, are all going on for an entire episode. It may be how Dickens wrote the book (I didn't read it for years), but a good script should keep the different plot strings together. <br /> <br /> Finally, Smallweed's role in the story is so reduced that he is almost redundant. His discovery of the New Testament, which elicits the final phase of the story, is also discarded. It happens on the screen. <br /> <br /> Despite this, it's still a very good production. Many of the performances are outstanding. Individual scenes are beautifully realized. The accumulation of tragedy is very powerful. I would still recommend it as an excellent adaptation to a good book, if it wasn't for the 2005 production. In fact, I probably wouldn't be fully aware of his flaws if I didn't see Andrew Davies doing it better. I criticized Davies 'Jane Austen adaptations, but I have to admit he really knows how to tune Dickens' fascinating books. <br /> <br /> It is an impressive and gripping drama and seventeen hours of anyone's time. Nevertheless, the probable lot should be seen mainly as a cross-reference to the near-definite 2005 version.
