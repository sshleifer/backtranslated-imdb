For the attention of Chuck Davis and Emefy: I saw PHANTOM LADY many years ago when I wasn't yet a jazz buff. There is an exhibition that will be missed until the end of June in Paris' brand new MUSEE DU QUAI BRANLY, called LE SIECLE DU JAZZ. With special entertainment, nine excerpts from jazz movies, including the well-known PHANTOM LADY drum series. I saw Gene Krupa - and Elisa Cook Jr - in almost all of their movie performances, and I can confirm the following: 1.Elisha Cook Jr. has doubled in the movie. It was a little progress, as he was killed in most of his other appearances (mostly in Howard Hawks GREAT SLEEP). 2. Krupa probably called Cooking in PL. I could recognize his style, as he had already graduated from the tom-tom (and abused) at the beginning of his career - namely, in 1937's Hollywood SING, SING, SING sequence - and ultimately everything possible from what we called in the French "la caisse claire". 3. The order of PL, at least as shown in the Museum, is not censored. Harry Carasso, Paris, France
