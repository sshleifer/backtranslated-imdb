Still walking spirits is one of those movies that grabs you and doesn't allow it to end, especially if you see it as a child. To see the movie as an adult, you have to admit that it's not really that scary, but the story is very fascinating and contains many mysterious scenes (especially those with the creepy mummy) <br /> <br /> One of the best scenes in the movie is without a doubt the scene with grandpa and grandmother in their new RV; The scene with the rocks is very exciting and pretty scary. The scene where the main character discovers his mother's secret is also quite frightening. <br /> <br /> Well, the play in the movie isn't that good and the movie sometimes looks a bit boring, but overall spirits still running are fun. Too bad just a few people saw this movie, this movie really gets better. I just want to say, Mr Flocker, you've done a good job! And for all your Hollywood producers out there; If you want to restore a movie, fix this one!
