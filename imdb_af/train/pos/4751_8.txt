I have no idea why this movie gets such a bad rap by so many IMDb users (Some say it's his worst movie ever. "What didn't one of you see who Cradle 2 The Grave is?) My favorite criticism is that the plot is completely stupid, and just an excuse to hang all the actions. Duh! What did you get from a Jet Li movie? Did you honestly believe that someone thought the story, then it only came with action loaded, of course not! Black Mask is great, wall-to-wall action almost all of it is running time, it's also terribly gruesome, and we get lots of cut limbs, decapitations and creative ways to watch the bad guys (and also a number of innocent people!) Being slaughtered Most of Li's other martial arts films are nursery school compared to Black Mask, there is no setback to the free violence, bloodshed or action sequences at all! made me a happy camper Again, if you go into a Jet Li movie, what a expect wonderful dialogue and plot plot, go for the wrong reasons. Black Mask is probably my favorite of his movies (though, beware of the terrible dubbing).
