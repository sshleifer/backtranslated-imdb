Arthur was always a personal movie for me for two reasons. A good friend of mine who worked as an extra on the film and only helped with the horses during the stable, recently died. If you look fast, you can see Frank Graham during the restaurant scene in the background while Dudley Moore and Jill Eikenberry are in conversation. Frank was a champion and would be missed by anyone who knew him. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I actually knew a real life, Arthur Bach. He wasn't quite as rich as Arthur, but spent 47 years of his life basically as a child. His parents strictly controlled his wallets, but his rent and utility services were paid in a cellar apartment in Greenwich Village. He spent a great deal of his time stomping himself on different spirits and making a public spectacle of himself, just like Dudley Moore. <br /> <br /> The wonder with Arthur is why someone will bother him with wealth. But this is the other half of the equation. My friend was a most beautiful person when you got to know him. In fact, it was almost a forced to be charming. He couldn't buy a newspaper or magazine without trying to establish some relationship with the seller. He lived his life as a perfect feast guest. The term wastes commonly used in the 19th century would apply to him. <br /> <br /> That's what Dudley Moore is, a waste. Unlike my friend, Moore cleared up John Gielgud. This is a full-time job as we have shown in Arthur. My friend never found a Liza Minnelli, a man Liza Minnelli, because he was gay. Still Moore's portrayal of Arthur Bach is deadly accurate and so to me. <br /> <br /> Arthur, 20th century, is forced to marry another child trust fund in Jill Eikenberry. Since he will not work for a living, the threat of being cut off is really for him. He just played his butler Hobson by John Gielgud and driver Bitterman played by Ted Post to throw out his problems. We must all have such problems. <br /> <br /> John Gielgud, in his almost centuries of life, has done better work than in Arthur on film, and in fact Gielgud is more prominent for his stage performances. However, 1981 was a year of sentiment during the Oscar time. The Academy awarded Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn Oscars for On Golden Pond and Gielgud the best supporting actor, mainly for the work of a lifetime. This man was incredible, almost to his craft. <br /> <br /> So to Frank Graham who worked in the movie and to Jackie Weiss, a real Arthur, I carry this review.
