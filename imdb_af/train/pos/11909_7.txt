A young woman (Jean Simmons) is convinced by her twilight and dangerous aunt (Sonia Dresdel) and uncle (Barry Jones) that she loses her mind and in a very delicate state that requires them to be more like manipulation, as they try to keep her as far away from human contact as possible. The only other person she sees is the estate guard, a capricious character played by Maxwell Reed, who has captured the brave eye of the middle-aged aunt. All this, the aunt and the caretaker, the uncle of the butterfly, who has a serious bottom on him, and the susceptible cousin in the middle, would have made a darker and more sinister film. As it is, a framework for a murder sent to Trevor Howard (a discarded public service agent who used butterflies in the estate catalog) and Simmons escaped from the police across the country and received police headlines just included her cover photo , jumping on buses, and winding up in Liverpool, where they meet some wonderfully played characters, and eventually face the greedy and murderous aunt and uncle.
