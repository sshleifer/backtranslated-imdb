This movie, along with WESTFRONT 1918, is my favorite Pabst-directed movie and I enjoyed it more than its much more famous films that Louise Brooks (like PANDORA'S BOX) stood for. This is probably because both are very similar to the Neo-Realistic films that the Italians perfected in the 1940s and 50s. This style film called to use non-actors (just typical people) in everyday settings to create intense engagement and realistic films. <br /> <br /> In this case, the film is about French and German coal miners. appropriately, the people in the roles look like miners - not actors. The central conflict when the film starts is that there is a large mine on the France-German border. Instead of one big mine, it is split at the border and German workers are not welcome in the French mine, despite the fact that there is unemployment in Germany. These language differences (illustrated in a dance room) and WWI conspiracy create a huge gap between factions. This leads to a WE vs THEY mentality. Later, an explosion causes a huge collapse in the French and the Germans refuse to sit back and do nothing. The risk of their own lives proves that there is true companionship between miners and men in general. <br /> <br /> The film is a strong criticism of xenophobia and tried in vain to see the German audiences to see the futility. of war and hatred. It was a wonderful moving movie with some of the frightening and claustrophobic images I have ever seen. Consideration of history, although the film's impact was at its best minimal. This is a real shame, like this one, WESTFRONT 1918, J√ÅACCUSE (Gance) and ALL REST ON THE MAJOR FRONT (Milestone) had good messages of peace and harmony, but ultimately, failures were in the positive swinging public opinion. So, from a historical point of view, it's an incredible and sad relic that's worth seeing.
