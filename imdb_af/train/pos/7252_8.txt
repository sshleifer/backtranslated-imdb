I watched this movie before joining the British Army. I got through my basic training, in the first trouble and then as I progressed much easier. My time was spent knowing the problems of the NI and the Cold War. There were times when I questioned myself about what I got myself, not long, because the training will always take over and you will always react instinctively. The voice used to show what the soldiers think is about, although I added breathing and heartbeat as it looks in given situations in your eardrums. A few years later I was in Canada for a family. A lady of mine who lives in the US and is a lecturer at Columbus Uni Ohio, did a newspaper about the consequences of the British Army in NI. She went out there to investigate. Although she was an ex-pat, she was very anti-British. She made me an extension and condemned me because I was a British soldier. My only answer was the film 'a long day's death'. It is the closest one citizen will get to realize why a soldier does what he does. The answer is right at the end.
