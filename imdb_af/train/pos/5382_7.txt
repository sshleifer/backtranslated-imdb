After watching the Next Action Star reality TV series, I was delighted to see the winners' film immediately. I was delighted with such a new talent show, but I was pleasantly surprised and excited. Billy Zane was, of course, his usual big self, but Corinne and Sean kept their own next to him. It was also nice to see Jared and Jeanne (also of the competition) in their role players. Sean's character, not Billy's, is being hunted, and his frustration in discovering new rules in the game is well-played. Corinne goes well between her character and Sean's only creature in it for the money. I loved how the game was played to the last second. And then on! Not a good movie, but an entertaining one all the way and a great showcase for two people on their first time out of the gate.
