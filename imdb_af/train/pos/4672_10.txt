I saw Brother's shadow at the Tribeca Film Festival and loved it! Judd Hirsch and Scott Cohen are great as father and son. The movie follows Scott Cohen's parole back in Alaska back to his family in Brooklyn. He pointed out because his brother was dead and started traveling to slowly recover his estranged relationships with his brother's wife and child and his father who had never forgiven him as the family's black sheep. The story takes us deep into the hearts and minds of this family and allows you to understand the complexity of their lives. The sculptures of the woodworking business and the Brooklyn background also set the tone for this rich and revealing family portrait.
