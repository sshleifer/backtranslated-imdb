This gripping story of intergenerational love, jealousy and revenge was even more enjoyable on DVD years after his PBS broadcast, with a sharper picture and sharper sound. My only caveat is that the plot has some unlikely moments and that some of the stronger Manchester accents are sometimes difficult. Fortunately, even a word is missing here and the fun will not spoil: the primary actors are ideally thrown. Robson Green brings a mysterious smile, a broken temperament and an athletic physics to his role as a young surgeon who falls hopelessly to his boss's wife in the hospital where he just started working. Francesca Annis is one of the most striking 50-year-old women imaginable; Her acting is against her beauty. (The love shows between these two show better than words how little the age difference is for them!) Each of the supporting characters is drawn sharply and also excellently portrayed. The mixture of spicy dialogue and passionate excess makes it a beautiful miniseries. As Russell Baker points out in his introduction, you can't be morally improved by seeing "reckless", but you'll have a lot of fun. (The sequel, a part of the DVD set, offers a wild but satisfying two-hour denial. You won't want to miss it if you enjoy it.)
