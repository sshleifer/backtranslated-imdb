Let me first declare that while I watched every episode of StarTrek at least twice, I didn't consider a Trekker or Trekkie. These are people who live in their older cellar and have attended conventions with pointed rubber ears. I stole this movie a seven aside from the fiction historical errors. The acting was better than average, but the plot had no surprises. They tried very hard to redesign the technology, but still the special effects were just a big temptation. Regarding the historical mistakes, if you call it, the first Capitan to run the Enterprise, Commander April, was then Capt. Pike, Jim Kirk, etc. According to a statement by both Riker and Kirk we educated the Klingons and them and gave them the technology (which is why a first directive was created), but as I said, this is no reason to do not discredit. I hope the plots will get deeper, and then special effects can take a back seat.
