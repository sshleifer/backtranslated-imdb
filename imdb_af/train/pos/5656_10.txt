I could never remember the name of this show. I use it to watch when I was 8. I remember getting up late when I wasn't supposed to just see this show. It was my best performance. From what I remember, it's still great. It showed Lucas Black, who made him the first son I ever loved. I'm out of the country, so boys with an accent don't appeal to me, but for him I would definitely make an exception. Looking at Crazy in Alabama, Friday Night Lights and Tokyo Drift, you should see why. He is a good actor and was since he was a child. I miss this show and wish it will come back. If someone ever sees where they are selling the season, send me an email. kywildflower16@hotmail.com
