This production of Oliver is masterful to show low evil in the human soul. What makes the story remarkable is a brilliant brightly-disguised character, penetrating this darkness while leading an innocent boy through the greatest dangers in the hands of his own family member. Yes, although Oliver walks through the valley of the death shadow, he fears no harm. A staff and staff are there to comfort him. In the end, he is saved from the murder of mankind. At the bottom is Fagin, the most evil of fate. Fagin does not intend to repent once, but twice, but still refuses because he is not willing to pay the price. Fagin is worse than Bill Sikes because he brings small bags that become murderers. In the middle is Oliver. His innocence is unfinished, but not married either. The best is Nancy. In the judgment, she lacks Bill Sikes's violent nature from her deep need for love. But unlike Fagin, at the probable cost of her own life, she repents her sins by Oliver from Bill. Things are not as they seem. In my opinion, this quality that makes value of art is unpredictable. I will give this movie a "10" but its 70's made-for-TV soundtrack and atmosphere was distracting. Overall, a fine parable and a thoroughly appropriate story for all audiences.
