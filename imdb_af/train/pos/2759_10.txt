The number of times I had in my eyes when I watched a movie is very little. And there was only once when I really screamed and that was when I saw this movie. This movie has a few cliches, but I really don't care. I even cry as I write it and it has been a while since I saw it. It's done perfectly and all the production values ​​are good, but what really matters is the simple and wonderful message. We all know this in our hearts, but it's not always easy to remember that the only thing that really matters in life is LOVE in all its forms. It's only when we like that we really live. I know how sentimental I sound and I promise that I am usually not like that. I'm quite a cynic. This movie brought out stronger feelings of sadness and happiness in me than any other movie. It will probably always be the first movie I recommend to see others.
