It's not the best Bigfoot ever made, but with the latest standards of nature, there are terrible movies, which are mostly displayed on the Sci-Fi channel, it's quality prices. It has a bit of action, a little humor, decent F / X and Bigfoot. CG is used, but so are some practical F / X I want. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is worth a watch if you are a fan of B horror / sci-fi and need a solution. It's better than the movie Sasquatch and not a sequel to it, so don't be fooled. <br /> <br /> The acting is better than you can expect to find in such a movie and directing is more than adequate. Expect a bit of a dick because the characters are "evolving" but know that things will pick up. If you watch a DVD, you might want to skip a chapter or two.
