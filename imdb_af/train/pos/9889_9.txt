Read Eric's review again. He described my own feelings for this movie as eloquently as I could ever have. I'm just writing here to further encourage you to search and see it. <br /> <br /> I saw it many years ago on TV, the IFC I think. It's such a unique movie that I hesitate to make comparisons. It was filmed in northern Mexico, somewhere in the impassable bad areas of Coahuila / Zacatecas / San Luis Potosi. It's not the Sedona-like Durango, Mexico (of the John Wayne movies), but a really sharp and wild place. I now have to find the novel to look at the original location of the story. Like the place, this movie is strange and wild and wonderful and strange and absolutely not for everyone. This is the kind of production that almost motivates me to study film. <br /> <br /> I really didn't forget this movie, it's indelible. Yet, over the years, I have forgotten about its existence. I do not know anyone who saw it, never read it, and there is no reference to it. Erendira is such an unusual name, I even forgot the title. Well, I'll buy a copy now. <br /> <br /> ** Since then I have become a big fan of Gabriel Garcia Marquez and so sorry I haven't read it before. <br /> <br /> Relative to MsMyth's comments below; The film was filmed in Mexico, but the author is Colombian and has no comment whatsoever on Mexico or Mexican history, although Marquez is now living in "political" reasons in Mexico. This story is universal. <br /> <br /> I'm still desperately trying to find a copy of this movie for my library. Did the movie hope? You have to read the story and then Garcia Marquz wrote altogether. And by the way, the original location in the story was Colombia.
