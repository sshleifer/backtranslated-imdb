These 1947 movie stars are directed and written by Orson Welles (with a funky Irish accent) and also stars the beautiful Rita Hayworth with less attractive short blonde hair. So, I was hanging out with Orson in front of the evil and Citizen Kane and the Third Man etc. but that was my first Rita Hayworth interaction. Our first meeting went well, she did a great job of playing the scared Elsa, married to a crippled millions of lawyer. Mike (Welles) and Elsa fall for each other. He wants to run away with her, she doesn't know if she can live without the things that money can buy. Elsa, her husband, and his partner bumps and bites, just like the sharks Mike describes, attacking each other and his prediction just seems to be true. Several twists and turns follow in this murder mystery as we come to the climax in the fun house. (Think of the end of the shooting in The Man with the Golden Gun, which borrowed heavily from this scene). I wasn't sure who the killer was to the end. <br /> <br /> This movie is like garlic and lemon juice. The dish is centered on the sea, it is subtle, sour and sharp, all to great effect. It may not be the best fresh shrimp, but good quality shrimp from Costco. The fragrant sauce adds to the naturalness of the pink shrimp, as you are on a healthy but filling alternative to a more general, ordinary price. 7/10 http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies
