The first time to see Buster Keaton's first feature film, and I must admit that I liked it very much and just wish I stumbled across it years ago. The Rohauer blur at the beginning warns that the Three-Eight single-nitrate pressure has been rediscovered and rescued just in time for incineration in 1954, and many framelessly framed frames are separated. So it's a rocky sight in places, but I've seen and survived much worse. <br /> <br /> It would have been good than the 3 short films, but as an assumption of intolerance it has been inventive and funny from the start. The Finish: In the Stone Age with Baddie Wallace Beery, an elephant and Goodie Buster riding a pet brontosaurus ride; In the Roman period Buster rides with a wheel with wheel locks and adapted for sledding, No parking signs in Latin; In this technological era of speed demand and greed, his car falls beautifully at the first hump. Seek him and Beery to the Girl through the ages, an eternal end. Favorite piece: As the cave man he is beaten backwards by a wreath, but still a kiss to the camera, a wonderful second or two! <br /> <br /> Big things, confirming my love for silent movie comedy.
