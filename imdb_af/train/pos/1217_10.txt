I was worried my daughter could get the wrong idea. I think the character of the "dark heart" is a bit rough and I don't like the way he moves in an "average" frog, fox, son. I was wrong. This movie was made for my child, not me. She "gets it" when it's over (under?) My head. Of course I don't get it. This is not one of the new children's films that adults will enjoy as well. It's right for the little ones, and the crew knew what they were doing. There is no political junk ether. There is no magic key that will save the world of ourselves, no one has the right to access, and not everyone is happy. And as a fringe, no one dies! ?? russwill.
