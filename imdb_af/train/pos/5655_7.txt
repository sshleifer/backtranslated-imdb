I watched this show because it is said to be reminiscent of David Lynch's Twin Peaks - a show I worship. The show starts to introduce us quickly to the main characters and rather unusual to the pilot is the best of the lot, it is very dramatic and really gets the whole evil side of the show ready throughout the rest of the season. to progress. My biggest criticism is that I made a little sense at the show - probably not by its own fault, as it was canceled after just one season, it showed a lot of potential and it got much better treatment than it got . The acting is excellent, and this performance has some of the best characters (good and evil) I have ever seen in a short time. There is the odd cheesy effect for the first five or ten shows which is a bit too dramatic, but it gets rectified as the season progresses. Well a watch, definitely something extraordinary!
