How wonderful this movie is! I've seen it back and forth over the years and I'm always playing through it. The reason why the movie is so easy to watch is, of course, the arrest performance given by young Bette Davis. She not only steals every scene she is in, but is actually much nicer and better photographed here (no less a part) than in any of the films she has made at her home studio, Warner Brothers (this film was made by RKO Radio Pictures). She wears a very flattering make-up and has many attractive hairstyles and oh, those beautiful big eyes (especially in the restaurant scenes that take place in London's Soho). Her body was so crooked when she was young. Get a load of it in the cheap carelessness she carries for her huge explosive confrontation scene with Leslie Howard. And oh son, she's an absolute power station in that scene. Howard is a little too nervous throughout, but he takes the hero's sensitivity. Frances Dee counts as the lovely, beautiful young Sally who really loves him. Max Steiner's score is both charming and attractive. Beautiful performances and thirty tastes make it look like the classic novel.
