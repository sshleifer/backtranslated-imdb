Massive multiple cold fever in the spine! I'm surprised there are people who didn't like it! I saw it at 10:00 in the morning and still stored tightly! And I saw hundreds of trillions / horror movies! To cry out loud, I'm 22 !!! I mean, okay, tuned, not very good, probably even b-film-ish. But the true appearance of terror, the sound effects, the flow! From the beginning, you beat again and again with relentless, unforgiving, terrorizing scenes! So many cliches still no one fails to surprise / frighten! You know it's coming, it's coming, it's coming, BOO! and you still jump off the chair. Grab a pillow and a blanket, call your nearest friend and do not check in at night! Hats off to the Japanese!
