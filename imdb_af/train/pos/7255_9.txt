It's not a movie you're watching for entertainment, at least most people I know wouldn't. <br /> <br /> It depicts the cruelty of both body and mind that happens in war very well, the likelihood of the characters, especially because you read their thoughts, something that is more often found in books and rarely in movies but done very well in this piece. I'll place it next to "All quiet on the western front" and "Die Br√ºcke" if it's a lasting impression. <br /> <br /> I wish I could get it to school, along with the other two movies - but getting a copy of it showed it's pretty hard - it's a shame.
