What a fun movie! If you are a Giallo fan, red queen kills 7 times is a real winner. To begin with, it's hard to go wrong with Barbara Bouchet and Marina Malfatti in the same Giallo. Both are wonderful - especially the wide-eyed innocent Bouchet as the guilty woman who fears her life. The dead queen in Red Queen Kills 7 Times is especially nice and has plenty of blood to make most fans happy. One of the first murders comes rather unexpectedly and gets the movie really good. The killer, The Red Queen, is one of the most exaggerated and interesting killers I have seen in an Italian movie. The 70's and fashions are great. In fact, all the footage is interesting with the laughing Red Queen walking across the bridge and one of my favorite moments in the film. The intricate plot kept my interest throughout. Finally, Bruno Nicolai's score could be the best I heard from the composer. The main theme is so memorable that I couldn't get it out of my head for two days. <br /> <br /> The only two issues I have with Red Queen Kills are 7 times in the final of the movie. First, the person responsible for the murders is too easy to see. If you've seen more than a few Gialli, you'll have no problem determining who is behind the murder. Secondly, the end feels a bit rushed and is therefore somewhat confusing. I'm definitely not one that needs every plot point spelled out for me, but I'll admit I lose it all. A second view can only fix it.
