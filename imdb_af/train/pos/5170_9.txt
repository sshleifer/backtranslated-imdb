I rented this movie when it came out on video tape and really enjoyed it. I had the opportunity to buy it on DVD a few weeks ago and have watched it several times. I'd agree with others if they say Indian summer was nostalgic. If I see it, I wish I could be 10-14 again. I think that's why we all like the movie to some extent. We sometimes wish we could relive our lives as children with the wisdom / knowledge of adults. Wouldn't it be nice to be all your friends / parents young again? Not to worry about your work, being older, etc. ??? I know I like to jump into a De Lorean and go back in time. While enjoying the movie, my favorite movie is all the time though Meatballs with Bill Murray. I wish they could make an Indian summer version of it.
