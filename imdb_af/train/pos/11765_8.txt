This movie surprised me, it has good one-liners and laughter, + an inexorable action packing story with tons of gun action and explosions. This movie had surprisingly very good twists. The plot is solid despite what others might think, it kept my interest all the way to the end. In closing; This is a great way to use an active movie to offer time.
