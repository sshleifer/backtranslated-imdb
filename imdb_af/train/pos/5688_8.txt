Opening Credits: Large. Music: Just right for this movie. Cinematography: messy to great effect. <br /> <br /> Excitement in a train swing type. That's how out of control some lives can become. "Wonderland" does not show drug-induced wildness (and its consequences) as a deviation, but shows how it really happens in our society. It's better than images of another wild group - Manson - because all Manson movies, books, etc. So much on Manson's insane minds rather than the overall picture of cheap fame and arbitrariness nowadays so pervasive. <br /> <br /> If you want to see the best "Method Working" on film, watch Kilmer in this movie. He shows how the "Method" can sound in the right role. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers here manage to "out of control" to the level of an art form, not just for the sake of giving us cheap excitement.
