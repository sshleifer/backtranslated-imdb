Never heard of The Man in the Moon until it was seen on this HDTV channel last night. Look, my taste is like any other, eclectic. My favorites are from Blue Velvet to Dr Strangelove to The Ghost and Mrs. Muir through the wizard of Oz and the beloved, Eraserhead, repo man and The Spy Within. <br /> <br /> The Man in the Moon is excellently crafted, a gentle, heartfelt, joyful and tragic film, beautifully filmed, one in which actors truly live, rather than acting. This lovely story will soon be in our private library. This beautiful story of life in a much finer era in rural Louisiana literally transports you to its pastoral environment. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to stay stoic during the last moments of the film, especially when the young girl spreads the size of her older sister's private pain and forgive everyone. <br /> <br /> Instead of spoiling the pleasure or sobbing with my dull prose, now end up with this proposal of one who enjoys movies that speak to heart. <br /> <br /> If you don't buy another movie, please buy the Man in the Moon. This moving story is one that you will enjoy again. It's a joy and a jewel, a movie that is too scarce in this world of hardening hearts. <br /> <br /> The simple virtues found in Man in the Moon are a joy to watch. <br /> <br /> Paul Vincent Zecchino <br /> <br /> Manasota Key, Florida <br /> April 05, 2009
