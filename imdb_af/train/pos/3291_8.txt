A big movie it and a shame that it gets little attention outside of arthouse circles and students who stay until morning until noon to watch it on Channel Four. <br /> <br /> The plot is a simple one, but works very effectively, fading between childish fantasy and stubborn nightmare is very blurred. The budget looks pretty low, but it doesn't show too often for those involved. It also hasn't dated so much. <br /> <br /> I was fortunate enough to cut it off the telly when it was a few years ago and it resisted half a dozen views. It's one of those movies that won't appeal to everyone; But as usual, those with a more thorough approach to the theater will come up with much of this. <br /> <br /> Charlotte Buerke puts a good performance like Anna, the spoiled brat and it's a shame she looks away from the scene scene. Cross is also very good and carries the character of his character very well within the context of the picture. <br /> <br /> There are some real (and I don't say so lightly) disturbing moments in this movie, both half-second shockers and more stretched tension. Look at the lights! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended. <br /> <br /> 9/10 <br />
