This movie is a fantastic movie. Moreover, everything about it in my opinion was from acting to directing. I know Mr Garfield was blacklisted in the 1950s, but the majority of his other films are on video, if not DVD. This is the case, why is it not the one? A friend recorded it to me from TCM, but having it on DVD would be good. For special features they can say a marine historian talks about the fight and as Schmid's wife or son still lives, they can also be fed. Anyway, it's a good movie and I highly recommend it. If it ever hopes to be postponed, it won't be colored. Colorizing it would, in my opinion, just destroy the entire effect of the film. The battle scene was pretty realistic until 1945, the movie would go. Mr. Garfield did an excellent job To depict Schmid. Some actors might have been tempted to part of Mr. Schmid's disability persuaded, but I feel he has succeeded. I sincerely hope that they will one day come up with this movie on DVD as a tribute to Al Schmid's courage and all the other marines who sacrificed so much to us in World War II.
