The very first picture of the movie shows a mountain ridge in the early morning fall fog, and my thought was: "It's almost too beautiful." And so it goes: Images of landscapes and animals that resemble a series of romantic paintings, each perfectly in every detail. Even the girl's room, her father's car - everything is nostalgic, romantic, beautiful. It may look obsolete and fun, but it fits in with a story that runs between life and fairy tales between Dian Fossey and Le Petit Prince. I enjoyed every minute of it. The extreme parody of the movie, with a simple, slow story, just one actor and almost any special effects, exerted a strong magic. So I find it regrettable that these parsimonies were given up in the last few minutes, when suddenly two additional actors (the girl as a grandmother and her son) were introduced. Another shortcoming is the music, which is often intrusive, Hollywood-like, and sometimes inappropriate. I couldn't bring an English pop song with the French mountain glory. I went to the movie with my two little girls, but I also recommend it to adults, as they appreciate these movies. Obviously not everyone does.
