Great play by Gretchen Mol. This movie is one of the best biopics to hit the screen for some time. While it covers most of Bettie's young life, it also manages to stay on a mostly focused path, which seems to be most biographical. There is a beautiful and disturbingly funny subtext in the dialogue and acting. This movie is an excellent break from the Dir. from "American Psycho," and I think it will look like her best work to date. Oh, and as a cinematography buff, I give this movie 100% in the cine dept. It was amazing how good they were with a 50-year-old look with modern movie supplies. Awards to the D.O.P. All around very pleasant. I recommend interested people to see it: 8/10.
