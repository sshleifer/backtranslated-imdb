This is apparently the second redesign of this film, previously filmed in 1911 and 1918. And in so many ways, it reminds me of the later film, a YANK AT OXFORD. Both films relate to a confused blow-up that arrives at one of the top schools in the world, and both ultimately show the buzz that slowly teaches about teamwork and decency. In this film is William Haines "Tom Brown" and his main rival, "Bob" is played by Frances X. Bushman. And in a supporting role, Jack Pickford is always remembering Maria's brother. Of these three, Pickford comes out best, as the sympathetic loser that becomes Tom's partner. He actually has some decent scenes as well as a dramatic moment just before the Big Game! All the standard cliches are there and the movie, because it's so many times before and since done, offers little surprises. However, it is nice movie and is enjoyable to watch. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, for a better quiet college movie, try Harold Lloyd's THE FRESHMAN - it's soccer scenes are more exciting and Harold is much more fun and sympathetic than the annoying Tom Brown.

Well done, but definitely NOT original! And because it's just a rehash of his other movies, anyone who gives the film a score of 10 is strongly advised to watch these other movies. <br /> <br /> 4/25/08 == I just watched and saw this little movie was the highest rated movie on IMDb since the 1920s! Talk about over-rated! There are dozens and dozens of better movies - how this movie becomes # 1 is anyone's guess.
