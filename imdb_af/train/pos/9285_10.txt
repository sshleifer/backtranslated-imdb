Finally! An Iranian movie not made by Majidi, Kiarostami or the Makhmalbafs. It's a non-documentary, an entertaining black comedy with subversive young girls kicking the 'system' in his ass. It's all about football and it's funny, it's really funny. The director says: "The venues are real, the event is real, and so are the characters and extras. That's why I deliberately chose not to use professional actors, as their presence would have suggested a false idea." The non-actors will immediately let you root, unless a. your heart is of stone b. You are blind. Excellently written, challenging the film patriarchal authority with an almost absurd freshness. It won the Jury Grand Prize, Berlin. Dear reader, it's close-perfect. WHERE, WHERE CAN I GET IT?
