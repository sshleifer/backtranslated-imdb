"N Itch In Time" is one of a series of home tracks that Bob Clampett hit in the early 1940s for the World Cup, including "Horton Hatches The Egg" and "Tortoise Profit At A Hair." 'In the manic timing and exaggerated chaos, it's awakened. It is basically the saga of a flea that is breaking ground for a new home and the dog whose land is being broken. Because Master Elmer will give him a dreaded vloadbath if he's as much as scratches, the unlucky dogs are forced to endure an upward spiral of torment, as the apartment fleet uses bowls and tools to remove the land. Ultimately, the small monster lifts the fusion to a small mountain of high explosives on the back of its victim! There is a tremendous explosion, and the incessant pooch covers his eyes as she bursts back into a fiery fourth of July show! It must be really hurt, and the dog takes flight, but soon he stops the action and says with a cheerful smile: "You cut it better, because I think I'm getting it right!" For years, this kinky confession has been censored, but current pressure has restored the clip, so now viewers can enjoy it in its original devilish glory. Still cutting, the closing stop in which the cat blows out his brain after complaining, "I've seen everything!" It was a general tournament at the World Cup, but it has since been purified from this cartoon and several others, including "Horton".
