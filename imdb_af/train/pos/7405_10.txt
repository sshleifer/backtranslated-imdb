This movie is just great! It has everything: laughter, sadness, beauty, poetry, truth. Everything in a simple but intense story - like life! You won't be distracted for a moment. <br /> <br /> 10/10 <br /> <br /> P.S. Someone tells Hollywood, you need a good story to make a good movie, and there are so many good stories out there.
