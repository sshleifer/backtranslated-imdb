Alain Resnais movies are unpleasant in the way they aren't really edited for continuity, but the shot seems to be right where a reminder has been edited. Love to death is sometimes a silent existential drama and a round creative magical realistic movie, and either the audience treats for a whole new aspect of the Eros / Thanatos relationship ... or may create a new relationship, that of Agape / Thanatos. <br /> <br /> The start is like a bizarre surrealistic horror movie. A woman runs desperately around the house while a man dies in his bed - did she kill him or what happened? Soon the tension is dissolved when a doctor arrives and declares him dead, but from there a newer strange drama begins: the man wakes up and after death the woman and the man fall in love with actually quite tragic consequences. Meanwhile, their friends, both priests, have their own debate on the nature of love, faith and dedication. <br /> <br /> Resnais always seems to have a device to make these kinds of narratives work. And what is so wonderful about his films is that those devices always work. In this case, Resnais divides the screens with shots of snow falling into an exciting orchestra party, which fades and blooms in subsequent shots that continue the story. This film is captured from time to time, and the film develops a rhythm, not too much like an epic poem, and I got one of those strange flashbacks on Dante's Divine Comedy, despite the lack of direct reference in the movie. Resnais is known as a very poetic filmmaker, but it only spans the cinepoem structure to something that causes some introspection in the viewer, giving the opportunity to surface some strange memories . Memory story, Resnais create. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
