I watched the original English version on video. Disney's choice of voting factors looks very promising. I can't believe I'm saying it. The story is about a young boy who meets a girl with a history that is intertwined. The two are thrown into one of the most fun and intriguing stories in any animated movie. The animation quality is excellent! If you saw Disney's work on Kiki's delivery service, you can see the quality in their production. It almost saves them from stealing the story of Kimba, the white lion. (but not quite!) Finally, Miyazaki's movies are released correctly! I can't wait to see a rough English version of Nausicaa!
