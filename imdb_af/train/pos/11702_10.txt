A thief in the night should be the best of all the end-time thrillers. I have no idea what people complain about what people hear when they say these movies have scared them to accept God. They just had to apologize and blamed a thief in the night. Don't listen! These movies tell not only one of the many possibilities of the tribulation, but they are also fun to watch in their simplicity. They are actually low budget and it is a little obvious, but not too obvious. I had no idea, because I really believed that many of these films made in the 70's included low budgets all the time. <br /> <br /> A thief in the night tells the story of young and cynical Patty Myers who lives for her way to her husband, and almost all her friends disappear into the prophetic rapture that everyone has warned her . Initially, the film is not completely around her until the rapture takes place. What this results in is that everyone else is becoming her Christian and believes in Christ, which usually happens to many people. Everyone around them who once knew and loved them will be forever, and the one left behind is the one who blames everyone but themselves. No one can ever make themselves guilty because they are always right. <br /> <br /> Just like these whiners complaining about the movie. These people must be adult adults. I'm thirteen, and you don't see me whistling, especially because I was exactly like Patty before I accepted Christ in my heart again. For those who have not seen it, if you want a bit of everything that is thrown into a Christian movie instead of stereo-typical, all are different wrong movies than you would enjoy a thief in the night . Don't beat it before trying it. Something new is always good. Trust your own instincts.
