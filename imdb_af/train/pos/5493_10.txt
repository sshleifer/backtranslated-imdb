It's really scarce to get an inside of a media fraud that has been widely reported as official "truth" and has caught so many "news" agencies with their pants. This movie, I think, deserves every prize in journalism - it is objective (yes!), Courageous and a real "scoop". It can do without comment, false scenes or leading questions. Everyone, including Chavez, also gets foolish of themselves in their own words. The filmmakers had to watch alone and roll out their cameras. <br /> <br /> The Venezuelan elite teaches us how to deposit a president and sell it as a victory of democracy. It's amazing that they've finally lost - so far. Of what I know, the biggest TV station involved just recalled its rural license, they are still broadcasting via cable and satellite. I doubt many if George W. or Barack Obama would be tolerant of a coup attempt. But then they don't have to worry. <br /> <br /> The fact that "Chavez supporters shoot innocent civilians" scam was so willingly repeated over the world, revealing just how biased the so-called "free" established media is, or has ever been, just more so. An important lesson for anyone interested in what is "really" going on in the world. <br /> <br /> The well-known "objectivity" challenge always comes into play when journalists dare to resist the mainstream outlook or reveal unwelcome facts accusing "us" - that is true with the effects of the Atomic Bomb , the American secret history of the spread of "democracy" around the world or the war in Iraq which, according to Johns Hopkins, killed 1.3 million Iraqis. To name the 60,000 Afghans (in 2003) never mentioned. To be objective, Saddam Hussein was less hurt to his people than the US. And the US is ready and prepared to be detrimental to the Iranians he was. <br /> <br /> I am very curious about the upcoming trial of some Khmer Rouge leaders before the International Hague Tribunal, or mention our involvement in the support and training of Pol Pot's guerrillas in the 80's when they were largely defeated by Vietnam. Probably not. <br /> <br /> All the more reason to turn to the Independent Media for balance, if not fraudulent.
