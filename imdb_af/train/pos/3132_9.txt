I looked at low expectations last night. The reasons for this are, I don't usually like "made for TV" movies and I rarely had a movie. But the critic in the Los Angeles Times looked like this, so I gave it a chance. I'm glad I did. It was pretty good. Adam Wes and Burt Ward reunited as themselves. But somehow they acted as their "Batman and Robin". They were champions and didn't have themselves or this movie too serious. The movie starts with them looking for the "George Barris" design Batmobile, stealing someone before auctioning it for an orphan's home. While looking for the car, they also remind them of the series they did together. It is said in flashback. It was well done. The actors they have, for the younger Burt Ward and Adam West were dead. And for a TV movie it came across the nitty-gritty about their real behavior on and off the screen. I give this one a 9/10, I liked it so much.
