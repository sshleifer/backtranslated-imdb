This complicated story begins quite simply, with an English journalist accepting a bet from Edgar Allen Poe and his friend Lord Blackwood that he cannot spend a night in Blackwood's haunted house. The author once walks around the dusty rooms and corridors, until music and a glimpse of a pair of walks lead him into an empty room. He sits at the harpsichord and starts playing the song he has heard, and is surprised to be typed on the shoulder by the beautifully beautiful Elizabeth Blackwood. She lifts him in an ambiguous, charming / ominous way that she has prepared his room upstairs and that someone is always expected tonight ... the night of the dead. So start an exciting series of supernatural events that spoil the journalist all night. SPOILER AHEAD: It probably won't surprise too many viewers to learn that the beautiful Elizabeth is actually a ghost. It doesn't prevent her from falling in love with the journalist, but it makes them more complicated than the average couple. It's a fun movie, with absolutely everything: ghosts, the haunting castle, repeated visions of past events, sex and violence (both were rejected in the version most Americans have seen over the years.) The alluring, fascinating Barbara Steele is the main reason to see it. She has a strange charisma, unlike anyone else you've ever seen in the movies. Recommended!
