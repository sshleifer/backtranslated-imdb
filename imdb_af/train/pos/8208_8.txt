I kept almost all the movies in the Dirty Harry series, with the exception of the one I think titled "Enforcer". "Deadpool" was also a little poor in areas, but I still enjoyed it. This one is one of my favorites of the series, as nothing else for the big line of "Going to Make My Day". This one also contains an interesting, though well-known plan by someone who kills those who have done her wrong. Just think "Magnum Force" with less mystery about who is behind the killings and you have your plot. Admitted there is a little more than that, as this one has a very nice final show at an amusement park. It also features Dirty Harry who gets a bulldog as a gift and Sandra Locke in a rather humorous scene. The only question left is why Clint Eastwood had the supple actress, Sandra Locke, in so many of his movies. She brings the score to a point every time, even though the movie is pleasant to me. Granted she's not bad here, but her character could have been so much better by someone else. Another problem with this movie and other Dirty Harry movies, they sometimes seem to be ads for guns. I like guns as much as the next person, but do we really need scenes from him that explain all the strength of his latest weapon and how many bullets it contains? Still, very good access to the Dirty Harry series movies.
