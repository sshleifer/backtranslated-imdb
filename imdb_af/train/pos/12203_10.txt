Orson Welles' 'The Lady From Shanghai' does not have the brilliant script of 'Citizen Kane', but Charles Lawton, Jr. cinematography, the memorable pieces (such as the scene in the aquarium, the sea point a beautiful blonde-proud Rita Hayworth song, "Please Do not Love Me", and the most wonderful Hall of Mirrors climax) and the wonderful cast (Everett Sloane in his greatest performance, Welles in a beautifully played role, former Miss Hayworth - Welles' wife at the time - on her most beautiful - makes for a very memorable movie experience. The bizarre murder mystery plot is fun and compelling, not at all impractical. The viewer is surprised by the turn and turn, and Welles' closing line is an irrevocable classic. "The Lady From Shanghai" gets four stars from this impartial arbiter.
