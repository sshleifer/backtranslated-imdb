Perhaps the last movie you expected from Vittorio de Sica and Cesare Zavattini (who wrote the novel on which this film is based) is. It's a neo-realistic fantasy, kind of an oxymoron, really. An old woman finds a baby in her cabbage spot and raises him as her own son. After a few years, the baby is a young boy (called Toto) and the adoptive mother dies. He goes to an orphanage and when he finally turns 18, he leaves. Immediately he finds that he has no home. However, Toto is optimistic and will not let anything down. A man steals his valise, and instead of being angry about it, Toto becomes his friend and goes with him to a small town. Toto takes an initiative and organizes the many homeless people living in the area, and they build a better exploration. Soon the landowner is trying to sell this land, and the shantytown's citizens have to protect themselves. After many attempts, the owner occupies a police force to get rid of the homeless. At this stage, the film becomes full-fledged fantasy (before that it was more comic / fantastic melodrama in the style of Charlie Chaplin). These things are so strange and shocking that it is probably best for others to see it for themselves. It's quite incredible, and very funny. There are objections you can collect about the plot of Miracle in Milan, certainly. Fellini and Visconti were greatly criticized when they turned away from Neorealism. I think I read it was widely criticized at the time of its release. At this point, however, it is so nice - I loved it very much. This can be my favorite of Vittorio de Sica's films, although Umberto D and The Bicycle Thieves are very close. 10/10.
