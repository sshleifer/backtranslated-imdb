It was a wonderful romantic comedy! Historically inaccurate (Einstein had no cousins ​​or cousins ​​as mentioned elsewhere in IMDb), but he made a good matchmaker. He played two very nice people playing by two of the best actors working. The supporting film (Lou Jacobi, Joseph Maher, Gene Saks, Stephen Fry, etc.) all clicked on the screen and made it a great viewing experience. The fact that he was driving a car to drive around, seems to contradict all the images and posters of his riding a bicycle to get around. And did he wear socks in one scene? According to reports, the professor never wore socks! (Two new entries for the IMDb goofs section.) Historical inaccuracies and inconsistencies aside, it was a great movie to watch with a big role. I give it a 8!
