It is one of the few movies out there that are very erotic without being pornographic, although there is only a very rudimentary plot. There is not much live sound or dialogue; <br /> <br /> This is a document. <br /> <br /> It's thinking. <br /> <br /> <br /> I can quite understand why nobody else has ever tried such a thing. There is something like that already. This. :-) <br /> <br /> NB: The producer does not have the right to distribute a DVD version. I've never seen it sold anywhere; One can mr. Send Boerner and order a copy on VHS.
