I saw this movie when I was a kid. It blew me away. It was before the days of television, such a film of this magnitude, a young child could send in the track. It impressed me so much that I watched this movie for twelve consecutive days. The special effects used at this time were far from his time. Sabu was a real joy, just like Rex Ingram as the Genie. I found myself "I want to be a sailor" for months after the film left. I would recommend this movie to everyone and everyone. I forgot to mention Conrad Veidt, who was so scandalous a character you ever wanted to meet. Also, June Duprez was never nicer than she was in this photo. The color was outstanding. Give this movie an AAA!
