I saw this jewel of a film in Cannes where it was part of the directors for two weeks. <br /> <br /> Welcome to Collinwood is nothing but wonderful. Great fun throughout, with all the members of a strong role finishing their socks. It's a sometimes loud comedy about a small rogue (Cosimo, played by Luis Guzman) being caught trying to steal a car and send it to prison. While in jail, does he meet a "life" who tells him of "the ultimate bellini"? what for you and me? is a sure fire get rich quick scheme. It seems there is a road from an abandoned building to the village jewelry store? what can be millions of net. Sounds simple? ?? On the go, throw all sorts of brutal characters and incidents and you have the ingredients for one wild ride !! ?? word goes from one lower life loss to the next and soon a team of them is gathered to win cash on Cosimos 'bellini' lead by failed boxer Pero (Superbly played by Sam Rockwell, surely a star in making) and Reluctant villain Riley (William H. Macy) forced to bring his baby with him if his wife is locked up for fraud. <br /> <br /> Based on the Italian movie, Solitaire ignoti (Big Deal on Madonna Street) which also inspired a similar movie for Collinwood? `Palookaville. It knocks off the latter effort and although it's written and directed by the Russo brothers, it certainly has shades from the Coen Brothers. Produced by Steven Soderbergh and George Clooney, who have a small but hilarious share as a lame safe breaker.
