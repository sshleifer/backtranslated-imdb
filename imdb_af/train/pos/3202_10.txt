I can't understand why many IMDb users don't like this movie. Why they think it's so bad, etc. It's not worse than anything else out there. Personally, I think "Soldier" is a good movie, much better than most other movies in the same genre. <br /> <br /> Reasons why I held "Soldier": Kurt Russel, Connie Nielsen, Jason Scott Lee, the writing (David Webb Peoples), great visual effects, and directing (Paul Anderson). <br /> <br /> I even think it's the best job I've seen of director Paul Anderson, who was previously the entertaining "Mortal Kombat" and the non-entertaining "Event Horizon".
