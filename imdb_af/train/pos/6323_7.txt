"Welcome to Collingwood" offers some of the most hilarious recent memory dialogue. To see this comedy directed by brothers Anthony and Joe Russo, we may have reminded of another movie we have seen in the past, but as we missed the opening credits, we had to wait until the end to discover that what we are reminded of is the 1958 Italian movie "Big Deal on Madonna Street" directed by Mario Monicelli. <br /> <br /> The Russo brothers played a wonderful role in portraying all the characters in the movie. Anything with William H. Macy, Luis Guzman, Sam Rockwell, Patricia Clarkson, late Michael Jeter, can't be bad. Since it's an ensemble piece, all the characters get an opportunity to shine. <br /> <br /> The movie gives us a group of perfect, safe crackers from hell. No one can think these men can do a job like the one they do. Whatever can go wrong, and more, is what they manage to do. George Clooney makes a small appearance as the master lock which is also seen as a rabbi, which is confused with a priest only by gangsters coming from Cossimo's funeral. <br /> <br /> The best way to get The movie is to sit back and relax, and let all these little time frames do their thing. Let their funny lines make you laugh, because everyone can see that this gang is doomed to death!
