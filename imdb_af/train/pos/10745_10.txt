Let me get rid of the bad, James Hanlon is absolutely horrific at trying to do his descriptions of what's happening with the newcomer's training and events of the day. Actually, it's in strong contract with the other firefighters without acting aspirations that are, of course, in their delivery. <br /> <br /> It said it's an incredible movie that is impossible to see in my eyes without tears. I am an English man from London, but I love New York and have visited many times before and after 11 September. It is a second home for me and I can't help but feel ruined at the loss of life but also the destruction of a part of such a wonderful beautiful city. This is the right deal, with the firefighters having everything around them falling apart. I am so glad the footage exists to show people how it was. It's a pity they didn't make use of the buildings, because friends who were there say it's such a big part of their memory. It should be included to show future generations how terrible it really was. <br /> <br /> At the time, conspiracy theorists can go to hell.
