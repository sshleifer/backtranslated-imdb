I read many posts of this game that are so similar to Max Payne, when I first played it, I thought it was a bit of a strange arcade game with the desire to rip off the Max Payne style (not just the bullet). -Time). When I played it for a few hours, I realized how much fun it was! and how different from "Max Payne", yes the dot time is a bit similar, but I think it fits differently in the style of play. This game is non-stop action - a mix of a shoot'em and a fight'em up, so much fun. As a big fan of Max Payne, I have to say that the story of DTR is not near Max's greatness. Payne, the graphics are a bit mean and some of the levels look the same, but if you want a bit more of that bullet time, you should definitely own this game.
