The film comes to the tension between a boy and a father. <br /> <br /> The brilliant dialogue, beautiful scenery and great acting serve as a great way to present the onions that have low levels. <Br /> <br /> The core issues of parenting, communication and masculinity are being investigated indirectly. <br /> <br /> In curvy ways, the curtain is withdrawn, the masks slip a bit and the truths are exposed. <br /> <br /> All this happens within a road travel format. The background is the rural New York state in early autumn, just as the trees change colors. WOW!
