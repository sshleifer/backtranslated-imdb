From the director of movies 'Last Seduction' and 'Kill me again' another film comes in the noir style. John Dahl created a niche for himself by filming the themes of adultery, extortion in the early 90's. Although I did not have much opinion about the last temptation. But nowadays Mr. Dahl used to directing television programs. This is a pity because the man had talent. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS ** It's quite an impressive movie that turns around a Cage driver. It comes to the town of Wyoming for a job. However, he is not happy and is being mistaken for a Texas hit by bar owner J.T Walsh. He gets the job of killing his wife (Boyle). But Cage decides to split after paying the prepayment without doing so. On his way out of town he accidentally hit a man on the road, which he then took back to the local hospital. At that time, Cage met Walsh, who also appears to be the local sheriff. Then the Cage escapes from his clutches, but he comes to the right hit Dennis Hopper. <br /> <br /> John Dahl wrote and directed this movie. It therefore means that a project can be decent when a director puts his mind on the screen. The direction is of good quality, but while watching the movie, I made a TV movie. There were too many nearby frames. However, this does not reflect the movie as a pleasant experience. The movie has a good fit and the structure was perfect. Dahl wrote the writing with a good price. <br /> <br /> Cage has portrayed the role as a drifter realistically, but for me, his performance was slightly limited. His facial expressions were on the point. Lara Flynn Boyle was warm and handled perfectly with the femme fatale. Her hair style was far-fetched and could leave any guy on his knees. Hopper played his part well. But I feel he is in a bad mood for this role. He did not convince me that he had the characteristics of a hit. The role is not written to keep his personality in mind. <br /> <br /> As you watch, you'll get deja vu from previous movies like 'The Hot Spot' and 'Perfect Murder'. Due to the fact that some sub-stands are similar. Overall if you are a fan of noir movies, then this one is for you. Possible recommended. 10/07
