For Tuscan air I saw Diane Lane's tender performance in this other lick of a movie. Campers are invited to camp of their youth and experience it as adults. Anyone who comes back looks for something they've lost, which makes it so realistic. Perhaps you should be a camper to get it really, but in the words of one character who remarks, all her clothes are wet. "It's such a camp!" From the practical jokes and fighting over boyfriends, to the shabby lunch lady and the early morning bell ... this is amp. As soon as exciting activities occur everywhere. A great ensemble cast makes the best of one-two-dimensional roles and makes them credible. Bill Paxton, Diane, Elizabeth, Mrs. Brad Paisley (probably when he first falls for her!) The beautiful scenery, bright colors, comic music (including variations of Hello Muddah) and a comic play by well-known director Sam Raimi make it a movie you watch can stretch, such as looking for an old friend.
