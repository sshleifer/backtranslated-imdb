Really, I like it. The point of departure was good, the story is fit, where both have left the respective series, and here is my favorite part. Maria and Valerie are not bitter! They are not like others that become synonymous with a certain series and then refuse to talk about it or do possible reunions. (A prominent example is Susan Dey, "The Partridge Family"). In fact, Valerie said she would be excited to do another movie, and then Mary said the same later, so I'll look at the other ... but if it doesn't really work out then they can do this one export again.
