How can a movie be controversial and soft? This one does it with a near-perfect structure. No one wants their daughters to be athletes. Apparently, most cultures do not want their daughters to be small breasts either. Here we see a lot of excellent actors we have never heard before portraying people of different cultures who live fair lives until their female children want and have the potential to become professional footballers. The structure around the parallelism of the two cultures is wonderful. There is no condemnation. Both cultures are considered modern and valid. (And yes, both are also stupid). One mistake: the Hindu wedding was apparently hundreds of relatives, but not one child among them.
