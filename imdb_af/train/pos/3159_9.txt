... and in the series you can forget about it all. I'm about three years older than the kids portrayed in the series. Born in 1958, I learned to drive during the first guest shortage, and had my first post college graduation at the second guest shortage in 1979. The 70's were a really awful time to be young - inflation, competing for after school minimum - Wait to work with thirty seasons, terrible music, worse clothes. <br /> <br /> The funny thing is, this series doesn't ignore any of it and still manages the 70's to make fun, even for those of us who are old enough to know better. It manages to face the 70's directly - complete with time-authentic clothes - and yet the show full of youth hopes and things that make high and high school times the best of times and the worst. Then there are the parents. The two young lovers in the show - Eric Forman and Donna Pinciotti - have really terrible parents with the best intentions. Eric's parents, Red and Kitty, are not exactly June and Ward, although they are conventional for the decade. They represent what happened when the 60s eventually reached the suburbs during the 1970s. Donna's parents are two people who have been waiting for the 1960s to show their whole lives to give them strange legitimacy. Eric's friends Fez, Kelso, and Jackie group out the group that distinguishes the humility, significant incompetence and respectively. Hyde is an unusual teenager for a suburban performance, but he largely represents someone who has to play the cards he has dealt with, even when the cards are mostly absent and negligent. I have been recommending for eight seasons, although the season is a bit laughter for Eric's absence.
