I started the show of the first season, and in the beginning I was pretty skeptical about it. Original movie was kind of childish, and I was looking for some sci-fi programs while waiting for the BSG's new season. <br /> <br /> But after a few episodes I became a fan. I loved the characters - the not-so-stupid-as-you-think-he-is Jack O'Neill, the non-only smart Samantha Carter, the glamorous Teal'c, women and kids favorite and brilliant Dr. Daniel Jackson . <br /> <br /> Of course, stories aren't serious at times, sometimes even ridiculous, but mostly it's not about technology or space fighting. It's about your girlfriend, even to risk your life for him. It's about "we leave nobody behind". Struggle to the end when all hope is lost. About the free will and all the good qualities that one makes - Man. <br /> <br /> And now it's breaking a record, going 10th season, and still doing well.
