Atlantis was much better than I expected. In some ways it had a better story than the other films aimed at a higher age. Although this movie actually required a strong attention span. It was a good movie for all ages. I noticed that some of the younger audience expected a comedy, but had an adventure. I think everyone is tired of an endless parade of extreme parodies. Many of these children have seen nothing but parodies. After a short while, everyone seemed to be looking at Atlantis very intensely.
