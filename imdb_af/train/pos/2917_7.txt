While this movie is not classic by any stretch, it is very entertaining as I remember it. I saw it on HBO about 15 years ago and loved the movie. It's written by the same man who wrote and directed "Arthur" and although it's not as funny as this movie, it shows the potential that Steve Gordon has reached Arthur.
