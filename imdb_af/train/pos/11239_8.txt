Hidden Frontier is striking to be the longest running internet-based Star Trek fan series. Although the production quality does not focus on the same scale as fan productions such as Starship Exeter or New Voyages, Hidden Frontier focuses largely on story. In this respect, it is very good. <br /> <br /> Hidden Frontier has no physical sets; Instead, actors are filmed at a green screen, and the backgrounds are digitally inserted.
