"I just wanted to see you in the Purple Rain." It's an excellent movie. It had to be rearranged on PG-13. But anyway, Prince's first movie and the best. The sequel sucked. But I haven't seen for years, so here's what I can remember about it. The Kid (Prince) should juggle the victory over the love of his life, Apollonia (herself), keep his band together (The Revolution as themselves) and the tension in his family. But his rival (The Time as himself) destroys his life. As Morris (himself) tries to steal Apollonia from The Kid. Just like Saturday night Fever, Flashdance and 8 Mile. Very good. Hire it, laugh and cry and if you luv it, buy it.
