I found the only comment about this movie completely uninformative and totally too hard, so I decided to write my own. I only saw the movie when it came out and has caught it a few times since. First of all, let me say that the things that make this movie right are, in general, worthwhile. It doesn't matter that it has some low budget issues and other errors. It's worth watching. The idea of ​​filming Walt Whitman's visit to a limited, special Anglo-Canadian community in Southern Ontario and bringing people to life is a brilliant miss-and-act. The movie is about the kind of human catalysis that Whitman inspired in humans. And in that sense it is exactly accurate. The acting - especially by Rip Torn (Whitman) and Colm Feore as the doctor - is very good. The dissertation and dialogue are strong and give the necessary attention to the mores and inclinations of the time. Overall, what's not to like? Besides, mention another movie in which Whitman is brought to life alive?
