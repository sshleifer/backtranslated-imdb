See midnight Cowboy is like a master class in acting / director / cinematography / editing / writing. I was too young to see it when it was originally released and only saw it for the first time a few years ago, but it was absolutely the test of time and I have been watching it several times. <br /> <br /> Everything about this movie is brilliant, from the imaginative performances of Voight and Hoffman (although I know this movie well, I still find myself flashing one of his innocent painful looks every time, or Hoffman coughs in his sickly and ominous way to the beautiful cinematography and wonderfully edited dream series. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that more of our current filmmakers are not prepared to take a risk of making films that are so visually and aurally interesting. Midnight cowboy should be watched at all movie schools. <br /> <br /> 10/10
