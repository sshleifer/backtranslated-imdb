It couldn't have been better. The strong constraints on Mike Sullivan's expressions could not be portrayed in any other way. Tom Hanks delivers the best performance of his career. Young Tyler Hoechlin drives an emotional wheel; play the basic character for the story. And veteran Paul Newman has long been one of his best character performances. <br /> <br /> This movie is based on a daring graphic novel by Max Allan Collins and Richard Piers Rayner. It is a father / son story that basically uses the two candidates exclusively incompetent for the roles. Mike Sullivan didn't have a father as a child, so John Rooney took him. Although a generous man, Mr. Rooney engages in organized crime. Therefore, the debt of Sullivan is only payable to involve him in the business. Sullivan now has a wife and two children and tries to keep his children safe, but at the same time repays his boss. The events that follow will test Sullivan's loyalty and embrace the fate of his family. <br /> <br /> With a great adaptation by David Self, the dialogue rarely comes out, yet very good. The story unfolds in a beautiful 1930's setting (Brilliant Art Direction by Richard L. Johnson and Nancy Haigh) covered with a dark rainy (snow on the ground) outside. The story is Thomas Newman's wonderful Irish score, but only when needed. <br /> <br /> But the main technical element in the movie is the beautiful photography of Conrad L. Hall. These are some of the best movies I've seen; and I watch many movies. The scene when Mike and Michael are in the car is pleasant in Chicago. The shot starts in front of the car and reveals Mike (Hanks) through the windshield. It then crashes to the side of the car to wake Michael (Hoechlin) and extend his side window. As it goes on, it carries back and dolly back, completely around the car and reveals a beautiful scenic 1930s Chicago. <br /> <br /> With a big role player and crew, the founder creates a brazen incredible movie. I'm talking about Sam Mendes, who made his 1999 film debut with American Beauty. (won several awards). Before the American Beauty, Mendes worked as a theater director for the British Theater, but decided he wanted to continue saying that there was nothing in the theater for him. With just two films, Sam Mendes marked me as one of the great directors (in a list of about twenty-five) in my book. <br /> <br /> The movie illuminates a brazen genre that has its hits and brilliantly speaks the true theme. Photography, acting and story are phenomenal. I'm still waiting for Scorcesee's Gangs or New York, but now I'm confident to say it's the "Best Movie of the Year". Consideration of the competition (Signs, Insomnia, Minority Report) is a strong statement.
