I love this movie. It is well written and performed and has good cinematography. The story mixes action, humor, mysticism and tenderness with great sets and beautiful place shots. See it, buy it, show it to your friends. <br /> <br /> The acting is good and Murphy does a good job, portraying the reluctant / unlikely hero. I enjoyed all the characters and found them interesting and well-developed with dynamic interactions. <br /> <br /> I care what happened to these people and while the outcome was pretty predictable (the good guys win, the hero gets it). the amazingly attractive girl and the holy child save lives - who doesn't see it?), it still made me happy when everything worked out well. Thank you, this film's dignity is never ruined by an unfinished successor. Grab popcorn, hug on the couch, and watch this fun, happy and entertaining movie.
