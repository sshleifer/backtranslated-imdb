Guy Kibbee laughs at the viewer. Like most candidates, he knows almost nothing. Warren William, a much-appreciated actor, is great at giving Kibbee instructions; That is, he teaches him to say something that does not mean anything to the voting court. A campaign based on no comment, "I would recommend it," and "Maybe, but then again, maybe no," is the almost perfect way to win an election. Successfully, the thicker the candidate, the greater the chance he or she will win. The public can identify with such a person. With regard to the movie, it makes a lot of comedy.
