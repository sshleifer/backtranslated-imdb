This movie was as good as some of the other westerners who made Anthony Mann and James Stewart, such as Winchester '73 and The Naked Spur, and much better than Thunder Bay and Bend Of The River. This movie starts like a twist of the mill western but becomes more complex as it goes. It starts with Jimmy Stewart and Walter Brennan arrives in Seattle and Stewart is charged with murder. He is found not guilty, but cattle are stolen by a corrupt judge. Stewart agreed to lead something, but I forgot what it was, but Stewart just gave up getting his cattle back. As the movie goes, it's just like Stewart just cares for himself, just like his character in the Naked Spur. It gets much better at halfway after arriving in Alaska. This is one of Stewart's better westerners.
