Canadian film producer Mary Harron is a cultural dressing room whose previous films only laid the artistic remains of the sixties and hollow eternal nineties. With 'The Notorious Bettie Page' she shows her unwavering eye to the fifties of America, an era that has been cut into the moral justice of Joe McCarthy while experiencing the start of a sexual awakening that has the free love of the next. will lead decade. Harron and her co-author Guinevere Turner are clearly not interested in the standard biopics of a gender symbol. It is a film about the underground icon of an era and how its pure unashamed sexuality revealed both the predator instincts and unclean thoughts of a culture through the beauty of a naked body. If the details of Bettie's life were concerned about the movie, why did it end before her most tragic period was about to begin. Clearly, Harron is increasingly interested in America's attitude toward sexual imagery. Along with a fearless head performance by Gretchen Mol and the beautiful atmospheric cinematography of W.Mott Hupfel III, she achieved this goal wonderfully, holding a mirror in the past while hearing their own "enlightened" 21st century attitude towards so-called pornography. . As America suffocates under a new conservatism, it's a film more than ever needed.
