She has the audacity to put herself into a rare difficult girl role very early in her career, which is an achievement to be recognized. Although her later film plays the same role for her, this film made her robust. <br /> <br /> Her character is a romantic student / fighter / lover who struggles to overcome her disillusioned existence in the projects. a little exaggerated in film ... but not by a girl. The aspect of this movie is not very original, but the story goes in depth when the confusing relationships that this girl has to deal with are cooked and her overburden is over. <br /> <br /> I did "When an actress is seen, he takes such an aggressive attitude in the movie, and I'm glad she gets the original twist there in Hollywood.
