I originally saw this movie years ago at Cinemax on Friday after dark series (back when the cable box was built like a keyboard), and it irrigated me. Although there is a meaningful aspect of the film, it is well-behaved. The performances of Depardieu & Dewaere are very pleasant. They have a good chemistry together and Miou-Miou makes a pink coat so breathtaking. A movie like this will probably not be made in these politically correct times (at least not in the US), as it seems to be sensationalizing things like violence, robbery and casual sex. This film proves that having a talented role-player and also a talented director of a good movie is a good movie, no matter what the subject is. It's my sadness to commit Patrick Dewaere suicide and in the near future I'll check him with Depardieu & Miou -My in your towel.
