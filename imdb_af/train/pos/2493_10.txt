Typical 90's comedy, situational comedy similar to our contemporary "My Family". Thatcher is the highlight of most political jokes, Bill (Belinda Lang) blames Thatcher for anything she can. "Bloody Thatcher" may be shared with most of us. David the typical teen, brain brain with bread knives, Jenny, the moody, older teenage child, who is only interested in boys and more boys. Bill and Ben work as much as they can to combat their family in the economic climate in the early nineties. Granted the first two series were not as successful as the latter, but series 3 and beyond is where it all starts with more laughter that I like to count. Overall, this show did not have the best times and had to last a little longer. clear that they could not go on after Gary Olsen died, but I think they should get rid of "catherine Tate" "the office" "little Britain" and bring the classic back!
