"The Student of Prague" is an early drama for feature film or, rather, it is an "author film" (ie a writer's movie). This film is a member of a movement of many movements trying to give respect to cinema, or just making a profit by adapting literature or theater to the screen. Fortunately, the story of this book with moving pictures is good. Using Alfred de Musset's poem and a story by Edgar Allen Poe, it focuses on the doppelg√§nger theme. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the most movie that this film gets is the double exposure effects of Paul Wegener appearing twice in screens. Guido Seeber was a special effect wizard for his day, but he is not very good at positioning or moving the camera. Film writer Leon Hunt (printed in "Early Cinema: Space, Frame, Narrative"), however, made an interesting analysis on this movie using framework to reinforce the double theme: characters are divided by left / right, near / far and front / diagonal frame of characters and shots. Regardless, the film mostly consists of long long shots from a fixed position, which is noticeably primitive. Worse is the lack of editing; There is very little scene dissection and scenes. None of these is unusual for 1913, but there were more advanced films in this regard around the same time, including the better parts of 'Atlantis' (August Blom, 1913), 'Twilight of a Woman's Soul' (Yevgeni Bauer, 1913) and the short films by DW Griffith. <br /> <br /> An extensive universal film vocabulary by 1926 will make a much better remake possible. Furthermore, the remake has a reason for the Lyduschka character, except to be an occasional troublemaker and spectator surrogate. Here, apparently, the striking gypsy acted, with a mantle of invisibility. I know their world is quiet to me, but I suppose their lips move and so their world won't keep silent for them, so how can Lyduschka learn about others' shoulders and not be noticed? <br /> <br /> However, this is one of the most interesting early films conceptually. Wegener, who appears to be the lead behind this movie, later starred in the title role and worked with The Golem in 1920. It helps to further the supernatural thread in German silent cinema. . <br /> <br /> (Note: The first version I saw was about an hour (probably not completely finished) and was in a bad state, with sometimes bleached faces and so on). I'm not sure who was the distributor, I've also seen the Alpha DVD, which failed missing footage in the previous 41 minutes and also has fewer and many different title cards, but visually not that bad. best muted, though.)
