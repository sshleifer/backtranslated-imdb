By 1945, and after a rope of solid WWII propaganda, Errol Flynn's hold on the US box office began to decline, despite the increasing burden of deviant appearance he began with a series of films related to genre that used to make its name: the swashbuckler. The first of these was a good one. - ADVENTURES OF DON JUAN (1948) - but it was also his last major Hollywood star. The rest of his sword-bearing days have been spent throughout Europe. In England for Kim (1950), THE MASTER OF BALLANTRAE (1953) AND THE DARK AVENGER (1955), IN FRANCE FOR ADVENTURES OF CAPTAIN FABIAN (1951) AND ITALY FOR THE ABORTED WILLIAM TELL STORY (1953) AND THE SO called KROSSED SWORDS (1954). However, Hollywood has watched him over to his old yachting ways - although he had a modestly budgeted Universal picture rather than a Warner Brothers A production he was accustomed to at peak time. <br /> <br /> However, the glorious Technicolor cinematography is exalting here and while a older and faster Flynn can resemble the light shadow of its former self, its redhead vehicle Maureen O'Hara has a field day as a tomboys buccaneer leader who longs for romance and wants to be treated like a lady. Anthony Quinn has been away from his bigger-than-life main vehicles for a few more years, so here he is typically seen as the bad - pirate captain Roc Brasiliano, a role he attacks with gusto. Like the BLACK SHIELD OF FALWORTH (1954) - a performance that preceded this - AGAINST ALL FLAGS takes me back to my cherished childhood of constant TV watching as cute Hollywood movies were the order of the day on both the local and neighboring Italian channels. <br /> <br /> For all that I know, it may have been the very first pirate movie I've ever seen, and I cut the thought of today's generation of youths who believe the devastating pirates of CARIBBEE trilogy is what buccaneering is about! As I said earlier, the best pirate wars may never be on display at all, but this is a good example of this productive genre. Nowadays, the strange perseverance of the childish Indian princess (Alice Kelley) can be one of the most stupid of her pirate prisoner Flynn, but the rest of it - despite the heights of the seaport (1940) and the black SWAN (1942 ), to name the best shipping companies of its various stars - is fast and fairly enchanting. By the way, the movie will be tackled later than THE KING'S PIRATE (1967) with Doug McClure! <br /> <br /> Worthwhile, the unparalleled cashier success of that unappealing modern franchise is likely to be that impressive reluctant movie studios to pick up their catalog swashbuckling titles and release them on DVD, and AGAINST ALL FLAGS itself was the one jewel in Universal's poorly-thought out Pirates Of The Golden Age Movie Collection, which also consisted of obscure foam such as BUCCANE'S GIRL (1950, with Yvonne De Carlo ), DOULE CROSSBONES (1951; with Donald O'Connor) and YANKEE BUCCANEER (1952, with Jeff Chandler)! Value for money, maybe but so far I have only acquired the Errol Flynn movie from other sources. even if the mood strikes me in the future, I want to establish my hands on similar marine adventures such as Edward Dmytyk's MUTINY (1952), the former YANKEE BUCCANEER and PIRATES OF TORTUGA (1961).
