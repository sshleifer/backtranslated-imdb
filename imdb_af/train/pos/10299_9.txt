I'm a huge Jim Carrey fan. I was assassinated during Liar Liar and Ace Ventura. I also love him in his serious movies, especially Truman Show. This one is a cross between his very funny side and his serious side. He is, of course, very funny in this movie, but there are parts that are very serious and he pulls it off with ease. He is truly a multi-function actor. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the cast, I was happy with Jennifer Aniston's play. I think she's more than just some nice tits and good ass. Morgan Freeman makes a very cool god. As far as Steven Carell is concerned, his limited scenes are very funny, especially in the anchor scene. <br /> Overall, I'll have to rate it a 9. Good acting, funny writing and some very serious situations make it a very good movie.
