Johnny Danger falls completely into the hit or miss category with his remaining gags and complete lack of a comprehensive script or story that makes any sense. But that's the point, right? <br /> <br /> The role play is nice; Michael Keaton is an excellent cartoonist before he took himself too seriously. Griffin Dunne, Peter Boyle, Joe Piscopo, Marilu Henner and Danny DeVito all play with enthusiasm and at least get a lot of laughs from me. But the full play story here is Richard Dimitri (the word "Iceholes" in film history) as a mobster who is the best at the murder of the English language. <br /> <br /> I associate many children's memories with this movie, as I watched it very often, maybe I tend to enjoy it more than many others. Johnny Dangerously is at least a completely innocent gangster movie spoof that even relieves good messages about the dangers of smoking (and sex). <br /> <br /> I like it, but it's hard to recommend. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10.
