Absolutely the very first movie that killed me. I caught it when my older brother (r.i.p.) watched it. It was on a black and white TV and not really a good picture, but it was of interest to me. Shortly afterwards my people bought a color set, and as luck would have it, the Million Dollar Movie would show it one Sunday. <br /> <br /> I forgot most of the plot, but it didn't take long ... and I was so scared that I slept hard that night! I guess it was just a movie, but it had a creature that didn't just come out of space, but you couldn't hear it or see it ... and once you got it, Too late. Even now, after all this time, it sends me a while on my spine. A real classic, and even better a classic I've seen, scares the pants of a new generation! <br /> <br /> Long Life The Blob!
