And that's why historical / biographical movies are so important to all of us, and also when they're done so well, like this one! <br /> <br /> Before I saw "The Young Victoria", I knew a few things about Queen Victoria, but in the end I got more knowledge about it. <br /> <br /> Emily Blunt is just GREAT as Victoria (who will guess!) and she will probably get a nomination at Oscar's. Personally, I rejoice for her ... <br /> <br /> For technical issues, I'm happy to say it's a very successful production, with wonderful Art Direction / Set Decoration and of course as it was expected. be a great periodic costume design! <br /> <br /> The one downside is that I want to see more and more about this interesting queen, but especially amazing woman and mom! <br /> <br /> BRAVO: 9 out of 10!
