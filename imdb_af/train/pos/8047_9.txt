I accidentally happened on this movie and enjoyed it a lot. Timothy Busfield's character is without detached features, and at one point, Busfield and star Meloni enle all women as they pass by. Meloni's actions are different to Busfield's. Janel Maloney is great. She looks very much like Tea Leone, but the big difference here is that Janel can actually act. Some very nice things in this movie and worth your attention when on the cable.
