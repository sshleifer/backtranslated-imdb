I saw this movie a few weeks ago, and it's been stuck in my head ever since. It stars two spellbinding characters in unfortunately a mediocre documentary. To get the real story of the Beales, I had to search and search the bonus material and commentaries of all the DVDs on the web. <br /> <br /> Although the Maysles and their supporters (Edith and Edie didn't even mention) brush on the suggestion that this movie is exploitation, it is exploitation in the true sense of the word. There was a lot of effort to explain the Beales or how they were in the condition they were in. The Maysles approach seems to be just turning on the camera and waiting for Edith and Edie to say something out of the question. The sound, even on the criterion, is poor and difficult to follow. Although I appreciate it, this film was made a bit early in the history of documentary film. It is ironic to compare it with Geraldo Rivera's (!) Far superior series on the sexual abuse of mentally handicapped patients at Willowbrook State School in Staten Island from 1972, four years before Gray Gardens was shot. <br /> <br /> To paraphrase a review in the New Yorker, there were many things that Edith and Edie needed in their lives, and a documentary was not one of them. <br /> <br /> As for Edith and Edie, the thing I was thinking while watching the movie was "where's hell their family"? They were in dangerous, unhealthy, unsafe conditions. How is it that Jackie O, married to one of the richest men on earth (or the rich Bouvier family himself) could not afford to get Edith and Edie a decent home? Or at least hire a part-time housekeeper or caregiver to go in and keep an eye on them? It's scandalous and a lasting disgrace to the entire Bouvier family. <br /> <br /> Although this review may be negative, I would recommend Gray Gardens to anyone who enjoys documentaries. Perhaps someone will one day come and do a documentary documentary on this documentary - including the rich background (and background) of the Beales and the entire subdivision of the Hamptons community in the 1970s.
