When I saw Birthday Girl, I liked it so much that I saw every Nicole Kidman movie I could, just to find a disappointment to all. I theorize it while the presence of a particular star usually guarantees a certain level of quality because of their artistic control, with Nicole Kidman being the influence she exerts, detrimental to movie entertainment - IMHO. For example, Dogville even deprives the viewer of anything visually to detract from the existential insight she has hammered into or other films that promote gay and lesbianism than worthy of anyone else's attention or other pet causes of Kidman. <br /> <br /> Here she is a natural woman and she does a very good job. I don't know how or what was able to limit her, but apparently it worked. The way the film portrays her openness despite her resistance comes to the heart of what a woman makes a woman. And so, what makes a man's most desperate hope possible. <br /> <br /> Of course, the fact that the male leadership of a milquetast clerk changes to a macho man in the space of one movie, such as a male ego expansion fantasy, but his transformation is sufficiently credible. It is not briefly confronted, as it will be in a movie to strengthen male ego. Instead, the necessary growth is accurately reported arising from the movie's unique circumstances. <br /> <br /> Also beautiful is the way in which criminals are portrayed as completely human, apart from their criminal mission. Her gang has a rough and tumultuous community that is foreign to American culture. And while they are his adversaries, they are never his enemy. In fact, they teach him to compete. <br /> <br /> I was really amazed at Kidman's ability to physically appear Russian. It asked me if her ancestor was Russian, but none of the photos of her that I investigated showed a hint. Maybe it's just makeup, but it was wonderful. <br /> <br /> I can only hope they beat her over the head again so she can do another good movie. Despite my gratuitous digging at Mrs. Kidman, the message is that it is a superior movie in every respect and probably the role of a lifetime.
