I returned Soylent Green back in 1973 when it was first released and maybe eight times over the years on T.V. or video. It was always one of my favorite sci fi and / or Charlton Heston movies. <br /> <br /> Recently, the Egyptian theater in L.A. A twelve film Charlton Heston had retrospective. I flew from outside the country to see six of the films over a two-day period. Soylent Green looks good on the big Egyptian screen with a perfect new print. Charlton Heston as a police spokesperson living in a dog eats dog world with little natural resources and no understanding of how it is going. the world was and Eddie Robinson as a man who remembers the past is both great. <br /> <br /> Together, their chemistry is wonderful. The film also looks so much better in a good 35mm print. Fleisher really knows how to fill the screen, and the cinema rhythm, writing, music used, and everything about it. The film is also very powerful in its dark and very possible future view. Just think about how the world population has grown, the rainforest that has disappeared, the resources being used, the greenhouse effect worsened since 1973. I just wonder why this movie has not played in theaters for many years. His reputation must be better. <br /> <br /> Speaking of reputations, people often speak as if Charlton Heston is not a good actor. To see him in El-Cid, Soylent Green, The Warlord, The Omega Man, Will Penny, and Major Dundee, I'm convinced he's one of our best actors. Of course, he made about a dozen other great movies and for those who care you know what they are. <br /> <br />
