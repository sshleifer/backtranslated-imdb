What can be said about the compelling performance of Tara Fitzgerald? She is completely credible as the injured Mrs. Graham, who is hardened by experience, sharp and strong-willed, but not immune to the passionate attention of Mr. Markham didn't. Through every impenetrable look and every flash of mood, every flash of distinction in his eyes and with facial expression, Toby Stephens is a master of his character. He is the power of passion and hope that will restore Helen's injured spirit. Graves' Huntingdon is a perfect show of the irreparable villain. In spite of everything he did, there was an unmistakable human dignity in his refusal to play the hypocrites at the end; he is at least aware of his own failures and how they have brought down. Helen's attempt to save his soul - after he left him and at a time when it was unprecedented - is a triumph of hope, hope and faith in the value of every human life and soul, but wrong, but sin that person may be. Markham's constancy can then be seen as her reward for her faith and unrelenting moral character. Although the much sought after morality ideas in Tenant seem to be obsolete by today's standards, the story is sustained with integrity, passion and beliefs that still impact. Tenant is much more credible than Wuthering Heights or even Jane Eyre; here is an adaptation that does the novel justice. I recommend seeing it!
