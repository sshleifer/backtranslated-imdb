I loved watching Friday's "Sabrina, the Teenage Hitch" to ABC's TGIF. I think it was one of the best shows on TGIF. My friends and I met every Friday to see just this show and we never missed an episode. <br /> <br /> My favorite character was Salem. He was rich and so funny. I also liked Sabrina's boyfriend Harvey. He was warm. I think Melissa Joan Hart also played a good teenage witch. My favorite episodes were "Sabrina Through the Looking Glass" and "Hilda and Zelda: the Teenage Years". These episodes were wonderful. <br /> <br /> Overall, I really miss this show. One day I hope ABC brings it back with new episodes. I give this show 10/10 stars.
