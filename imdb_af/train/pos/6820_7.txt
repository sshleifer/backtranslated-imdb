The movie was much better than the other reviewer said. It's a nice family movie. It has a fun fantasy aspect of a time trip. The story revolves around a 14-year-old girl who accidentally finds a way to travel back in time in the old elevator of her apartment. Of course, no one believes her if she tries to explain her disappearances. She finds and makes friends with a girl about her age and can help the girl's family in many ways. She can also help her long-term relationship with her father. It reminds me of a Hallmark movie, so give it a chance and decide for yourself. It was more aimed at children about 6-12 years old (maybe a little older) and this is pretty much PG or G rated. I am an adult who can appreciate a good "family" movie - I think the other reviewer is.
