************** Possible fairy tales ********** There is only one reason I saw this movie and that was because I had a massive loved one at Richard Belzer has. I don't know much about humor) There was a part that was funny like the Barbie and Ken Spoof and the merchants and the president shoot. Remember you are sometimes racist (dare, I say rude?) It was sometimes funny, but it could have been better. Probably if they spend more time in humor and less time to pull out women, the movie would have been more beautiful. Some sketches just make you want to gag, and cringe, other sketches make you laugh and think strangely enough. Unfortunately, this movie is dated. If you have a mad lover on Richard Belzer (it's worth it), it's worth checking out and seeing chevy chase.
