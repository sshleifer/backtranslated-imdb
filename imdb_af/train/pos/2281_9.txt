There are numerous films related to World War II, but Mother Night is very distinctive among them. In this film we are introduced to Howard Campbell (Nolte), an American living in Berlin and married to a German, Helga Noth (Lee), who decides to accept the role of a spy: More specifically, " A CIA agent Major Wirtanen (Goodman) recruits Campbell who becomes a Nazi propagandist to enter the highest echelons of the Hitler regime. The deal, however, is that the US government will never admit Campbell's role in the national security war, and so Campbell becomes a hated figure in the US. After the war he tried to hide his identity, but the past came back and haunted him. His only "friend" is Wirtanen, but even he can't do much for the deluge of events falling on poor Campbell. <br /> <br /> As we see Campbell's tragedy which, although a great patriot, is being treated with contempt by all who surround it, the story becomes very much alive. Not only that, but he also gradually realizes that even those closest to him have many secrets of their own. Vonnegut gives us a moving atmosphere, builds up with Campbell's despair and almost chokes the viewer. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Nolte plays the role of his life; He is even better than in "Affliction", though he plays tragic figures destined for self-destruction in both roles. Sheryl Lee is also excellent, and the same can be said for the whole role in general. <br /> <br /> I didn't read the book, so I can't figure out how to compare the movie. Anyway, it's not important here: My criticism is the movie, and the movie deserves a 9/10 whole heart.
