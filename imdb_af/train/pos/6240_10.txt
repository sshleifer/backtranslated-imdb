Dog Days is one of the most accurate movies I've ever seen in modern cities. It is very hard and cruel on some points and unfortunately it is very close to reality. Isolation, despair, deep emotional death, problematic issues, perversion, complexity, insanity. All the things that are present in the big advanced cities of today. This again makes you busy with the miserable state in which people have led the community. <br /> <br /> The negative side of life in the city has never been so beautifully displayed on the screen. I just wish it was a lie. Unfortunately it is not. That's why ... 10/10.
