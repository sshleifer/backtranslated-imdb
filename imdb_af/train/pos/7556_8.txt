Well, it was a nice, good, good episode. Much better than the credit it receives. <br /> <br /> The camera work is great. Best of all. I like the last shot. The atmosphere is fantastic, the costumes are good and the guests (minus the helpless victims) are strong. <br /> <br /> What I don't like about this episode is that many things are left inexplicable. why does it change sex? what is the purpose? And they are strangers? what kind? Why were they never again shown in later mythology? <br /> <br /> I give this episode a high THREE stars. Another of my favorites, but the plot holes bothered me. Yet ... it won't ruin my entertainment.
