An excellent film depicting the cross streams in the lives of a multi-ethnic blend of not so ordinary people in the rural Pacific Northwest. Solid directs and writes with fine acting, especially the performances of Kwami Taha and Dan Stowe. Interestingly, this film was made in the same year as the highly successful "Crash", written and directed by Paul Haggis. The pace of the action may not be as daunting as it is in urban Los Angeles, and the characters may be better acquainted with each other in "Apart Van That", but the personal relationships of the characters are so faulty and upset and their stories as resonant like any of those in "Crash." For the viewers who appreciated "Crash", it's a movie they should see. Also fans of Jim Jarmusch and John Cassavetes will keep this movie.
