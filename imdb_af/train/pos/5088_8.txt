I never had an inkling when I watched the movie that meant it to the idiot box. I always thought it was a very good successful movie of the late 90's. But after watching the internet for the TV, I was shocked that it was absolutely fantastic for a television movie. <br /> <br /> The thing that worried me most was the length. I felt the one had to be removed on one battlefield because it was completely unnecessary. It also started until the end when the adventure never seems to end. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, there is a strong, very interesting and engaging plot with great performances by everyone. I just felt that Patrik Frayze looked a little. I also felt that Gogool, which looked thirsty, had become a little silly at some scenes. <br /> <br /> I was delighted with the beautiful landscapes of Africa. Also in the first half of the movie I would have made the movie a 9. Still, it's a good movie for the television. 8 out of 10.
