An inventive, exciting exercise in claustrophobia. A Japanese thriller that presents him with a difficult challenge by being completely in two rooms. Not quite successful, but naughty, surprising and benevolent. One might find the SAW movie? two men trapped in the room and bumping against each other ?? but unlike the movie, dare to stay in the foreground and hold the hero in his cell through the film. It's like watching a lab experiment. Some people find the included tension boring, but this reviewer found it satisfactory. The sound and footage of the film is surprisingly well-realized. It is definitely a good movie to use to show a good home video system. Just right for a late-night film festival, if you're in the paranoid mood. It woke me up the night.
