As a long Red Sox fan, I just had to watch the movie. It was wonderful! While there may never have been enough live footage of the Wonder Soo 2004 season, some of my favorite Red Sox players have had good photos. While the movie is definitely a movie, it has enough baseball material from the wonderful 2004 Red Sox return to make it one of my top 10 movies of all time. I especially enjoyed the Red Sox fans who were part of Ben's baseball family. The scene Ben met with his friends on draft day to find out who gets seats for some games is hilarious! A must see if you are looking for a healthy movie to watch with your spouse, date or significant others ... especially if you are a baseball fan ... and even more if you are a Red Sox fan !!!
