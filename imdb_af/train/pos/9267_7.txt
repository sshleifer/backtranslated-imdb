Not a bad movie. Somehow I was made to root for the Iranians to win the game in the movie, although I don't know anything about football and not a fan. The end of the bus was exciting. <br /> <br /> The film itself deals with the issue of women in Iran and how they are not allowed to enter sports grounds among men, because their curse is inappropriate for women to hear. . Despite this law, some women are trying to sneak in, but many of them are being caught and detained. It is really surprising that any society can still have such outdated gender attitudes. Panahi said in an interview that his films were documents of history and his injustices, and that one day we could see these movies and see how Iran ever lived. One hopes that the future will come rather than later.
