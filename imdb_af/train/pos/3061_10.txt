This movie shows the kind of ensemble work you want in every movie. Barbara Bain and Donald Sutherland (who play husband and wife) are positively chilled, and discuss the "family business" as if it were a grocery store or dry cleaners. Macy, Campbell, Ullman and Ritter are great too. They play each other like members of a top theater studio, realizing that a quality product needs every actor to support others unselfishly. And finally there is Sammy (David Dorfman). What a wonderful performance of a child ... and what an unprecedented deal with Ullman, whose son he plays! <br /> <br /> We are treated to a unique story in "Panic" and this is a rarity In these days of tired, formal shit. The dialogue is sharp and clever, however, this relatively short film has the power to evoke a full range of viewer emotions. There are places to laugh, to be shocked, to be frightened, to be sad, to wake up, to be angry and to love. It's not a movie that makes you happy, but when it's over, you're more than happy to know you've spent the last 90 minutes. A good piece of work from us. <br /> <br /> More of us would go to the theaters if we deal with the quality price. When will the powers in Hollywood wake up? This is a real shame when something this good fails to get exposure outside of parties and households that are fortunate enough to have cable.
