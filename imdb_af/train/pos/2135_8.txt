Will our dance be an excellent movie, as it shows how something like dance can rejuvenate the life-flow in the human spirit. Dance is seen as the expression of existence and the birth of individuality. This is definitely the case with Aoki. At work, he is a humble office denizen, but places him on the dance floor and all his bottled intensity is released. Surprisingly, this release is rejected in Japan because of the rigid culture of similarity. At the beginning of the film, all the characters are ashamed or afraid of their desire to dance. They will be despised or deemed to express their passion through dance. <br /> <br /> This movie is worth watching to see the rebirth of human emotions and passions. It will leave a smile on your face for days.
