Unlike another user who said this movie was sucked (and that Olivia Hussey was terrible), I didn't agree. <br /> <br /> This movie was incredible !!!!!! Olivia Hussey is wonderful in everything she's in! Yes, she can be older, because many remember her from Romeo and Juliet, but she is wonderful! <br /> <br /> This story line can often be used, but it is a unique movie and I will fight back on anyone who disagrees! I enjoyed this movie just as much as I have another Olivia Hussey movie. Olivia's "my girlfriend" and I love her work. <br /> <br /> I saw and fell in love for the first time on Saturday (4/14/07). Not just because it is an Olivia movie, but because of its unique story line and wonderful direction.
