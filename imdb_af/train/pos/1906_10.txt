Unfortunately, 8 simple rules to meet my teenage daughter were the last sitcom that John Ritter worked after his tragic death in 2003. He was one of my favorite actors. He had it all, comedy (which can forget him in Three's Company), but he was also an excellent dramatic actor. (Unforgettable effort to watch TV movie.) So much I loved all the other role-players of the show (Katey, Amy, Kaley and Martin) John was THE star, he was much of the reason why show was, and it was his perfect comic delivery that could crack me every time. <br /> <br /> I loved how the show wasn't so sweet (as much as I loved The Cosby Show, come on, it was too nice for each other). They brilliantly portrayed the typical family dynamics. It was realistic enough with all the brothers and sisters and the ships between parents, but they still kept it funny. Many American sitcoms are trying to fill the shows entirely with morals and what not, and this show did not. Yes, there were some, like tackling important issues, such as drugs and bullies, but they didn't try anything but a fun family comedy. <br /> <br /> The way they did John's death in the Show was brilliant, I still understand like a baby every time I see it. You can feel how grief the emotions were during those incredibly difficult episodes. <br /> <br /> I'm sad the show is canceled, I still enjoy watching the reruns, and I never get tired of it. <br /> <br /> John Ritter, you will always be remembered for your hilarious portrayal of this overprotective father, who would rather close his daughters in their room than they date a boy =) You rock ritter !!!
