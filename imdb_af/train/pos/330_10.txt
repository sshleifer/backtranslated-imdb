I am Italian and when I recently watched this movie, I was amazed at his beauty: the first time I was 10 years old and I liked it, but today I can appreciate it with mature minds and feelings. Now I can understand it was a masterpiece of a special season of Italian theater (Pasolini etc.), by then. <br /> <br /> The Hollywood epic movies are good ... for fun. Maybe this "Odyssey" didn't have an English version, because it's not enough funny ... not suitable for popcorn and cousins. However, suitable for Homerose pathos and existentialist reflection. <br /> <br /> In Italy, a very good DVD version has recently been released: INTEGRAL, with excellent colors. You can find it in some file sharing, but it is only Italian and without captions. Too bad: even the dialogues and voices of this film are remarkable.
