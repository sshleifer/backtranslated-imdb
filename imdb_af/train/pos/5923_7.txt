A woman who hates cats (Alice Krige) and her son (Brian Krause), moved into a small town and has to deal with an average teacher (Glenn Shadix), their blood-related relationship, a lovely girl (MÃ¤dchen Amick) and one hell a great secret. <br /> <br /> Well so technical, it's a bad movie. But who cares? It's so much fun! <br /> <br /> Impossible things (with maize) happen, people touch on kitty cats, there are bad one-liners, there is too much cheese to handle! <br /> <br /> So yes. You will enjoy it. Very. It will not move you, touch you, scare you, or excite you in any way, but it will entertain and laugh!
