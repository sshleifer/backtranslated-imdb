A long film about a very important character from South Africa, Stephen Biko. He is one of the Blacks who did not survive apartheid, who actually died long before their normal time. However, the old film does not show how important Biko was, which he really represented. His life and teaching are limited to a few, at best, some witty remarks. The 1987 film was aimed at pushing South Africa over the edge that would lead her to liberation. The film is therefore aimed at showing how irrationally the South African supporters of apartheid were in 1987. To show this, the film should look beyond Biko's death and therefore not place his discourse on Biko, but on a white liberal journalist and his escape from the absurd system in which he lives. His escape is made essential because of the victimization he is the victim of, along with his family, and because he wants to publish the first book on Biko after death, and that can only happen in England. The film shows a way to escape South Africa, while apartheid still stands and kills. So don't expect this way to be realistic and true. It can not be. But the movie is immensely outdated because it does not show South Africa with any historical abomination, the much distortion that has taken place under Nelson Mandela's presidency and it is called forgiveness, has voiced those who want to be forgiven. The film is strong and emotional, but the very historic limit makes it quite weak today, especially as the film does not call the third racial community, the Indians. Panegirical books or films all have the defect: they look at the person who has to stand from one point of view alone. This explains why the movie is so much outdated, so long ago, as if nothing had changed completely. A remake is needed. <br /> <br /> Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Paris University 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, Versailles University Saint Quentin and Yvelines, CEGID
