There is nothing to keep from Moonstruck. I'm from an Italian family in New York and I actually get a little homesick when I see it. The actors and actresses, the plot, the subplots, the humor. They were all fantastic. It starts a bit slow, but a lot happens in those two days! I'm in love with LaBoheme because of this movie. On my favorite movie list is Moonstruck number 3. This is a "good movie" where you leave the scene "it's amore" or repeat from your favorite lines: "old man, if you give those dogs another piece of food , I'll kick you until you're dead "; "Chrissy, bring me the big knife", "who's dead", "you love him Loretta ..... well, because if you do, they drive you crazy because they know they can." I always put Moonstruck when there is nothing good to watch, because it makes me happy.
