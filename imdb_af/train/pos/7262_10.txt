My daughter, her friends and I literally watched this movie dozens of times. I bought it twice and a few little friends did it. Then I rented it so many times. It just never gets old !!! Blockbuster didn't even list it, and I tried to buy, find, rent it for over 5 years. Without a doubt, it was and is my favorite movie of my daughter's childhood ... it has everything! We laughed, we cried, we discussed the real life and how difficult some children have in the world. There is nothing pretending to be this movie. We cover every second and every line account! Thank you a million for restoring our faith in human nature. Sincerely, Shelleen and Kailin Vandermey. Craven, Saskatchewan. Canada, eh !!! :-) <br /> <br /> August '07 update: <br /> <br /> Who are we to judge whether a rich woman falls in love with a poor man; or a man who has love, chooses to collect a child who is not his own. It shouldn't be me or your life. It's not just credible, it happens every day. Thank God! Keep my faith in human nature alive !!! celebrate !!!!
