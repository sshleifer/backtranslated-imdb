Diane Keaton delivered an excellent performance in this rather sad but funny story involving a number of young people and their deep dark secrets. Diane Keaton, (Natalie), "The Family Stone", '05, who had a single daughter and loved her out of words. She always called her and told her, "Dorothy's surrender," which was an expression used in the "Wizard of Oz", 1939. A sudden car accident occurs and Natalie gets herself very involved with her daughter's friends and lovers. As Natalie investigates, the more truths find herself about herself and her real relationship with her daughter. Great movie to see and enjoy, especially the good that all the supporting actors observe.
