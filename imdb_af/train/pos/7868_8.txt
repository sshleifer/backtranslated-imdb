Again, Madhur Bhandarkar takes you on a drive to the wild side. And a remarkable one is it literally and figuratively. <br /> <br /> Mumbai Horseshoe - stars and stars, glass heads and witch doctors, business tycoons and broker types, the all-smelly fate - is in sharp focus here. In the typical tabloid mode, their worlds unfold with every colorful story a clever subplot in itself. <br /> <br /> A staggering asterisk plunged by the producer after she became pregnant, the flight attendant and her high-profile man, the pedophile businessman and his neurotic wife, the reporters and the police captain; all shades on each other and numerous colors in between. <br /> <br /> Bhandarkar does a swell to dig the dirt on drama kings, the dance queen and the living dead. Atul Kulkarni packs a punch, just like Boman Irani and Sandhya Mrudul. Konkona Sen Sharma is effective as the former crime reporter, but she could fit a little with the job change and the party job. <br /> <br /> Highly focused (running time 140 mins) and Refreshing other movie, worth the money.
