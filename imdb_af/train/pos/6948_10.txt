The first time I saw this episode was a shock to me, it was actually the first time I saw "24". The speed that is happening is wonderful, and it's so surprising, exciting, and even interesting, it's almost like reading a book. Once you start it, it's very hard to stop. From the moment Richard Walsh was private to Jack about the possibility that they had a mole inside CTU, and I sat at 6:40, which means 10 episodes !!! (Sounds funny and crazy, but I'm the kind of guy who if interested, he just can't stop.) This series is one of the best of its kind. And it builds in a way to have a few different stories that are interconnected. Recommended in every way!
