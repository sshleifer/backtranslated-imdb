Sleepwalkers are creatures that drain the life force completely out of man to survive ... but they can only use virgins (this is not explained why). Charles Brady (Brian Krause) is one to feed his mother Mary (Alice Krige). He follows Tanya (Madchen Amick). Will she escape? <br /> <br /> On the one hand, it's a BIG horror movie. Quick fit, lots of blood and gore and a nice, twisted sense of humor. There are lots of joke references for horror buffs (Castle Rock is mentioned once). Krause is also excellent (which would have thought he could go to "Back to the Blue Lagoon"), such as Kirge and Amick. But I find this movie annoying. <br /> <br /> It's written for the screen by Stephen King and it's maddeningly vague. The sleepwalkers are never fully explained. Where are they from? Why do they call it? Why should the boy feed the mother? Why do they hate cats and kill them? After all, what are their powers (at one point Krause makes a car disappear and change color and style!)? Why do they have to discharge people's life force? Why should they just be virgins? Why is the boy having sex with his mother? Not one of these is explained, and let the story be confusing. It's really bad because the questions are set aside, it's an excellent horror movie. Excellent makeup and special effects. <br /> <br /> Fast, fun and fun. If only the writing was better. Also a fairly explicit sex scene between Krause and Krige was edited (you can tell it) to get an R rating. I can only give it a 7.
