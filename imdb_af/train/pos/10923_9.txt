This movie is really good. The plot, which works like puzzle forces viewer to think and guess, what will happen next. Such a trick brings many surprises and makes a viewer really look forward to solving a mystery. Vegtonele is very good. There are many different styles of battle (although one of styles was a little unreal to me, but it's just my opinion) to watch and it's fascinating. The only thing that can be annoying is actors. A bit too effeminate (at least for me). Hong Kong was always good at kung-fu movies especially in the 70s and 80s, so "Five Venoms" (or other versions) is a good choice.
