The filmmaker has curled Andy Goldsworthy's art, his quest for the proximity of the land and the water, and his sense of relationships - and so quietly put it back so beautifully for the rest of us. "Rivers and Tides" love Goldsworthy's work and adhere to it as a visual concert of time and human presence in a flowing world, a world that conceals its power in a mere eye. See this movie!
