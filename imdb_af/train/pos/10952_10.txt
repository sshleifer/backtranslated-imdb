Sarah Silverman is a dangerous bitch! She is beautiful, sexy, funny and talented, dark and demonic. I read the other 'comments' on this show as well as the message board post and people just don't get it. Nothing that appears on T.V is an accident. Too much money, time and work is put into the production of a TV show because there are errors. This show is stupid because Sarah wanted to be foolish. This show is youthful because Sarah wanted to be. I thought the jokes were wonderful and the theme display as well as the other musical numbers were wonderfully bizarre. It's much like Pee-Wee's Playhouse for maladjusted, slacker twenty-something gum sniff, America's Future Pornstars from the Valley. The cast is awesome. The scenarios and action were well played. I hope this performance succeeds, as Comedy Central didn't keep David's spade. Who plays Sarah's sister? She is not in the site list on the show's homepage. I'd like to see her point of view. Does anyone of her upcoming show know dates or DVDs that can drive around there?
