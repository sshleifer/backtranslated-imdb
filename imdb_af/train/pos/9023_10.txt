A very eager, gutsy portrayal of part of world war 2 history, most of us in the US ever had, has never had an idea. I'd love to have it on video. This was just at t once I know, back in 89 or 90. I asked for this movie, and most video stores don't even know about it. Great actresses everywhere, wish I could see it again. Top notch series.
