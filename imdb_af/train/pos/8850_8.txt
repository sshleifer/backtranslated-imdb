Legendary director Sidney Lumet gives us in this very tense one of his best films in his historical career, and finally shocking story about a family that is dysfunctional as one of the children. With an A list led by Philip Seymour Hoffman (an Oscar-worthy performance here), Ethan Hawke, Marisa Tomei and Albert Finney, Lumet has not only captured elements of crime stories such as Reservoir Dogs, but also family stories such as Common People . <br /> <br /> Many viewers can be confused and uneasy about the construction of the plot. Lumet went here. Instead of pointing it in a linear fashion, he went the Tarantino Trail and the central scene of a robbery that was left out of sight at various points, all out of order. I personally found it to be very satisfying and constantly suggested what would happen. The writing is very strong with some excellent scenes between husband and wife, Hoffman and Tomei, as well as between father and son, Finney and Hoffman. All the actors are totally watching, and of course Lumet has the pleasure of leading a style that he usually does not dip. Lots of action and excitement to keep the audience running for the two hours, it's a rare movie that doesn't disappoint for a moment.
