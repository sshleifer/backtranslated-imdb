Just seen season 1 so far but it's just fantastic !! A wide variety of people sitting on an island. No one is what they seem to be and everyone looks like many skeletons in their closet. It sounds like Melrose Place meets the Crusoe family and why is it so good? It's probably not, but a spoonful of X Files, a dose of "what" ?? and a great "hey" and an island you've ever dreamed of - in your freakiest nightmares and you'll be lost. The story has so many twists and turns it is incredible. Great intent, solid acting with a liberating acceptance that at the end of man is human (good almost everyone ... I think ...) with good and bad sides. But odd, oh so strange ...
