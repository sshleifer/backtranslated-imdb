Wonderful cult film of 1979 in which students of Vince Lombardi High School are confronted with a new dictatorial principal named Miss Togar (Mary Woronov). Togar is a music hater and blames the musical taste of the students for their offenses. Riff Randell (PJ Soles), the # 1 Ramones fan, who wants more than anything, wants to record the song's songs. <br /> <br /> Now * this * is an impossible movie to resist. In the first place, the soundtrack is incredible, with songs from such artists as Alice Cooper and the Velvet Underground, in addition to the infectious, non-stop range of Ramones songs. "Teenage Lobotomy", "Sheena is a Punk Rocker", and "Blitzkrieg Bop" are just a few of them. Then the cast really gives it all, with Soles an ideal choice for Riff's role; she is a real joy. Vincent Van Patten and Dey Young are serious like Tom and Kate, Woronov is well thrown at the kind as the snooty and tiny Togar. Clint Howard has one of his best parts as a washroom occupying entrepreneur Eaglebauer and New World tribes such as Dick Miller. , Paul Bartel (especially fun as music teacher McGree) and The Real Don Steele are fun as always. And of course it's a surprise to see the Ramones playing themselves. <br /> <br /> The movie has real spirit. The energy level is high, with co-storywriter and director Allan Arkush who brings a lot of flair to the proceedings. There is also a good sense of humor. The paper plane gag is an excellent example of this. It goes straight to the "wipe" style of stage transition. There are even hilarious giant mice created by future makeup effects, Rob Bottin, in one of his earliest performances. <br /> <br /> About as good as a government-defending, defensive-one-legal film can get. "Rock 'n Roll High School" is simply a wonderful cult film. <br /> <br /> 8/10
