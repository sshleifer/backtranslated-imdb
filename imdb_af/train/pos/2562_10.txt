This is one of the greatest love story movies I have ever seen. Yes, I can agree that some parts may seem dated, but it does not detract from the movie. One should try to view, criticize and enjoy any art form from the time perspective. Apparently, according to the "Sex in the City" standards, Charlie Chaplin was terribly boring. But when he was judged by the 1925 prospective American, he was fantastic. Similarly, Sayonara is a breakthrough film in its gaze on a mixed-race love affair, American manifest destiny arrogance and bias, and the complexity of different cultures. This is a natural next step to such films as Gentleman's Agreement. Its purpose, however, was not just social commentary, but it was entertaining and enjoyable, with countless lines that one simply cannot forget. <br /> <br /> But even if it's only taken as a love story, it's great. Although some Brando's accents have been attacked, he is at his closest in nuance and characterization. Buttons and Umeki (who both won Oscars) and the rest of the supporting role play a lot in the film. <br /> <br /> The real star, Taka, makes a fantastic job that makes you feel the passion she has for Brando while being torn by her sense of commitment and loyalty. Her speech when she first meets and talks to Brando is a classic and something that rarely resembles cinema. The dialogue between Taka and Brando in her dressing room in Tokyo at the end of the film is equally good. Of course, it doesn't suck mouth, spit-swapping and worse, which exemplifies love in today's movies, but it does get better. It depicts true love and passion, not just "heat". If this movie doesn't touch you then you're just too young, too cynical or dead.
