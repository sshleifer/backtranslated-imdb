Fact: Stargate SG-1 is a cheesy sci-fi TV series. <br /> <br /> There are no escaping facts. How much you try to excuse or explain yourself. Stargate SG-1 remains a cheese sci-fi series. <br /> <br /> Stargate SG-1 borrows and steals ideas quickly. Special FX isn't nearly as impressive as they could have been and the action won't blow you off the chair. Or such a couch. <br /> <br /> But, and that's where I think Stargate SG-1 earns all the credit it can get, for every episode or stolen idea I think you can count on at least one cute sci-fi movie that is actually worse than a one-hour TV episode. <br /> <br /> In fact, some episodes were probably 90 minutes long and were even better than most movies. <br /> <br /> And to keep the quality and deliver and push the story further, Stargate SG-1 is special. <br /> <br /> I'm very picky with my choices. I might follow one or two TV series and I keep very high standards that made me even more surprised when I caught myself. <br /> <br /> So for those who decide to brush even more Stargate SG-1. Another tough sci-fi show, don't. Keep it up and you'll see what I'm talking about.
