I just did to watch "Julieia" on Showtime for the fourth time since I first saw it in July 2001. You'd think with the recent wave of serial killer movies the "California" among some of the previous movies would be worthy of mention but not. Perhaps it might be more successful if this movie was released between 1996-1999. In my opinion, "California" is very different from most serial killers released in the late 1990s. It has an almost completely different atmosphere from most of today's serial killer movies such as "Seven" or "The Bone Collector". Many ceremony films have shown a killer, but that person is always behind a mask or we never see enough of them to learn anything about them. "California" is a movie that actually tries to break through the barrier and actually understand the criminal mind. It tries to answer questions like "why do they do the things they do? Is it because of something that happened in their past? Does it make them better or powerful? Or do they do it because they keep the excitement of the murder?" "These are some of the things" California "are trying to answer, but also leave room for us to try things for ourselves. Brad Pitt makes an eternal impression as Early Grayce. When we meet early in the film, we see that he is, of course, a disturbed individual. When we first see it, it's late at night. Early may be drunk. We see him picking up a rock, throwing it out of a bridge, and it lands on the windshield of a passing car. Pitt is fiery in this movie. It is always good to see him playing psychos or bad people. It is funny that it will later lead him to a real wage as in "12 Monkeys" and that he will be on the other side of the spectrum in David Fincher's "Seven".
