I saw this movie in 1976, my first year of life in New York. I lived there for the next 26 years, but have never seen such a delicate and beautiful look like this little TV movie. It was part of a PBS series as I remember, and I never forgot it. <br /> <br /> There are no sex scenes to talk about, just delicate, moving, extraordinary moments full of excitement and excitement, all in a conservative Boston (I think), world war 1 environment where women played the role of dedicated woman in anticipation of the return of the man of war, and did not seek a career and financial independence. Frances Lee McCain is great in the role of career photographer and I spent the next 30 years searching her in equally challenging roles. <br /> <br /> There must be a video of this movie? Sure it should be on DVD, but surely at least a video?
