In what will probably find himself on my list of Fuller's best movies (that is, as soon as I see more of them than just this and Shock Corridor), Pickup on South Street is a film noir where the femme fatal as well as the male protagonist , is not the stereotypical in the genre. Like most of his other works, Fuller injects his own experiences and the sense of the New York style that is usually absent from the Hollywood noirs. On a small budget - at least for people like Darryl F. Zanuck-Fuller and his actors, people who are even pleasing in such a dark atmosphere. The good guys are basically the ones who won't get violent with you, even if they are looking for extra money. <br /> <br /> Richard Widmark, Jean Peters, and Thelma Ritter are all in the lead. Widmark is one of only a few actors I can think of who could really draw this character. He's a bit like Bugs Bunny, because he can be a wise man who is a bit sneaky. On the other hand, the character of Skip McCoy does have a set of values ​​in his life. He does not go out into other people's affairs and does not care for many of the world outside his small hut on the river after being sent away for three years. He slips up, unknown to him, when he picks up a Peters (Peters) on the train, and lifts an item under the eye of the government. It may have secrets that can make him a lot of money. But at what cost is the centerpiece of the movie, as it stools Moe (Ritter is one of the best and most credible characters of the era), the woman's ex (a fleeting Kiley) and the police. <br /> <br /> Apart from the thematic elements, which are told with a sharp dramatic journalistic style (such as Fuller's previous position, with boxer), the dialogue is fresh and involved. There is spontaneous movement in many of Fuller's camera. And what a third act. It's a lean, stiff film noir worth checking out, even if you're not familiar with Fuller (it's relatively less bizarre than some of its later works).
