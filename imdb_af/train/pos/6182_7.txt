This murder mystery with musical numbers is long on atmosphere and character, but rather short on tension and credibility. Based on a play by Broadway showman Earl Carroll and others, it combines a whodunit plot with a background atmosphere (a murder investigation takes place on the night at the theater where a musical revue is offered). <br /> <br /> The movie is impressive and varied: Tough gobbles Victor McLaglen as the police officer leading the investigation and never failing to learn idly at which showgirl is in sight; Jack Oakie (the pre-war Jack Lemmon ?? or was Jack Lemmon's post-war Jack Oakie?) As the harassed director who has to coordinate the increased performance as well as the chaos behind the scenes; the eternally homely Jessie Ralph as a dressmaker with deep, dark secrets; Dorothy Stickney, near the end, has a beautiful nearby monologue, as the proud girl fell in love with the male head; Carl Brisson, the Danish star, as that very masculine lead, who does not twist the classic "Cocktails for Two" once; Kitty Carlisle, operationally "Where do they come from and where are they going" and other Johnston-Coslow songs; the glorious Gertrude Michael, who previously divorced us, as a moderate showgirl whose love for Brisson is sworn; the usually ridiculous Toby Wing that is at least the center of a laughing joke here. <br /> <br /> When the plot complications get out of hand, there's always an interesting viewer or a fun music number to deduce. the viewer. The film's most celebrated sequence is the Marahuana number, led by Michaels, but apart from its controversial history, it is really one of the lesser musical offerings. All the songs here are performed as if they were actually a standard proscenium theater space, as opposed to the Busby Berkeley style cinematic fantasy set-up.
