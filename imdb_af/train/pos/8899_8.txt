What really represents the movie The 60s (to those of us who knew in that time in America's stomach) is the turbulence and diversity of the decade. Despite the exaggerated, stereotypical characters, the authenticity of the issues remains clear. <br /> <br /> Not only were those radical times of change, but also very confusing times. Then two basic things have changed our world: the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the overwhelming influence of the media. These two new freedoms have begun social changes, which are soon institutionalized. <br /> <br /> Sensitivity has come from chaos, values ​​have come to mind. Keep in mind, however, that most of the Americans were not involved ... they worked, they played, they watched the news ... and slowly they caused the efforts and struggles of the minorities ... the Civil rights workers, political activists, anti-war efforts, the poverty war. <br /> <br /> The representation of the power of the press and television in particular was well reflected, although the conflict between the general public's attitude and those who want to change things was best ignored. and at worst, misrepresented. Middle-class Americans weren't all around bad dog bats, or denying their dead daughters. They were also confused. Let's not forget how Folk Singers suddenly became Protest Singers, and how The Beatles started off with an assault that killed the people-protest movement. There are no Beatle songs in the movie, or even any mention of them. <br /> <br /> I think if you haven't lived the decade, you may not have a feeling about what the movie is about, the overall picture is a bit dull. At one stage I kept a steady job while my sister lived at the Hog Farm Commune and went to Woodstock. At another point I was in Haight Asbury and in the Detroit Riots while working and playing the housewife in Maine and Connecticut. Roles have changed constantly. <br /> <br /> The movie shows three middle-class brothers and sisters. They represent the hippie child, the political activist and the active military personnel. Dad represents the typical attitudes, and the mother represents the voice of reason, tolerance and sometimes compromise ... for the sake of peace. <br /> <br /> The Black family consists of a minister and his son ... out of proportion, I think. I suppose the producers knew all the variables and had to settle for restrictions, otherwise the film would have become a long, tedious, documentary. Dad's message was that anger caused bitterness, and bitterness caused chaos. This was clearly a message aimed at today's youth. <br /> <br /> We look at a unique solution to social problems, and also how issues are divided ... The 60's were unusual in that way, and only compared to the Roaring 20s. In other words, this movie has a moral one. Ultimately, it is our collective individualism that survives. Place it in your Oxymoron list. <br /> <br /> Everyone was a God, a Guru, or a generous genius in the 60's. It was a time of magic and madness. No one will ever cut the 60s right ... it was too diverse (this movie is close). At least we can say that we are not ashamed, that we have learned and grown from it, and formed it for once, a generation and changed America ... for the better.
