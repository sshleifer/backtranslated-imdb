During a Kurt Weill celebration in Brooklyn, where are we going from here? was finally unearthed for an investigation. It's amazing that a movie, of any era, that has Weill-Gershwin collaboration, may be missing from the screens. The score is high, and a CD of the material, with Gershwin and Weill, only highlights its merit, which is substantial. Yes, the movie has its problems, but the score is not one of them. Ratoff is not in his element as the director of this musical fantasy, and Fred MacMurray cannot properly understand the material. Then the 'modern' segment is also poorly written. BUT the fantasy elements carry the film to a high point, as well as the work of the two beautiful leading ladies - Joan Leslie and June Haver. Both have the charm that this kind of work has to work desperately. As a Second World War, we will be able to capture the history of the country - even if it is in a never-before-seen, movie in Hollywood's musical history, and everyone should be available to see and find its significant earnings.
