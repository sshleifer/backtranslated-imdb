I first saw BLOOD OF THE SAMURAI at its premiere at the Hawaii International Film Festival. WOW! Blood just blew us away with its mere dyeing, gore, vitality, gore, excitement, gore, total campus, and even more gore, and all in such great fun! Especially for those who enjoy all the Japanese Chambara Samurai and Ninja movies, you MUST SEE PART BLOOD!
