I love this show, as it is action-packed with adventure, love and intrigue. Well, sometimes, love! It's so good to see a show where all the characters work well and treat each other with respect. It is also very good to see Dick Van Dyke in a television role, as I only saw him in Mary Poppins. The mix of the main characters, Mark, Amanda, Jesse and Steve are very catchy to the audience. This is a show you have to watch!
