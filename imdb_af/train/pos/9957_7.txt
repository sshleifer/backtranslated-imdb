This movie is underestimated by IMDb. Like so many movies, it's not Shawshank. But it's a pretty good, if predictable, dance competition / personal growth movie. If you want to spend an hour and a half, look for a kind of 8-mile for a female walking dancer, as I think you would like. <br /> <br /> Judging by the IMDb ratings, my guess is that the movies came to the top 250, and with many 1s it was "bombarded". As happens with so many films that are not about the crowd, there are no special effects, or non-white or non-straight characters. <br /> <br /> It's an American movie, but it's not an American movie. Most of the tournaments in Toronto are subtle, and some audiences may think it is totally in the US, just because the final competition is in Detroit's border city. <br /> <br /> I like the music. I like the dance (but not convinced it's worth $ 50,000 ... but what do I know). The characters were easy on the eyes. <br /> <br /> I agree the title sucks. I don't remember anyone in the movie saying the words, and it should have a "s". (No, it's not a foreign language.) <br /> <br /> There's not much to hate about this movie (and let's be honest, a voice of 1 means you've hated it ), so I can only assume that it is an expression of hatred for the kind of people in it, and it is sad.
