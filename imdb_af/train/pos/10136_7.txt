This is one of the best episodes of the second season of MOH. I think Mick Garris has a problem with women. He kills them all, they are often the victims. (Screwfly solution, Pro-life, Valerie on the stairs, I don't remember the Argento's episode in season 1, etc., of course Imprint). I think he enjoys seeing women burn, torture, mutilate and I don't know. Not least, the right to die is one of the best, with good turns and graphic scenes and tensions (especially with the pictures from the cell image, wonderful). The acting is like the whole series, often I can be the worst like 'Pro-life' or 'We scream for Ice cream'. I also think the plot can be made for a movie and not just for an episode. The ideology of the series is horrible, killing and ending women, mutilating animals and on and off and on ... the first season it was better than the second with episodes such as "Cigarette Burns" (best of all), "Homecoming" (The funniest), "Imprint" (really shocking).
