I already read Nancy Drew as a preteen and collect the books as an adult. I loved the effect used at the end (and a little at the beginning) of the movie where line art style paintings in plays from the movie painted. It was a neat way to indicate connections between situations in the film and the books. For example, the scenes with the Eastern antique dealer reminded many scenarios that I remember from the books. I thought Ned was perfectly thrown, and Emma Roberts was a wonderful 21st-century interpretation of Nancy Drew. (Like Betty Crocker's photo, she keeps pace with the times!)
