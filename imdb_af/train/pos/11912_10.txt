I enjoyed Albert Pyun's "Nemesis" for his cheese activity and semi-intricate writing. Many people complain about the "confusing" plot of the first film, which is probably why "Nemesis 2: Nebula" has a dumb as rock plot with the same super action to carry it through. <br /> <br /> This one gives the name of the first movie's hero, Alex, to a grandfather sent to the past to save the future. She is raised by a tribe in Africa. A good part of the movie just has an African-language dialogue without captions, which I wanted, because it made it look somewhat authentic (how often do movies in this genre really try it?). It doesn't take long for the evil cyborgs to return in time to find her and try to kill her. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong, it's a piece of crap (not that the first one was good). There are subplots that include Africa's political turmoil, treasure hunt and tribal struggle. The picture is very short on brain, so none of these things get very good treatment. The picture is basically an elaborate battle with a few chases that amount to muscle babe versus cyborg. It has its entertainment value, but does not expect quality or anything from the first movie.
