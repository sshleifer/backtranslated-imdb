I couldn't agree with the rating given to this movie, and I believe it's an example of how short-sighted most of the spectators around the world are. Really ... Do you forget that the Cinema was a kind of art before some tycoons just made it fun? This movie is not entertaining, at least not so easy to entertain you on movies like Titanic or Gladiator. It has style, it's different, it's shocking. Therefore, most of you have hated so much: because it is not pleasant to you. It's just a story, a very strange one I recognize, but it's just a strange story. It's not a great story, not even a great movie work, but I believe it's just a 7-star rating for the courage of both writer and director to shoot a story that's not made up for to please the audience and therefore to sell billions. of copies and make the big studios even richer. This movie is a European artistic film made in the USA and respecting everyone involved in making it. Must be for the courage, or be it for the unique sense of humor.
