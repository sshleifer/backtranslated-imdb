William Powell is Philo Vance in 'The Kennel Murder Case', a 1933 film featuring Mary Astor, Paul Cavanagh, Eugene Palette, Helen Vinson and Ralph Morgan. A dog show in which Philo entered his Scottish terrier captain served as the backdrop for a closed room secret with too many suspects. The secret is very clever and the unbundling is complicated and interesting. Since the talkies are quite young, the work of the camera is a bit static, but Michael Curtiz does a good job of targeting the action. <br /> <br /> The supporting role is excellent; the whole movie brings the film to a notch. Many actors played Philo Vance, including Paul Lukas, Basil Rathbone, Wilford Hyde-White, Edmund Lowe, James Stephenson, Alan Curtis, Warren William and others. Powell played it the most (five times) and is best suited to the role - very relaxed but serious at the same time. It was made before "The Thin Man" hit him a big star. He had already started the film for twelve years. He began his career in 1912 at the age of 20. A remarkable man, a remarkable screen presence and a remarkable actor who was almost 92. We are so happy to make his films available on DVD and on TCM today. "The Kennel Murder Case" is a wonderful story and a fun movie - don't miss it.
