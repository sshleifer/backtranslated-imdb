Nicolas Mallet is a failure. A counter in a bank is all about him. Then his friend, a writer whose books no one likes, is a plan to change his life. Our hero tells his boss he stops. He plans to spend the rest of his life making lots of money and sleeping with many women. And he manages to do just that. <br /> <br /> If it wasn't for the amount of death (murder / suicide / natural causes) in the movie, it would be a row. There are many jabs in marriage, politics, journalism and ... life. <br /> <br /> Jean-Louis Trintignant is a lovely amoral rogue. Romy Schneider is most attractive to her. Definitely worth it.
