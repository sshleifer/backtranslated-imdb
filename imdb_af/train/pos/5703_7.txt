I'm a fan of Crash and Blade Runner and this movie explores some of the highway deaths and 80's movie noir themes I'd love to see, so I enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> In general, the essential stupidity of the film noir protagonist is not well-drawn by the female lead and her hero is almost a neanderthal, hence the selection warning.
