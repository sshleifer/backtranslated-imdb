Ulysses as a movie should in no way be compared to the novel, because they are two completely different entities. However, it is said that the film still maintains many of the elements that make the book work, but since it is a visual medium, it is more difficult to draw consciousness. I think it's the best movie they could have made with the material ... and it is from someone who regularly runs over movies that aren't like their literary counterparts. I recommend the book, but the movie is still entertaining.
