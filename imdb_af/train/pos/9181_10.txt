I didn't know what Jane Eyre was before I saw these miniseries. I've read and looked at many classics before, and I believed that most of the classics were boring, overheard and, at best, overestimating stories with pretty interesting sites. These Jane Eyre miniseries have completely changed my concepts. <br /> <br /> Zelah Clarke is a great actress, and she gives Jane Eyre a wonderful performance. Her accent is beautiful and her quiet, but solid nature exactly matches the young government's character. Timothy Dalton is a wonderful Rochester. His passion and energy in the film makes me believe he was born to play the moving master of Thornfield Hall. I couldn't sleep all night after watching these miniseries. The plot is both haunting and inspiring. The characters are masterfully executed, and the story is incredible. This is the best version of Jane Eyre ever to appear on film. <br /> <br /> I read the book later and was amazed at how this miniseries followed Charolette Bronte's writing. Jane Eyre is now my favorite movie and book. If you want to see a masterpiece that will change your life, look at the 1983 version of Jane Eyre.
