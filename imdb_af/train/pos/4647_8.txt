It takes a very special kind of person to make a film that is so miserable, deceptive, disgusting and repulsive, but makes it a way that makes it brilliant and the very essence of personal film liberation. Crispin Glover, in all his "out there" antics and predispositions, has made something unique. In a world that has become very partisan, this film seems to evade the standard lines of creativity and art and to surprise everyone effectively. <br /> <br /> The movie is right from the bat, and it takes a fairly distant paradigm (if there really is a model) and initially forms it with the Shirley Temple before a swastika and naked women . a man with cerebral palsy. These are quite shocking things, but if you had the opportunity for the Q&A sessions after the shows, make it a bag of worms that make you wonder if it's art or just the lowest common denominator. In both cases, you feel the tremor that this movie will eventually cause. It will never be accepted, not even by the supposed authors of the world who talk boringly of the human condition. You may not like it, but it is definitely worthy of watching.
