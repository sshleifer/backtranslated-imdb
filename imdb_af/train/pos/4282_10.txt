Excellently developed characters in the very funny situations full of spirit, absurdity and Serb mentality. Film is a great comedy, pleasant, interesting, unpredictable. Best point in a movie: characters, then humor itself, story and dialogues. Humor has 'inner development', scarcely in Serbian movies. So, this is due to characterization, is well motivated, spontaneous and consistent. It is also sharp, intelligent and clear. Most of the movies unfortunately built humor (think of a joke and put it in a character's mouth) or ordinary situation comedy, burlesque, farce. Some of the 'art immortality' is included in this movie. Small masterpiece, hardly accessible.
