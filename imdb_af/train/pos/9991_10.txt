I thought this movie was hysterical. I watched it many times and highly recommended it. Mel Brooks, was excellent. The movie was fantastic. I don't understand how this movie gets a 2 out of 5 rating. I loved it. I saw other movies of his and they were funny too, but this one really looks like my mind because of the humor. She just can't say enough about this movie. I regularly check, but it is never enough for me. The people playing the homeless were also compared to the funniest standards. Please place this movie regularly. I can't see it enough. Leslie Ann Warren was also another favorite of mine since Cinderella. I always thought it wasn't really funny, but loved her. In this movie she was very funny .. and her and Mel did a good job together. They need to put more of their movies on TV.
