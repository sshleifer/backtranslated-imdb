I generally love these 1930s mystery / police Charlie Chan type movies, and that is no exception. But something looks bad with this movie. A low effort to switch from cerebral Moto movies, is divided around the plot, to a salad table, spoiled by comedy relief that is so relieved as sore feet. A typical buffoon appears from nowhere depicting a clumsy Englishman who plays the detective, and even appears to be other characters in providing comedy relief. The plot may be strange to us today or a mere excuse, but then the possibility of evolutionary archaeological discoveries was not only real, but an everyday appearance.
