The late-sixties and early seventies sex exploitation era began with the awarding of free nudity in mainstream films and ended with the legalization of hardcore porn. It was peak years between 1968 and 1972. One of the beloved and talented actresses of the era was Monica Gayle, who had small but fanatical cult followers. She was actually able to act, unlike many who filled the lead roles of these movies, and her subsequent credits proved it. And she apparently disappeared deliberately in the dark moment when her career just got up, multiplying her mysticism. <br /> <br /> Director Gary Graver was also a talent; probably too talented for the sex-fluttering genre, and his skill combined with Monica Gayle's screen presence, make Sandra, a woman's creation, a pleasant, enjoyable experience. The movie never pulls and you won't hit your finger on the prosperity button.
