hello. I watched this movie earlier today for the 14th time in 3 days. I am a history teacher, who has too much time for me. I need a life. I found the movie that has a striking deal to break mountain. I also found myself very much like Jean Lafitte when he was white. Also my favorite line in the whole movie was from Mr. Petey - "This baby can shoot a gypsy's eye of 300 meters!" Oh, and my favorite scene in the movie was when the British entered, and the one drummer so devoted to his work, and he stumbled to death, as if that drum were to end the war completely ... but it will no. Well, that's all I want to say about this movie. OH, one more thing .. Bonnie brown is an insane physco bipolar mood waving BEEYOTCH. This is all.
