Pre-adolescent humor is present in large quantities. The play and story is great if you can stomach the concept. Those with poor constitutions will be difficult as the "worms" are realistic enough to cause more than a few in the audience. <br /> <br /> Tom Cavanagh and Hallie Kate Eisenberg stole the spotlight, but the young Ty Panitz could be on the screen the next few years. <br /> <br /> Miss Eisenberg developed from a cute face to a strong young actress with charm and wonderful comic delivery. <br /> <br /> The story is a spectacular work in dealing with bullies, friendship and fairness. This creates an opportunity to discuss these topics in an open and frank way, while reminding some "gross" plays of the film.
