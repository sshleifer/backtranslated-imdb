This is one of the few movies released on a "what if" type of situation that made me think. It was wonderful to hear that they were talking to each other, and recalled all the wonderful (and not so wonderful) things that happened between them. Actually, I think there is a very good possibility that this has happened as the movie implies, and they actually made peace with each other. It's good memories for every fan to hang out, and asking what actually happened between them would be selfish. What an AMAZING movie it was. The comic aspects of the movie were wonderful. To think that they were gathering such a thing between them, is a reassuring thought to people who wish they had the opportunity to remove the air with someone they couldn't find. To see John such a care was refreshing to hear all the rubbish talked about him ...
