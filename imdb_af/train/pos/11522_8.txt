I've seen it for the longest time, James Merendino is a good director. SLC Punk is one of my favorite movies, and in the first ten minutes of this movie I thought it was a good follow-up, but it started to drag. The acting and direction were great. In fact, everything in the movie looked like it was the movie. At times, the only thing that caught my eye was the fact that Claire Forlani was the most beautiful woman in the world. This movie was good, but I expected more. <br /> <br /> P.S. Search for great cameos by Chi McBride, and Chris McDonald.
