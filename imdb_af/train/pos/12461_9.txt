A clever script from the late SEBASTIAN JAPRISOT and clever performances by the two male leaders - ALAIN DELON and CHARLES BRONSON (or vice versa) will lead to an engaging and entertaining thriller. <br /> <br /> Add to the above-mentioned veteran JEAN HERMAN's competent direction and a sparse but effective score by FRANCOIS DE ROUBAIX, it becomes easy why this movie has a strange timeless quality. <br /> <br /> It's a friend or bonding story with two Loners, both disillusioned and world tired, returning, presumably from Algiers. Like the other colonial powers of this time (after World War II in the 60s), France struggled to hold action overseas. The loss of Algiers was a bitter blow. <br /> <br /> ADIEU L'AMI (the original title) chronicles the action of our two (anti) heroes as they struggle to make it after they are fired. <br /> <br /> One thing happens after another, and the viewer really needs to pay attention, because JAPRISOT is lean and economical with his writing: if there is, then there must be a reason. <br /> <br /> That's enough to say, these two men are physically and psychologically fighting, one long weekend. Their motivation is very different, their goals are different - their survival depends entirely on one another. That ALAIN DELON and CHARLES BRONSON are so different from the outside - the former, probably a pretty boy, and the latter an ugly thief, adds to the chemistry. <br /> <br /> The quest for a great story, which in turn, makes for a good movie. <br /> <br /> Let me forget there are women in this movie, and where is the Japrisot method, they are also memorable, but not so far. To say much more would be to surprise your joy to discover their true nature. <br /> <br /> FAREWELL, FRIEND IS FREE An ANAMORPHIC IMAGE, 16.9 IMPROVE; ONLY in English (not even subtitles for hearing); A TIMING TIME OF 110 MINUTES; MONO SOUNDTRACK, but the DE ROUBAIX music has a lot of punch! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
