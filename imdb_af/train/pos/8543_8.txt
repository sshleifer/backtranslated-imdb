It was one of those movies I would probably never get off the shelf, but one day I came to IFC and I said - Eric Stolz, William Forsythe ... why not? If I changed the channel, I would really have missed a treasure. <br /> <br /> The subject is depressing - young writer paralyzes in climb crashes in lower-class rehabilitation center. It would have been so easy and tempting to make it a manipulative tear. But this doesn't happen because it was written by Neal Jimenez after being accidentally paralyzed. No Hollywood luck here. All the patients in the ward come from many different backgrounds, but they share a sense of helplessness, to be others' grace. Stolz is very good as a "alleenwolf" -type, which in his embarrassment depends on his girlfriend (Helen Hunt); Wesley Snipes is fine like an early lady whose family falls apart; but William Forsythe takes the cake as a hard man who is determined to have someone pay to take away his independence. <br /> <br /> See this movie.
