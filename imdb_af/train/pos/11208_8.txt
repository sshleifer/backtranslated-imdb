Oh, where are you, my little one, little one ... <br /> <br /> Turn around and you're two, turn around and you're four ... <br /> <br /> I remember these shows broadcast on Disneyland for the first time. I remember sitting there electrified by Werner Van Braune's rocket science explanations. I watched how history, science and humor are all intertwined with an impressive story of possibilities. <br /> <br /> It was fifty years ago. And the shows are back in the Disney Treasures series, and what a treasure they are. I watched them last night and tonight with my 8-year-old daughter, who initially couldn't even come into the room, but later showed when she saw they were partially animated. As she looked, I watched her, and by the end she was almost as gone as I was. <br /> <br /> Turn around and you're a young woman with your own babies ... <br /> <br /> Certainly, some of the predictions about reaching the moon were wrong. But there is a lot of information that is quite reasonable, and the overall offering is still impressive. I thought to myself that my daughter's teacher might want to show them to her class, not just as a 50-year-old artefact, but also so nice and easy to understand lessons in history. Turn around, turn around, turn around and again ... you wonder how many in 50 years really changed.
