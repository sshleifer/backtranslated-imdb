I also saw it when it was issued in '56 and has since been hit with its final scene. If it's an answer to "High noon", it's an appropriate and appropriate answer. The idea that, like this chord is upside down, "The town is gathering" is a much stronger message than the lonely personal heroism of "High Noon." In this theme, 'Concho' is a phenomenal precursor to one of my other everyday favorites, 'The Magnificent Seven.' Both Sinatra and Conrad give impressive and convincing performances, especially Sinatra's transformation of a bully's brother to liberating village savior. I can only hope that at any stage all the friends and family on whom the years of my love for this movie have been, will have the opportunity to experience it for themselves.
