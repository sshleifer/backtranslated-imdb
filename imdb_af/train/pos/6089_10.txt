OK, I overestimated it just a little to account for at least one of those grumpy reviews. But I enjoyed it. I didn't laugh out loud, but it attracted me and pulled me up without dropping me. The story was built. Yes, you knew it would have a happy ending - this genre always does. Meanwhile, it was impressive with siggats that you could miss, so beware when you look. Stiller and Black were once again able to deliver. Good team. They need to work more together. Don't know it would be a cult classic, but it was definitely a fun ride. Not as good as WAT ABOUT BOB, or DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS, but what is? It's still worth going a bit to see this movie.
