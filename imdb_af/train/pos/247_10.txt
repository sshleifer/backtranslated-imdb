I love this movie because it showed that they didn't kill for fun, but to save those who loved them! Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom had a good job portraying Ned and Joe. It has some quick inappropriate scenes, but that's right, unlike that. The language is very soft and sometimes it doesn't even know it's there. This movie shows that just because they are illegal, it does not mean they are malicious killers! I hope people will watch this movie and learn about important times in history like this one. There is one thing that fascinates me about this movie, that they got their inspiration for their weapons from a book Ned! This is also how people remember them, their weapons. I hope people will watch and watch this movie as I have.
