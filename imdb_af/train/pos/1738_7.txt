It's a hilarious movie. Burt Reynolds is a NASCAR star who signs a sponsorship contract with Ned Beatty's Chicken Pit restaurants. The contract has all sorts of humiliating clauses in it, such as forcing Burt to wear a chicken pack during the race! Jim Nabors is his (not quite convincing) chief engineer. Loni Anderson (oh!) Is assigned by Beatty to keep Reynolds honest and strict with the contract. It's a funny movie in which Burt proves he's not too proud. I like that!
