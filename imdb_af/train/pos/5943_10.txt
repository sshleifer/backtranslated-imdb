This movie is really cool. Everything looks like it comes from the strip. The sets, the costumes and the plot are wonderful. Clark Bartram is our favorite batman again. He looked a little better in death, but he still pulls it off. Superman is also wonderful. the flying effects are OK. but it's a fan movie so we can't expect them to be the biggest. The shot with the superman catching the car was very credible. it was cool. It's a movie, I will definitely see if it really is. it has everything you want in a batman / superman movie. one exception although I would throw the joker instead of 2-face ..... overall I give this movie a 10 because it's a good movie.
