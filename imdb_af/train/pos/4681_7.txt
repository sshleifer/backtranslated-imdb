Overall, I enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to indie movie lovers. <br /> <br /> However, I would like to note the similarities between parts of this movie and Nichols' Closer. One of the scenes, especially where Adrian Grenier's character questioned Charles Dawson's question about her sex life while he was away, is remarkably similar to the scene in Closer where Clive Owen's character questioned Julia Roberts, although with less hardness and intensity. Love "is dealt with. Also note that "Anna" is the name of Dawson and Roberts's character. Can't be coincidence. Now Closer is based on Patrick Marber's play and presumably this film is loosely based on Arthur Schnitzler's Reigen, so I'm not sure how this band formed. <br /> <br /> Anyone have an idea?
