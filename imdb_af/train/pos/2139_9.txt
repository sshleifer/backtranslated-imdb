I approached this movie with low expectations but was very pleasantly surprised. It was very well done and it is off the ballroom dance movies of recent years, especially "Strictly Ballroom". While the music is fun and the colorful dance, it is not for me to dance. It's about the many Japanese institution that gives male office workers long commuters to work and free time to work for entertainment that doesn't involve their families. Here we have the man with the whole family and the great bond and a flagship for life. He is attracted to the handsome image of a young woman in a dance studio that he passes during his commute and it causes him to try ballroom dancing. Japanese is also the fact that the lecherous motives that started his new passion are made clear, but somehow accepted, at least in the end, by family and audience. Ballroom dance attitudes, as conveyed in the film, are certainly non-Western, although the discipline and music are clearly cultural imports to Japan. The cultural contrasts are therefore intriguing. Even without the cultural insights, the color, the dance and the enthusiasm of the players make it a fun movie to watch.
