Celebrating Earth Day, Disney released the movie "Earth". To avoid a turbulent message of gloom and weeds, we treat excellent footage of animals in their habitats without feeling bad about ourselves. <br /> <br /> The stars of the show are a herd of elephants, a family of polar bears and a whale and his calf. The narrative starts at the North Pole and goes south until we reach the tropics, which are already announced to the inhabitants of the various climates. <br /> <br /> Global warming is called while we are watching the walks of pool; The shrinking sea ice islands have been made in recent years. We never see the seals catching seals, but the father's desperate quest for food leads him to a dangerous solution. <br /> <br /> The aerial photographs of caribou migrating over the tundra are one of the spectacular game shots I've ever had. see; This and another of the wild animals is enough to reward the price of admission to see them on the big screen. <br /> <br /> One of the disappointments I felt was that filmed massive shots of large white sharks were shot in slow motion. You never get the feeling of one characteristic of wild animals; their incredible speed. The idea of ​​slowing down the movie to give quick speed, I think (or at least the first thing I remember) was the television program "Kung Fu" during the early seventies. <br /> <br /> An interesting highlight is that if the credits roll into the end role, some demonstrations of the cinematographic techniques being used are revealed. There are plenty of dramatic, humorous, and learning moments in this movie to make it a great choice for nature buffers. Perhaps because of some selective editing (which saves us so much from the creepy end of a prey predator moment) and the fact that these footage was released in 2007 and available on DVD, it is a solid movie in its own right. And you can take your kids! <br /> <br /> Three stars.
