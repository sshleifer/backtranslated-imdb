Although the recent repetition of a part of Homer's epic "Troy" with Brad Pitt was once, "Iphigenia" with the glowing Irene Pappas is breathtaking. Receiving in a natural environment with Greek actors speaking their own language gives such authenticity. An accidental encounter with this movie on one of DirecTV's many movie channels interested me despite my concentration issues. There is no glare or bling in this movie, just an amazingly rich story that has been blamelessly told by actors, so in fact they feel they are falling into a real family in turmoil. I even think Homer, if he really existed, will be proud of this narrative. <br /> <br /> JLH
