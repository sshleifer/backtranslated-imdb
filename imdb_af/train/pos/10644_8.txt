The second of the Why We Fight series concentrates on Hitler's grab of Sudanland and beyond, as he makes a lot of Neville Chamberlain and begins his conquest of Europe. <br /> <br /> Clearly meant as propaganda in the day, this time trial series has also become an informative documentary, with most of the "Allied bias" appearing to be historical fact. The Fuhrer lifts himself on his own petard with smug statements before his people and the world as he says one thing and does another while his army moves east. The Czechs and Austrians quickly capitulate, but Poland has set a heroic battle against overwhelming odds. <br /> <br /> The difference between Hitler's military force and Chamberlain waving the Munich treaty as a white flag, which to this day declares "Peace in our time," has durable propaganda characteristics. Here, in its original context, it resonates even more vigorously as the darkness of World War II takes place in Europe, leaving the American viewer with two options, freedom or slavery. In 1943 this simple truth escaped and the Nazi strike made its point effective.
