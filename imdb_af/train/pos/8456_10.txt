I almost watched the Gundam / Mech anime shown in the US and it was by far the best story. The way his plot twists and turns has cut you. Gundam Wing is a series that focuses mainly on politics and war. The series follows a group of five 15-year-old boys who are trained for the leading mobile accessories known as Gundams. The Gundam pilots are trained to know a powerful uprising known as Oz. As things warm up between OZ and the Gundam pilots, new political groups will form and old ones will disappear. Old conflicts will end and newcomers will arise. To bring about peace, the Gundam pilots must take on the events in their world and put an end to all the battles. But how far are people willing to go to reach their goal. I recommend this anime to anyone looking for a deep plot show.
