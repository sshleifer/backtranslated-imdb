I watched this movie at the Toronto Film Festival, where it got a standing ovation! This film tells a story I have never told before, namely the Rosenstrasse (a street in Berlin) rebellion of German pagan women who were married to Jews at the end of World War II. As such, it is a unique story, and it is also the only film about the Holocaust I have ever seen, proving that there were good Germans (the helping family in "Anne Frank" for example Dutch) who did not support it the Nazis, and they actually had the courage to stand up against their own country's immorality and brutality during the Nazi regime, at the risk of their lives. The play is across the board, the frame in New York interesting and complicated, the direction of Von Trotta masterful in every scene, and the production values, including the beautiful cinematography, are excellent. Of course, the family can speak German in New York. Many immigrants in this country choose to speak with their family in their mother tongue - a common look. So the criticism is illegal. To say more, the experience would spoil. The movie is long, but I didn't even look at my watch. I hope this movie gets a little spread, is North America, because not only is this movie a masterpiece, but it can actually help to cure any hostility that people have against the Germans because of their support of Hitler. If this movie is playing in your area, I ask you to see it! You'll be glad you did!
