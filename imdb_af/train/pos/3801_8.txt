This is a CGI animated movie based on a French 2D animated series. The series has briefly worked on Cartoon Network, but its run was so short that its inclusion as one of the potential Oscar nominees for the best animated film this year has left most people knowing what, Huh? This is the story of Lian-Chu, the kind of heart muscle, and Gwizdo, the brain of the operation, who with Hector carries their fire dragon, he is more like a dog. Travel the world offering their services as dragon hunters but never pay. In their lives, Zoe, the fairy tale love-cousin of a king who goes blind, comes. It seems as if the world is being swallowed up by a great monster, and all the knights that the king has sent out have never returned, or if they return, they come back as if. In despair, the king hires the dragon hunters to stop the world eater. Zoe obviously markers along ... <br /> <br /> What else can I say, why is this movie hiding under a rock? This is a very good little movie that is completely out of the radar, except as an unlikely Oscar rival. It's a beautifully designed, fantastic movie (The World it takes, has floating countries and crazy creatures) that has always done me "Wow". The English Voice, along with Forrest Whitaker as Lian-Chu (one of the best vocal performances I've ever heard) and Rob Paulson as Gwizdo (think Steve Bucsemi), is the first time. Just as good is the writing that does not fall to its audience, using some real expressions that are not normally heard in animated films (not Disney or Pixar). It's all really well done. <br /> <br /> Is it perfect? No, some of the pieces go on for too long, but at the same time it is entertaining. <br /> <br /> If you get the chance, see it. She is one of the better animated films from 2008, and continues on my good 2009 surprise list.
