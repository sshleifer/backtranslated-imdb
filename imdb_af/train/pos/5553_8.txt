Slow but beautifully mounted story of the American Revolution. Griffith's storytelling looks much less melancholy than in his earlier historical epics and his table work is fully integrated into the action. Lionel Barrymore is a mature pig, Neil Hamilton is poor but stiff and Carol Dempster is. Well, Carol Dempster is the bulk of what is wrong with Griffith during this period, but she doesn't show enough to slow down the pace. and drama. <br /> <br /> Note that the trivia for this movie says it originated more than 2 hours after it was released, but there is no track longer than 90 minutes. However, the DVD release is offered at a slower fps rate which increases the voltage and returns it over a little over two hours. <br /> <br /> Much better in terms of storytelling than audio versions, such as THE PATRIOT. While it's not quite in the league of Griffith's best, such as WAY DOWN EAST and BROKEN BLOSSOMS, a great way to spend a few hours.
