"Twelve monkeys" have all the elements to become Terry Gilliam's masterpiece. An outstanding screenplay, a continuous rhythm, clever sometimes ironic dialogues. In addition, he had a good nose about the role. "Twelve Monkeys" is also the first film where Bruce Willis returns from the kind of character he plays in his previous films. Here's a dreaded and hopeless character that you can call a prisoner, taken over from an intrepid and invincible hero (as in "The Hard"). No matter how he tried, he was a prisoner of the time. The movie also features a very exciting ending. It has a truly dramatic power. But this awesome film is also a reflection on humans, the dangers he is fearing (especially those that can cause the end of the world, and here are viruses that can cause disease). No matter how long it will last, "twelve monkeys" will be estimated to be true: one of the masterpieces made in the nineties.
