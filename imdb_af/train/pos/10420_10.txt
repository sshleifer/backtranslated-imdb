The Great Caruso displays the unique talents of Mario Lanza. He shows good acting ability and is in the best shape as a lyrical singer, accompanied by Dorothy Kirsten, soprano of the Metropolitan Opera. Indeed, I dare say he does some songs better than Caruso (see A'Vuchella of Tosti and La Danza of Rossini). The MGM art and music divisions also did a good job. This movie could be perfect, not for the uncomfortable presence of Ann Blyth; we see that she tries her best, dressed in the fifties style in scenes just before 1920 - unforgivable. Lanza deserves to be a better-looking lady, and Blyth needs less demanding productions. Also note that Mrs. Kirsten singing most of the opera duets of the movie with Lanza, giving the wrong idea that Caruso had a kind of permanent soprano.
