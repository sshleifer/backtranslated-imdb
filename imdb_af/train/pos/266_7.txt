This story was never in my favorites in Christie's works, so I was pleasantly surprised to enjoy this adaptation quite a bit. The mouse motif was effective as a little exaggerated, the bones of the story are there, although more emphasis is placed on the 'crime in the past' subplot. The students were all pretty much as I suggested to them, though it was a pity that they were not a more cosmopolitan group. Perhaps the revised thirties did not allow it! I thought there were many risky risks to the filming; Maybe that's because I didn't read the book again for a long time, but it seemed to me obviously who was the murderer of their appearance early in public. <br /> <br /> Humor was much more common in this early Poirotte. Sometimes it works, but I did a lot of it in this episode (although I was throwing away the 'Lemon sole' line). Although a solid entry into the series is not one of the best.
