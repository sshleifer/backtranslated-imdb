In a year of pretentious sweets such as "Synecdoche, New York", a movie born of Charlie Kaufman's own self-sufficiency, a movie that is equally difficult to see comes about, but about three times as important. "Frownland" is a loving work by the crew, the actors and the filmmaker who has been shot by friends for years. It traces a man who cannot communicate through his completely authentic, real Brooklyn world. The people you see are a step further than the styling of the "mumblecore" movement. They are real people who are painfully trapped in their own independent neurosis, not willing to change. The real world for them is their own set of delusions and because it's a movie about people who are so deep in touch, it's very difficult to watch. It's 16mm movie-up without proper light, money or any of the other factors that make a movie "smooth," but its honesty can't be underestimated, a fact that will leave a room full of people to dismiss it and for Richard Linklater to give it an award as he did at SXSW. It is reminiscent of movies like "Naked" or the best of the "mumblecore". It's a movie that's not for everyone, but one that challenges you to watch and grow on you the longer you think about it.
