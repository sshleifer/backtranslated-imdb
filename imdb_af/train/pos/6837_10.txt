Typical De Palma movie made with lots of style and a few plays that bring you to the edge of your chair. <br /> <br /> The style that makes the movie better than the average thriller is certainly the best. It has some brilliantly crafted plays and a few plays that are truly a nerve removal that will bring you to the edge of your seat. The best scene is the movie; The museum scene and the elevator murder. There are some soft erotic plays and the movie may not fit fast enough for the casual viewer to fully appreciate this movie. So this movie may not be suitable for everyone. <br /> <br /> The story itself is also very good, but it's really the style the movie works! It may just be for the fans, but casual viewers should also appreciate the tension in the movie. <br /> <br /> There is a nice character portrayed by a good role. Michael Caine is an interesting decisive choice and Angie Dickinson acts just as well as she looks pretty (not bad for a 49-year-old!). The musical score by Pino Donaggio is also typical De Palma likes the movie and fits the movie very well, just like his score for the other De Palma movie, "Body Double". <br /> <br /> Brilliant nerve spot thriller. I love De Palma! <br /> <br /> 10/10
