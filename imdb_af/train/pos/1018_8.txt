The Movie was sub-par, but this Television Pilot delivers a good springboard that has become an Sci-Fi fans ideal program. The actors deliver and the special effects (for a television series) are spectacular. Having an intelligent interesting script also doesn't hurt. <br /> <br /> Stargate SG1 is currently one of my favorite programs.
