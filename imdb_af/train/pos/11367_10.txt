Warning: Can contain spoilage ... <br /> <br /> I saw this movie 3 times and I chose it every time. When I see it again, I am always reminded of how good it is. An HBO television movie - done very well like most of their movies - would have received Oscars for the shows if released for general distribution rather than for TV. <br /> <br /> As I am sure someone knows about reading other reviews here, this is the story of serial killer, Andrei Chikatilo. He killed 56 people over 8 years in the former Soviet Union. (3 victims were buried and could not be found. He was only found guilty of 52 out of 53 of his murders.) The story is more focused on forensic analyst Victor Burakov has played Stephen Rea in full. A man who is tortured and obsessed with finding this killer, despite the additional barriers placed by party hookers, is his part essential to be sure. There is a very pleasant scene towards the end of the movie, which mentions how US investigators are regularly deprived of ceremonial cases after 18 months or wanting spiritual tension and frustration. According to this program, Burakov worked for more than 5 years before getting his first break out of it. He followed the case to his conclusion, 3 years later. In this scene, his superior, General Fetisov, played by Donald Sutherland, actually told him he admired his dedication and apologized for not knowing that he had given him a break earlier. <br /> <br /> Rea's performance is so well done, he doesn't steal, chew up the scenery, or do anything that distracts from his depiction of a man who has bent hell to find his killer. He is a man of passion, but does not show it in the same way that is usually portrayed in tracking videos. He only occasionally gives outbursts after he has quietly applied more than most under such circumstances. Rea does so much with his face, his eyes, he doesn't have to overreact. He's just * is * - his character, so frustrated after so long, at one point, frustrated, he actually said he'd rather find 3 at a time than nobody in a year. Of course, what he means is not that he wants more people to die, he just wants clues to catch this man. Rea lets us feel this man. He understands us, but looks at what it is like to live with such abomination and futility. <br /> <br /> To be sure, Chikatilo's childhood was one that produced such "monsters". The character of Chikatilo is very well done by Jeffrey DeMunn. He somehow (possibly impossible) seems to elicit some sympathy for himself. Perhaps he's the worst of us, gone terribly wrong? Anyway, his actions are very well done. <br /> <br /> Donald Sutherland as Colonel Fetisov (later promoted to general) also does a good job. He apparently began to be a cynical world official who is no longer interested in the investigation than anyone else is blocking Burakov. But eventually he becomes more than just an assistant, he actually participates actively in Burakov. There is also a very good turn by Max Von Sydow as the psychiatrist brought in to help profile and find out what kind of disorder they are looking for. <br /> <br /> Although this film is about a morbid, grotesque and violent story, it's really more about what it takes to catch a killer than the murderer himself. Around a very good movie with fine performances and a big screenplay. The script is doing what the best of this type of movie means: giving factual events and placing them meaningfully within a dramatic framework that makes you know the people * behind the facts. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10 stars
