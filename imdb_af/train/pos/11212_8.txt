This photo came out in 1975 and it was the second in the three part series of sheriff Buford Pusser's life. Bo Svenson takes over the role of Sheriff Buford Pusser, and Luke Askew plays the role of Mobster Pinky Dobson. The last thing we saw Sheriff Pusser, he put behind him and his wife in a hospital bed. After Pusser recovered, he went to the men who killed his wife. Can Pusser complete the revenge he pursues or try to take him out before he succeeds. The only thing that bothered me about this picture was that it was a real story. How can you with this kind of crime leave in a village and still do nothing about it. Since there was really no name actress in this picture, I can't give it 10 weasel stars, but I can give 8
