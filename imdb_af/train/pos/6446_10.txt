"So sum in heaven" was probably one of the 3 most beautiful movies I've seen in my life. That it didn't win the Oscar, I won't throw a tear. This movie is in a sort of its own class that could possibly detract from an Oscar victory !!! My dearest friend, Anders (Nyberg), you really did glory with your pen here! Kay Pollak, with your creation, and everyone who contributes, all gave a gift of love to our world. Between the points of entering this world of us, if you leave it - you can really say you've made it better! A special, personal, thank you to all of you for bringing back the precious memories of the second decade of my life. I grew up in Sweden, and my young spirit and current Beingness were formed and formed by many beautiful Swedish influences, individuals, traditions, music and nature. My blessings with thanks to all. With Love and Light, George-Gabriel Berkovits Soulhealer, Johannesburg, South Africa
