A big money maker for RKO Radio, Bombardier stars Pat O'Brien and Randolph Scott as trainers at a bombers' school. O'Brien and Scott argue about teaching methods, while their students are annoyed by Anne Shirley's affections. O'Brien's methods are healed during a bomb attack on Tokyo. Scott and his crew are captured and tortured by the Japanese, but the deaths injured Scott control to set a gas truck on fire, which is a perfect target for his fellow bombarders. Stylistically, Bombardier is one of the most schizophrenic of war films, with moments of subtle poignancy (the death of trainee Eddie Albert) alternating with scenes of ridiculous "Yellow Peril" melodrama (the Japanese literally pulling their teeth as they torture the helpless Americans). Although it may not seem today, Bombardier remains an entertaining propaganda effort (the movie is sometimes listed as the debut of Robert Ryan, which appeared in front of the cameras since 1940. <br /> <br /> Anyone interested in To obtain a copy of this movie, please contact me at: iamaseal2@yahoo.com
