Someone (or something ..) leaves puncture points on the jugular and drains the victims from their blood to death. Police detective Karl Brettschneider (Melvyn Douglas, before slipping out of the B-movie horror genre for greater heights) was hit by who .. or who is behind these notorious crimes. The village is dominated by hysteria and Karl is dependent on his trusted medical genius, dr. Otto von Niemann (Lionel Atwill, in yet another effective scientific role) to give feedback on what could kill the innocent. He also fears the safety of his beloved Ruth (the beautiful Fay Wray who dies with Atwill for the third time after "Doctor X" and "The Mystery of the Wax Museum") which is Niemann's assistant. <br /> <br /> Dwight Frye steals the movie as a nice village idiot who collects bats and undergoes demented behavior. He is easy to see why he becomes a suspect, as local paranoia is at a height. Maude Eburne offers the film's humor as a very naive (and easily influenced) von Niemann patient, who believes she has ailments over which she reads in books near the lab where he works. She is impressive and often von Niemann encourages her and her constant fiction diseases she feels. Lionel Belmore returns as another scared, superstitious Burmese guru. <br /> <br /> Bitter, static but rather entertaining thanks to the cast. The film is, of course, as low-budget as they come, but it doesn't hurt the movie too much, as it is rather composed by director Frank R Strayer and his crew. I'm sure the movie's pressure has seen better days. This is the kind of B-horror item you want to find in packed with 50 other random cheese feasts and poverty programmers. The film's villain and his motifs for feeding synthetic-made biological creatures. Make sure the Frankenstein formula is used differently. Many may be disappointed with the end result, as the film stays away from a real supernatural story about a true vampire killer that causes the killings.
