This short film inspired the golden-length feature - Spatel Madness - is a hilarious piece that is contrary to similar cartoons that several writers provide. Short film stars Edward the Spatula, who was fired after his work, joined the fight against evil spoons. This premise allows for some funny content near the start, but is barely present for the rest of the feature. This movie's 15-minute time is absorbed by some strange ball comedies and a small musical number. Unfortunately, there is not much else to be done. The plot set up doesn't really have time to show. But it surely follows that it outperforms many high-budget Hollywood movies. This movie is worth watching at least a few times. Take it for what it is and don't expect a deep story.
