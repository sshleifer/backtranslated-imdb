Fabulous, fantastic, probably Disney's best musical adventure. I have loved this movie for over 35 years because it is so imaginative, smart and fun. Even in spite of the foolish "flying bed" scenes, the other scenes and dialogue are magical and funny. Could they have chosen someone better than Angela Lansbury to play Eglantine? I can't think of anyone more suited to the role. The memory of these classics would be as stupid as Mary Poppins' memory. <br /> <br /> David Tomlinson, though he had few movie films, is absolutely in this adventure. He was a comic genius who is often forgotten these days. Napping, prim and proper English man - no one can really sleepstick and pull it down like he does. It will be tragic to relive this movie because Tomlinson has died for a few years and no one can get into his shoes and do his character justice. <br /> <br /> The dancing nightdresses and weapons have a magical aura about those who just don't catch other movies with witches. I especially enjoy the parts where the Germans invaded Eglantine's house and she must defend it in any way she can. <br /> <br /> Bobbing along, bobbing at the bottom of the beautiful white sea. Richard and Robert Sherman left the musical numbers. All of them are fantastic and remember, Portobello Road is one of my favorites. <br /> <br /> A good movie that still stops!
