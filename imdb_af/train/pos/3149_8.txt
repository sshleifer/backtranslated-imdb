Not since the Simpsons made it, there was a sitcom that I didn't want to switch off in a matter of 2 minutes. Of course it was said that The Simpsons killed the sitcom. Not the one. <br /> <br /> The first season was such that the teenage characters were not as shameful as they were later. They even went to school. The following seasons are the character from which they flowed. Eric, the sarcastic tweet, Donna, his shepherd friend, Kelso, the dull sphere, Hyde, the conspiracy theory and anti-settling punk, Fez, the pervert exchange student and finally Jackie, the spoiled rich flutter. Regarding the adult characters, there was Eric's mother, the "you can believe she is such a ditzy" suburban mother, Eric's father, the straight arrow that wasn't such a hard ass as he looked, Donna's goofy dad and her stupid blonde mom. All are true to their characters, but special kudos to Kurtwood Smith, who find the perfect balance between toughness and make his Red Forman rather sympathetic without abandoning us with unexpected sweetness. <br /> <br /> Of course, Topher Grace is the main reason why this show is so good. It's a tough character to play, as it doesn't allow the actor to persuade the game like the Kelso character, who played Ashton Kutcher skillfully. He enjoyed seeing the two characters interact because they are the most different. <br /> <br /> Hyde's character is a bit harder to enjoy because he is more realistic and we have to see the orphan story for the umpteenth time, although I will say the writers have a spectacular story in recent seasons arrived for him. <br /> <br /> Jackie, played by Family Guy Vocalist Mila Kunis, is hilarious and she has a nail on a writing board type that actually fits her character. The only sad part is that we didn't see any more scenes with her and Eric, because they were hilarious together. Too much story has been wasted on her relationship problems, as we already had it in spades with Eric and Donna. <br /> <br /> Finally, I will say that the decisive guest actors were always great. A few favorites: Fez's mid-season humongous girlfriend, Pastor Dan, the absolutely awesome Leo played by the equally cute Thomas Chong, another one of Fez's girlfriends who is completely certified and a special look by the teenage witch Sabrina as a Slutty Catholic girl. <br /> <br /> Come on next to Fox, whatever.
