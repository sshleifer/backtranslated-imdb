I remember having very little regard for such a business when it was first released. James "Not Jim" Belushi, a hommie-young actress, and a cheesy title in a John Hughes formula. You couldn't have paid me to see it 15 years ago. But I got caught watching it while I was throwing away a Sunday afternoon, and it hit me on a few levels. The fairy tale (share Pretty Woman, shares reverse Pretty Woman), the very vulnerable, Elizabeth_Perkins_in_Miracle_On_42nd_Street-like performance by Kelly Lynch, the escapism. All over it gently pulls very nice strings. It's pretty hard not to fall into the story, develop a beloved on Kelly Lynch, identify with James Belushi, dislike the stiff bad old guy, and laugh at the Curley Sue lines. Have all the ups and downs, with a happy ending, and the kind of message you want to hear. Go ahead, waste your time on this movie, it's worth it.
