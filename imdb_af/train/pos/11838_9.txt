This is one of the most calming, relaxing and beautifully animated movies I've ever seen. With beautiful music throughout the movie, sounds and music can make you feel like you're in the movie! This movie is not only ideal for children, but also for adults. It teaches you lessons, as never forget who you are, you can do everything you think, and brave and brave. This movie can sometimes make you cry, which is always a nice touch in movies. This movie is funny, sad, cute and keeps you on the edge of your chair! Some movies really give you a dirty feeling after you see it, and the movie "Spirit" is definitely one of them! With my 9/10 stars for animation, music, and a great idea for a movie, it gave me a lot of Spirit!
