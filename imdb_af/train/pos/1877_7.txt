Arthur Bach is definitely unhappy in his life as a multi-millionaire and is attracted to people below him in the social position. He pays for a hooker in the opening styles and is then very attracted to a shoplifter. <br /> <br /> He also drinks a lot, and sometimes he also drives while drinking, which of course is not funny. <br /> <br /> The movie is great, but behind the comedy are some realities. John Gielgud wipes the floor with everyone on the screen and creates a character for centuries. Talk about meritorious Oscar. Moore and Minnelli have their moments, but they Gielgud as "Hobson" remember you most.
