Overnight the movie was pretty good, a good action plot with a lot of explosions and fighting scenes, but Chuck Norris did almost nothing but disarm the bomb and shoot a few characters. The movie was very similar to the events of September 11, with a truck that appeared on the latter and sent a video to the president (Urich) and threatened to explode it. Judson Mills has some excellent action roles, which include Rashid's compound and various kicks, but there was a lack of Chuck Norris. Judson took over most of the action and left Joshua (chuck) with Que on her computer. But in general, it was realistic and the action was not lacking, but only on Mr. Norris's part done. I gave the film 7/10.
