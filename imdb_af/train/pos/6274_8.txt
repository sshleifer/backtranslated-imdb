I saw this evening with a lot of friends. I didn't hear much about it. So I didn't expect anything. But after I saw it, I really liked it. Nicolas Cage and the rest of the cast were very good. But I have to say that Giovanni Ribisi's acting performance needed a little. But such a small mistake, it can be violated. <br /> <br /> Gone In 60 Seconds is about a retired car thief who needs to improve 60 rare and exotic cars in one night to save his brother's life. The movie is by no means predictable. The end must therefore be a surprise. Think it's just another fast-paced car movie? Well, you're partially right. There is much more to it. Everyone should watch this movie.
