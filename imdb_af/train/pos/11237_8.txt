Star Trek: Hidden Frontier is a long-running internet-only fan-film, made entirely for the love of the series, and a must see for fans of Trek. The production quality is extremely high for a movie movie, although you can sometimes say it is green screen. However, it does not take away from the overall experience. The CGI ships are fantastic as well as the spacecraft. On the downside, in the previous episodes (and even occasionally in the latest) I can tell that some of the actors / actresses are not very comfortable in their roles, but this again does not detract from the overall experience of new interpretations of Star Trek not. The cast and crew really did something special here, and overall I would recommend this series to fans of The Next Generation and Deep Space 9.
