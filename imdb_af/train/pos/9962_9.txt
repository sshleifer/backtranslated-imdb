I was a little scared to watch this movie because of its rates. But life in Italy's titles never occurs and I like so much that I decided to try it. And how surprised I was! The story is different from any other dance movie I've seen lately, with a deeper meaning than just 'winning'. It touches and is well written and well directed. Raya is such a strong character, I love the fact that she never doubts her, she is so mature and focused and AWARE of her TALENT (and what talent Rutina Wesley dropped my jaw into the final dance scene). The way she pursues her dream and refuses to prevent something is honest, inspiring. Also, the fact that she is not the typical super-hot chick (see Jessica Alba, Briana Evigan, Jenna Dewan, Zoe Seldana ...) makes her really attractive and real. Seriously, why was this movie rated so low? You can understand from the first 5 minutes that it's a good job. Actually really good. I even cried at the end of the movie. And the dance routines are just sick.
