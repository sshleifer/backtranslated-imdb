I once went with a roommate who committed suicide, and our apartment was in a building where you could get a fifty thousand noises for the sneeze after midnight. So, I can easily connect with Polanski's "The Tenant". <br /> <br /> But I also enjoy the movie for other reasons. I'm not sure if it works. The Polanski character's descent into paranoia and madness, which lasts for half an hour or so, looks rather shocking and bizarre. Ebert, for one, was completely unsatisfied, and he clapped the movie with an evil one-piece review. But I think those individual scenes and moments work beautifully, so even though I don't quite understand the whole movie - what does Egyptology have to do with it? - I still have an overall positive impression of it. <br /> <br /> For example, I love the petty friend portrayed by Bernard Fresson. God, how often have I established that I have such stupid friends instead of no friends! I love the movie scene - the funniest "make up" moment in the history of the movie, I would say. And boy, I love Isabelle Adjani - she's so foxy in this movie, it's almost incredible. And she gives a good performance, as always. <br /> <br /> Polanski is also a good actor; I disagree with occasional disapproving remarks about his actions here. Its character is supposed to be low-key and considerate, so its low key performance fits. I found him completely sympathetic - although he lost me a bit when he started pulling for a clear reason. <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie is dark. One still. But it captures the alienating properties of apartment dwelling - something I've done far too much - so I'm digging it. It's funny that everything you need is a common point of reference, and suddenly a weirdo movie becomes so important! Definitely worth picking up for business change on DVD.
