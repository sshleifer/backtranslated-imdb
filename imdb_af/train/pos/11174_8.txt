Probably the most accurate Stephen King adjustment. Not surprising, since King himself wrote the script. The story follows the Creed family moving in a beautiful Maine house. One of the other residents is Jud, a nice old man who knows a few things about the area. One is the highway that runs right through their front yard. The other is a path that leads to the Pet Sematary, where children have buried the animals killed by the highway for decades. Soon Ellie Creed's cat, church, was found dead. Fortunately, this happens while the family, with the exception of Louis (the father), is away for Thanksgiving. Jud takes Louis to another cemetery, outside the Pet Sematary, where the church is to be buried. Later, Louis (not so polite) is greeted by the church. He came back, and he chewed his cold from the bag he was buried. Maybe he was buried alive. Maybe not. Nothing more I can say without destroying the story. <br /> <br /> Of all the King adjustments I saw, it would be the most frightening. The characters are real and the situations are normal. Mary Lambert does a good job of directing the proceedings. The suspension is kept fairly high by the film, partly due to plot development. The scene where Gage is killed will remain in your mind forever. Then of course we have the conclusion. Easy to find out what's going to happen, but Lambert actually pulls some scary and sometimes disturbing moments. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a great movie and a great fit. If you like to be scared and don't mind being followed by some occasionally disturbing images, "Pet Sematary" is just what you're looking for. Non-abominable fans will want to avoid it.
