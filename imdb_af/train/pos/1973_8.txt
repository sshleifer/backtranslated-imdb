I never trust anyone's views on a movie. This also applies to critics. Certainly, if it gets positive reviews, it is OK and a plus, but most movies that become critical, I hate. I enjoyed this movie for what it was, an entertaining movie. It takes you for a few hours out of your life and into a fictional character ... it's Catherine Trammell. Sharon Stone is wonderful in this role, just as she was in the first one. Anyone who says she's terrific in this movie, must have felt the same in the first one, b / c she's back as she did in Basic Instinct 1. Catherine is hers and she plays her perfectly. Her one linen is large, much like the first one. Who can forget in the first movie when she tells the police: "If you are going to arrest me, do it ... otherwise you will get the f ** k here!" Great scene, and believe me, she does it again in this one. I was enchanted by her. Her outfits, as she smoked her cigarettes, believe me, it's just worth seeing Stone's price. I can't wait for this movie to be released on DVD, because I can only imagine how much better it will be. And yes, there are many spinners, like the first one, including the end!
