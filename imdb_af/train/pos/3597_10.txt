(spoilers) <br /> <br /> I was blown away by this movie. I've already rented a little on movielink, and decided to watch this movie. Many boxing films seem to overflow the blood. In this movie, it shows it on the amateur level. Although I wish, perhaps more attention would be paid to her to improve her grades. The movie highlights the problems some families face with gender. <br /> <br /> I was a little worried about the end. But the end was not a disappointment either. <br /> <br /> I think it was pretty clear by the title she would win. What was unexpected was that the two of them were combined. <br /> <br /> Loved the score for some of the screens. Highly recommended. <br /> <br /> 10/10 <br /> Quality: 9/10 <br /> Entertainment: 10/10 <br /> <br /> Recoverable: 10/10
