I want to give Kolchak a higher rating, but the show quickly became scary / suspenseful too stupid. ABC's fault. They moved the show at 8:00 on Friday night, then known as the "family hour". Never be in the first place on Fridays. I was a high school in high school and loved the early episodes! It was the first time against the Policewoman on the NBC. ABC had major problems with Friday nights. Bad season for them overall to Barney Miller, Baretta, and SWAT debut in January of '75. Kolchak had to be a hit. Darren McGavin asked to come out of his contract to end the show. The writing wasn't exactly for Richard Matheson in the original TV movies. Yet McGavin has made his own Kolchak, as actors can do. Jackie Gleason as Ralph Kramden and Caroll O'Connor as Archie Bunker come to mind. That the INS set up with the manual typewriters and clacking teletypes today looks like senses and antique today, but it was part of the appeal. They were very happy to have Simon Oakland's "Vincenzo" repetition of the TV films.
