It is indeed a surprise to every Bolan fan, some may think it is a bit at the top, and that it's just about Ringo's and Marc's egos, but I think it's similar to any other concert video, except that it is Marc Bolan, not just any guy! I especially liked the music video for the children of the revolution, along with Elton John and Ringo Starr. this clip alone is worth all the money, i can't believe they didn't release this version as the single. The movie is really great, especially for our dance. Now I wasn't alive in the 70's. But Danes in general were completely shot out of what happened around them. The media did not play or play any of the popular music, including Marc Bolan and T.Rex. They just played a bit with The Doors, but only the very popular songs. So, I know of my dad that he sees it, gives him some of his youth, he should never experience it. <br /> <br /> I won't make it too long, so ... If you're the least fan of Marc Bolan, you should see it. You can find it boring or, as before, a little over the top. But at least you've seen one of the best musicians ever in action! <br /> <br /> Just a little disappointing is that Ride A White Swan is not on the band. but I forgive it, since Jeepster and Get It On are played so wonderfully.
