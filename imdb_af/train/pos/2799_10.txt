As an anti-football person, I (on the surface) took my younger brother grudgingly to see this movie, although I secretly hoped it might be East is East II. The trailers look nice, so I thought I'd give it a little. <br /> <br /> It took about ten minutes, but afterwards I was glued to the screen and it was nothing with the neck cramp Due to a packaged auditorium, too close to the front. The acting was fresh and alive, captivating the characters, and the jokes really funny. The entire auditorium laughed aloud every minute. Soccer winner or no soccer fan, sport has become irrelevant to the main principles of love, friendship, family, independence and rivalry. Add a dash of Sikh culture and you have the formula for the best British comedy I've seen long ago. I dare say this ... better than East is East. <br /> <br /> This movie proudly At a beautiful pace, never lives longer than necessary, and does nothing, and keeps the viewer entertained and mentally engaged. Although it is not a distinctive turn-and-turn movie, there are some pleasant surprises on the road and things do not always happen as you would expect. <br /> <br /> Say there were elements of predictability, but it was exploited satirically as used as script fillers. I suppose, depending on your particular affection for happy rounds, you can either be delighted / dropped by the end. Personally, if there was any other outcome, I would have written a strong word to the writers. <br /> <br /> As far as the actors are concerned, I should say that Juliet Stevenson (Paula) has the best performance. I never knew people like it existed, but she convinced her realism with sometimes bizarre concepts that they could do! Unfortunately, the most convincing (of the main characters) goes to Kiera Knightley (Jules) but doesn't make me wrong, even she has a good performance, it's just that someone last should be the best and sorry. Kiera, this time you are. <br /> <br /> Tip: Don't leave the credits. As soon as the lights came back, I realized to my horror that I might not have seen this movie. My beloved but forgotten Ice Junkie melted in a sugar-blue juice. Oh, what I say, it was absolutely brilliant and I can't recommend it enough. I will definitely buy it when it comes out and add it to my 3 video collection. I'm a student. I just splash out if it's really worth it.
