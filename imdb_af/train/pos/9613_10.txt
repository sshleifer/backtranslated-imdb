It is difficult to describe errors in words, it is one of those movies that must really be seen to be understood. It follows a story that is more fluid and interesting than I've seen in a Hollywood edition lately. Since his characters respond in different ways to the chain of events, and as the events determine different paths for the characters, the audience is simply an observer. The almost Proustian narrative stream of thoughts to mind, the very spontaneity in writing will stick you to the screen, and wait anxiously to see how it all works out eventually. And as far as the thematic elements are concerned, there is a specific sequence in the film that goes from melancholy to bright and beautiful, and then tragically, all within a minute. And it works. <br /> <br /> This movie is pure magic. It reminds one why independent film is perhaps the brightest star the movie industry currently has. Perhaps with more movies of Bug's quality, people will begin to notice.
