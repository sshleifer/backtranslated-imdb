How anyone can say it's bad outside me. I loved this show before I even saw it. For 3 reasons, 1. The story focused me, 2. Jessica Alba and 3. James Cameron! Please check out the bad comments and please check the entire first season before deciding that it is bad because I know that if you watch the first season you will love it and go out and buy season 1 as well as season 2 on DVD and then join the campaign to make Season 3! <br /> <br /> I hate Fox and I'm sure many of your "Dark Angel" friends also hate them. They have a thing for Canning Good Shows! Don't you agree?
