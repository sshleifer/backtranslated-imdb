To become a genre movie fan, a child of the 80's and a fan of hard rock music ... this movie is a special place in my heart. It has everything you want in a supernatural movie: action, great special effects (for 1986) and a guitar-like glamrock soundtrack. It was definitely the movie for all the heavy metal fans at the time. I didn't see it at the theater because it was never released above theater ... but the popularity of the video in the mid to late eighties ensured the status of the cult and eventually came to an (unfortunately mediocre) DVD release released in 2002. If you're not a fan of creepy movies or rock music, it's probably not your cup of tea ... but, trust me, there are worse movies of this kind out there ... and, despite average acting and some Outrageously ridiculous situations, Trick of Treat, are definitely a scary riff over the ordinary horror card. You will never look at your stereo again. Or should I say MP3 player? <br /> <br /> TRICK OF TRIAL TRIVIA- Marc Price (Eddie) played geeky Skippy Tradingman on the popular long-running comedy sitcom "Family Ties." After a series of direct video-flops, including "Little Devils" "Killer Tomatoes, Eating France" and "The Rescue," he has been following a career in uprising comedy. He recently considered a TV return. <br /> <br /> Glen Morgan (Roger) is now a major Hollywood producer / scriptwriter.

Since then, he has had a long and varied acting career, which appears in such films and TV series: 'The One' 'Godzilla' 'CSI: Crime Scene Examination' and the short-lived Joss Whedon sci-fi series 'Firefly'.
