I really loved it, although I read the reviews, it was very upsetting to me. But as an anime art fan, I can fully understand this perfect artwork, although it is my beliefs and beliefs. But hey, it's the world of art .. !! The beginning of the movie is very strong, strange and confusing. It is difficult to understand the content that makes me respect the one who made it. Only someone who is extremely open can do such a brave movie. It is absolutely not for children. although the characters are cute and rich, but they go through some disturbing adventures that cannot be erased (sorry if the spelling is wrong) of memory
