I was pleasantly surprised by the movie. Let's look at it; The point of departure doesn't sound particularly attractive when money is to be handed over for a night's movie, but it has an easy nature that wins one. There were no moments I found uncompromising, and I doubt anyone I will remember the next day, but it doesn't fail as a good distraction. What I found was funny to look at here in Beijing with my Chinese friend who never understood what I wanted. I told her there was a plot - three guys had to bring some weeds back to London. Almost satisfactory to her. There is no attack here for the camera I was expecting after reading some of the comments. However, I take exception to comparisons with Withnail and I; Not in the same league, and I doubt it was going. www.imperialflags.blogspot.com
