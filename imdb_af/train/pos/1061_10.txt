all the acting done in the first season was really great. The first look you get from Max and Zach is by Geneva Locke and Chris Lazar or if I call them the minis. the minis do the best work i've ever seen. the main actors and actresses, such as Jessica Alba Michael Weatherly etc., let you forget you look at a fictitious tsv. show that they look like this show is alive. All in all, it's the best show I've ever watched
