This movie is pretty cheesy, but I give it credit to at least give a characterization for its principles. There are a few good moments in the movie and the dialogue also has good moments. <br /> <br /> The air strikes may be the best part of the movie. <br /> <br /> I think I really like the idea of ​​how long a veteran goes for a fellow veteran. It's probably not done so well, but the point of departure is not bad at all. <br /> <br /> Tom
