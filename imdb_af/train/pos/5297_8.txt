Went to see this movie with my brother and his girlfriend. The place was pretty packed and we all laughed so hard it was easy to miss lines. I knew it would look good, but it was more funny than I thought. I looked both Edward Furlong and Christina Ricci, they looked very strange like ordinary people, if it makes sense. I get sick of movies that teenagers show like cookie cutters, such as "jock" or "geek" or "cheerleader" ... etc. Both characters were unique but still very human and normal enough to relate. I would recommend this movie to all my friends and very eager to get out on DVD. Look at this movie with your friends who can laugh at the funniest parts of life! I plan to see it again in the theater and I don't see more than once many times.
