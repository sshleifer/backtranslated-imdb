This movie documents the mid-1980s Harlem Ball Course. Much more fun than Palazzo Volpi, but just as sick, this movie is a real gem of squalor. One cannot help but sympathize with the characters because of their freakness. The only purpose of middle class intellectuals is to document the trash and gloss phenomena. Here is the most genius of the trash extremely well documented and properly glamorized. The characters' idol for idolatry of everything that is glamorous, inspires even more worship of the characters themselves on part of the viewer, and creates a phenomenon of a phenomenon effect that makes this movie an artwork.
