The only other film except Soylent Green that has such an air of hopelessness is On the Beach. Both films deal with the effects on the species and the planet of man-made disasters. On the beach with nuclear war and Soylent Green with the environmental poisoning of the planet. Perhaps there is reason for optimism because since 2007 we did not describe any of the worlds in those films and we were supposed to be too late. New York City still has about 8 million people, not the 22 million by the turn of the millennia as described in Soylent Green. Environmentalists always take this film as the result of global warming. For myself, it also shows the right to life-ethical race mug. Obviously there is no family planning in this world either. <br /> <br /> Charlton Heston is a NYPD detective who lives with roommate Edward G. Robinson, who is old enough to remember the Earth before the disaster struck. There was a murder, Joseph Cotten, an executive with the Soylent Corporation, a multi-national food-product case, a kind of wafer in many colors to feed the world's population. The latest product is Soylent Green. <br /> <br /> The investigation finds that Charlton Heston gets his husband, but it also leads to some terrible truths about the Soylent Corporation and the future of humanity. As Heston in the end screams that Soylent Green is made of people, that we have become a cannibal race, the terrible thing is that there is no alternative. We have exhausted the planet and we must kill our death to survive. <br /> <br /> It was the farewell to Edward G. Robinson and in his memoirs Heston spoke to Robinson, though they had different political opinions. . A few weeks after Robinson wrapped the final scene of his screen loss by consent of euthanasia, he died in real life. Not many did it, but Heston knew that Robinson was terminal and there was no play in the final two-man death scene. <br /> <br /> Though the timetable was down, it doesn't mean that the world intended by Soylent Green shouldn't happen. Hopefully we will not only have the intelligence but the sense of shared responsibility to make it happen.
