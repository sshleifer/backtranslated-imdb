Antonioni was looking for another hip masterpiece, this time across the Atlantic as "Inflatable". It was not the success with critics and youths like the former. Why? Maybe because it was a European view of America, filled with clich√©s that didn't work and it didn't age well. (The revolutionary students at the beginning are embarrassing.) Perhaps when it was released, large firm movies and those aimed specifically at the youth market dated. If released a year earlier, the hippos would have been fresh in deserts. It is a very interesting film shot very nicely with some brilliant and Antony-like scenes in between, such as the love of the desert, the silence of the desert house and the explosive end ... That the leaders were two amateurs did not not helped. They were beautiful but inexperienced. Mark Freshette is slightly better than Daria Halprin. It would have been so much better with proper actors! Perhaps Michelle Phillips or a young Jessica Lange ... The dialogue is pretty funny and awful, you don't know how the lines are delivered. <br /> <br /> A very intersting document from the late sixties is definitely worth the photography and the soundtrack.
