Bela Lugosi plays one of his rare good old roles in a series based on the long-running radio hit (which was also the source of a movie where Lugosi played the villain.) Lugosi cuts a fine drop of figure and silk sad that he had no more roles where he could order the man. Here comes Chandu back from the East to help the Princess Nadji hunted by the leaders of the Ubasti cult, who needs her to bring back the high priests of their cult. It's a great world-class series that's great fun. To be sure, the pacing is a bit limp, more related to one of Principals (the production studios). Then it's a ripe roaring adventure, but it's still nice. It plays better than the two feature films that were cut from it, allowing things to happen at their own pace, rather than feeling, or feeling "I've missed something". One of the trilogies of three good series Lugosi made, the other was SOS Coast Guard and Phantom Creeps
