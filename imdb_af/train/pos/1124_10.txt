I agree with all the awards, I watched a box of tissues watching this movie. It had a coarse authenticity and became true in every respect. <br /> <br /> The question I am about to raise represents a current animal sensitivity. I had a very difficult time at the start of the slaughter of sheep and goats, and the dying deer with its pulsating neck and bloodblowing, as his life was pulled down, was scary. <br /> <br /> It's the age of "no animals were injured in the production of this move." Iphigenia was made in the late 70's before the advent of computer simulation. Was it possible to kill this animal? Or are these animals for art generation?
