When this movie only came back in 1984, Prince was one of the hottest acts. Everyone wanted to see this movie, which was not much more than an extensive music video. The play was pretty bad, but what can you expect from musicians for the first time on the big screen? Even so, it was still a very entertaining movie! Morris Day and Jerome Benton offer some classic comedy, especially their version of "The Password", which will remind you of Abbott & Costello who "do their first" baseball routine. <br /> <br /> Appolina (who then went with a single name) gave some beautiful breasts, so you covered the short nudity. Plus, she is very attractive. And of course the album's soundtrack is one of the best Prince ever recorded. Prince later had an impact with Warner Bros. and changed his name, but at this particular time in his career he was at the top of his game. <br /> <br /> This movie does not fall into big time, but it's pretty entertaining.
