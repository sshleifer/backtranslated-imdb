I have to admit that Tsui Hark is one of a kind, you can't top a person with a strong style of movie presence. A Chinese fantasy picture cannot be easily presented to an audience, and the director tried to bring the classic fantasy stories of Zu Mountain back. That's what he showed. <br /> <br /> The new Legend of Zu really improved from one in 1983. From this new millennium update we saw Tsui Hark's vision of the Zu mountains. Spectacular visual designs, wonderful action-fantasy-epics have made beautifully beautiful. Stick me through the whole picture. Great throw with just fine acting. It's really a fun movie to watch, but is it too strange? <br /> <br /> Now, people are confused with the broad story line shortened in a 95 minute movie. Plot may not have much relationship among characters, but by watching the movie again, you will understand the characters themselves better. Some may complain that there are not too many physical battles, except with characters who have supernatural powers to defeat enemies, spirits that fight hand in hand would not make sense. <br /> <br /> I appreciate this pretty stylish picture. It may be a thin story, but look at Tsui Hark's "Time & Tide", but we also confused the plot, but it was really stylish and wonderful. Tsui Hark always attracts something different in H.K. Theater. American audiences may be hard to understand while watching this movie, because it's not Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, it's a whole new genre. Although it may not be a masterpiece, but it's special effects are really better than Storm Riders. It is really worth checking out.
