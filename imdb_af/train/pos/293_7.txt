What could be more shocking than the idea that private detectives get involved with the women they should be spying on? And most of the written dialogue is perfectly banal. <br /> <br /> But the actors change the dialogue into something that makes sense. You can see real people behind the unreal lines. And directing is wonderful. Each scene does just what it should and ends without dragging for too long. <br /> <br /> I showed it to several friends in the mid-80s, because I was amazed at how such bad stuff in such a good movie. The friends also enjoyed it.
