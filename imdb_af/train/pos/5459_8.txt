BABY FACE is a fast, smart cracks, a hint of a movie <br /> <br /> lasting just an hour and 15 minutes, but oh what a smart 75 minutes they are <br /> < br />! That a story covering so much land can be told in such a short time, shame most of today's filmmakers. Writing writers from <br /> <br /> today need to study the economy of BABY FACE and the bloat that <br /> <br /> overshadows so many of their movies. <br /> <br /> This story is no nonsense. An amoral woman rises to wealth first, <br /> <br /> and then the bodies of men who fall in love with her. <br /> <br /> Certainly, the production code created it with a redemption, happy ending <br /> <br /> but it's not difficult to see in which direction the authors wanted to <br /> <br / > don't go, so enjoy what is there and use your imagination for the rest. Stanwyck is great, like George Brent and Douglass Dumbvrille as a <br /> <br /> fearless businessman. Not a good movie, but definitely a pleasant one. If <br /> <br /> you never saw BABY FACE, it will come on the cable next time <br /> <br /> or rent the box. It is worth the effort.
