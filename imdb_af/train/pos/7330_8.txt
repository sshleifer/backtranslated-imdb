This movie is based on the art of Frank Frazetta, the mythical fantasy illustrator. Some of the characters are straight from his paintings (the Death Dealer is the best example). Surprisingly, the animation manages the feel of the original art. Bakshi is known for his heavy use of rotoscope (the technique of finding a live action series) and this movie is no exception. But since the subject of the movie is pretty realistic (all characters are people), it works well. <br /> <br /> But what I really like here is the plot: for once we have a story with interesting characters and fun action sequences, a scary villain and a beautiful babe. This movie has the feel of the best Conan comics, not surprising, as Roy Thomas is the author of the Marvel series of our favorite Cimmerian! It's far from the crappy live action Conan, not to mention all the B movie of the genre. <br /> <br /> Definitely recommended!
