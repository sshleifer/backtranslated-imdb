Crush offers a combination of drama, humor and such irony that I find the English settle very well when it comes to heart. Mostly known for the direction of John McKay, this wonderful script wrote about three forty-something friends in a small town in England. All three professional women, who were unsuccessful in men, included a ritual women's weekend with gin, phage and candy intake, with endless conversations of their dates wrong behavior or the needs of their libido. Andie MacDowell is thrown back by the British environment (which is where I find her the most). It is absolutely charming as the main holiday of a prestigious school that engages in a younger man. Small village gossip and the disapproving jealous friends (great supporting cast) contrary to her relationship. Unveil a series of brutal unhappy events and show us the many problems when one is in pursuit of true happiness. Keep in mind that the main premise of this movie is friendships and the end shows us exactly that. This is the kind of movie you love or hate, and so I believe many reviews of the mix and not the greatest success occurred when this film was released. As I am sure, most of them just degenerate into the movie. I really enjoyed this movie and was highly recommended for those like movies like "Love Actually" and "Three Weddings and a funeral". Not to mention the soundtrack is extremely perfect to capture those important moments.
