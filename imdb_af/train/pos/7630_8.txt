Kurt Russell, whose career started when he kicked the REAL Elvis. This is happening on the world's display. He will probably never clear his performance as the King in this biopic shoulder by shooting obliquely and shocking master Carpenter. There are times when you feel like you are looking at Elvis until something looks back to reality ... maybe memories of a fearless Don Johnson in Elvis and the Beauty Queen? All the performances here are excellent: Season Hubley as Priscilla, Pat Hingle as Colonel, even Shelley Winters brings the right levels of nerves and hysteria to her delivery of Momma Presley. <br /> <br /> Kurt's dad Bing plays Elvis's father Vernon here, and there's a fine, understated show by Robert Gray as Elvis's girlfriend and bodyguard Red West. <br /> <br /> A must see for rock n roll fans.
