This film made for French TV deals with the tragic effect it has on a closed family. When Leo, the young man in the middle of the story was diagnosed to have the AIDS virus, announce it to his parents, they just can't believe it. The film is a character study on how this family deals with the topic. <br /> <br /> The director, Christophe Honore, must be congratulated on the fact that this franc account is being brought to the screen. Nowhere, but in France this story can make the movie because of the subject. <br /> <br /> The news has a devastating effect on Marcel, the young brother who hears about what Leo has contracted, despite the way parents want to protect him from reality. <br /> <br /> Yaniss Lespart and Pierre Mignard do a convincing job of portraying the brothers.
