So we compromised. It was a pretty beautiful movie, I like the artistic direction (it feels much more "right" than most children's films), and the costumes were not too cuty. The child actors weren't bad to look at (the adult shows went to cheese). It was wonderful that they showed how a bully child also bumps other kids and kids. <br /> <br /> I don't know how many adults want to see it for themselves, but it's a great movie to take a child. And since "Barnyard" attended to 100+ kids at the same time, I am VERY happy that we have chosen the smallest attendance of "worms".
