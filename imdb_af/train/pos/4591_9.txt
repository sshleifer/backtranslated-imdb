It is depressed to see where Jackie Chan ended up. He was an unstoppable hurricane of punches, kicks and incredible stunts. To be fair, he is now in his fifties and one will expect it to be slow. But with 'Rush Hour 3', where he sits behind Chris tucker (of all people!), And then there is 'Kung Fu Panda' where he not only has a pure voice but his character has scarce dialogue. .. to say that Jackie Chan has seen better days is a colossal understatement. <br /> <br /> It's times like this when the only solution is to make a dusty old VHS band and watch Jackie some asses in his younger kick, fitter, Chris Tucker free days. <br /> <br /> Give 'Police Story'. Jackie Chan plays Kar-kui, a policeman whose job it is to protect a witness before a big trial. He resists both the unco-operative witness and the numerous hits sent by the crowd to silence both of them. <br /> <br /> But on the other hand, who cares? We don't look at Jackie Chan movies for the story. We look at them to see Jackie Chan exercising obvious stunts and generally kicking a lot of people who are scarce than he is. <br /> <br /> And at that level, 'Police Story' disappointing. There is an immense revelation in a shopping mall at the end that culminates in Jackie who is a giant, high-voltage candlestick. Seriously, if this kind of thing happened more often, no man would ever need nurturing to buy clothes. There is also comedy, of which Karu Kui accidentally upset May (Maggie Cheung). , his eternal suffering and apparently ever forgiving girlfriend. The humor as a whole is pretty impeccable, but it works so I don't complain. <br /> <br /> The acting is also not too subtle. Indeed, I'm not sure there was anything subtle about 'Police Story'. Director Jackie Chan (yes, he does too) clearly has a deep understanding of why we see his movies and know that while we wait for the next fight to start, the last thing we want is for nuance and depth and inner meaning. <br /> <br /> So 'Police Story' is an explosion. As in most of his films, the fact that Jackie sees the things you see on the screen is actually the head and shoulders above the competition. I mean, if Jackie Chan really hangs from a speed bus through an umbrella, a whole new "Wow!" factor is added to the action.
