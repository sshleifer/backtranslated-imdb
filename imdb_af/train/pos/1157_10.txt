This is one of the best comedies ever! Writing this parody of soap is brilliant and throwing, just look at the names of the cast and you will understand why it is so good. If you're a Kevin Kline fan, he does (as always) a fantastic show, and Robert Downey Jr. is perfect. If you do not laugh while watching this movie, you have no sense of humor.
