Tigerland is one of the best movies I've seen, and I think it's even a complete metal jacket, a film of a similar nature. Bozz is extremely well played by Farrell, and is a character who stays in your mind long after the movie ends. The end is cut brilliantly by Schumacher - with the melodic harmony singing and the slow mother of the troops preparing to leave. What a movie.
