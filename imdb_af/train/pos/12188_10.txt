Pure Orson Welles genius makes this one of the greatest movies. Welles is only used in a murder conspiracy to set up as the false man, after which he refers to the sarcastic commentary "big dummy I am." Plot is so complex that I don't know if the victim knew his life was about to be lost. The shootout scene in the mirrored carnival hall is one of the most beautiful ever filmed. That scene alone is the price of admission. It's the only time Rita Hayworth ever played a complex but credible character. No one, but Welles would have had the nerve to cut her hair and paint it blown. No one should miss this picture.
