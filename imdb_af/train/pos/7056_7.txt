Following up on the popular Cinderella story reminded me of what they did with one of the Beauty & the Beast movies. It's basically three short stories in 1. <br /> <br /> OK, the mice are rich (I love Gus! He's sooo cute!), And Lucifer's awesome (as usual). I also liked the newer characters (Pom Pom was beautiful and I liked Prudence.). Yet the storyline was somewhat limited, but still very cute. So, I vote 7/10.
