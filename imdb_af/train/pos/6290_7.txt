With the help of Buster Keaton in the twilight of his career was an interesting choice. He was perhaps the most talented comedian of the silent age. It gives him the opportunity to display those talents in a short travel story. He becomes addicted to a man who lives in modern times, and it becomes clear that we are the best in our own time. Keaton is able to do his face well. I heard his voice before. I believe he did some of the Beach Party movies, playing some nice characters just to earn a few bucks. Serling had respect for him and portrayed him so. This is not a bad story. It shows how one reacts if we want something that we don't have and we want.
