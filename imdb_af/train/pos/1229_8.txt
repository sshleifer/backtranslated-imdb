I waited before I saw it, since all the reviews I read said it was terrible! I rented it and expected the worst, and although it is hardly the best sandler movie, there is much worse! Sandler regularly speaks with the camera and the movie doesn't take him seriously, but it's all part of the fun! A great way to waste an afternoon, and you can even laugh yourself once! A good movie, worth renting!
