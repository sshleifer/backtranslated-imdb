This is a beautiful, rich and very well-executed movie with a rich and meaningful story. Actually, this tells how an old master storyteller must find a (male) heir to continue his craft, but eventually he doesn't get what he expected in his very masculine dominant world. The characters then have to deal with their situation and the old master must struggle with the conflict between his desire for a companion and heir and his and the community's traditional concepts. <br /> <br /> The story is fun, emotional and complex. Exploring the characters, their lives and emotions is rich and forcing the character development to be strong while the characters are complex and not one-dimensional. The film brings the old man's emotions and his desire to find an heir, and shows compellingly how he and the child deal with the situation. There is also humor, sometimes fairly subtle, at appropriate points. The film also explores the good and bad of traditional Chinese culture, creating further interest and depth in the film. <br /> <br /> Directing, acting and scenery are all outstanding. Added to the other strengths, it creates rich and convincing visual images and compelling, real characters. The result is that the film causes strong empathy and feelings about the characters. <br /> <br /> Some say the end is weakening the movie, but I don't necessarily agree. Perhaps it could have been stronger at another end, but any improvement in the overall movie would have been rather small.
