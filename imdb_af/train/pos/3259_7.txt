It's not the best romantic comedy ever made, but it's definitely pretty pretty and viewable. It is fashioned in an old fashion and it works well. Cybill Shepherd as Corinne is not bad in her role as the woman who can't get her husband's death. She has a sexy maturity. But I can't say much to Ryan O'Neal as Philip, because he's at best, indescribable. He may be sufficient in the role, but it is not good enough. <br /> <br /> However, I get the feeling that some of the characters, especially Alex and Miranda, are not thought up in depth. We don't know anything else about them, because minutes after they appear, the story becomes thick, and the writers don't tell us much further than what happens. But the problem has been saved because Mary Stuart Masterson has a fresh-as-a-carnal sweetness to lift it, and Robert Downey Jr. is so beautiful that it melts the screen. Even his smile is contagious. And it also happens that his big dreamy eyes are perfect for the deja vu and flashback scenes. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this movie is light and easy and if you keep them that way, why not try it. <br /> <br />
