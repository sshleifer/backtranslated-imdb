HONOR PEOPLE has Cuba Gooding Jr., in what is probably his best performance so far. He plays Carl Brashear, a man of eternal courage and heroism. He is a poor farmer from the South who wants to become a naval diver, but has problems because of his race. The head of the diving school, played by Robert DeNiro, is a racist redneck who, however, grows to respect Brashear. The film is about Brashear having to accept the almost insurmountable chance not once, but twice. The shows are what make this movie special. Gooding is fantastic, and DeNiro, the best actor in film history, gives high performance - his best dramatic work in years. Charlize Theron gives another solid performance than DeNiro's much younger woman. The film is a bit too strong on patriotism (although not near the level of the Patriot), and a few characters are just one dimension bad (Hal Holbrook's Pappy is just as angry), but the film is a rarity among movies today. It is exciting and ignorant. A wonderful movie.
