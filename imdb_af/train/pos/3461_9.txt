This Columbo episode is probably more noted for director, Steven Spielberg, as one of his early films. It should be looked at Jack Cassidy's role as the murderer who killed his partner in writing to maintain his lifestyle. Jack Cassidy will appear in a later Columbo. Columbo meets his match in Jack Cassidy's character. He is a riddle writer who portrays the perfect murder. After his first murder, his next victim would be the annoying general store owner / widow who would extort him for money. Rather than losing more money, he kills her. It is very entertaining to watch Cassidy and Falk as always. Falk's fame as Columbo makes him vigilant after watching this episode repeatedly over the years. What television has forgotten about the success of years is that people want to watch the shows again and again when they keep the characters. It's not about who does it, how and why, it's the familiarity of Columbo and its benevolence, which is highly regarded by viewers as I do.
