Hunky Geordie Robson Green is Owen Springer, a young doctor who moved to Manchester to be near his father. Along the way, he falls to Anna, a 20-year-old woman, who is the wife of his new boss, Richard Crane. Despite warnings from his new colleagues, Owen continues to find Anna for himself, as far as Anna is sabotaging and cheating on Richard's marriage. It is a romantic drama with very humorous undertones and a quick white. The actors are beautiful: Green of "The Student Prince" and "Touching Evil" blacksmiths on the screen as the cunning but warm-hearted Owen; Annis from "Dune" fame is alive and proves to be a good fit with Green; Kitchen, from "The King To Play" is the real threat to Richard, whose comic book and snobbery underscores Owen's masterful hatred. It is a perfect love triangle, and despite the foolishness and delusions of our three characters, you better get to know and look.
