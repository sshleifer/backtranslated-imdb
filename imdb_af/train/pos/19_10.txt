I just read TomReynolds2004's comments and felt I had to jump here. I understand he doesn't like the movie, but his reasons are not clear. My feeling about this movie is that it is not afraid to travel the dark roads of loneliness, failure, disappointment and sadness. Each of these two people, as depicted, has many reasons to be bitter and angry, yet they find tenderness and comfort in each other. Only great acting can make this work without becoming an emotional quagmire, sentimental and juicy. I was really interested in these people because of their overwhelming humanity given to such strong performances. I have every reason to keep Jane Fonda for her Vietnam-era performance, but personal feelings apart, she is fantastic in this role. Robert DeNiro is wonderful as a man whose intelligence and goodness fail him in a world of his ability. This is the first thing I have seen DeNiro use of tenderness rather than toughness to sell a character and I really like it. This movie was a big surprise when I first saw it and I look forward to seeing it again.
