I was glad to see Jim Carrey in a movie where it wasn't. His character is like us all. Want more - better things to happen to us and expect God to deliver. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman made a good God. With a sense of humor and a sincere love for each one of us, ready to take some holiday when the opportunity arises. <br /> <br /> I thought Jennifer Aniston's character was a bit too vulnerable and understanding to Carry's basically self-centered TV anchorman, but that's the way it was written. <br /> <br /> I think the previews have ruined some potentially very funny scenes because everyone they saw knew what had happened before it happened. /> <br /> I've read a number of reviews and some people seem a little too deep. It is a summer comedy and is not meant to solve the world's problems, although there are some messages that we can all take to heart. <br /> <br /> A funny movie.
