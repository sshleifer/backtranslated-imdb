I've seen The Running Man several times, because I'm a Stephen King fan and have all his movies, but now it's even better because until 2 days ago I didn't know about this site and I didn't realize that The Paul Michael Glaser who was involved in this movie was the same Paul Michael Glaser I grew up on the Starsky and Hutch television program. For me, it's a pleasant surprise because I can't tell you how many times I've called out when Starsky or Hutch was hurt. The episode where Starsky (Kill Starsky) is almost dead, I cried so loudly. My dad had to turn off the show. What do you expect from a child at age 12. Now I deliberately look at movies and programs that include Paul or David Soul and anything that Stephen King has his hands on. I'm so there !!!!!!!! Are you just lucky with Paul?
