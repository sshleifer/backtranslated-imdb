As someone else commented, it's a good movie. It has glorious scenery and the wonderful voice of Luciano! I saw this movie many times and saw it again this afternoon. I forgot how much I miss Pavarotti's song from Nessun Dorma and I have to get the CD out! It's a great movie just to be taken in fun and reverie in the afternoon. Eddie Albert is big like the agent and a bit on top, but all the agents are just like that. The Italian countryside is beautiful, but nothing is the balloon ride for the perfect view. If you need Olivier ratio, this movie is not for you. If you just want a flight of fancy and some great music, watch this movie. Don't Enjoy!
