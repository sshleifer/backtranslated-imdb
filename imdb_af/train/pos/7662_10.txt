As B movies go, it was well above average (I now warn the reader that I can reveal certain key elements of the plot or other parts of the movie, although I try to limit such a trend). As the successors usually go, it was absolutely fantastic (despite a "cookie cutter" approach to try to copy certain elements of the original movie ban. Despite this sometimes boring trend, it looked as though the viewer could work. Separates his attention from comparisons with the original "Scanners". <br /> <br /> The movie was similar in ways of the Superman series, in terms of the main character's description of his early childhood and relationship with his parents. (modeled in the same way as the Kents in the "Superman" stories) and the theme of a morally pure hero possessing extraordinary powers of early age, etc. The portrayal of profound feelings of alienation from lost or otherwise non-corresponding children, adolescents and / or adults was a theme that reminds me of movies like "Real Genius" and (to a more superficial degree) "Doctor Mordrid" and got a very strong cord. <br /> <br /> The movie had a positive message and was nice to watch. I found some of the insights and accuracy (in terms of portraying certain aspects of paranormal experiences), fascinating, and even touching thoroughly. These moments sometimes occurred from all the great formula-driven shock and free sex (uality, in this case, as the sexual elements were done tastefully) and violence that B-movies (or Shakespeare play, for the matter!) So much fun to watch! <br /> <br /> It's a must see for all comic books, sci-fi, remote viewing enthusiasts and horror fans! With the right exposure in the right circles, the movie can follow quite a cult, along with the original "Scanners".
