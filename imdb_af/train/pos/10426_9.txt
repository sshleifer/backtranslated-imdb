I like this because of my recent personal experience. Especially the ideas that everyone is free and that everything is finite. The characters in the firm didn't really enjoy their "real" lives, but they enjoyed themselves, ie what they were. The movie did a good job of making this simple day a good reminder. A good reminder not only includes romantic feelings about a beautiful stranger and a beautiful European city, but definitely about the deeper discussion of their values. Many movies are like this in terms of discussing the definitions of life or love or relationships or current problems in life or some sort. Before Sunrise handled it in a fun way, the viewer stopped and thought and adjusted her breath and continued the movie. Before Sunrise didn't try to push a particular thought into your head. It just encouraged you to think about some problems in everyday life and gave you some alternative options. This made the conversations between the characters interesting, not just typical sounding complaints or flowing silly ideas. You will still think about these issues for yourself and be curious about the next line of story. The end was not quite important. You can get something out of it and feel something good or positive about yourself after the movie. Movies are supposed to be enjoyable. It's a nice movie and worth seeing your time. I'm also traveling. The film suggested somehow and answered some of my questions.
