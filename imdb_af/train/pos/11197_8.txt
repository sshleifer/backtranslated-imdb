Another silent love triangle movie from Hitchcock, not a mystery, but very English, very good-natured and photographed. Smooth boxer Bob Corby (Ian Hunter) recruits circus boxer "One Round" Jack Sander (Carl Brisson) to be his sparring partner, partly to keep the pretty but capricious Mabel (Lilian Hall-Davis) close. There are many character actors and grotesque? At Jack and Mabel's wedding, the concierge, standing in the corridor of the church, shock at the eyes of the very tall and very short men, the fat lady, registers the knotted twins who, of course, argue about which side of to sit down the aisle, and the wedding feast is amusing. The rest of the movie lost Jack Mabel and returned to his heart, or something. It was another era, with the audience in evening dress, and the boxers also dressed when they were outside the ring. The camera angles, the tempo, the use of symbols, the cut? Everything very stylish and masterful. The camera work and editing of the last boxing game is very gripping. Brisson's good looks are well used in this one; his smile is not as unaware of what is going on around him as he is in Hitchcock's Manxman, and so it is not annoying. But can boxers have such pits?
