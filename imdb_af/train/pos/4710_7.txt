As far as parody movies go, there is little that is worth time and energy. But with a recent revival of horrible parodies such as Date Movie and The Comebacks, it's a fresh air to come back to and rediscover a really funny farce like Johnny Dangerously. <br /> <br /> After his mother has no end Of medical problems, little Johnny goes to work for the crowd. What is fake is a series of gags, most of which work, but there are occasional flops. But a strange gangster who can't master the American language (a prophetic way), a competitive gangster with a love of shooting his mouth (... once!), A younger brother with the D.A. who is out to get Johhny Dangerous, and a hot young star hot for his love, Johnny is busy. <br /> <br /> And the viewer will be laughing, mostly, as each gangster movie clich√© is skewed by a talented role and decent writing. <br /> <br /> Not perfect by a long shot, but definitely good for a smile on a bad day.
