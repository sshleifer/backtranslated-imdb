When looking at this early DeMille work, it once again confirmed to me that early DeMille is much better than the late DeMille. His attention to the use of light within screens is remarkable. His pacing is very good, so it can be told in an hour or so. It is a pity that he was not so intuitive about the style of his later audio films, as he was in his silent movies. <br /> <br /> It was the first movie I saw Cleo Ridgely. She was remarkable, properly confined and yet conveyed a wide variety of emotions. <br /> <br /> The end is great.
