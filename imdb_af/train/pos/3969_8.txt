Did anyone notice that James Earl Jones is the waiter who serves when Hagarty's wife reveals that she is pregnant while at the restaurant next to the lake. I watched this movie on a video I taped off the television. When I looked at this scene, I thought I recognized Jones' voice when the "waiter" was over. I washed the tape back and then slowly pulled through that part while the camera pulled back and showed the waiter. Listen well as the waiter laughs when Hagarty looks up and tells him they'll have a baby, look now or slow down the scene when the camera shows the waiter, even if it's fast.
