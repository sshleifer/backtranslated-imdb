The premise of the story is simple: An old man who lives alone in the forest is accidentally stumbled upon a murder of a small child and tries to convince the police that the murder has taken place. Although very little dialogue is provided throughout the film, the visual narrative made by the camera's eye alone made the film very enchanting. The setting of the gray bush brings a sense of loneliness, which complements the silence of the characters themselves. We can also experience helplessness in the old man's inability to convince the police of the murder, which is in line with the disabled child's inability to tell her own story. True terror lies in feelings of hopelessness, helplessness and irrationality. This film successfully adapts these elements through visual art, rather than relying on cheap sound effects or blood and gore, that other bad horror movies use when the narrative is weak. <br /> <br /> The story is clever, unfolding at a slow pace to build up for some creepy and surprising moments. The end is also unexpected and credible. Reminiscent of Japanese horror movies, such as "The Ring" and "Dark Water" or English horror movies, such as "Lady in Black" and "The Innocents". This film offers viewers the experience of true atmospheric horror. I recommend someone who enjoys a good cool of the bone difference to try this movie. <br /> <br /> By the way, if you haven't seen the movies I just mentioned above, you might want to try them too.
