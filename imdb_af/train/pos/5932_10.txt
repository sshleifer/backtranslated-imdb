Best Stephen King movie with IT, although this one is nicer than scary. <br /> <br /> This one has it all: <br /> <br /> a big part with Alice Krige and Brian Krause and a pleasure from King himself <br /> <br /> - well-taught horror in an entertaining storyline; <br /> <br /> -Great use of music, especially in the "Sleepwalk" of Santo & Johnny; <br /> <br /> -like characters in a typical King neighborhood: middle of nowhere; <br /> <br /> - Lots of humor. You can't really get good scares here, because it's too much fun and, moreover; <br /> <br /> - all but beautiful makeup effects like they no longer make! <br /> <br /> A 4.5 rating: I'm not really getting it. When was the last time a horror movie as much fun as this?
