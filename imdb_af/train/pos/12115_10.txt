Another comment about this movie made it sound uncomfortable. Given talk pictures were so new - I think the writing and acting were good. Davis was so young and fresh. She hasn't gotten her own style yet. Yet it is wonderful to see her so - still learning the craft. <br /> <br /> So many clips came from this movie and this movie seems to have been on the road for the next 70 years. My voice is this and remember how young this kind of movie was. Keep open and mind, and you may be shocked at how worried the characters in this photo were, as it was 1934 and how we considered the early century of the last century. I love it and hope you have your own thoughts on it. by other negative and one note comments.
