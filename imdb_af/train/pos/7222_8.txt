Definitely one of the most witty and twisted-what I've ever seen. Christopher Reeve and Micheal Caine were brilliant and made me go through the whole thing. <br /> <br /> Many classic pieces and props really give a sense of atmosphere to the proceedings. The minimalist feeling works for the whole picture. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is not the movie itself, but the lack of a decent widescreen edition of the movie on DVD. I own the fullscreen version (which proves I love the movie to endure full screen presentation), but a wonderful Deluxe or "special" edition will surely get me money.
