The movie version of Alice Walker's extremely emotional and influential 1983 novel (written mainly as letters from the central character Celie to God) was a massive Oscar success, and rightly so. <br /> <br /> In the role of the battered and awake Celie, Whoopi Goldberg gave her the best screen performance per kilometer. Not far behind her was Oprah Winfrey as Sofia, the fiery woman tamed by the lot. Others in the role-play have the characters Walker introduced so clearly on the page - Danny Glover as Albert, Celie's abusive man; Margaret Avery as Shug, a power of change for good; Willard Pugh and Rae Dawn Chong as Harpo and Squeak; Susan Beaubian as Corrine, the preacher's wife; and the beloved Carl Anderson (otherwise known as Judas in the 1973 film of Jesus Christ Superstar) as minister Samuel. <br /> <br /> Beautifully and sensitively written, 'The Color Purple' goes straight to its source while the story opens to use drama viewers with drama.
