Some movies just don't have to be made again. This is one of them. In and of course it's not a bad movie. But it fails to capture the scent and terror of the 1963 movie of the same title. Liam Neeson was excellent as he always was, and most of the governor quit, with the exception of Owen Wilson, who just didn't get the right feel for Luke's character. But the big mistake with this version is that it has gone too far from the Shirley Jackson story. These are attempts to be generous and have lost the excitement of the previous film in a finishing for more strange special effects. Again, I will say that this is not a bad film in itself. But you will enjoy the friction of terror in the older version much more.
