As a young boy, I always hated "Cinderella" as I was wiped out by my two sisters when my parents considered what Disney movie would buy. I wanted "Dumbo", but my sisters won and we got "Cinderella." They thoroughly enjoyed the movie while playing in the back of the room with my Star Wars action figures. <br /> <br /> Many have since changed. My love for the Disney theme parks landed me an internship at Walt Disney World, and now I have two young cousins. I love Disney as much as I can, and we recently watched "Cinderella" together. With my newfound appreciation for everything Disney is, I looked at "Cinderella" with a new perspective and was impressed with what I saw. <br /> <br /> However, I didn't understand from the beginning. why Cinderella was caught up in such horrible trouble. Why was she such a slave to her step family, and why couldn't she just run away? I was not too sympathetic to Cinderella, but as the story progressed, I immersed myself in the story. Perhaps the striking animation or the love characters moved me in, or maybe it was the timeless songs. Listen to songs like "Bibbidy-Bobbidy-Boo" and "A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes", hit me back to the theme parks. I can imagine myself in the carefree and fun atmosphere while looking at the awesome Cinderella Castle. <br /> <br /> Something about this movie just makes the magic of Disney known. It can make many people mock, but go to the Magic Kingdom and see all the little ones that are like Cinderella, excited to be in this fantasy world, and you will know what I'm talking about. The images of Cinderella and the glass armor - as well as Mickey Mouse, Winnie the Pooh, and Tinkerbell - explain why Disney is one of the most beloved companies in the world. <br /> <br /> While "Cinderella" may be Not the strongest story, it's kind of iconic in Disney and movie history. It represents the fun, idealistic and fantasy-like wonder we held when we were kids. I think this movie has a lot of meaning for many, many people out there. It may not be my favorite Disney movie, but it represents everything I love and admire about the company. <br /> <br /> My IMDb rating: 10/10. My Yahoo! Grade: A (Outstanding)
