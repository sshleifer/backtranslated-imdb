If you are in the mood for more than an hour, a long film like this movie can give you a little variation. What I love is the constant surprises. It's not just one time you want one or more of the short films in "New York I Love You" to continue. Yes, some of the short films make you curious, some of them are very short, some of them are longer, some of them have definite ends, some of them do not. <br /> <br /> Most of the story is on the sad side of the capital. It shows many different nationality backgrounds. Many of them make it the same way I once went to a capital in other countries for a year where many people came from different countries. This movie explores many things you may have known, but for all the characters it's a new thing. Perhaps some of you alone traveled abroad to stay for just a year or two just to feel something new, meet new people; Feeling dreamy, sad, but the kind of sadness you are looking for because it was just boring you, was in your own home. You might want to relive it by looking at it.
