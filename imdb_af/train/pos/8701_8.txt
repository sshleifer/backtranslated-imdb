For anyone expecting a traditional superhero movie, this can be an unpleasant surprise. It's definitely more of a drama rather than an action movie. It mainly focuses on emotions and it's a bit like a Greek tragedy - regardless of the main character, it's always somehow wrong. <br /> <br /> That's because Sasha, like every superhero, takes the law into its own hands and society doesn't appreciate it. Sasha becomes a ban. While on the move, he meets a beautiful girl and falls in love, making things even more complicated for him. <br /> <br /> As you can see, the plot itself is very dramatic, but the movie does not have dynamics. It reminds me a little of the narration in the recent movies by Ram Gopal Varma. Everything happens very slowly. However, if there is an action scene, it becomes so dynamic that before you realize what is going on, it is over. But the director doesn't want to impress us with flashy and striking action. What is more important here is the outcome of Sasha's actions, which are mostly very drastic. The score is very scarce, which also makes it harder to focus on the film. So basically you have to be very patient to see it. <br /> <br /> Is the movie worth it? This is a very difficult question to answer. I don't think this experience has enriched me so much, but somehow I keep up with this movie and feel it again. Mostly because of the atmosphere, which is really dense but not suffocating, because Sasha and Katya always have hope. After all, they are young people who have all their lives to live. No matter how difficult it is, there is always a little joyful tune when they are together.
