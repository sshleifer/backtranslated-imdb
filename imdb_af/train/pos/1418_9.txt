I hardly saw this movie, because I remember the penguin march was not so exciting. I went mainly because Disney promised to plant a tree when I saw it on the opening weekend, but after seeing it, it was just wonderful; The fact that photographers can capture impossible images is simply worth your money. You also get different habitats, different vegetation, animals and natural phenomena that will not only shock you - simply because you will never expect nature to be so magical and dynamic, but also touch your souls and the demand of mankind towards the world of how our lives deviated from nature to such an extent that we take for granted the natural beauty and miracles characteristic of our biosphere. You don't have to be an earthly lover or a tree-crawling environment to appreciate the sheer awesomeness of this documentary. You just have to be an inquisitive soul that asks the value and miracle of life. Enjoy it!
