I thought King Solomon's Mines was beautifully done. My only discussion was Alison Doody. Her acting was wonderful, but her makeup and her were not of the time, and apparently she had made her appear to the other actors. I thought Patrick Swayze was an excellent choice for Alan Quatermain. It was nice to see a seasoned, rugged player in this role after being through the movie to the film with the righteous, just actors like Val Kilmer, Brad Pitt, and so on. He was an excellent choice and I enjoy this movie every minute. This version cannot be compared to the 1950 version with Stewart Grainger. It was a big screen movie and not a TV movie. I thought both Quatermains were credible, but the two media should remain separate. I'm looking forward to seeing it again, and I hope Patrick Swayze will look at these rolls again.
