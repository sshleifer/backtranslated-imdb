Pushing Daisies is just a wonderful fairy tale, with shades of Amelie's aesthetic and romance. It has a beautiful palette, its shots are well thought out and detailed, its names and dialogue are whimsical and cuddly to actually be, its imagination great and its romance deep. Look at the blue in the airbag at you, blue cannot be found in the rest of the sets or shots (with a few exceptions). <br /> <br /> Watch a weird natural and completely satisfying song out of a scene. <br /> <br /> The score is beautiful, its role is very nice, there is good music, and the two leading romantic stars cannot touch each other, or she will die. How much more sexual tension do you need? (Actually, I wished they'd found a way to get this one, but it's just an indication that it's a pleasure to spend an hour and I highly recommend it. other television that really does, and I would like to see more. It made me have a crazy week through a flu, as it does for good company. <br /> <br /> Bring it back!
