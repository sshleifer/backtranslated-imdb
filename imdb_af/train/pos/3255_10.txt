Each scene is perfectly composed. This movie had a wonderful team and crew. I mean, how can you make a bad movie with Robert Downey Jr. in it, no one will ever exist. He has the ability to brighten any movie with his wonderful talent. This movie was perfect! I saw this movie alone on a movie block in "Blockbuster" and it was like I exclaimed. I couldn't resist picking it up and bringing it home with me. You can call me a juicy romance, but this movie just touched my heart, and I also said I laughed at the same time. Although it made me cry, I admit that the whole movie eventually brightened my outlook on life afterwards. I suggested to my horror, action and pure humor film from a brother who absolutely loved this movie. It's a movie with a good sense of feeling. It can make you laugh out loud, touch your heart, make you fall in love, and enjoy your life. Every time you deliberately go over this movie, be aware that you're aware of the choice to live and feel this inspirational movie. Who knows? What if it really happens to you? And keep your mind open to the mystical wonders of life.
