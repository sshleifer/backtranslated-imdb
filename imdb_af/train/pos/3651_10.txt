Pandora's Clock is one of the best thrillers you'll ever read and is one of the best thrillers you'll ever see. A highly faithful adaptation of John J. Nance's novel, which had a terribly real scenario in the novel, is made even more so here. <br /> <br /> Despite being made for TV, it is first-class entertainment. The film is good and grinds in characters from the novel so well that you think they read the novel. Richard Dean Anderson steps out of the shadow of Macgyver and gives the best performance of his career to date. Jane Leeves is a great role as ambassador assistant in a role that proves she can be a good dramatic actor. Daphne Zuniga is big like dr. Sanders and despite the character of a man in the book, it works very well. Robert Loggia, Edward Herrmann, Robert Guillaume, and the rest of the supporting role-players are also adapting their new counterparts to his letter. <br /> <br /> There are, of course, changes to the story (including and a slight change in the end), but the changes are for the better compared to the novel. The plot is realistic and much in the way it is presented to make it the best airplane movie ever since the original airport movie. The production values ​​are high and although the special effects may look as good as they did a decade or so ago, it works well. Sets are great, especially CIA HQ and the Oval Office which prove that the filmmakers spend a lot of time making this work. <br /> <br /> It doesn't matter if you see this first and then read the novel or vice versa. Do both and you won't regret losing four hours to this movie, and how long it takes to read the novel. It will leave you breathless.
