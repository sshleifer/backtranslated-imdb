This film has rewritten film history in all respects. Nobody cares about what anyone thinks of this movie, because it surpasses criticism. Every mistake in the movie is easily overcome by the incredible things the movie is about. It's a very beautiful movie, and I doubt many of us will see something like that again. I've seen it more times than I count to count, and I'm still caught every time, with a feeling that can hardly be described. One for centuries.
