I just had to be 11 when Mr. Peepers started. It was a must for the whole family, I believe in the sun. nights. Repeating gags opened Rob's robe (he had to use a benchmark or pointer to make the right place on another locker room and do other things and eventually kick the place where his door would open) and pins from a to draw a new shirt at the start of an episode he will open a parcel with a new dress shirt and get one for the rest of the show one he missed when unpacking the shirt, timing was all and pennies laughed a lot.) I remember a lady riding a Rio like Jack Benny and always wanted "Sonny" to say something scientific. He will think and come up with "semi-permeable membrane" or osmosis that causes her to say how brilliant he was. (you should have been there). Marion Lorne stole the show every time she was on the screen. Why didn't they continue the series of her POV when Wally stopped (he was afraid he was tipecast but then it was too late) I would never know. I saw somewhere that the 1st TV wedding (big one anyway) was Tiny Tim on the Carson show. Horsecocky. It was Rob and Nancy (had I ever had the hots for her) and I remember making the cover of the TV guide and printing in all the newspapers and major magazines. A trip to the Museum of Broadcasting in NYC years ago was disappointing because they had very few episodes and it may be gone. I still remember it so much and wish I was a little older.
