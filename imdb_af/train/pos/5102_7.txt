No matter what the soundtrack is. <br /> <br /> However, Debra Winger is always interesting and while it was a former role for her, she is pretty good as Cissy, girl on the wrong track, has in a trailer with Bud, (Travolta), just for a time replaced by city clerk Madolyn Smith. <br /> <br /> I agree with a previous review about Scott Glenn, he is only used for plot, thrown into the mix to create tension; The story is predictable and confronted. <br /> <br /> Although I come from the east, many of us didn't like Saturday Night Fever, while having his moments, are the eternal stereotypes about criticism at this point. <br /> <br /> Appreciate for Debra Winger; she is still so nice, and never had the Hollywood persona that we are undergoing by too many actresses today. 10/07
