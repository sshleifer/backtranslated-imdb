A good movie with - for his time - an intense, vast, rather dark story reminiscent of John Ford's "The Searchers", though not so cruel. The story begins quickly and does not cease, with several scenes of a very good dialogue between Jeff Webster, Ronda Castle and Sheriff Gannon. This movie was somehow reminiscent of "Bend of the River" (1952), also a Mann-Stewart work, but I found it less sentimental and more interesting. There are a few examples: an over-filled (and rather sentimental) end; 24-year-old Corrine Calvert is not very convincing as a naive French teenager and of course, the film takes place in the Mythic West, a country of fable where the right laws of nations and physics are not applicable. But this is trivial concern. James Stewart is surprisingly good as a dark, disconnected man who thinks he doesn't care for anyone but himself, and the mountain scenery can't be beaten. A fine Western costume drama.
