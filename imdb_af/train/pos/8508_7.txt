Richard Dix decided to retire and so Michael Duane took his place as Ted Nichols. He meets a young French girl named Alice Dupres Barkley (Lenore Aubert). This couple knew only two days and they decided to marry a Justice of Peace (Judge) and it is raining when they come to the Judge's house and find out he is not at home and will do not return to the next day. As the couple are inside the house, you see the car of the car and take a car in the engine. Once you see this event happening, you realize that this couple is in a great surprise and the story creatures are creating a very mysterious event that surrounds Alice Barkley and so begins poor Ted Nichols with many problems and no marriage. Good mystery, but I missed Richard Dix. Enjoy.
