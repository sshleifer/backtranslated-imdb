The strange couple is a comic gem. One of the funniest manuscripts ever dedicated to celluloid - just exceeded by Strangelove, Spinal Tap and Lebowski! Lemmon and Matthau are best friends: obsessive compulsive Felix and untidy, irresponsible Oscar. Oscar's wife has already left him because he is impossible to live because of his irresponsible attitude. Felix's wife leaves him at the start of the movie, and after a suicide attempt suspended, he moves with the poker friend Oscar. That's when the fun begins. <br /> <br /> The entire script is brilliant and filled with brilliant one-liners. You are probably already familiar with the "F.U." joke, but it still works brilliantly because of Matthau's comic timing. <br /> <br /> My favorite moments are when Lemmon tries to clear his sine in dinner and when the Dove sisters are charmed by a very pure Matthau and Lemmon entirely out of his element. This one requires repeated views!
