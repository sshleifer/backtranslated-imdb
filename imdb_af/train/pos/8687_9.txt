It was the second entry into the regular Columbo series, and it is doing well today. As I can now see it on the DVD and see how it is built, I am very impressed with the direction of Bernard L. Kowalski (who regulates the fine MACHO CALLAHAN as well as numerous TV episodes) - watch the Na-murder the killer's action is shown on a dividing screen effect on his two glasses, watching the murder itself appear in mounting mode, watching the eyepiece shot from the light of the body. Also the wild but impressive avant-garde musical score by renowned Jazzman Gil Melle was incredible and helped so much to create atmosphere. And the supportive performance of Brett Halsey as the golf pro was wonderful - such subtlety and complexity in a role that would be nine out of ten times a one-dimensional cut. The "formula" had not yet been determined when this episode was filmed, so there are still a few surprises in Columbo's methods. Of course, Falk, Robert Culp and Ray Milland are the highest quality actors and it's a pleasure to see them work - all men are known for many other roles, but lose themselves in their characters here. Overall, this entry into the Columbo range - and much of the others - is as well-crafted as a very good feature film.
