I'm probably one of the biggest Nancy Drew fans out there. I read every book three times and I played a lot of the Nancy games. I love this movie. It has entertained you all the time you watched it. I am with some 10 of my friends and everyone loves it. There were three women behind us who were in their late 30's to early 40's and I asked them how they liked it, they said they loved it! So you see it will be fun for all ages. You just have to give it a chance. And it also teaches a lesson, be yourself, even if everyone around you is exactly the same. So overall, this move was wonderful. I'm going to see it a second time now! So stop stopping it. It's a very good movie!
