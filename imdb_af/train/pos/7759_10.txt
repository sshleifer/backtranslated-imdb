On the surface, "Written on the Wind" is a slim, glossy soap opera about the sexual dysfunction of a Texas oil friend. But under it all is a deep, social commentary on the life of the 1950s. Director Douglas Sirk is counting another Universal sudser. Robert Stack falls in love with Lauren Bacall. The problem is that Stack's best friend, Rock Hudson, also likes her. When Stack finds out, he is sterile and Bacall ends up pregnant, flying the fireworks. And all-well-good Dorothy Malone won an Oscar for her portrayl from Texas's biggest nymph avoided by Hudson. Good epic soap.
