The combination of the beautiful black and white photography and the 'Eugene Onegin with a twist' made me a real hit. The atmosphere created by mostly dark shots as opposed to occasionally very brightly overexposed white was grabbing. There was a wonderful moment where transparencies - apparently conventional holidays cut, but where the faces of the actors subtly but immediately revealed the character and situation - are accompanied by Lensky's heartbreaking aria from the Tschaikowsky opera Eugene Onegin. <br /> <br /> For me, the sign of a good movie is that it should benefit from the opportunities offered by the medium, which means that the story is often less important than image and atmosphere. Last year in Marienbad is a good example of such a film. . Krisana is in the same form.
