By the time I write it, I see more than 15 000 votes, it has a 5.8 count. Something's wrong with that photo. Personally, I give it a 10. I can see a 7 at the lowest or a possible 8 if it is for people who see this movie for what it really is. It's a comic book-based movie. This movie won more than part of the awards. Won 3 Oscars. Another 5 wins and 26 nominations .... right there I say it's better than a 5.8. Some great actors from some very good actors, some great special effects and in my opinion will be if not already a classic for the coming year. If you're looking for pure entertainment, check out Dick Tracy. Definitely a movie that you can watch more than a few times. All Pacino is big like Big Boy Caprice.
