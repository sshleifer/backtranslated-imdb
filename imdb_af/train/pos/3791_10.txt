Our song is a wonderful example of passionate, movie entertainment at its aesthetic best. It's actually a real wonder of a movie; a penetrating and insightful artwork that twists the lives of three young inner (Crown Heights, Brooklyn) girls during a particular summer in their lives when the confusion of their approaching maturity forces every one of them to make a number of difficult lives Changing choices that will probably define who each of them is, and how they will stay with each other over the next few years. <br /> <br /> Jim McKay's writing / direction is graceful and fair. There is no juicy, generous sentimentality, and there are no solutions in this movie either. What we see here sometimes seems to be sad. There is a naturalism - a credibility, if you like - in our song that surpasses that of other giants in this genre, including American Graffiti and Cooley High. <br /> <br /> Much of the film's credit goes to its principle actors. The combined presence of Melisa Martinez (Mary), Kerry Washington (Lanisha), and Anna Simpson (Joycelyn) is brilliantly powerful. It will be easy - and, of course, blatantly blunt - to reject, like some, the performances of these three as apathetic or ominous. In fact, their silent charm, their instinctive sense of dignity and their raw, sometimes unconventional intelligence, throughout the film, is absolutely sound. One must be completely unobstructed with, or completely indifferent to, the behavior of teenagers to miss the prevailing authenticity in what these three young ladies bring to the screen. Similarly, the supporting role, especially Marlene Forte as Lanisha's mother, complements the work of the three girls as well as the overall tone of the film. <br /> <br /> Our song is a movie that should not be missed - by anyone of any age.
