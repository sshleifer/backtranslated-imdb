For me, it was more awake, and realized that most everything we see, hear, read, and think about most anything, depends on what the media feeds us. It's a classic example of high-level spin doctors trying to control the masses through controlled information. It is also an excellent example of how people with a constitution that they have freely bought will not be monitored by this media control or any attempted misinformation. Again, it shows that the needs of many at the end of the day will indeed increase the needs of the couple. It is also enlightening to see that in a country where there is no religious civil war, that democracy is not a really difficult thing to implement.
