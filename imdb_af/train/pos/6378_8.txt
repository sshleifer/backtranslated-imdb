Atlantis: The Lost Empire has the best, smoothest animation and cleverly written dialogue of any Disney movie I've seen. And I was convinced of it in the first 15 minutes. I especially love Don Novello's voice work on Vincenzo Santorini and Phil Morris as Joshua Strongbear Sweet. Badly the whole movie seems to be moving at about the double fit that would be appropriate - at least in the first act. One important aspect of any Disney movie is a satisfactory antagonist - which Atlantis does not provide. He is at best average. Halfway through the movie there is a mediocre twist. That's all. It's a big movie. Everyone should choose it.
