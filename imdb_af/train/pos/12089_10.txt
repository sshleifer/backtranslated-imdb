<br /> <br /> Film dominated by raven-haired Barbara Steele, it was seen when I was seven or eight and created permanent images of pallid vampire men and women beating a castle looking for blood. Steele is an icon of horror movies and other worldly beauty, and the views of the undead have foretold Romero's NIGHT OF LIVING DEADS, which unite them in my mind. <br /> <br /> I don't see the connection between this movie and THE HAUNTING, which is clever but ambiguous about current forces. LA DANZA MACABRE is a b-movie without pretense, daring to fall in love with Barbara Steele and suffer the consequences. There is no such sign for HAUNTING's crowded Claire Bloom. The equations with the HAUNTING are superficial. <br /> <br /> And no, this movie does NOT have to be made again. Not only is it a product of the Sixties, but the vast percentage of unpretentious criminals in Hollywood cannot satisfy the MACABRE formula for terror. The formula is based on one dominant factor: GOOD WRITING. Low-grade classics such as CASTLE and Corman's Poe films featuring R. Matheson and Tourneur's OUT OF THE PAST share a common strong writing. It's simple. Get a real writer like Richard Matheson or Steve McQuarrie and let them make a plot in today's spectacle. Besides that, Hollywood is trying to make some original material for a change, and stop exploiting the naturally better product of the past.
