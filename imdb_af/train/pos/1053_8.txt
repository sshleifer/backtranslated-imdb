Sisters in the law are made by the same directors of the rather oddly fascinating 'Divorce, Iranian Style', which was exactly as it was, as we have a look at the Divorce Court in Iran. Now they have turned their attention to the court system in Cameroon, Africa. What is good about this court is that 2 of the magistrates are Women, which is unusual for such a country. Anyway, they are about many men trying to get their way out of the women, but this film is remarkable in the fact that women in society have made great strides in recognizing divorce and women's rights. So the judges often chastise the men to act in these primitive ways. Not to say that the women appearing in court get the softer treatment. One of the main points of the film is a case of child abuse done by an aunt. The judges do not waste time in eradicating women. And who said that justice is no longer served? With this 2 behind the bank. They often execute maximum penalties! Ya! You're going girl!
