... and I love it. Many special effects, and for a movie not made on the mega budget, make this movie a great job to create a fantasy masterpiece. I'm one of those guys who didn't understand the story at all, but it was still a good movie to watch. It's definitely there in standards that exceed Bored of the Rings, and in the same way as movies like Harry Potter. What a lot more to say for a movie, made on a fraction of the budget of these international hits. <br /> <br /> One thing I really love about this movie is that it is the adventure movie envelope that comes from Hong Kong. The subject is exotic and original. Production quality is different from anything that comes from HK for fantasy action games, and acting is great. <br /> <br /> One of the best movies to come from Hong Kong is the Hong Kong fantasy movie Infernal Affairs. , and I hope they will still work in this area until they surpass Hollywood adventure movies. <br /> <br /> Just fantastic.
