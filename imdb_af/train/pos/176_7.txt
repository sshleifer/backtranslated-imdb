KEEP SPOILERS. This movie was okay. Goldie Hawn and Chris Sarandon were the best two in it. Okay, so the goofie-stranger who (SPOILER HERE) deals with the biker for his clothes, was funny. This man's boss was also good. But the movie really belongs to Sarandon and Hawn. These two had to spend much more time on each other. They are chemistry was wonderful. The bathroom scene-WOW! Romantic, sweet, delicious. <br /> <br /> Hawn is a goblin waiter who saves a stranger and ends at the basement in the middle of a plot due to the greed of politicians. Talking about Sarandon would be to give away a lot. SPOILERS This is a rather extraordinary romantic / political comedy, and it satisfies both the political side and the romantic. It touches on political issues, and barely skim on romantic areas. <br /> <br />
