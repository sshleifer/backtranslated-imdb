"Dragonlord" sees Chan returning to his role of "Dragon" from "The Young Master". However, not much of the first film was transmitted. "Tiger", his older brother, is nowhere to be seen; The Marshall, his daughter or his son was also not played by Yuen Biao in the original film. Dragon does have the same master - presumably all the other students have moved on other things. (Dragon's laziness on training is portrayed in this movie, so maybe he is still studying!) <br /> <br /> Originally titled "Young Master In Love", see this movie Dragon (for the first sixty minutes) a village girl in various idiotic and slapstick ways. His rival for her love is his friend (improperly named "Cowboy"), played comics by long-standing Chan Stunt team member Mars. We see several scenes where their stupid schemes fire back. This is one of those scenes that we (gratefully) find "Dragon" in his head. <br /> <br /> This movie is notorious because it failed the expectations at the box office. That is, I am sure the expectations were quite high and I feel that this film has never been justified by its own merits. But even if I'm trying to do that, I still feel there is a problem with the movie. It seems pretty unfocused, sometimes rushed, and I think the action is too sporadic and not as brilliant as Chan's other work from this period. <br /> <br /> The thing the movie really is is the finals. As in "The Young Master", there is a fantastic final rule that it is full of incredible exhausting action - you really feel every blow. And again, Chan goes against the same rival of "The Young Master" (is it the same character?), And the time and energy here is brilliant. Chan's style of using every last part of his environment to defeat his opponent - not just on pure physical abilities - is as clear as elsewhere. The barn they invade is full of clever little propagags and improvisations. It's an absolute highlight of the movie and one of Chan's incredible career. <br /> <br /> It is not necessary to see the prequel before you see "Dragonlord". It can even raise more questions than it hopes to answer. But it must be said that the original movie is the superior movie, and "Dragonlord", with the focus on girls hunting and sporting sports seems baffling. Fortunately, the few combat scenes it offers (plus a fantastic picnic scene) line up as a must-see movie in this genre.
