A deceitful social condition leads out of the disaster: An impoverished Giovanna landed in the gutter, but has another bait on her sleeve: beauty and youth. Bragana, a nice gas station tenant, who has come up for years, takes her off the street and offers her bed and home with his uncomfortable love. But Giovanna's physical contact now only gives her feelings of dislike, and as a result, she doesn't see a benefactor in him, but an evil man she has to get rid of. <br /> <br /> The arrival of Gino, a young migrant worker, finally offers her the longing opportunity. And you don't have to ask her twice. At the first encounter, she gives him the feeling of physical desires, and a little later she seduces him without resisting. <br /> <br /> The development partnership must comply with the strict rules set by Giovanna. Gino's longing for freedom is suppressed, his desire to leave the place with Giovanna and start a new life far from the fatso is set aside. Giovanna strives to achieve another goal: to kill, inherit, and collect the insurance premium. In her hands, Gino degenerates into a self-sacrificing instrument. Being completely at the mercy of this woman, he becomes a cold killer. <br /> <br /> But unlike Giovanna, he asks for the committed crime at moral level. The takeover of Bragana's place, which includes sleeping in the bed of a dead, causes a deep aversion to itself. And later, after finding out about the upcoming payment of the insurance money and appearing to be regarded by Giovanna's cunning plans, he also made a physical separation from his lover and found comfort in the arms of a prostitute. <br /> <If Visconti's movie ended at this point, it can easily be classified as a judgmental portrait of a cool, computing and unscrupulous woman with mild social criticism. But then the last sequences make this careful build of ideas collapse. Eventually, Giovanna feels remorse of what she has done, and through the unshakeable revelation of her innermost feelings she manages to regain Gino's love again. Her violent death through an absurd road accident not only leaves him helplessly at the mercy of an arbitrary fate. It also affects us as we realize that none of the acting characters is responsible for their disaster. The culprit is just the condition of a society that is determined by the individual from the outset. <br /> <br />
