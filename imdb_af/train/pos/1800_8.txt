All dogs going to Heaven are on a par with Watership Down for scary kiddies movies. Both were dark and fairly sinister, but at the same time the most surprising experience a child could have. It was one of my favorite movies as a kid. I was in love with Charlie and at age five or six I would admit ... I had a beloved puppy. All dogs tell the dark story of lovely cad Charlie and his partner in crime Itchy. The story begins with Charlie who escapes the death field and swings to the nearest club to do gambling. Of course, as a kid, I didn't understand the concept of this movie. I loved the songs and the animation, but as I got older, I wonder why I wasn't disturbed by this movie as a youngster. It's about beautiful adult themes --- gambling, murder, hell and prison, but in a world of good Disney movies, it's something every child has to watch. <br /> <br /> Yes, there is a kind of crazy transvestite crocodile scene and hell scenes scare me more now that I was little, but it does deliver such a striking message that should not be ignored by parents!
