It's a great game! Well, maybe it didn't have some of the features it meant, but Digital Anvil still showed a good game. There is a similar agreement with the Elite (you can trade, upload weapons and remove cargo from destroyed ships, go on missions). However, this game has a heavily written mission. It's a big mission. The control system is different, it uses the mouse! You basically fly your spaceship around a system and work your way out! The game features some good graphics, even though it was made in 2003. It should run well on even a modest specified computer. The story contains a big voice acting from John Rhys Davies, George Takei, Jennifer Hale (she appears in every computer game). Stick to the story, it gets better and better as it goes on. There is even a racing section where you and an opponent have to race your spaces around a course (it involves ringing). This section took me a while to beat. It adds variety to the game. Some sections are a bit difficult here and there, but overall you can win this game. The game has an active mod scene on the Net. Pick up a few mods to expand the game. I haven't played any of the mods yet. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, a sequel has been canceled, a shame!
