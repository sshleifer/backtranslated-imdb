Loosely referred to as a satire by D.W. Griffith's intolerance, The Three Ages, was Buster Keaton's first attempt at a full-fledged comedy feature. The only similarities with intolerance are the opening of the "book" scene and the fact that similar stories have been compiled into a complete movie over the centuries. Keaton's reasoning for applying this style was that if it could not succeed as a feature film, it could be reduced to three two lines. Fortunately, the three centuries come brilliantly as a comedy and contains some of the funniest routines I've seen in any of Keaton's films. There is nothing unique or daring about the story lines. They are a simple boy-meeting girl, son-in-love girl, boy-girls, but the satires are countless and set the standard for future works by Mel Brooks and all the movies of this genre. However, I do not believe anyone ever covered this comedy. Nobody can play the lovely roof like Keaton and the stunts in this movie are the best. In addition, Wallace Beery adds Keaton's rival to the film's appeal. Anyone who thinks about the comedy of the 1920s cannot be appreciated by modern audiences, this movie should see.
