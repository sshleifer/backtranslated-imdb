If I think of the return of the Jedi, I think epic. Yes, Ewoks was there, what? They are an interesting addition to the movie (not to mention, they are similar to the Vietcong which could also take a technologically advanced army with primitive acts). Jedi is definitely darker than the rest of the movies. Emperor Palpatine (portrayed by the incredible theater actor Ian McDiarmid) was one of the best parts of the movie. Palpatine is so angry and angry, Father looks like Mr. Rogers compared to him. Talk about Darth Vader, who made a wonderful end to such an iconic character. Father is truly a contemporary Greek tragedy and I think people can understand and appreciate it now after the Sith Revenge has come out. His salvation at the end was moving and really made you feel happy but bittersweet. Of course, the best part was the special effects. It's amazing how a movie from the early eighties can still stand the test of time with its graphics. The screens at Jabba's palace (Leia looks incredible in that metal bikini) and of course, the epic triple battle at the end is still special to look at. In all of Jedi's deep plot and emotional moments (mainly between Luke Vader and Palpatine and when Luke reveals the truth to Leia) and incredible special effects, this is an appropriate end to one of the beloved franchises in cinema history.
