I saw this movie in the first few weeks, but I didn't remember exactly when. I thought it was good for a Ben Stiller movie. This movie is not for a person without a good sense of humor. Like most of Ben Stiller's jokes, you have to think about them. Or as I said you have a good sense of humor. From a few people on this site I saw that people had nothing to say about it and it didn't get a very good rating, but I would have given it a bigger one. This movie, I think, was very good and it had to get a better rating. Maybe it's not a movie for you. I just give you another person's opinion.
