These westerns are done differently from most others. Realism is the key here. Conchata Farrell comes to Wyoming to work for Rip Torn on his farm. How it is presented makes Americana an interesting cut. I'd prefer to see it on the big screen rather than on the tape, but it's worth seeing how life in the west was back. Cinematography is excellent. Solid 9. Torn & Farrell excel in this movie.
