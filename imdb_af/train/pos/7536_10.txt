The person's comments saying that Pat Robertson is angry and his program is bad has nothing to compare to what is evil and fair. His definition of evil is the opposite of evil. The Bible itself says that in the last few days people will call good evil and evil good! He does not even know that he has fulfilled Bible prophecy! If you don't know God and refuse to know him now, that's fine. He still loves you, but if you finally bow down to Him and you will, it will be too late for you. God doesn't send anyone to hell, not even you! You are going to make your own decision and define it! May God be gracious to you and give you a Damascus road experience. The 700 Club and Pat Robertson's ministry is one of the reasons I am still here. On the brink of alcoholism, adultery, and probably death, God reached through the TV screen and used Pat Robertson to do so, and thank God for what He did! You have the right to say what you have said, but you have no right to curse your words. God has mercy on you.
