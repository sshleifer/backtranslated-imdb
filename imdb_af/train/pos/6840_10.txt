the fact that the film is predictable is not a problem. This movie is like a beautiful painting to be enjoyed. The museum scene is like a nice music video. the apres sex scene is an all-known scene in all our adult lives. but the movie would not interest me without Keith Gordon. keith gordon may be one of the most underrated actors of our time. Almost everything I know about acting has come to mostly study his eyes. He had the most compelling face. His character possesses the qualities I look like in an old, sensitivity and dedication. keith gordon is beautiful. BTW, I wish he would now shave his beard, as his lips, jaw and Adam's apple were his most beautiful set next to his eyes.
