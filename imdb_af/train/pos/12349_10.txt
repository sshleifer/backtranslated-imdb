This movie just shows that you don't need big explosions, or a million dollar graphics, or highly paid actors and actresses to make a good movie. All you need is a great story line and plot. who brilliantly mastered all Japanese films, Akira Kurosawa. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves an epic period piece. and for those who enjoy Kurosawas previous works. 10/10
