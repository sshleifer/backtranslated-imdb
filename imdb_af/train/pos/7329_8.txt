I really enjoyed this movie. The humor was sometimes absent, but I enjoyed how the story moved between dramatic and serious film. This is the only movie I have seen Verdone (one was 'Un sacco bello'), and I can see why Italians find him tiring, but he thinks he played his role well as the loving father. <br /> <br /> My one drawback to this movie was that I knew it was happening in Italy - somewhere in the middle or south, I thought, but I felt there was no place. This movie could have been in New York, Boston, Melbourne, New Delhi. I always think it's important that movies get a place to give the viewers something. (Maybe I missed something?) :) If you like Italian movies, I think you'll enjoy it. It's not a Fellini or a Rossellini - it's not realism or neo-realism. It's a comic story with serious moments that can really happen to any of us.
