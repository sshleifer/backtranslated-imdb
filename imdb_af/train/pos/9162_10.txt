Although I didn't read the "Classics" in the literature before I was 47, it's never too late. Jane Eyre is for many reasons a favorite, mainly because there is no part of the book that I liked less, only parts that I enjoyed more. The 1983 TV mini series featuring Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton was all I hoped it would be. I saw it as a full length movie in 2006. Dalton's "Mr. Rochester was very good, but I absolutely loved Zelah's Jane Eyre. On another 'Classics' movie I've seen recently, I was disappointed in production, direction, and dialogue. It was just true to the sly and arrogance of Hollywood. Artistic license for the great works in literature is nothing less than plagiarism. The use of the title after such license is fraud. Allow the British to get this one right (among other things). You won't be able to read the book without reliving the movie with the right context and spirit. Well done BBC.
