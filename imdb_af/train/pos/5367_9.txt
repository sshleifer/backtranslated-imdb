This movie is one of the most underrated movie of his time. If you watch this movie, you're full of action, and when something doesn't really hap, the humor is un-matched. Brilliant writing for a movie made to give us a bloody mix, a game show where criminals are the participants, and a near future where the general public all thirst for blood. Also Arnold does not let us off his best one liners. I don't want to spoil anything for you, but I'll tell you when Arnold gives her "I'll give back". He gets the best response from all of them in this movie. Hope you enjoy this jewel as much as I did.
