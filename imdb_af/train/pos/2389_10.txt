I work with kids of 0? 6 years old and they all love the Doodlebops. The Doodlebops are energetic, lively and attractive. Once they start singing, "" We're the Doodlebops. We are the Doodlebops. We are the Doodlebops. Oh yes. Come enjoy the fun because we laugh and we sing all day. "It's almost impossible not to join them. in the song. The Doodlebops brings the viewer into a world of color and fun. Every show is an adventure. The Doodlebops are not trying to change the world with preaching messages they are doing, being fun while dealing with the everyday challenges the young child is sharing. The Doodlebops is a refreshing, high-action alternative to regular children's television shows.
