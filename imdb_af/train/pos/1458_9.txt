Sharp, well-made documentaries focus on Mardi Gras beads. I have always kept this approach to movies - putting ideas about a bigger, more complex and often irreconcilable phenomenon by breaking the problem into something familiar and close to home. <br /> <br /> I'm sure most people heard stories about sweatshops and understood the basic motives behind profit and capitalism, and the effect of globalization on poorer countries (but people feel about it). Rather than set out on these subjects and stand up on a soapbox (not that something is wrong, except such documentary programs usually preach to the converted), this documentary reveals Mardi Gras beads, how it is manufactured by which people and under what circumstances and then how it utilizes consumers at the end of the process. It examines the motivation of everyone involved in the process, including workers, factory management, US importers and ultimately the consumer at the end of the chain. It examined me openly and firmly. <br /> <br /> I feel a little sick here. ; Similarly, through the Mardi Gras revelers, but also the workers in China accepted their situation as normal and ready for the course (though they objected to the details of how they are managed). The footage of the street sweepers cleaned the beads at the end of the streets, made a special impression. But it was just my reaction; I can see someone else reading this documentary a little differently. <br /> <br /> Unlike other documentary documents on this subject, I don't think you should have a specific political opinion on this. This is ultimately a story about people and our relationship with the goods we produce and consume. If you've ever bought a product made in the Far East, you should consider it. <br /> <br /> Outstanding and highly recommended. See more documentaries like this. Kudos to everyone involved in making this movie.
