I believe Sarafina is a tremendous effort by Whoopi Goldberg. Besides her, there are no other stars in the film and her role is smaller than the title character, Sarafina. As I work in a high school with urban children, I think it is an important film to show the South African history of apartheid. Sarafina is a film about education and a teacher's relationship with her student, Sarafina. I bought the video for almost nothing at a video store. I watched it and quickly sent the music numbers. But I strongly recommend this film to educators and their students to understand. Now that I don't know the other actors and actresses in the film, I assume they are very popular in South Africa and I'm glad they filmed a South African film, except Goldberg in a small role but if it gets people to see this movie, then Whoopi is worldwide appeal.
