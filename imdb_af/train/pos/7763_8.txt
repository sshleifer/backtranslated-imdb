One thing about Hollywood, someone has a success and it's always rushed to be copied. And another thing is that players give some of their best performances away from their home studio. <br /> <br /> Rock Hudson has such awards for his Texas-based film performances. Giant that Universal drivers thought, let's get it soon. him in another modern Texas neighborhood. <br /> <br /> Similarly, Robert Stack received good reviews for The High and the Mighty as the pilot under pressure to fly a damaged plane. It was natural to give him another crack. <br /> <br /> Both of these goals were achieved in Writing on the Wind. Before Hudson was the big farmer, he's now the son of a hunting companion of Robert Stack's father who took Hudson under his wing. In other words, the James Dean shares without the James Dean racism of Giant. <br /> <br /> Lauren Bacall is the executive secretary of an advertising agency using Stack's Hadley Oil Company. Hudson loves her, but she's blinded by Stack's millions and if he lives a girl, he has the means to really follow a campaign. She married Stack. <br /> <br /> Last but not least, we have Dorothy Malone's Stack's amoral sister, who has a rock for Rock, but Rock is not about to hit this wild kid . <br /> <br /> For over 10 years, Dorothy Malone spent in a lot of colorless movie heroine roles before landing this gem. She received a best supporting actress award for her as Marilee Hadley received, and it was well deserved. <br /> <br /> If you want a stunning technicolor Fifties soap opera, this is the movie for you.
