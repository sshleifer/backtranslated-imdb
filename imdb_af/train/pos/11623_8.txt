(You will know what I mean after seeing Red Eye.) <br /> Overall, Red Eye was a better-than-expected thriller. It starts a slow start, and slowly builds. But by the time it's over, it's a dump! <br /> <br /> It is difficult to define exactly what makes this thriller as ... exciting as I found it. In addition, simply put, the director has done a deserving job to get you into the action that would otherwise have been a running plot. I tended to forget I watched a movie. It says a lot. <br /> <br /> Other factors, I think, are the "closeness" of the victim and the bad guy ... and over time you really start to relate to the victim. A rare 8 out of 10, more like a 7.5 ... but that's pretty good!
