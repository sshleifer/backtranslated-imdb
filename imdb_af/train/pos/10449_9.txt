I've never heard of this movie a few weeks ago, but his concept was of interest to me when I heard it: An American man meets a European woman on his last night in Europe and spends the night together. This caused my interest, but I never expected it to be so good. Before Sunrise is a masterpiece, it is also one of the most romantic films on record. To my surprise, it completely lacked the cynicism of the 1990s. It is impossible to talk too much about it, since there is no real plot, so to speak (although there are many interesting things you can talk about, it's like My Dinner With Andre, where there is a conversation is, but it's not just the conversation that matters but just let me see it. SEE THIS!
