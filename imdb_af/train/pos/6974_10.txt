I recently looked at Caprica and thought I could also write and write a review! I only saw it after seeing the series of Battlestar Galactica finals. (I was a big fan of the show, and I liked the look of everything I could of the show universe) so I didn't know what to expect. But I came out with a smile, although I have to admit ... <br /> <br /> The story begins dramatically on the planet of caprica and we are introduced with a variety of interesting characters ... I won't much does not go away but there is a dramatic event that determines the course of the story, but I suggest you look at it. <br /> <br /> Must say ... Esai Morales is a hell of an actor he pulled from a young Joseph Adama. .. (Father of the Admiral in Battlestar Galactica) I found his scene and I could believe he was William Adama's father of BSG. <br /> <br /> Also Eric Stoltz adjusts his role exactly. ..! Special note It was good to see Polly Walker outside Rome! Don't sit down and watch Caprica expecting it to be like Battlestar Galactica, because the story line is straight and anyone can see it. Without seeing BSG! <br /> <br /> This show is a well-written drama for those who hold drama with a bit of a sci-fi kick!
