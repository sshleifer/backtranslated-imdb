Paperhouse is the most moving and striking movie I've ever seen. Often it is considered a "horror movie" as a serious mistake. Some journo once mentioned a nightmare on Elm Street, and while accepting the logic of his conclusion, I can't help but think it's a remarkable and deceptive tag. Those who can only see abomination really miss here and only serve to demonstrate that they do not think at all. <br /> <br /> In fact, just to classify this wonderful work is probably a bad idea. Paper House is simple, perfect in every detail and will always have a special place in my heart. Like someone who is wiser when I once said, "the movie is becoming quite emotional", which may be a way to explain why my comments are so inexorable. To be honest, I have no excuse for this. If you feel my words are too succulent for your taste, stop reading because there is more to come. <br /> <br /> Finding a movie at heart is so rare that the pain and sadness of childhood and the struggle to overcome the terrible feelings of isolation and loneliness we totally overwhelmed during this fragile time in our lives. Even more unusual kids actors who can actually play their roles with the sensitivity and intelligence needed to make it all work. In Charlotte Burke and Elliott Spiers we had an inspired piece of casting and the lasting impact of Paperhouse is very important for their ability to portray the melancholy and alienation of childhood (often overlooked) seamlessly and convincingly . <br /> <br /> However, both of these brilliant young stars slipped through the grip of the studios and somehow disappeared. <br /> <br /> Add to this an amazingly talented director (Bernard Rose), imaginative cinematography and the most beautiful and haunting soundtrack you'll ever hear, and you may begin to find out why I'm such a love and love for has this movie, which cannot express any words. <br /> <br />
