Wow I loved this movie! It's about normal life in a small town. About hypocrisy and honesty, love and surrender. Great! It's about things everyone meets in life. You have to do things with passion. But some people will not appreciate your passion and will try to stop you. There are people who find the opinion of others and "what will the neighbors think" more important than following their heart. Don't let anyone's opinion hinder you from fulfilling your dreams and passion. I loved the fact that the actors were all really ordinary people, it could have been my family. No big beauty, but all the people you fall in love with in the movie.
