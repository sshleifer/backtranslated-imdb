John Waters has made the most effusively lively, sad, dark, personal, small movie I've ever seen. (Perhaps Fast Food Fast Women comes in the second second). The directors' vision is unobstructed ... the narrative is whimsical, the characters are personal and strange reflections of family and his own inner life ... the tone never forced or stylistically over-arched. <br /> <br /> There is no pretentious shot design, ennui or magazine rating. Martha Plimpton is wonderful like the sister. This furlong is inspired. A grandmother with a talking Mary, tea bags, recycled clothes, yesterday's rubbish gets today's art - and the lesson of the movie is that the most important thing we can appreciate is family ... and a humble life.
