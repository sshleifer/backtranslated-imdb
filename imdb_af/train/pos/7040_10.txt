This movie was excellent for the following reasons: 1) It contains great backgrounds and sets. 2) It showed the inequality of a war-torn environment next to a technological one. 3) John Cusack's scene was great. He portrayed anxiety very well. 4) This showed the vulnerabilities of everyone in a war-torn situation. 5) This gave us a picture of what happens in many ways in the future. I was also impressed with the acting for the most part. Hilary's acting, I found, was the most stylized. The morals and values ​​of everyone in a war-torn situation are at stake. The liberal journalist and the conservative businessman are able to do anything in any situation and are equally unpredictable. Good stuff. PSP
