Definitely one of the best comedy independent movies ever. You must have a sense of humor to fully enjoy this one. This movie did not receive its credit for some reason. First, start the story line. Everyone loves a good treasure hunt. When a dead father remains behind advising a hidden treasure, it not only brings together two families, but begins a stormy adventure. Mix in a Polish translator, a comatose mother, a cracked head with tower syndrome, a twisted homosexual hypnotist, and a dragon queen. Money not only makes the world around, but can change the family into enemies. My favorite character in this movie will be the sister / cracker with turret's syndrome, her sudden outburst will cry and mimic you for weeks.
