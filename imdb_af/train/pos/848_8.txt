The turning point in "The Matador" comes about half way through the movie when Danny, an unsophisticated Denver man, sits on the balcony of his Mexico City hotel, enjoying a quiet moment. Someone knocks on his door and knows it is Julian, the paid murderer, and he refuses to answer. But did he really do? <br /> <br /> Richard Shephard, director of "The Matador", offers us a character, Julian Noble, who shows no redeeming features. In fact, we've seen him in action and doing what he does best. When Julian meets Danny at the bar of the Camino Real in Mexico City, he rinses the beans and tells his new expert what he's really doing for a life. <br /> <br /> Danny, who came to sell his program to a Mexican company, seems to compete against a local outfit ahead of the contract. Danny is a naive person who falls prey to the charisma and charm of the smarter Julian. It's not even later, on a cold winter night, that the killer appears at Danny's door, and asks his friend to pay a favor and go with him on a trip to Tucson. It is at this point that the secret they bind together is revealed in an unexpected way. <br /> <br /> Pierce Brosnan, who acts against type, makes a huge contribution to his inexorable Julian Noble. Just to see how he runs through the hotel lobby in his Speedo and boots gives the right impression on his character. Greg Kinnear, on the other hand, plays the straight part of this strange couple. Hope Davis just appears in a few scenes we leave to complain about why she no longer stays. Philip Baker Hall appears as the link between Julian and his commands. <br /> <br /> Richard Shephard leads with style that works with his own material. The musical score is by Rolfe Kent and David Tattersall's sharp cinematography enhances everything.
