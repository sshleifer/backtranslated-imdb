Simply, this movie is scary. <br /> <br /> It starts out simply like a study of a rebellious young girl and continues to become a beautifully crafted horror movie. <br /> <br /> Don't expect Gore, or Zombies. It is psychological, and just as he did in Candyman, Bernard Rose manages the horror that is not believed. <br /> <br /> Every time you watch this movie, you realize more about what is happening and how the two worlds connect in this movie. <br /> <br /> Drawings are never scarce.
