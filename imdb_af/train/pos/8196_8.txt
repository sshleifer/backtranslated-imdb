I don't know why people think it's such a bad movie. It has a good plan, some good action, and Harry's changing place doesn't hurt either. Certainly some of his offensive and free, but that's not the only movie like that. Eastwood is in good shape as Dirty Harry, and I love Pat Hingle in this movie as the village. If you liked DIRTY HARRY, you should see this one, it's much better than the DEATH. 4/5
