The third Fred MacMurray / Carole Lombard movie is a little more serious than the hands over the table and the princess comes over. This is another adaptation of the game Burlesque which was apparently popular in the day. <br /> <br /> In the 1927-1928 season, the original play Burlesque ran at 372 shows, which is the role of Carole Lombard. Barbara Stanwyck originated on Broadway which brought her to Hollywood. An edition played Nancy Carroll in the early days of talkies, and later Betty Grable and Dan Dailey have another version of it in When My Baby smile for me. <br /> <br /> In fact, I have a vinyl album of a radio version that Al Jolson and Ruby Keeler did for the Lux Radio Theater. It's an interesting job, believe me. <br /> <br /> Anyway, MacMurray and Lombard are doing well through the old chestnut. The story is now in a nightclub where Lombard is a singer and MacMurray is a jazz trumpeter. Note a good performance by Dorothy Lamour as the Latin vixen that gets between Fred and Carole. Anthony Quinn is also one of his earliest films as a wolf making for Lombard. <br /> <br /> Swing High, Swing Low is really nice today and I won't be surprised if we see another version of Burlesque for the 21st century.
