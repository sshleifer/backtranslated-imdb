This stylistic sophisticated visual game offers a story in a story '. The protagonist is scriptwriter Bart Klever who is constantly fighting his new text? which is at the same time the screenplay of the movie we are watching. In the film, Bart plays a scriptwriter who writes the screenplay of the film? Bart's battle with the text becomes a narrative theme, just like the neighborhood of the apartment where he works and takes care of his little girl. The intimate setting offers ample opportunity for illusionary games that include space, light, colors and a few cats. The outwardly simple world of the room is further complicated by the unstable dimensions of a text which is continually influenced by the film maker's interventions appearing on a computer monitor and serving as a counterpoint for the corresponding variable environment. The constantly changing viewing angle complicates answers to questions that arise: What is 'truth' and what? Illusion '? Which of the observed worlds is primary and superior to the rest? Can anything serve as a basic orientation point in narrative space?
