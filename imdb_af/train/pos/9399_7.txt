This is a movie I saw when it came out for the first time, and I have seen it several times over the past few years. It is always pleasant. <br /> <br /> One thing is that the comedy does not work side by side: it divides labor and capitalists equally. Just Sid looks beyond the classical struggle, even if he is responsible. <br /> <br /> Spoiler Warning: read no further if you haven't seen the movie <br /> <br /> It's a fantasy, but is reasonably likely to be presented. Ask yourself: can anyone support most of his or her weight in a single fabric style? This will cut almost any support. <br /> <br /> Also, when in an incline, Sid uses a garbage cover like a knight shield. Fun symbolism. <br /> <br /> One day I get it on DVD.
