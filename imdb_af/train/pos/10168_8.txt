Look, it's Eva Longoria and Paul Rudd in a movie about a dead girlfriend ghosting the new girlfriend. It is Gabrielle of Desperate Housewives and the man who wore "Sex Panther cologne" in Anchorman. If you're expecting a Golden Globe nominated movie, consider re-viewing movies. But if you're willing to suspend reality for 90 minutes and want to see a funny movie, you're in the right place. The characters are all funny. They work very well together. The right match is Paul Rudd and Lake Bell. He was as funny as he was at Friends and she was funny and nice at the same time. I went with my wife, she enjoyed it and so did I.
