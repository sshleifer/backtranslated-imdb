In my case I enjoyed this movie because when I saw it, I found more than I expected. I mean, this is one of the few animated movies that made me think about his themes even long after I was done. It speaks of death, revenge and hell in such a way that it comes to you like a punch in your face, even to suffer the dream sequence in the center of the film. It makes this movie so good: the ability, unique in Don Bluth (director), to play with people's feelings and to love or hate them in an instant. It and the fact that it has so many good characters like Charlie and Ann-Marie, that in the sad but happy end you must say, "I have something in my eye" to hide the others you called out. All I said is just some of the good points of this movie. As for the rest, you should see it very honestly for yourself in a movie. Don Bluth, thank you.
