According to the book The Last of the Cowboy Heroes, which deals with Joel McCrea, Audie Murphy and Randolph Scott, the author said Albuquerque was the only film he had not personally reviewed because he claimed it was lost. Not seen in years. <br /> <br /> Good thing for Western fans, someone has done some spring cleaning at Paramount because a print was apparently found and now it's on the open market. Albuquerque is also a very good western with Scott involved in a family error with Uncle George Cleveland. <br /> <br /> George Cleveland sends his cousin Randolph Scott to make him part of his freight business, headquartered in the rapidly growing Albuquerque settlement. Cleveland is more than just a business owner, he is the city boss he runs from a wheelchair. He even has the sheriff in his pocket. <br /> <br /> Randolph Scott is not a cowboy hero for anything. This does not include supporting family members when they are villains. He is going to work for a rival outfit led by brother and sister Russell Hayden and Catherine Craig. <br /> <br /> Cleveland is full of all sorts of tricks and even sends a western Mata Hari in the person of Barbara Britton to worm her away in the confidence of his competitors. Barbara is wonderful as the homespun vixen who develops her own agenda. <br /> <br /> Randolph Scott's original studio was Paramount, which was where his first studio contract was. Albuquerque marked the last film he ever made for Paramount and gave him a good one. <br /> <br /> Also note Lon Chaney, Jr., who is George Cleveland's chief handler, a pretty man's anger and Gabby Hayes, just Gabby Hayes. <br /> <br /> In 1948, Albuquerque was loved by Republicans with its headquarters as a city boss who ruled a wheelchair. A certain wheelchair Democrat had four straight presidential elections for them and he was gone. They also had the hope of winning the White House this year, but things went wrong and they had to settle for a replacement boss who got his arrival in Albuquerque. I'm not sure why Cleveland was in a wheelchair because nothing was really made in the plot. My guess is that he was injured and played the part because he had to. <br /> <br /> Another Albuquerque had had great appeal to the IDP market.
