It's just a wonderful, nice, beautiful movie. It captures the true essence of the decade and of the people and tells a beautiful love story of two sisters with two sailors. Although this film can only be in black and white, it is certainly not present in modern times. The main purpose of the movie is timeless. This movie features great plays, beautiful songs and dance numbers, and great design work and movie shoots. Follow the fleet is also comic, there are funny moments, moments that make you laugh, but other moments where the play just gets you so involved in the storyline. His wonderful how this movie might be introduced in a certain decade, how it can affect those today. If you want to see something good, look it out.
