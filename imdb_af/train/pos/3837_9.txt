Back in the forties, when movies touched on issues that had not yet become receptive to the "polite" society, they made use of codes that presumably blew the heads of most of the audience while they were in the knowledge. was just warned. Probably, no movie of the decade was such a lorry with innuendo as the strange dark desert rage, which was in a small gambling oasis called Chuckawalla somewhere in the California desert. The owner of the Purple Sage salon and casino is the astonishing Mary Astor, in a slacks and a cigarette holder; In town, her little-by-daughter, Lizabeth Scott, drives in Technicolor, like $ 20 million. But listen to the dialogue between them, which indicates an older lesbian and her young, restless companion (one can only wonder if A.I. Bezzerides's original writing made this connection explicitly). Even more blatant is John Hodiak as a gunman and Wendell Corey as his madman jealous torpedo. Add Burt Lancaster as the town keeper, stir, and sit back. Both Lancaster and (surprisingly) Hodiak fall for Scott. However, it seems that Hodiak has not only Astor but also had a woman who died under suspicious circumstances. The desert sun heats these ingredients to a hard boil, with face wash and abundant exchanges. Don't pass this hothouse melodrama, beat full of exotic flowers, if it comes your way; It's a remarkable movie.
