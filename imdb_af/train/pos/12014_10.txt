This is by far the most amazing movie I've seen long ago. The actors gave wonderful portrayals of the characters in the movie. The story is depicted accurately. The story begins with a young woman from the British Isles and her father who is steamboat traveling to Nauvoo, Illinois. She became a member of the LDS Church and did not. He thinks she's ridiculous to make the trip and is discouraging. She encourages him to read about Joseph Smith, the Prophet. This is where the story of the Prophet Joseph Smith begins. The film accurately portrays his life and some of the history of the LDS Church. It was sometimes graphical, but needed. The emotional expression was very credible, causing my emotions to emerge. Filming was wonderful. The way the story was presented was touching. After the movie was over, we just sat there not to move. I was amazed. For people who know very little about Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet, I will encourage you to see it. As nothing but understanding understanding of his life. For those who are members of the Church, I will encourage you to see it. This will increase your testimony to this most incredible man. This is a must see.
