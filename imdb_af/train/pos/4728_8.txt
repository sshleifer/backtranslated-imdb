Having seen some break in Vancouver at the release party, I thought it was a very enjoyable movie. <br /> <br /> I had a few naked stomach patches and some of the cameos (especially Eric Roberts) were screaming. I haven't heard a word about the actual release, even though I've heard it. <br /> <br /> The story is simple but is mainly a vehicle for the characters and situations. The writing is smooth and seamless, the plot develops effortlessly and the acting is comfortable, but fresh. This movie has won at least one award from EVERY movie festival that it has worked, which is about 10-15. <br /> <br /> I recommend breaking a leg.
