"Lion King 1 1/2" is the funniest non-theatrical release from Disney. I recently saw this movie again after not seeing it in many years. I remember the first time I saw it, and I didn't have any expectations and was pleasantly surprised by this viewable and highly entertaining movie. <br /> <br /> Is it better than Simba's pride? In many ways, yes. Although "Simba's Pride" was not really bad, it had some problems: lack of a good screenplay and bad characterization, which made the impact of what was otherwise a good movie. <br /> <br /> Anyway: it's nice to see Timon and Pumbaa's personalities bloom again the way we (or certainly I) loved them in this movie; In "Simba's Pride" they were completely annoying and I also didn't have the "Timon and Pumbaa" series. <br /> <br /> This movie can easily be stupid, but fortunately the filmmakers have not listened. the wrong turn and instead focused on making this movie extremely hilarious at times. There are some jokes that adults can enjoy on their own. The score is pretty good. There are two new songs, which are catchy and two new characters, Timon's mom (pronounced by recognizable Marge Simpsons' Julie Kavner) and Uncle Max, which are enjoyable. The friendship between Timon and Pumbaa is remarkably portrayed. The emotional scenes are well integrated into the comic story and do not feel out of place, which could easily do (especially in comedies). <br /> <br /> But is there anything that distracts this picture from 10 votes from me? Yes there is. Although fortunately they do not affect too much, I will call it: 1. Many of the scenes of the first film are used in this one. Personally, it was strange that the old scenes were integrated with the new ones. <br /> <br /> 2. During the climax, some of the jokes are paralyzed. <br /> <br /> 3. Storywise, this is Timon's story and although the filmmakers are trying to integrate his story with Simba's, it sometimes makes the play a bit chaotic. <br /> <br /> But this information doesn't touch this otherwise entertaining movie. . This is the only really acceptable Disney sequel to be in every movie collection.
