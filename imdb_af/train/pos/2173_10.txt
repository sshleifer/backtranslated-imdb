It is often only after years that we can look back and see the stars that are really stars. As the French film critic, whose name escaped me, said: "There is no Garbo. There is no Dietrich. There is only Louise Brooks"; and thank God! Louise Brooks! This is the third of her European masterpieces. But it is also an exceptional film as one, if not the first French talkie, for writing a script written by the renowned Ren√© Clair, as it was apparently completed by Georg Pabst (the direction) and the voice of Edith Piaf before she was known! So much talent working on and in a movie, how can it not be a masterpiece? And that's what this movie is. It's a pity Louise Brooks was blamed by Hollywood when she returned to the States - so much talent has thrown away so far! In the film, except to see Louise Brooks in action, it's great to see pictures of Paris. 1930 and to hear Piaf's young voice. I never get tired of this movie!
