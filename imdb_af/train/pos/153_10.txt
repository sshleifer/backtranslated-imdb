This film is just a movie masterpiece. The film is brilliantly moved by intense images that move the sensitive viewer deep. The film opens during the Spanish Civil War, as a group of children seek their revenge on another child. In fact, they play in their world a version of what they saw in the adult world around them. Later we meet three of these children as adults at a sanatorium. Here we see what life did on each of them. One is a sexually repressed patient. Another man is a hustler who has become ill. The third child, a young lady, became a nun and served at the sanatorium. This film is an allegory about the effect of violence on the psyche. <br /> <br /> This movie has a climax that is definitely not for the capable audience of the viewer audience, but it is logical and deeply moving. The acting is excellent and the writing is fairly well written. There is a musical score that provides an undercurrent of fear in this movie. It's not a movie for exciting seekers, but a movie for a thoughtful audience.
