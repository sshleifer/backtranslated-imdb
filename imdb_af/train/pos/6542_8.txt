Although it was well past the target audience, I have always had a soft spot for YA fiction, so of course I was intrigued by the return of Nancy Drew to the screen. <br /> <br /> It's not a bad movie. The central riddle involving a long dead actress is presented in simple simplistic terms, with obstacles that endanger the youth. Nancy and her friends never take the threats seriously, so young audience members will not be upset. <br /> <br /> What I greatly appreciated from the story was the final results were pretty serious and meaningful and Nancy was understanding and growing. from that experience. <br /> <br /> Emma Roberts is wonderful like Nancy Drew and hopefully we see her again in another mystery.
