I took my ten-year-old daughter to see Nancy Drew this weekend and entertained me thoroughly. First, it was clean, and I mean by my standards. Most children's movies today are full of toilets and horrifying jokes to lure inexpensive laughter from the teenage crowd. Nancy Drew is smarter than that, and the humor is subtle and clever. <br /> <br /> The title role is played with a refreshing vivaciousness by Emma Roberts, who is beautiful and polite without ever being annoying. Unlike the Brady Bunch movie, where the anachronistic characters are shot and mocked, Nancy's style is treated with respect and dignity. It's a great moment when the LA-style conscious girls are dismissed with their Paris Hilton street walker's clothing by the boutique owner, while Nancy, in her penny rolls and homemade Butterick pattern skirt, is embroidered. This movie gives us our need-to-relieve-this-healthy girl, thanks for so many Hollywood movies. Nancy continues to marry herself and her values ​​throughout. <br /> <br /> The mystery is just enough time to be endearing. There were several exciting moments where my daughter was nervously grabbing my arm, but there were no free shocks. It's all based on tension and mood and is great fun. The supporting role is good, especially Marshall Bell as the creepy caretaker. There are a few great cameos by Eddie Jemison, Chris Kattan and Bruce Willis and many moments that will make adults smile. <br /> <br /> This movie deserves better ratings than some did. Not only was I happy to be dragged into another computer animated movie, where the animals talk and spread gas over the place, but I was also very entertained. If I were there without a child, I would still have enjoyed the movie. This is a DVD that will have my daughter's name under the Christmas tree.
