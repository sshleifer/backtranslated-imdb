It's a beautiful movie about the quest for some happiness in everyday life. The pacing, the camera work, the emotion, the ghost music and the pure charm of this photo make it a must see. It is not easily appreciated by the immature or emotional stunt. The only mistake I can see from this movie is that it is not captured in a more technically perfect movie format. It earns Todd-AO, Technicolor and the very best audio format available. (An intimate movie can be made in seventy millimeters.) The beautiful Italian villa effect on its residents would have made even more lushly and the small, enjoyable moments would be even more beautifully seen and heard. As it is, it still requires attention as a sweet moving little movie. I can't stop myself watching it every time it comes on satellite. The transformation of the characters of contained, tight and distrust is always a joy to watch and I have to recommend it more often. <br /> <br /> The casting is perfect, the mood is perfect, the acting is beyond reproach. It's a movie about the middle age and the choices people make. It is deep and thoughtful without hitting the viewer with heavy skill. Look it in one seat and let it have your effect. If you don't get it, you may not have lived enough or something else is wrong with you.
