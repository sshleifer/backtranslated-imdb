This is essentially a variation on House Of Wax, in both the plot and the role of the movie of both movies, Vincent Price. In both pictures, he plays a talented artist who is sent over the edge in madness when his creations are being nominated by other less talented and less meticulous people. In this movie, he is a designer of illusions for stage artists who aim to express themselves on an acting career, but to be frustrated when another illusionist insists the Great Rinaldo (John Emery) claims to honor his contract and give him the first choice of any illusions he designs. Prize is already bad about Rinaldi as his former wife is now a paramour of Rinaldi. He deploys his talents as an illusionist and as a brilliant imitation to avenge himself on Rinaldi and others who address his plans for recognition as an artist and designer. <br /> <br /> Price is pretty much the whole show here and gives a well-rated star turn as a wrong man whose trouble obeys obedient sympathy. The rest of the role is skillful as colorless and the weight of the whole business falls on Price which easily eases the burden. <br /> <br /> Well solid B Movie melodrama, it's a crime movie rather than a horror image and is nice, provided you don't expect a masterpiece. Black and white shot is low on the game and is best seen as melodrama and enjoys the presence of his star giving an idiosyncratic performance
