I am quite surprised that no reviewer has so far commented on the rather elementary chess shooter in Luzhin's play as white against an unnamed opponent immediately before the final. Despite using Jonathan Speelman as a consultant chess expert, Luzhin is shown to win the game with an illegal move. Between the quick cuts and back to the board it is not difficult to see that Luzhin's combination that culminates in a queen sacrifice smokes his smoke on d1 through the black smoke against c1 against his king in the corner of the h1 nailed. So he can't play the alleged parking movement Rd1-d8, which would be illegal - but he showed it to be so reckless with the reckless applause of the audience.
