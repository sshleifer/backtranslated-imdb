Let me start by saying that I have never reviewed a movie on IMDb; However, I am in the video myself. And come out of that acting; I can say without a doubt that this movie is a short one. It has a very good story and another thing I love - (an even better turn ends). The opening was done very well, I chose the video that was chosen for it and how it was edited. <br /> <br /> I'm not a fan of B&W, but the way this movie uses the effect it works. And with any movie it's all that matters. The flow of the movie works perfectly and editing was done very well. From a technical side of things (which I usually work on) everything is also done very well. There is no great technology. things to point out. Only small one I have is that the end credits are a little bouncy. This is probably due to a delivery issue. Let me also say that I chose to see more of the love scene, but I'm an old one (so you can make it a grandfather). <br /> <br /> Overall I set it a 9/10. It's worth the watch if you are a fan of India and / or short films. <br /> <br /> ps. sorry for bad grammar or spelling.
