My favorite Austen novel, and Paltrow is by no means my favorite actress, but I found the movie almost totally enjoyable. Paltrow does a good job, and Cummings, Stevenson and the one who 'Miss Bates' play are absolutely great. The detail period is not alienated; the feeling of the movie is just right. But the real 'find' is Jeremy Northam as Mr Knightley. There can no longer be perfect casting, IMO. I hate Mr. K in the novel, but found him wonderfully human and human in the film. Northam's good looks and smiling eyes are also no hindrance to enjoyment! Highly recommended. Anar
