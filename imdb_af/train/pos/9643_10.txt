This movie has it all. Emotion, power, love, Stephane Rideau's worshiping naked beach dance ... It exposes the need for true inner communion and outward communication in any relationship. Just because Cedric and Mathieu are a couple who are gay, it doesn't mean there is not much useful insight for anyone in it. I would probably classify it as a gay movie, but one that can be appreciated and loved by heterosexuals as well as gay and bisexual people. Mathieu's inability to handle his emotions explains the way in which our society does not encourage us to act any other, and this causes the disagreement between him and Cedric. It's definitely a must-see!
