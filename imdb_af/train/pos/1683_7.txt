I watched this movie because it was the second feature on a disc containing the previously banned Video Nasty 'Blood Rites'. Since Blood Riders were quite awful, I didn't expect much from this movie; but actually it seems that refuse director Andy Milligan has dethroned himself this time, as Seeds or Sin tops Blood Rites in style and stand tall as a more than adequate piece of sick sixties sexual birth. The plot is actually much like Blood Rites, as we focus on a dysfunctional family unit, and of course; There is a legacy at stake. The film was shot in black and white, and its appearance reminded me of the classic 'The Curious Dr Humpp'. There is hardly any gore on the screen, and the director looks cleaner to focus on sex, with themes of incest and hatred penetrating. The acting is typically trashy, but most of the women are getting naked at one time or another and despite a poor reputation, director Andy Milligan actually looks for this kind of thing, as many of the rows in this movie actually reasonable. pretty. The plot is paper thin, and most of the film is stuffing; But the music is striking, and the director also does a surprisingly good job with the sex scene itself, as most are somewhat erotic. Overall, it's not a good movie; but it will probably appeal to the cult lover, and get a much higher recommendation than the better known and lower quality 'Blood Rites'.
