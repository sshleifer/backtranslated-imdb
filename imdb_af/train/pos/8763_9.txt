This movie is cold, bare truth. Often we think "oh no, it won't happen to me." But it can. Drug smuggling is big money and often people are unknowingly (or deceived) to do things for smugglers. The story of these two girls is the story of many young people who love them, just wanted an exotic holiday - that changed into a nightmare. People need to know that these kinds of events are not unlikely or exaggerated - this is a major problem in today's society. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to aging parents because of the understanding it needs to truly appreciate it. Movie. It is very emotional and raw. Worth to watch and definitely stay in your memory.
