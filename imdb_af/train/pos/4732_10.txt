I'm not a big fan of Martial Arts movies, but the video store was almost empty and Jet Li was in Lethal Weapon 4 and I got it for free when the other movies I rented or rented it. I absolutely loved it, my flatmate and myself (22 year old Biochemistry and Accounting students) spent half an hour after the film spending the strange Kung Fu sounds and putting beer shurikens on each other. I can't explain it (maybe a little tequila). I never enjoyed Bruce Lee, skinny blocks kick big kick, beat him, kick bigger blocks etc. movie ends. Think Jackie Chan with a little less comedy and more action.
