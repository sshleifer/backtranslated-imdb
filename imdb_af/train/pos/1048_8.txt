For Muslim women in West Africa, married life in the hands of abusive men can be very difficult. The community should not explicitly endorse such behavior, but they may not be ready to regard it as a criminal, an attitude that makes it possible, of course, to continue. Fortunately, the letter of the Cameroonian law promises equality to all, and this documentary follows the real life exploitation of several female practitioners in the Cameroonian legal system as they seek to ensure justice for a number of women and children. What is noteworthy (apart from the uplifting central story) is how the courts, despite their informality, are actually pragmatic progressive, if a matter is actually bought. The program also gives a fascinating insight into the entire Cameroonian lifestyle, which (apart from the terrible crimes committed in the well-known cases) looks incredibly emotional and joyful compared to the inhabitants of Europe or North America. And while I admit that this comment can betray me from my side, it seems that this attitude is trapped in the pidgin English they speak. Overall, it's a great little movie, and much more fun to watch than you can imagine.
