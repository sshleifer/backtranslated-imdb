I previously thought this movie was the lamb of the Muppet movies. I would like to withdraw this statement. In my opinion now, the funniest MUppet movie was the TV movie. It's a very common Christmas Christmas. It is a wonderful life that is frightening which was really terrible. MUPPETS TAKES MANHATTAN is nothing special, but miles better than MERRY MUPPET Christmas. <br /> <br /> The best songs are the song "You Can Not Take An Answer", the one that sings the Muppet Babies and the songs for the great final itself. As I loved the Muppet Babies TV show, I loved the Muppet Babies series here. (I said it inspired the Muppet Babies show) <br /> <br /> The MANHATTAN MELODIES show was the real show stopper. Sesame Street's Muppets appear even for the wedding. As Kermit puts it in his final line, "What better way can anything end?". But I wish that what was between the beginning and the end was a little more entertaining. There are cute comos from Brooke Shields and Gregory Hines and a great dance series by Rizzo and the Rats (Choreographed by Late, great Jim Henson himself) and the movie remembers. I have to say that MOPPET MOVIE, GREAT MUPPET CAPER and MUPPET Christmas CAROL are the three definite MUppet movies.
