Although this film is quite old, no matter how many times I see it, it still makes me laugh. <br /> <br /> One particular quote in the movie comes out. <br /> <br /> If Danny (Joe Piscopo) goes to da's office and parks in a disabled place, Danny's partner says <br /> <br /> "can't park here, it's for the disabled ". <br /> <br /> Danny replies, "I'm disabled, I'm psychotic." <br /> <br /> It's one of the many lines in the movie no matter how many times you look, it's "I'll let you go. <br /> <br /> Johnny Dangerous stands in my top 5 comedy / show movies of all time. <br /> <br /> As an added bonus, it also includes legendary actor Peter Boyle in the throw. So look at this movie and love myself and many others who watched it, you will be addicted.
