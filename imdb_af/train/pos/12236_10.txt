I saw this movie in 1959 when I was 11 at a boarding theater with my family. <br /> <br /> Going back then I thought it was very funny. . . although I was too young to understand 90% of what made this wonderful movie such a joy! I saw it this morning on "Turner South". As I watched it, I was absolutely messed with laughter! "The Mating Game" is a unique classic of passing age. If you are too young to experience the enchanting period in the history of this film, I feel sorry for you. There is no way you can watch such movies and understand how (even today) they can give such a glorious cut to "old timers" like me. <br /> <br /> Having said that, all I can do is Respect Respect that younger people refrain from commenting on movies like "The Mating Game". <br /> <br /> Movies like this are made for the generation that preceded the current group of your people. And as such, these movies speak a lot of different language than you can understand. <br /> <br /> In other words ?? If you do not understand the issues addressed by the movie, do not scan yourself by commenting on what? honest ?? Don't make sense.
