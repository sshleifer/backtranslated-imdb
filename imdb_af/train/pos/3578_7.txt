12-year-old Arnald Hillerman accidentally kills his older brother Eugene. His feelings are arrested by the fact that his family cannot communicate with him (or feel it is not the right thing to do). His only refuge is his grandfather, who is the only one who has compassion on him. Realism will captivate "true-2-life" movie lovers, but will not satisfy those who desire action and excitement.
