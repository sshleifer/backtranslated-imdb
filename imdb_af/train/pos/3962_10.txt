Wonderful James Stewart, Vera Miles vehicle. What is so good about this historic FBI movie is the family element involved in a 35-year career as portrayed by Stewart in the film. <br /> <br /> The film shows a history of the great investigative agency. It deals with aircraft bomb plots, which break down from Indian people in Oklahoma for property gains, combat organized crime, Nazis and Communists in that order. The human element is never far behind, as Stewart Vera Miles owns. They raise 3 children as Miles's heart goes out every time Stewart goes out on the mission. <br /> <br /> Search for a short but memorable performance by Murray Hamilton. Years later he appeared as Mr. Robinson in 1967's "The Graduate." <br /> <br /> The film has nothing but praise for J. Edgar Hoover. He definitely brought the FBI so far. <br /> <br /> This can probably be seen as right-wing propaganda, especially with Stewart's real Republican views, but that's well done, historically insightful, and the family's view is so well portrayed.
