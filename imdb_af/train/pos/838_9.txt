*** 1/2 Pierce Brosnan, Greg Kinnear, Hope Davis, Adam Scott, Philip Baker Hall. Directed by Richard Shepard. <br /> <br /> A well-formulated story and movie all together, Brosnan has never been better in a movie role outside his Bond movies. After 2004's "After Sunset" brings its latest role to laughter and a good time. Famous hitman, Julian Noble, at a work in Mexico City, is excited to meet the exact opposite of him. A high-profile businessman, Danny Wright (Kinnear, possibly also one of his best roles), is also there. The two on the screen duo produce a comically charged, laughing riot and fail to deliver the laugh. Davis in one of her best roles since "American Splendor" gives another beautiful and witty performance. One of the most enjoyable and best movies ever. My final review 9/10
