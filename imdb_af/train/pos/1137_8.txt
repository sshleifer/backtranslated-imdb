It's very funny. You know, just like a comedy is supposed to be. It also looks very good, like a Hollywood spectacular must. So what else do you want? Howz about a lot of very good Sally Fields. She's so much better here than in anything else I've ever seen her, and she looks so damn good. This movie is all you need to understand why she is a star. That eyes! Like a quiet movie star, but better. In fact, everyone's eyes are so good. I pretended to be a bad TV soap actor with my girlfriend. We want to do that thing where you really look from one eye to another quickly from one eye to the next. They do not do it in soap dish at all. Great. The eyes have it! (Pity) <br /> <br /> There are so many great performances, it's just fun to wait for each one to appear again. There is a whole workshop going on with Kevin Kline on how to persuade, very subtle. Have this? Yeah, he's good. So is Robert Downey, Jr., who has since made a career in playing the Slick, Slimy Executive. Cathy Moriarity, while not the most gifted actress, is so charismatic and sound, especially when she is angry. And even Whoopi Goldberg is decent, her natural timing gives here a little flat delivery a little Zing. OK, no, Whoopi Bashing, I hear you. <br /> <br /> And then there's the Hair. Soap dish is made at the end of the BIG 80's, so the ridiculous box is like a big character in itself. They grow bigger and more so, just as you did. Yes, we have pictures. <br /> <br /> Soap dish is better than I thought it would be, better that I wanted it. I'm sick of movies that tell me I need to care for level, self-centered, semi-talented egoans, ie. TV Soap Actors. Soap Dish just seems to make me laugh. Thank you.
