50 years old, this musical comedy fantasy can look its age, but it carries it with dignity. <br /> <br /> This movie is still very nice. Crosby was never really romantic, but he delivers the material with the light humorous edge he needs. Bendix plays wide and is great fun in a part that invokes his strengths. Hardwicke - how joyful for a knight of the kingdom - a real one - to solve himself in such kinds of things. And Rhonda Fleming enjoys herself in the least imaginative of the lead roles. Only Murvyn Vye disappointed as an unconvincing Merlin. <br /> <br /> Although not a musical, the songs are very good and the "dance" routine accompanying Busy Doing Nothing is perfect - funny, fitting, agile without challenge, and virtuous from Crosby's musical movement, which makes us fair, was inherently amusing because he was never his greatest strength. <br /> <br /> The color is good, the sound is a bit muddy in places. br /> And the story - well, it takes some freedoms with the original, but I suspect Mr. Clemens was happy with the result.
