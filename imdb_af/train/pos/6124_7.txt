This movie is goofy like hell! I think it was written as a serious movie, but when it came time to film, Michael Cooney said, "Hey, let's throw in some humor and kick it up!" The characters are actually slightly developed. Oh, and the death row is the best. One thing I hate, however, was the hair dryer arms. What is it about?
