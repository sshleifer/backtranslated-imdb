When the Grinch came out, I was excited, although I thought it would be a lucky lucky movie and it was. Although it had a little nightmare before Christmas it touched. You know a kind of dark and haunting. I loved this movie because it helped people at Christmas. So largely Grinch saved Christmas. And then what happened in Whoville, they say the Grinch's little heart grew three sizes that day. MERRY GRINCHMAS!
