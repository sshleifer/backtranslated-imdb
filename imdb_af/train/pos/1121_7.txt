Here is a real wonder for you. It starts with another takeoff on the PSYCHO landfill, on campus, and then becomes more crazy than several cows and their dead boyfriends go south to Spring Break. The trouble begins when they drive into Redneck County, which is delegated by the murderous dean. One of the college cuties walks in the bush, witnessing a sheriff's murder and blew her head open. Then it lets the MACON COUNTY LINE time like the Dean Stalk fall and beat the Whiteless witnesses one by one. Tony March is on target as the evil, shotgun-happy Dean. The film's overall tone is really disturbing. The end is so sudden you almost think the director ran out of film; it is also a study of despair. SMALL GRAVES is a must for misleaders, misogynists and nihilists around the world.
