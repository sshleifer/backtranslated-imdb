As most of you can see the Star Wars, you can return. The Jedi may be a good movie, but as you may have seen on video, they may have a party. They probably end up with the party with no spirit or something But on the original (Live TV) When they are party But before I say more than Ben obi-wan dies in the Imperial Ship or Death Star, they have him vanishes and Yoda dies of Old age or internal illness But since Luke Darth Vader (Real Name: Anakin Skywalker) killed when they all participated in the end when Lukas or someone puts the spirits of Ben and Yoda stands in hand while another spirit appears, she is Darth Vader, but not as an A Sith like the old ordinary self of him and starts to smile with ben and yoda I think it has ended the movie a bit interesting but the producers or someone should down a spirit of padme and mace breeze and other jedis killed by younglings under There arms in the background
