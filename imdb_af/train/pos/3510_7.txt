True fans of the movie will love this authentic movie. <br /> <br /> I disagree with the trolleys that rate this movie a one-star and call it unrealistic. While not having the background or coming from the area of ​​the protagonists, I have been working in lower income and labor deprivation for years and feel the play was very genuine and representative of how teenagers act. I don't know what the basis for others commenting is that the movie is unrealistic. The dialogue is wonderful. <br /> <br /> The low budget production value didn't bother me a bit. I felt that the natural lighting improved the character of the film. The focus was entirely on story line and character development and not shiny Hollywood propping or melodrama. <br /> <br /> I bought completely in the character's motivation and responses. The acting was credible and impressive for new and non-actors. <br /> <br /> If your idea of ​​good movie is Transformers or Fast & Furious, skip it. If you enjoy good character-driven dramas, see it. <br /> <br /> (For the negative commentators, "trolls": click on their names and you'll see that most have no other reviews or negative reviews.)
