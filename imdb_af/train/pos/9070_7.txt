It started slowly after an excellent animated intro, as the director had a lot of characters and school settings to develop. As soon as the bet is underway, the movie picks up the pace as it is a race against time to see if a certain number of worms can be eaten by 7 pm. We had a great opportunity to go home to discuss things with our son: bulls, others, thoughts about things when you don't want to do anything. <br /> <br /> Of special note is the girl Erica (Erk) played: Hallie Kate Eisenberg. The director kinda sneaks her unexpectedly, and when she is on the screen, she is fascinating. She is one of the "Hey, she looks familiar" faces, and then I remember being the little girl Pepsi knew about 8 years ago. She was also in "Paulie", that movie about the parrot trying to find his home. <br /> <br /> Me. Eisenberg made many TV and movie appearances in '99 -00, but then the next few years did not see much. She is now 14 and grows up to be a beautiful woman. Her smile warmed on the screen. If she could get even more good roles, she might as well have a career (or better?) Than Haley Joel Osment, another three called child actress, but hopefully without the problems Osment had lately. <br /> Anywhozitz, according to my 8 yo son, who just read the story, didn't make the movie so good, but it was quite entertaining. The end of the movie looks like a great set-up for some persecutors (How to eat cooked snails? Escargot Kid's Style?), Which may not be such a bad thing. It was nice to take the family to a movie and don't worry about language, violence or sex scenes. <br /> <br /> Another good aspect of the movie was the respect / fear of the principal, Mr. Burdock (Boiler). Movies nowadays tend to show adult authority figures as buffalo. While having one particular goofy scene, he rules the school with a firm hand. It was also nice to see Andrea Martin getting a job.
