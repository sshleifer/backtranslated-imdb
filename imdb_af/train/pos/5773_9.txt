Since I am so interested in lake monsters, I really dug this movie. This movie is worth seeing. If you like the terrible, it's good movies, watch it out. The effects are also really good, just think "Land of the Lost". I originally watched this movie in the early 90's, maybe more than 89/90 on a local channel sample called "Morgus Presents". I didn't scare myself, but I was 8 and anything B felt more like an A. Years later I saw it on DVD at a local Circuit City and bought it immediately, so I can give it 9 because it has a personal place in me. heart right there with The Monster Squad and Gremlins. Good B movie fun for all ages.
