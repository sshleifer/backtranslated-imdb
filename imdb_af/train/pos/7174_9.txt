I drove from Sacramento to San Francisco (and back) to see this movie prize - and I really stay. As a big movie lover and a lifelong Northern California, I was amazed at how many Oscar-winning films were made in the Bay Area. As a fashion designer who really wants to stay in the Bay Area, instead of LA, George Lucas's comment on perseverance, community and vision really reacted to me. <br /> <br /> Hey, if he and all the other filmmakers can make it in SF, other artists too. <br /> <br /> Would recommend this movie
