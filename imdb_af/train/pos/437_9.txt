Delighted April is a tone of poem, an impressionist painting, a masterpiece of a few words. It was one of my 10 favorite movies since it came out. I kept waiting, though less patient, for the movie to come out in DVD format. Apparently I'm not alone. <br /> <br /> If parent company Amazon's listings are correct, there are many people who want this title in DVD format. Many people want to go to Italy with this role and this writing. Many people want to keep a permanent copy of this movie in their libraries. The film is spectacular, cinematography and direction impeccable. The movie is a definite keeper. Many have already asked. Please add our names to the list.
