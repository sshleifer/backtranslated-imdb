Home Room was a great movie if you ever had drama in your life. It keeps you from seeing more. Wondering what the secret Alicia is hiding. I think I watched the movie 6 times in a row and never lost interest. Plus I usually don't cry about movies, but this one made me cry every time. I wish I could find more movies like this. All in all, I thought it was a good movie. The more you look, the more you share it. The end is the part that really got me when she cried when she got her diploma because it had her daughter's name on it. My heart felt like it had just broken. And how did her new friend comfort her when she hadn't found her yet. I loved it so much.
