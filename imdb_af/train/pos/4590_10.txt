Perhaps the movie itself is not one of the best Jackie Chan movies, but I think everyone will agree that the mall battle is one of the best fighting tones ever made. There were also some memorable stunts, which were so impressive that they made this movie an action classic. This movie has influenced many other action movies and I think active filmmakers nowadays need to learn from this movie (as they could regain the background, I can make it even better with modern technology). There were also some funny scenes that made this movie enjoyable, even when Jackie didn't fight. Although I think they can place more scenes in this movie.
