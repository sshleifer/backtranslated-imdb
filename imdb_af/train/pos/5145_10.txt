<br /> <br /> An old man works as a lawyer in a mental hospital to be near his wife who is a patient there and to try her out. <br /> <br /> This is surely one of the most forgotten masterpieces of the silent era and a stranger in the history of Japanese theater. Long thought lost, a print was found in the 70's and a music soundtrack added that perfectly matches the images. This can be influenced by Dr. Caligary's cabinet (director Kinugasa claims he has never seen the German film). But it surpasses it in style and in its more convincing (and cold) portrayal of the inner state of mind of the prisoners in the asylum. To achieve this, the film uses every available movie technique available at the time: multiple exposure and subjective perspective out of focus, angular angles, fast and slow motion, expressionist relief and superposition. It's also a very complicated movie to follow, as it doesn't have subtitles. <br /> <br /> The film opens with a montage of rain hitting the windows of the hospital, windy trees and thunder. The disturbing weather metaphorizes the mental state of the patients and suggests one of them: a former dancer. The combination of sounds caused by rain, wind and thunder serves as the music that encourages the dancer to come into a winding, almost hypnotic dance. In another order in which the same patient is involved in another threatened dance, she is watched by other prisoners. Multiple exposure of the dancer represents the patient's point of view and their confused "view" of the world. <br /> <br /> These are just two examples of this wonderful movie that shows the patient's subconscious and "healthy" world view. <br /> <br /> One should see in three words.
