"Jake Speed" is a fine movie with a wonderful message. Of course, it has its flaws. Sometimes it is a bit slow. This puts his villain too far in the story. This is the action that fits the pace of a snail's heartbeat. It threw a Z-grade (although I always admired Karen Kopins' work, which has the direct cord of Sandra Bullock). <br /> <br /> But with all these things going on, Jake Speed ​​"is really inspiring, thanks to a lovely script by Wayne Crawford (who plays the title role) and Andrew Lane. <br /> <br / > Why do I find it so inspiring? Because it says to me, "Hey, why don't you try to be a good person?" <br /> <br /> The story is essentially a stranger in a foreign country Jake Speed ​​is in the real world where bad things happen to good people, Jake is more than a Boy Scout, more than a knight in shiny armor. Speed ​​is the patron saint of optimism in a dirty, mean and evil world. <br /> <br /> It is because of this that Jake Speed ​​really had to be a hit. to Hollywood and then to the rest of the world. <br /> <br /> Imagine a film industry that really forced itself to portray good and decent people. the Waltons in every theater should watch the cineplex, but it will be nice if more movies like Jake Speed ​​get a chance. (Due South, a Canadian Mountie TV show is a good comparison of what can be done to brighten American entertainment.) <br /> <br /> Certainly, "Jake Speed" has violence , blood and guns, but the overall message is that if you try hard enough to be a good person, you will beat the forces of evil every time. 14/10/99
