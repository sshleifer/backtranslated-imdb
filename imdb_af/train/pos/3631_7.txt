The movie actually has a pretty good story, but is cut down in several key locations. It is almost as if the director has thrown the film together without taking the time to make some essential cuts in the film. Dennis Quaid does a pretty decent job in his role ... but something is clearly missing from several key screens. <br /> <br /> This 2.5 hour movie can be reduced to about 2 hours of movie. And probably a much better movie would have been if it didn't feel like it was thrown together. <br /> <br />
