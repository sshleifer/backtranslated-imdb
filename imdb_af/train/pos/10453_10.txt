Traveling by train across Europe, American Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and French Celine (Julie Delpy) meet and decide to spend the night together in Austria. The next morning, Jesse returns to the United States, and Celine to Paris. <br /> <br /> "Before Sunrise" is one of my favorite novels, indeed one of the most beautiful love stories I have ever seen. It's a low-budget movie with a very simple and real storyline, but the chemistry between Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy is perfect, and the dialogue is beautiful. The direction is incredible, and the feelings of Celine and Jesse are conveyed to the viewer. I just finished my review number 1000 in IMDb, and I choose "For Sunrise" for this important number because it's a very special movie for me. I can't understand why this movie is not nominated for the Oscar, with such a wonderful script, direction and performances. Yesterday I probably watched this movie for the third or fourth time, and I still love it. My voice is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Antes do Amanhecer" ("Before Sunrise")
