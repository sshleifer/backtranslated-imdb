I'm obsessed! The story is wonderful and the performance is very addictive, but I love it. I'm on Season 2, Slide 5, and I'm telling you I'm attached to the characters now. For anything bad to happen to them will seriously affect my vote for the show. And, Michael is on my list now. Treasure ... I'm so glad to see there is a season 3, because I was too scared to go to disk 6 thinking it would end. I can't wait to see the rest. Thanks to the directors / producers / actors of Lost ... I enjoy television again. Before I was lost, I was saddened by every channel because of my disappointment in television, but I have to say that Lost is my entertainment!
