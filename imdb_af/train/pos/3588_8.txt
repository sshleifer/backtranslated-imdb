When I watched this movie, I was surprised that it was just a TV movie. I think this movie should have been in the theaters. I saw a lot of movies dealing with rape, but this one stands out. This movie has a kind of realism that is rarely found in movies today, let alone TV movies. It tells a story that I am certainly very realistic to many rape victims in small cities today, and I found it to be very credible (which is difficult to find in other rape-centered movies). I also thought Tiffani Theissen and Brian Austin Green were great in the parts they played. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys movies that has a bit of a hard reality for them. I enjoyed it a lot.
