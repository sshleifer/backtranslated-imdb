<br /> <br /> "Burning Paradise" is a combination of neo-Shaw Brothers action and Ringo Lam's urban cynicism. Looking at the movie, they can feel the battles. Scene is just mediocre, but it doesn't matter, it's attitude and atmosphere that counts. This great movie has both !! Lamb always gives us traditional heroes (Fong Sai-Yuk and Hung Shi-Kwan) and places them in a Raiders of the Lost Ark environment. However, it is not the light-hearted comic incarnations you might see in a Jet Li movie. Instead, these guys are fighting with brutal results to death. What makes the movie even better is that anyone can ever die, there is no return. Bad, they no longer make movies like this more often.
