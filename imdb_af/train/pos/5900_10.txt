I am very sorry that this charming and whimsical film (which I first saw after it was first released in the early fifties) recently had such a poor reception. In my opinion, this is much underestimated - but perhaps it is more to the European sense of humor than to the (for example) American. Perhaps we can understand and appreciate its subtleties and situations in Europe, as we are closer to some of them in real life! Specific mention should be made of the limited but good music - especially the catchy and memorable song "This is a good fine night", which was issued separately on a HMV 78rpm record in the fifties (10 inches plum label, I think! ). I would call anyone interested in attempting an attempt if you got the chance: you might have a pleasant surprise.
