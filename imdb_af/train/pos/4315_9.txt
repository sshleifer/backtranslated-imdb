I just watched this movie again and remain upset about the number of cynics who dismiss it as just New Age pap. A big film, one that takes its time to develop, is still close to going over the edge, but never and is eventually meditative, influential, and lifelong than most movie people dismissing its "coincidences". I was angry when the movies such as "Prince of Tides" and "Bugsy" (although I liked the latter) were nominated for the best photo of the year (let alone the "Silence of the Lambs" won!) it was completely ignored except for one nomination for the best script. At reconsideration, I think history supports my initial response!
