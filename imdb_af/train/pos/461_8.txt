Since this movie has very good entertainment features, I think it needs more credit than it was on Imdb. <br /> <br /> It's your basic "who did it?" thriller with sex and murder, but it keeps you right up to the end. I love these kind of movies and I guess this one meets the standard. <br /> <br /> For me it was worth watching more than once, and I'll give it an 8 on imdb.
