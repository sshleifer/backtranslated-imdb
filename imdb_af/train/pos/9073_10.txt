My wife and I took our 13-year-old boy to watch this movie and was absolutely delighted with the fun of the movie. It has an extra appeal to boys and men who remember their childhood, but even women enjoy the film and especially Hallie Kate Eisenberg's chorus, "Boys are so strange." It is refreshing to see a movie unapologetically showing that boys and girls are indeed different in their emotional and social makeup. Boys really do such strange things and usually survive to tell the story and scare their mothers! We enjoyed the movie so much that my son and an 11-year-old friend, me and my daughter, 23-year-old boyfriend, came out the next day for a family day. The second time we had more fun and everyone was touched. It was clean and beautifully performed by a pre-adolescent role reminiscent of the TV Classic "Freaks and Geeks". We all believe it will be a place to sleep, unlike the "Freaks & Geeks" that didn't survive its first season, but sold its DVD broadcast. See it especially when you have boys and you will find it stimulates conversation about fun and safety! Girls will love it because of the opportunity to say, "Boys are so strange!" Don't Miss It ...
