It was a good movie. It wasn't your typical war flag, but something else. This movie showed us in training before the war and didn't actually fight a war. This film is one of the more realistic views on war and the army than most other films like this one. Colin Farrel did a good job of portraying an army winner and Clifton Collins Jr. and Matthew Davis contributed fairly well. As Colin Farrel moves from grade B to grade in a few short years, you would never have thought it would happen. I would also add that the makers of tierland did a good job of filming a movie in the year 2000 and it looks like 1970 was a good touch. It is good to see talent being used wisely and I hope to see the same talent again in the near future.
