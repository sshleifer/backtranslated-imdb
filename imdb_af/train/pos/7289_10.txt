It was one of the first CREEPY movies I've ever seen. I was about 5 at the time. It scared me well! But that night I sat chewing gum in one eye to be like the monster ... and my mother got very upset. She had to clear my eyes with alcohol and the next day my eye looked like DOUBLE MINT! Now it's a movie! Hey, it's time, it's a good movie. That head on the lab table top was as much as it got at the time. And if your 5 this is VERY SCARY! Children a day are spoiled by special effects that show too much and leave nothing for your imagination. Your mind can make your imagination more rare than special effects! (IMO)
