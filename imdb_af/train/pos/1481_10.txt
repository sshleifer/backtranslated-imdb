Nowadays, some people see a movie without film styling, so much Dogma, Lars Von, Watchosky Brothers, changing what we expect in a movie, maybe Casomai is no longer independent of American film, the movie takes all movies and language We tell a simple story about love and marriage, but much more. Full views, lectures and lets you think ... and I'm sure you couldn't have flown a second of a long 116 minutes. I don't calculate having a single scene longer than 3 o 2 1/2 minutes.
