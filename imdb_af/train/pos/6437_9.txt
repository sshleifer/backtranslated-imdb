A well-known conductor decided after a heart attack to return to the town where he was born to lead a quiet life. There he comes to Afrikaans at the local church choir, which will change his life. <br /> <br /> I had no expectations when I first saw this movie yesterday; I like to watch foreign films that aren't English, and I've seen some Swedish movies in my life, but this one was the best so far. <br /> <br /> Where to start? In my opinion, this movie is a gem, thanks to many things, one of which is the outstanding play. Michael Nyqvist is perfect as the thoughtful, almost embarrassed and dedicated conductor Daniel Dar√©us. Beautiful Frida Hallgren is captivating with her beautiful smile and her subtle acting. The choir members are all well-developed, interesting characters with their own story. <br /> <br /> This movie tells a story, a beautiful story about music, love, pain, memories, death, about a man who devoted his life to music and trying to keep calm in the town where he was born, while trying to make peace with the past and with the way his life was until then. Kay Pollack shows us that Swedish is outstanding filmmakers. Go see So Sum in Heaven, this is a movie that reminds you of life and love, and it is also encouraging in some way.
