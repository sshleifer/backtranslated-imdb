"The Tenant" is Roman Polanski's largest film IMO. And I love "Chinatown", but this one is so much more original and unconventional and straightforward creepy. It's also a great black comedy. Some people I showed this movie afterwards warned a lot. So it is warned, but it affects some people. Polanski does a good job acting as the lead in "The Tenant" as well as directing it.
