Titanic must be one of my all-time favorite movies. It has its problems (which are movies), but still, it's nice. <br /> <br /> If I stumble over someone asking me why I like Titanic, I think my first response is "wait a minute, you don't?" I know so many people who don't like this movie , and I'm not saying I don't see why. "The love story is too cheesy", yes, but isn't it nice and moving? Well, the love story between Jack and Rose is very unrealistic, everyone knows that love like this doesn't actually exist. But it's a movie, not everyone enjoys watching a beautiful story that lets us slip a bit in fantasy for a while? The next complaint, DiCaprio and Winslet, are terrible actors. Well, OK, in this movie I agree that they are not performing their full potential. However, I think it's unfair to say they are terrible actors. Personally, I think they are both very talented actors who are unfortunately very well known for a movie they are not wonderful at. But the roles they have given are simple and the characters really seem enough to take care of them, but I agree with many people who haven't done so well and what could be expected. <br /> <br /> And finally, if someone complains that they don't like this movie because they hate romance, or because they hate history, or tragic movies, then I'm sorry, but why did they go and watch the world and see such a movie so clear. It's like people complaining The Dark Knight is a bad movie because they hate action movies. To be just a movie, not because you don't like the genre, it's a good movie. <br /> <br /> A lot of merit from his Oscars, especially Best Cinematography, which I find the best I have ever seen in a movie, may save the trilogy of the Lord of the Rings. <br /> <br /> I know some of the writing fails, such as the constant screaming of each other's names throughout the movie. The playback part of the story can sometimes be weak, but overall it is a great achievement to make the Titanic look so realistic, and the sinking feeling is so epic. <br /> <br /> I understand why many people do not like this movie, but mostly, it is impossible for them to mislead the fundamental idea, such as being a love story rather than thinking the movie and in itself is poorly built. <br /> <br /> I can tell you that I've read more than five books on the Titanic, including memoirs of the day it happened, and this movie is extremely historically accurate, except for a few mistakes. The only most important thing I can find is that the piping should be copper, not steel, and the iceberg should not look pretty unrealistic like the scene where they hit it. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 10/10, Not because I like novels, but simply because it is an excellent movie performance, it makes one feel horrible through the realistic adaptation of events.
