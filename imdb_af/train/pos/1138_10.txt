When I was 8, I always watched movies and television that I wasn't supposed to, and that was one of them. <br /> <br /> It's one of my favorite movies of all time, and it has to be the funniest movie I've ever seen in my life, the acting is great, they don't make comedies like this parent. (movies that are really funny and make you laugh without escaping or some kind of vomit-inducing body fluid as in the delayed Judd Apatow movies starring non-actors like Seth Rogen, barf). <br /> <br /> This movie is a classic with actors who can actually act and earn all the awards.
