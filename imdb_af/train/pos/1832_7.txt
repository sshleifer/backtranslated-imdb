I saw two movies this weekend, One was "bare" and the other "Waqt". Both movies are made in "Bollywood", but they are worlds of one another. The fundamental difference is the story and the director. Vipul Shaw made his indelible point with Ankhen, one of the best Comedy Hindi movies. Its Casting of the Charecteres is perfect. The story that is apparently taken from a Gujerati Play is wonderful, the treatment is excellent with exceptions. Composed in Bollywood as a movie, the first thing a Bollywood director tends to do is report a music director. This man (mediocre Malik in this case) is obliged to pick up six songs to fulfill his contract. So even a good director like Vipul Shah should use them to thank the Finacier and the Grandma who just can't get enough of these numbers. No music director can see relentless good songs as evident in this movie. None of the songs has a melody and it is clearly intrusive for the story telling, except the background music and the westernized version of the Bharat-Natyam. The twin and role-plays of the Father and Son are well served by Bachachan and Akshay Kumar. His stunt scenes are clearly outstanding. A good director surrounds him with good actors and he is willing to wait until a good story comes as in this superfilm. Then we have a cheap, classless, tasteless producer like Sharukh Khan, who will kick lower than to create a garbage like 'Bare' to enrich himself at the expense of improving art, and they surround themselves with border talent. The investment before the word gets over. These are the Bollywood locusts who prey on the untouched audience to receive "Film Farce" awards by Bollywood Chamcha and most of them in the Media.
