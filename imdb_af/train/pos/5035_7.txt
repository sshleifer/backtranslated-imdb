McConaughey in a horror / thriller? I had to see it. I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> The plot is told in flashback mode, and it's about an otherwise normal and happy family of three going through a very bizarre predicament. I can't say much more without spoiling the whole movie, sorry. Just know that if you decide to watch it, you'll be at least surprised. <br /> <br /> All the main players are very good. Bill Paxton did a good job of targeting those children and his play is wonderful. McConaughey's play is completely solid and fits perfectly into the account. <br /> <br /> This movie challenges you to think. Is he crazy? Is there a God? Do Devils Exist? How far you go to the right a wrong. And what is right anyway? I still think. <br /> <br /> Therefore, I recommend "Frailty". 7/10 and that's one of those movies that earn and reward a second, or even third.
