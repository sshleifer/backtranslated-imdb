It should not be one of the best films ever made, but overall it is a very pleasant, light piece of foam in which everyone involved has a good time. Highly recommended for this is feel-good factor alone. OK, so Frank Sinatra's "acting" leaves much to be desired, but his singing is a great redeeming feature and the songs fit perfectly into the romantic atmosphere of the movie. Sinatra has made many more films where she has undoubtedly shone acting ability, but in this is his first venture in Hollywood, his voice, not his play, his greatest contribution to this movie. I just watched it again on TV and it still pushes my mood as much as it was the first time I saw many years ago.
