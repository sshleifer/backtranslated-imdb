You can call it a mystery, perhaps a small thriller or an intelligent movie. <br /> <br /> The story takes you through the life of one person who has lost his life and wants to regain it. <Br /> <br /> I must say I was rather surprised that I really enjoyed this movie. This is usually not the genre I give, but the characters quickly became people for me and I wanted to know what they were about and what would happen to them. <br /> <br /> Like many French films about English We can learn much more about the character and the influence of their environment on their person. This movie is character-driven and won't disappoint!
