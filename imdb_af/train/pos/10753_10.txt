For those who say this movie deserves anything under the escaping grace it showed, I disagree. This is an amazing documentary about a shocking day. <br /> <br /> IMDB asks us to review this movie. I urge you to consider the fact that the documentary was made. The courage it took to shoot this movie is particularly striking. We find that the two brothers were divided when that moment happened. They continue to document the bravest of the brave without knowing their own and each other's safety. To judge whether it is more noble to shoot a video of that tragedy or to save lives like this wonderful, wonderful firefighters didn't have mine to answer. I just know that in 30 years a class of kids won't know each other. <br /> <br /> I'm sending a wholehearted 10. That's why the art of filming has been created! To capture the natural emotion of real life. You can keep your kung-fu junk. Romance is cute. Action will never reach this level. This movie, 9/11, will be timeless because it has not glorified itself. It didn't have a sneak peek. It did not have all the blatant legacies that leaves a lion's share of the many movies on the many screens. It had class, serenity, dust, and it had a record of the day the modern face of America and even the world changed. It spoke of things that are inevitable for the camera's eye. Consider this movie, as it proclaims itself, a tribute to all who have fallen because of the free, beautiful name of America. <br /> <br /> How to give something less to a movie that shows, not decorations, the natural bravery of real people acting in unreal times. I love "The Godfather", but "9/11" is a different kind of movie forever because it is a different kind of world. It is art without questions or questions. <br /> <br /> watch
