"Kolchak" was a TV series that didn't fit in any category. Part of horror, sharing comedy, throwing in some social awareness, and what we have is something I think people were not ready for. This is a pity, since I started watching these shows on the Chiller network (I never saw the original), I realized how different and interesting it was. <br /> <br /> With International News Service reporter Darren Mcgavin as Kolchak, and Simon Oakland as his always angry boss Tony Vincenzo, the performances were followed by a Chicago news reporter who became more often than not do not have. part of the story itself, while searching the windy city for contemporary creeps that stumble at night. The underlying charm of Macgavin really sets the display apart. A somewhat good-natured man, who always wears the same suit, can't help but love him. His jokes are wonderful, and the back and forth between him and the skeptical editor, Oakland, are straight hilaries. <br /> <br /> The stories are mostly pretty good, and the acting is very good. The 70's were not a * big * time for special effects, and the show suffers, but if you suspend unbelief, it's a fun series that was ahead of time.
