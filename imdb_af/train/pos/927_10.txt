"Father of pride" was still one of the good performances that unfortunately did not have a very long life. And it's pretty sad, especially if you think the worst shows are almost always on the horizon (think in "The Simple Life"). I admit that there are many similarities to this show and The Simpsons, but despite the similarities, the show has its own merit. The animation is just adequate, not incredible, but good. The best is the characters. All the animals are very nice and funny, and even Sigfried and Roy have their moments. The music was good, I liked a lot of songs. <br /> <br /> Although the show isn't very original, I think it has a lot of potential. Just like "Mission Hill", a show not very well known, but I liked a lot, it didn't have the appreciation it deserved. What a pity.
