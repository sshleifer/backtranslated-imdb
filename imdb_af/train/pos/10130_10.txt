The pilot was done extremely well. It explains how the characters bind in future episodes. I don't think anyone could have created a better pilot for this show. It shows remarkable creativity on the writer's section. Although not everything has been corrected, as it was the very first episode, many events in future seasons were shown in the pilot. An example would be Ross and Rachel's future relationship. Although the nervousness of a first episode has appeared, it is overwhelmed by an incredible plot and excellent role. <br /> <br /> Bravo. <br /> <br /> A great start to an unbeatable comedy!
