I sincerely hope that the first season of Cosby will be released on DVD at least. The episode with Hilton's eccentric genius brother, George (played by the end of Roscoe Lee Browne), is classic hilarity. It reflects the classical brothers and sisters and love between brothers whose lives took different paths, but fortunately both replied. <br /> <br /> Mr. Cosby and Mrs. Rashad brilliantly regained the chemistry that they shared on The Cosby Show for years and put them in a more middle-class role. They show the dimensions they can use as artists. <br /> <br /> The timetable of comic dynamite ... Madeline Kahn, Phylicia Rashad, and Mr. Cosby ... classic genius!
