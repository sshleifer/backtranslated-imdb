The synopsis for this movie does a good job of explaining what to expect. It's a very good thriller. Well shot. Hard to believe this was Bill Paxton's legal principle, although some shots EXTRA look like a storyboard version. <br /> <br /> However, there are a few shots that look really good and show some true imagination of Paxton. <br /> <br /> It's a sturdy story with a few big twists at the end, several of them, all credible, everything nice and best of all, dark enough to make their true twists. <br /> <br /> The kid's actors in the movie also do good. I'm usually wary of movies with children in main roles, because all too often they come off as Nickelodeon rejects, but both of these kids do a good job. <br /> <br /> This movie is not nice. It's not very scary. But it is very, very creepy.
