THE SUNSHINE BOYS was the spectacular 1975 screen adaptation of Neil Simon's play about a retired Vaudeville team, played by Walter Matthau and George Burns, who had a very bitter uproar and were asked to re-unite for a television -specials or something like that. The problem is that the two still hate each other and have nothing to do with each other. Richard Benjamin appears as Matthau's cousin, a theater agent who has received the monumental responsibility to make this reunion a reality. This warm and winning comedy is a lovely valentine for a forgotten form of entertainment ... vaudeville and works primarily on one of Neil Simon's better scenes and excellent work by Matthau, Burns and Benjamin. Burns won the best supporting actor Oscar for this, but I think Matthau is running away with this movie with his flawless hilarious performance as Willy Clark. Matthau was nominated for Best Actor, but did not have a chance against Nicholson for ONE WET ABOUT THE CUCKOO'S NEXT; In another year, however, it was an Oscar-worthy performance. Matthau recommends the screen and there is no false note in this beautiful time display. The scene where he audition for a potato slice commercially and doesn't get the name of the product right is a classic. THE SUNSHINE BOYS is a warm and award-winning Neil Simon comedy that blends with the unbeatable chemistry between Matthau and Burns.
