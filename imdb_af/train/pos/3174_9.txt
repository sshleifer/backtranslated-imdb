Very rarely comes an indie comedy that leaves a lasting impression. Cross Eyed is a rare jewel. The writer did not only address the challenge of directing his own work but giving a hilarious performance as an evil roommate. The script takes an interesting look at not only the trouble of the struggling author, but mixes so much comedy in the desert world of the writer that you can't help commit Ernie as a character. Very funny things. Despite the small budget, Adam Jones manages to give the film a serious look. He doesn't waste when it comes to making a good movie. I can't wait to see what he does with the following. This man can make people laugh and think; it's special.
