First think this movie is your typical Western movie, but it seems to be very interesting and has hidden me until the end of the game, which turned out to be very unusual. Charlton Heston, (Sam Burgade), "Midway", 76, had past experiences with James Coburn, (Zach Provo), Dead Dead (93), and Zach never forgave Sam. He would never stop making sure he caught him with him and paid him back. Unfortunately, Barbara Hershey (Susan Burgade), "The Portrait of a Lady", 96, managed to get caught up in this situation and found herself among sex starved men who never left her. Sam Burgade had to make some very difficult decisions and I was quite surprised at the conclusion. It is a very entertaining movie and the play was excellent.
