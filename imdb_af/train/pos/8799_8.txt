The movie is great, like any other international project that includes strong impressions. three of them (Israel, Bosnia and Egypt) had to be exterminated. especially Bosnian clip, which is pathetic for all reasons, and does not contain a single original thought or element on its own. everything is very good, unrecognizable to most Americans, known to the rest of the world. Unfortunately, stones are talking about misery of people all over the world. and as I see it, there are so many of those who will not condemn it. <br /> <br /> top 5: 1. loose 2. penn 3. inarritu 4. lalouche 5. imamura
