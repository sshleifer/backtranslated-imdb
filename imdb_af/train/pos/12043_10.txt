... On stage, TV or in a book, 'The Woman in Black' is an excellent ghost story. Other reviewers have already said just about everything about this film, but I thought I'd add my low review as well. The made-for-TV film has a deliberate first act, which twists the main character Arthur, as he did in London in 1920 as a lawyer. I can understand why it cannot appeal to all tastes. Nonetheless, for me, I love this British storytelling style similar to any of the BBC's "Ghost Story for Christmas" adaptations of the great M.R. James's work. In the second act, the ghost story kicks in as Arthur is sent by his boss to the provinces to clear the affairs of a deceased client. The third action ceaselessly builds on a backbone-ticking conclusion. As a London player I saw the scene. I own the book, DVD-R and also have the unabridged audiobook on my iPod. What is certain to me, 'The Women in Black' on any medium is a ghost story with little equal. It's time we had a legal region 2 DVD release.
