While this movie is not in the big movie annals, it's a great way to spend half an hour with the family. The film is finally released in the video where it was first to debut. <br /> <br /> The movie is about an eclectic group of friends who gathered for meals they called "The Hungry Bachelors Club". Jorja Fox plays a woman who serves as a surrogate to get a discount for the restaurant she wants to open. Bill Nunn plays a Cadillac-loving mystery that becomes her lover. Fox gives an understated and reassuring performance and Nunn is reliably talented as ever. Micheal des Barres is a hoot as a top lawyer. The ensemble throws - consisting of familiar faces - work well together to bring this miserable group of characters to life. It's a good rental and one of the few you can see with the whole family.
