Los Angeles TV news reporter Jennifer (the beautiful Barbara Bach of "The Spy Who Loved Me" boasts) and her two assistants Karen (the handsome flamboyant Karen Lamm) and Vicki (the beautiful Lois Young, who are not just killed, but also beats her nice bid in a nice free wet bath scene) go to Solvang, California to cover an annual Danish festival. As all of the local hotels are booked for as long as they are, the three beautiful ladies are forced to look for room and board at a pregnant, but provisional, remote home owned by freaky Ernest Keller. It was played very well by the late-night, great Sydney Lassick and his gentle sister Virginia (a solid Lelia Goldoni). Unfortunately, Keller has a very dirty and deadly dark family living in his cellar: a spicy, pathetic, lazy, uncontaminated, human child Mongolian, about Junior (a varied touch and terrifying depiction by Stephen Furst; Flounder in Animal House) ), which, of course, is lost and causes murderous destruction, Captain Danny Steinmann, with an equally fine acting, a compelling perverse plot, excellent makeup by Craig Reardon, a beautiful creepy atmosphere, a wonderful wild climax, a slow, but steady pace, nice well-drawn characters, and a surprisingly heartbreaking final freeze frame (the stick subplot tackles an unexpectedly strong and terrible punch), this unfairly thought-out early 80's psycho sleeper is worth checking out.
