"Foxes" is a film I remember for the depiction of teenagers in the late 1970s. As I was exactly Jodie Foster's age, I was associated with this movie. It deals with the frustrations, temptations, relationships and rebellion of the youth. The soundtrack is wonderful with inspirational rock eg. "More than a feeling" by Boston and sad numbers like "On the Radio" by Donna Summer. The music of my late teens. Yes, I will always remember this one, even if it wasn't big.
