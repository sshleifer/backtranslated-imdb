A good story about how to follow your dreams and actually make a point of doing something about them when the opportunity strikes. Nothing was easy for Morris either; he had a family, work, work in another place, a bond, etc. It was not as if he could just abandon what he had done and he put on the greyhound to play AAA ball for 4 months. It thought. I'm glad they showed his indecision, almost until he got the call to the majors. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing him see the Red Sox (I think ...), it was a wonderful story. Although Morris looks more like John Kruk or a Mills Watson like Quaid, it's right. <br /> <br /> Quaid does a very good job of playing the man, teacher, coach and "oldest newcomer". If someone is in the same age group, I can definitely look with his destiny. You are not too old to do what you thought as a child, but it is there. You have to do it sooner than lator. <br /> <br /> Credible, beautifully edited, customized, acting, good to see the familiar faces of the late Royce Applegate, Brian Cox and Rachel Griffiths here. <br /> <br /> Good work everywhere, happy to see it. <br /> <br /> *** from **** ... who would have thought the Tampa Devil Stones would be the subject of such a good movie early on?
