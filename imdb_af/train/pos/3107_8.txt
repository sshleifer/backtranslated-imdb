After the Moscow performance of Supremacy, it is Bourne's greatest adventure and final climax. In the entire 115 minutes, the film Bourne runs from Russia to Madrid, Paris, Morocco and finally New York. Damon thought every inch of the hard-trained murderer Robert Ludlum. He is the deadliest spy in the movies, and it's the underlying emotions of his character that make him so credible and that's exactly the good way Damon can combine. These two polar opposites of themselves are so breathtaking. In this third, Bourne is on a mission to save his soul and while Ultimatum sees it, Ultimatum offers such a high-octane performance that you will float yourself and gasp over its truly powerful branch of ideas and deductions; just look out for two big car hunters and a battle scene as realistic as Bond vs Shaw back in '63. Director Greengrass has outdone himself with this compelling thriller and it is probably as exciting as the movie thrillers get; a real reward for Bourne fans and a new breed of spy-thriller standard.
