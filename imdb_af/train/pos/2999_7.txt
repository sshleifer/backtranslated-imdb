There were times when this movie became much more complicated than it was needed, but I think it's part of its charm. Acting Philo Vance's observation powers seem to be greater than all the Eastern lies of the era, combined when it comes to the final evaluation of how the murders were committed. The fall of the dagger in the Chinese vase was the kicker for me; I mean, could anyone not just drop it? <br /> <br /> Early in the film, Vance (William Powell) had a line about Archer Coe's "psychological impossibility" to kill himself - I had to consider it for a while. I have wondered if there is actually a scientific basis for the concept of being true, because I did not study myself psychology. It seems logical, but then there is always the case that doesn't fit the rules. <br /> <br /> You know, I got a kick from the rushed shoulder (Etienne Girardot), reminding me of Star Trek's Dr. McCoy said a few times, "I'm a doctor, not a wizard" and "I'm a doctor, not a detective". I can see DeForrest Kelley's photo and say to himself, "I'll have to use it one day." <br /> <br /> When the killer's identity is revealed, it doesn't look like a big surprise, but until then it's really someone's guess. But Archer and Brisbane Coe aside did not answer the central question of the title, and the murder I was really interested in - Thomas MacDonald's dog, Ghillie, killed?
