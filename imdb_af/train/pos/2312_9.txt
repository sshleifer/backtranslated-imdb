A young man named Court loves everyone. His painful bloody death brings everyone closer. You can find other symbols and notes in the movie. Whether predictable or not, and irrespective of ecclesiastical beliefs, it is a moving story full of environment and sensuality. <br /> <br /> Another thing, someone mentioned that his fate was so fast that it didn't seem likely. But the elements for this are subtly drawn. Notice what his mother is saying to bring his lunch to the field. Notice how he holds the steering wheel and his gloves. He is sweating and operates dangerous equipment. To date, tractors are quite dangerous.
