I don't know what this movie is about, I checked it at the videoback and I enjoyed it. Little-seen multi-genre movie by director Bernard Rose (Candyman, Immortal Beloved). Great story and characters. As a fan of Glenne Healdy's, I was amazed at her British accent. The only exception to this movie was the end. However, this is worth the rent.
