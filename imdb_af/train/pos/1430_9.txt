It played at our theater in Amsterdam and the movie we wanted to see was sold out, so we went here and knew nothing about it as a documentary on the planet. We were very happy in our accident because it was a very powerful movie about life and the delicate balance we all share with the rest of the Earth's inhabitants. This film has some of the most stunning photography I have ever seen in a movie and has taken me from deserts to oceans to rain forests and things I've never seen in a movie, TV or book. "Earth" is a film that every student must see before they come into tears. I will encourage my cousin to watch this movie, as she will inherit the planet we are leaving. It's also a movie to watch on a theater screen or a very large television, as photography is so powerful and exotic.
