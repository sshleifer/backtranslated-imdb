This film deals with Irish rebellion in the 1920s and more specifically one man's life after informing a friend of his mercy on his head and its subsequent consequences. Looking at the movie, I have the feeling that you can take the script and with just a few small updates, do it again and unfortunately it will still suit contemporary events. But to recover would not be so good. A beautiful show by Victor McLaglen (for which he earned an Oscar) and a fine ensemble role that includes the most, though not all actors with brogues in Hollywood, most of them recognizable character characters established at the time is or just started. A very good movie is worth watching. Highly recommended.
