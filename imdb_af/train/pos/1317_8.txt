This anime is underestimated and is still. Barely the brave children's movie as I noticed, I still come back to this 10 years after I first saw it. One of the better movies released. <br /> <br /> While not perfect, the animation is good, camera tricks give it a 3D feel, and the story is still as good today even after I grew up and saw groundbreakers like Neon has. Genesis Gospel and RahXephon. Obviously it has nowhere near the depth, but tries to see it from a light view. It's a story to entertain, not to question. <br /> <br /> Another of my favorites, I also come back when I feel like a giggle over more light spirits. Not to say it's a childish movie, there are surprisingly sad moments in it and you need a sense of humor to see it all.
