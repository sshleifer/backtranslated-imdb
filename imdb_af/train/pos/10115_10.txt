This film deals with the atrocities in Derry 30 years ago, commonly known as Bloody Sunday. <br /> <br /> The film was well researched, acted and directed. It's as close to the truth as we will get to the outcome of the Saville investigation. The film places the atrocity in the context of time. It also shows the cruelty of the soldiers on the day of the atrocities. The scandalous money laundering the Widgery Tribunal was also treated. <br /> Overall, this is an excellent drama that moves and shocks. When the Saville report comes out, look at this movie again to see how close the truth is.
