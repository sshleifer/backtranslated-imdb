<br /> <br /> I saw it in a sneak preview. <br /> <br /> I've always enjoyed the movie. <br /> <br /> I live in one of the cities mentioned in the movie where past players move. <br /> <br /> Not the best movie ever put on screen, but enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Robin is doing well with his role. <br /> <br /> Best line of the movie at the beginning, by Robin's character Jack: "I was that SOB!" Clean here not to offend anyone. <br /> <br /> Was pleased if it came back to the DVD in the wide screen / letterbox format a few years ago. <br /> <br /> I'm not a football fan or a real sports fan. But you don't have to be one to keep this movie.
