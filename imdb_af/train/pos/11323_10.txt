Fate / Stay Night is an animated series inspired by a h-game. Somehow, the producers reversed it to make it a successful series without any of the h-things. It could not have been otherwise, because the character's development is great just as it is depicted in this series and any change can only ruin perfection. (You will understand once you see all the episodes). <Br /> <br /> In spite of a relatively slow start (the producer took his time to present the characters), things get instantaneous and shortly after the middle series the action becomes so intense that you stick your seat. <br /> <br /> The subject of the series focuses on the Holy Grail War that has taken place in the Fukuky City over the past 50 years. The pilot actually starts with the end of the previous war and develops from there. Shiro is the only survivor of the fire that began in the last battle and enveloped a large part of the city. He unwillingly testifies of a struggle between two servants exercising his Reiju (Holy Point) to summon one of the most powerful servants of the battlefield, Saber. His first contact with Saber amazed him. "Such immeasurable beauty ... I was lost to words". <br /> <br /> You should not compare this series with anyone else to fully understand it. FSN offers much more than a few cool swords, good animation, spectacular lights, good soundtrack, and excellent character and relationship development. It offers the changes that take place in the characters' personalities as events occur. The action shows credible dynamic emotional and behavioral patterns of the individuals (not similar to the linear type of other series usage) which constantly shape their personalities to reveal, under the mask of perfection, defective characters. <br /> <br /> The Saber character is linked to a medieval legend that has been changed to fit this series and must be accepted as such. You shouldn't think of FSN thinking that it doesn't offer the viewer with the historical fact, just remember it's adventure / fantasy series and not a documentary and enjoy it as long as you can. The end is sudden and unexpected and if there were twice as many episodes, I would have looked at them in the same breath.
