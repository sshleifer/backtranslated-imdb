This is the best made-to-TV movie of all time! Am I saying this because I'm a big Silverstone fan? Partly, but even without her, I still see it. I am a fan of serial killer genre movies, and believe this to be a good entry in the category. Also, Mary Giordano is easily placed under Alicia's top five character creations. Totally unforgettable - as she really does. I also want her on my side if there is a riddle to be solved. She plays the character, as she does with her real life, with full confidence in everything she does. Looks sweet, honest, pretty ... just like she is in real life. So is it acting? Yes, she is a rebel again. This time she's not bad, she's too good and a bit scared to do things that seem above the law. But she doesn't do things that the normal teenager would do. Instead, she spent her time reading detectives and solving crimes. A clich√© of flow: she makes her father's death in a different way to vigilante style. At that time Alicia played the same characters: rebellious, seductive, without a parent, a lonely. It also happens here, but this time she is a little nerdy. It does not matter; she is still cool like a nerd. Going out soon, or else Giordano will investigate why you're not ...
