Cor blimey. This movie really surprised me because it is a comedy masterpiece. Billy Zane is stunning as the central character, and everyone drives it straight enough to make the comedy natural and easy. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is really good, and the chords are a pleasure to watch. I recommend watching this movie with a lot of friends, a few bottles of your choice liquor, and prepare to be surprised and entertaining. <br /> <br /> It works so perfectly from kitsch masterpieces like Plan 9 from outer space to the real B movie tradition. But what makes it more than that is the caliber of the people who participated in the film. For example, Ron Pearlman. I still find myself giggling on the scene where Zane put a set of steps in an almost ballet style. Already a little angry, and all the better for it.
