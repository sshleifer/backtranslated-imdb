An independent straight-action actor played by a cast and filmed by a director who obviously took the material seriously. Imperfect, as expected from a movie that was clearly shot at a tight budget, but the drama is involved - this is one of those movies that, when repeated, is ad nauseum on Cinemax 2 or More Max or what they call it, You end up looking 40 minute blocks when you're supposed to work. Along with W / "Deathstalker 2", "Chopping Mall" and "The Assault", a reminder that Wynorski is a much more talented director than many of his low-budget fellows, who have a true genre movie capability when he is really interested in the material (dislikes watching any of his 3 or 4 Shannon Tweed movie!) Actors who didn't have enough to do recently (Mancuso, Ford , even Gary Sandy for chrissakes) have been in their best roles for years. As for Grieco, he has the right look, although his play is a bit one-note - obviously his character is supposed to be self-destructive. the movie, but Grieco doesn't tell it well. I reviewed IMDB and I see the author also wrote 'Sorority House Massacre 2' and 'Dinosaur Island' for the director - both minor classics in their own right, but of course 'stupid' Roger Cormon-like Cinema - this is more like some of the better Jonathan Demme and Jonathan Kaplan B photos of the 70's. It gives you the exploit, but at the same time offers drama. This is a real step forward. Not 'Citizen Kane', and the comic final moments are a bit disruptive, but a well-written, character-driven, above-average straight-to-video action. Little achievements like this should not be overlooked if they come, which is scarce enough (as I am reminded if I tried the other night to have an Albert Pyun monster, called "Heatseeker" as it seems - But it's another story!)
