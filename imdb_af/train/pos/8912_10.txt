I read a lot of comments on this site criticizing the Blob because it was cheesy or camping. The movie is shocked by amateurish acting and poor special effects. What would you expect from a group of people whose only experience in low budget production was locally produced (Valley Forge PA) Christian Shorts. Let me tell the exaggerated critics that this movie never took everything that took it seriously. This fact must be evident from the mismatched theme music, complete with stupid lyrics played on opening credits. For what it was meant, this movie is excellent. I have seen some of the recent ultra low budget efforts, Blair Witch Project was one of them, which has absolutely no entertainment value or intelligent thought behind their plot. BWP was purely faeces. The Blob, on the other hand, was well thought out, well written and thoroughly entertaining. The scene where the old man comes across the meteorite and the mass contained in a stick is done perfectly and really creepy. The scene in the doctor's office with the Blob slowly moved under the blanket on the gurney while it consumed the old man, was a spectacular masterpiece. Bottom line is, I love this movie. I challenge anyone out there to pay $ 120,000.00, inflated for today's dollar value, and make a movie anywhere as entertaining or as successful as the Blob. It just can't be done. PERIOD! <br /> <br /> Thank you for taking the time to read this review.
