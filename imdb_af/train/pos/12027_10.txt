I saw it and I like Melissa playing her role well. It was actually credible. My son-in-law saw it with my sister and I and when I told my sister I forgot, it was based on a real story (I saw it a few years ago.) He just said because it at his lifetime you are true And both my sister and I were like it, but I wondered if anyone knew what murder was or what was really involved, because I wanted to prove it to him. I love life movies, especially the one who is true or just the one who teaches a good lesson. I thought I saw something about it a week ago, but I can't remember where any help would be appreciated.
