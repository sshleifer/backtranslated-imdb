I am and was very entertained by the movie. This was my favorite movie of all time from 1976. In the 70's I was so in love with Kris Kristofferson's appearance and attitude, of course, I'm not a film critic, but for the duration I think it was very good. I really like the combination of Streisand and Kristofferson. I thought they worked very well together. I saw the movie many times and still love the two of them like Esther and John Norman. I'm a huge fan of Kris and see him in concert when I can. What a talented singer song writer, not to mention, actor. I saw him in many movies, but still think back to a star was born.
