Not since SpongeBob Squarepants I saw a bigger cartoon on TV. The colors are wonderful, the voices can't be better, the characters are so original, wonderful cartoon. Hope Nickolodean continues to develop this cartoon. Hope the season DVD is coming out soon! I like cartoons like this and I hope more people agree to see this great cartoon. It's very hard to find the season DVD, so if anyone finds a store that sells it, please let me know. The only Catscratch merchandise available at Nick Shop is a good look shirt but very expensive! If you like Spongebob; and who doesn't? you will also love Catscratch!
