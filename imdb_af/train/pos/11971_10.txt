I think the commentary on the show is cheesy, is too exaggerated. When a person comes to watch a TV program, what does he look for? It is to enjoy watching a show, unless he / she is a critic or person who analyzes the story. But most of us are not so and look at the shows to relax and enjoy. FULL HOUSE is an ideal show to look at a heavy day in the office / school. It makes you laugh and it is not just humor. <br /> <br /> Yes, the Tanner family is a perfect family, a perfect hypothetical family. If such a family existed in the real world, it would be a role model for us to follow. But it's a TV show, not a real family, and there's nothing wrong with portraying a hypothetical family on television. The fact that the show can run so long shows us that people enjoyed it, whatever the commentary. <br /> <br /> Another good point about the show is that any person of any age will not only enjoy watching it but will take a message back but childishly that message is. Those who are Jesse's conversations with Michelle are very touching, if one does not think so childishly. <br /> <br /> Overall, I will say after watching every performance of Full House, there is a rarity in your heart that is rarely present in many other programs.
