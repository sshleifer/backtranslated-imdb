I started losing my faith in movies of recent abundance with the typical Genre Hollywood movie. Story lines fail, and camera work is just copied from the last movie of similar taste. But then I saw Zentropa (Europe) and my faith was renewed. Not only is the metaphorical storyline staggering, but the use of color and black and white is visually stimulating. The narrator (Max Von Sydow) takes you every step of the way through a playful journey and captivates you in Europe in 1945. We all saw how death on the screen takes place in hundreds of thousands of ways, but the beauty of this movie is how it penetrate you. every slow moment that leads you to death. Unlike many movies, it does not cut into one second (for example) a knife, but forces you to see the devastating but sensual beauty of a man's last moments. I think we can all get away from what this movie is trying to say, but it's definitely worth the time to figure out what it really means. I'd like to talk more in depth about the movie to anyone who wants to send me an email. Enjoy it!
