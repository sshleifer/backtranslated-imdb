I enjoy Ralph Bakshi movies ("Wizards", "Cool World" and the underrated animated "Lord of the Rings") and am a Frank Frazetta collector and fan. I am also a sword and wizard who loves the world of Edgar Rice Burroughs and Robert E. Howard. <br /> <br /> I missed the "Theatrical and Theatrical release" in 1983 and looked forward to seeing it video or revival ever since. That is why the 2005 edition was a dream for me. However, I bought it with some stress, because I was hoping it would be worthwhile not just to look and then put it on the shelf as a "collectible" fabric until the day. when I was dead. Fortunately my fears were unfounded and I was pleasantly impressed by this movie. <br /> <br /> Like Frazetta art, it is a greasy film that has a physical and sexuality that is hard to find in most fantasy / sword and magic films without being cheese or dirty. The art is good and you see the best of Frazetta. Even my young boys loved seeing it with me and asking for it again and again. My wife, however, has some objections because of the slimly dressed princess (very Frazetta-esquire). I do not care about it, because it is credible and there is no sex scene. <br /> <br /> Roto-scoping is used, but personally I enjoy roto-scoping. It gives more fluid and realistic movements to the characters that are difficult to find in animation. <br /> <br /> Despite some continuity issues, I recommend this movie to all Bakshi, Frazetta, Conan and Sword and Magicians. Enjoy it!
