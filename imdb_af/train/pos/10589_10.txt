I enjoyed Longstreet, who followed in the steps of Raymond Burr's successful Ironside TV series and was meant to give it a competition. But this show was canceled after one season because it was decided - I believe wrong - that Longstreet was not with Mr. Burr's Ironside could compete. <br /> <br /> I might add that the pilot for this show was especially well done and very memorable. I hope a Longstreet box set will appear. <br /> <br /> Writers should note that this story idea has just been briefly explored here and that much more can be done to show the drama and interaction of disabilities on TV.
