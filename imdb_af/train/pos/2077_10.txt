This timeless proverb reverberates in this movie and in my heart. So many years I waited to see this eternal story! Maybe I wasn't right. It is possible that my sensitivity would not appreciate his power. Therefore, I now welcome it with joy in my soul. <br /> <br /> My respect and admiration for PAUL MUNI is long. She is now a legendary luminescence. But now I finally discovered the valuable gifts of LUISE RAINER's wonderful talents. Oh, how many faces can speak like hair? Some said it worked out of her silent years, and this might have been good, but her speech is eloquent enough when given a chance. She earned her Oscar a lot. <br /> <br /> This movie is in an epic in the most classic relationships. All parts are equal, necessary and perfect. Naysayers can leave if they want, but they will avoid a storytelling that stays with life. <br /> <br /> THE GOOD EARTH enriches one in ways not expected. But not everyone will come out with the joy I did. But I can only hope this movie will be remembered for many years. <br /> <br /> Don't produce me with the technical skills of the main players race. These are expectations of modern times when we are obsessed with complete perfection. But I dare a million counters of newer films to tell the story of PEARL BUCK with such poignancy, power, beliefs and grace. <br /> <br /> If any modern artist dared to film this masterpiece, I warn them that they will never come close to the aromatic fragrance that still comes from the heart of this narrative. Time will not reduce this effort, and progress will not improve.
