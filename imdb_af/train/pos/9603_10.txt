I have one word to this movie, WOW! I saw "Darius Goes West" at the Tribeca Film Festival. People in the theater sighed. This movie shows the hardship Darius suffers with Muscular Dystrophy. The movie was very well done and really made you part of the movie. I was so emotionally moved by the movie because it tells us that we are very happy to be completely healthy. Some people in this world are less obscure than us. And sometimes we have to give them a hatred and help them to the end. I would give them ten stars, they gave Darius a head when they were not asked. They didn't do it for the money they did for a needy friend. Darius, the world must know, Darius went west.
