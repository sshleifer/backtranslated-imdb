Repetition: Zandalee is a young woman who is more and more caught up in her marriage to Thierry. Thierry struggled with the death of his father last year and lost his way. He immersed himself in the work, put down his writing, and Zandalee deceived the attraction between them. In this, Johnny, and old friend of Thierry's, once entered exile. But Johnny kept painting, and only a day's work for rent. He takes the day as it comes and leaves tomorrow after his fate. There is a moment of grace between Zandalee and Johnny, and they enter into a relationship. But Zandalee struggles with her desire to desire and her conscience and love for her husband. But none of them, not Zandalee, not Johnny and not Thierry, can turn the relationships between them completely out of control. <br /> <br /> Comment: It is set as an excitement tone. But perhaps more of a thrill to the heart than a normal thriller where it is about life and death, and threat of violence. Not that a vibrator of heart cannot tackle deadly relationships, but the threat comes from a different angle. And it's not really until the second half in Zandalee comes to the excitement, and although the foundation is laid in the first half, I can't really describe the genre as a player. Much more of a romantic drama than anything else but with the underlying streams of other genres. The developing thriller is there, but it also has more than a small hue of a sensual erotic type. Because that's what it's all about, which drives the characters and therefore the whole story. Desire. The need to have and the need to be. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, it's pretty good, certainly much better than its current (4.1) rating anyway. It takes its time, but it becomes a good sense of tension, and it handles the erotic part very well, with taste. It is always an integral part of the story, which is needed to give the story, it is necessary to have weight, and I never felt it was an excuse to show a bare breast or something like that. Unfortunately, the highlight of the story comes well before the end, and the end itself feels flat, even though it is dramatic in its own way. <br /> <br /> The role is impressive, with leading actors such as Nicholas Cage and Judge Reinhold. But the show was almost completely stolen by Erika Anderson. Beautiful and very skillful to portray the sometimes subtle feelings of desire, she is excellent, both Cage and Reinhold, sometimes become a bone overboard and become a bit rough. Her career after that is too thin for the talent she shows in Zandalee, I can only hope it is because of her own choices. Also two personal favorites appear in small roles that give a little extra edge to the movie, which is Steve Buscemi and Joe Pantoliano. <br /> <br /> If you're in the right mood, it's a very good movie, it can have a different purpose to get the credit it really deserves. <br /> <br /> 7/10
