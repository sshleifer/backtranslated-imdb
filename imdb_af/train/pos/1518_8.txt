THE HOUSE WHO HAS BLOOD is the third in a series of seven Amicus horror anthologies. Including the MONSTER CLUB as part of the series will make eight movies. Although that movie is very different from the others. <br /> <br /> I look at the Amicus anthologies with great memories as I loved them when I was in my teens. My feelings for them today are just as strong. <br /> <br /> For years I've been trying to find this movie. The synopsis of the stories were so appealing that I went so far to pay a considerable amount for it when I finally got a copy. Just as good as the movie, I felt a sense of disappointment when I finally saw it. It wasn't as good as I had to believe. While it's better than its two predecessors, it's nowhere as good as its four successors as I will demonstrate. <br /> <br /> The link story sees John Bennett as a police inspector who is a missing person living in a mysterious old home. His journey begins at the local police station where he learns the stories of previous residents. The link story later tells him that he is visiting the estate agent who sold the house. Although this link story is on paper, it is flat and lifeless in practice and easily the worst of any Amicus anthology. I can't help but get the feeling that John Bennett is an armman's version of Donald Pleasance or Ian Hendry. I'd rather have seen one of the two mentioned actors in his role. We could even have had both here - one as the police inspector and the other as the estate agent. They could, and I believe, bring this poor element of the movie to life much better. <br /> <br /> The movie contains four stories, each focusing on a resident of the house. <br /> <br /> The first story sees Denholm Elliott as a writer of crime stories. He is absorbed in an exciting story about a stranger, even as far as drawing a sketch to help his writing. Shortly afterwards he began to see visions of his own creation. Some excellent direction by Peter Duffell, especially with the choice of camera angles, helps detract from the limited writing. Elliott's performance is wonderful as the plagued writer and he also helps to elevate the story. The story ends with a semi-twist, but I couldn't help getting the sense of writing that didn't allow it to reach its potential. <br /> <br /> The second story sees Peter Cushing in the house. He is a lonely man who is still hurting for a beautiful young woman who once mocked him and who he likes to take a picture of. Cushing's performance really brings this emotional moving story to life. He is assisted by the director who chooses to continually focus on Cushing's loneliness. It is further taken with a huge hallucination scene that helps us see within Cushing's mind. Anyway, Cushing sees a figure at a nearby laundry museum that looks like his girlfriend. Of course, his obsession grows but this seemingly romantic story has a disturbing turn at the end. Joss Ackland plays Cushing's competitor, but his performance is largely overshadowed by late-big Peter Cushing. <br /> <br /> The third story and easily the best watch Christopher Lee - my favorite horror actor of all time - is moving home with his daughter. Mr Lee gives you his perfect ice-cold performances here. He does not show love or attention to his daughter at all. He even brings in a school manager to educate her. The governor, who is played by Nyree Dawn Porter in one of her beautiful performances, tries to figure out what is wrong. Without giving away too much, I can reveal that witchcraft plays a role. Christopher Lee's presence is truly electrifying in every scene in which he is involved. Chloe Franks deserves special recognition for her massive underrated performance as the girl who is easily the creepiest character in the whole movie. The movie is worth seeing even to see just one story. <br /> <br /> The final story is almost completely played for the laugh, but it is absolutely fun and important. Jon Pertwee plays a horror movie actor who moves in the house. He is very dissatisfied with the approach taken by his producers to movies, as everything is so cheap and fake, especially the costumes. That's why he decides to buy an authentic mantle for his latest vampire role. Geoffrey Bayldon has an excellent cameo as a merchant who sells Pertwee an old cloak. When Pertwee offends the mantle, he begins to develop patches and basically transforms into a vampire. Pertwee's performance should be seen as believed. It's really hilarious. Ingrid Pitt is also in this story, but her talent is wasted in a role that had to be much larger. <br /> <br /> The link story ends with a loose connection to the final story. This is especially appropriate because the inspector searched Pertwee and decided to visit the house of course. You can work out the rest for yourself. As weak as the link story, it has a decent but somewhat unintentional comic end. <br /> <br /> I am convinced that the blame for the shortcomings in what a wonderful movie should be, does not lie with Peter Duffell, the director, who really does his best with what he has. I think the script was just too limited and the ambition found in the four later movies is lacking. <br /> <br /> Overall, the house that drank was a must see for fans of the Amicus anthologies, supporters of other Amicus movies or fans of Portmanteau horror movies. If my summary gives the film with enough appeal in your eyes, look it out. You will enjoy it!
