I read the book and saw the movie. Both excellent. The movie is diamond under coals during this period. Liebman and Selby dominate the screen and communicate the intensity of their characters without errors. This film had to make their stars. Scan the studio not to post everything they had behind this movie. It could easily be a franchise. Release on DVD is a must and a worthy remake will revive this movie. Find it in your TV guide and if you see it, no matter how late it is. You won't be disappointed. Do yourself another favor - read the book (same title). It will blow you away. The times have changed dramatically since those days, or at least we think they have.
