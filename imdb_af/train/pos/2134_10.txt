Ernst Lubitsch's contribution to the American cinema is enormous. His legacy is an excellent group of movies that will live forever, such as "The Shop Around the Corner". This film was played in other lesser-known films and a musical play, without the charm or elegance of Mr Lubitsch's own and definite version. <br /> <br /> Margaret Sullavan and James Stewart worked together in several films. Their characters in this movie come out as an example of how to be in a movie without almost appearing to have acted. Both stars are beautiful like the pegs who don't know each other, but whose fate has worked in the same shop in Budapest. <br /> <br /> The reason why these classic movies worked so well is the incredible supporting cast of the studios together in picture to picture. Here we have the wonderful Frank Morgan, who owns the store. Also, we see Joseph Schildkraut, Felix Bressart, William Tracy and Charles Smith among others impressive work to believe us that yes, they are in Budapest. Therefore, these movies will live forever. !
