It was in 1988, when I first saw (the Austrian television) "The Ronnie and Nancy Show". At that time I was a big fan of Spitting Image (since it won the bronze rose of the Montreux Film Festival in 1986). Of course I recorded every show on the tape and watched it again and again - especially "The Ronnie and Nancy Show". I remember that scene when Ronnie was standing in front of a painting of Abraham Lincoln (thinking it was a mirror) and said to himself, "I need a shave". Or most amusing of all, when he played with his dog - but vice versa! <br /> <br /> It is so unfortunate that Spitting Image falls into oblivion; It was one of the most fantastic and intelligent TV shows ever. Compared to other satirical broadcasts, it was definitely the best of all. <br /> <br /> Well, almost 20 years have passed since and I wish I could see the show again. Is it possible to buy it somewhere from someone?
