Alas, the 1970s. A time when it was a swinger. To be honest, today is also a good time to be a swinger, but it just felt more daring. <br /> <br /> Joe Sarno presents a nice, soft soft film. In fact, like today, some of the actors are well-known hardcore actors. Unlike today, these people were good actors and these films had a plot and character development. <br /> <br /> That's pretty much what you'd expect from a swinger's movie. Two couples with open relationships set the wanderlust on fire from one of the women who came for a visit. Not much more about it. <br /> <br /> Of course, if the MILF is Jennifer Welles, it's another story, of course. Not too many 40-somethings look so nice to relax as Mrs. Welles. It's worth seeing the price. Mrs. Welles looks at herself in the mirror as if she is Aphrodite. She's not "Stifler's Mom". She is sexier. <br /> <br /> I also dug Chris Jordan's Anna. Jordan looks and sounds so much like Elaine Joyce that I thought she could be "divorced at birth", twins or even Elaine herself. Anna always eats, but needs incredible metabolism. <br /> <br /> Unlike 1990's soft core porn, 70's softie pores have retained the hardcore film's realism (something that 2000's soft core sometimes brought back, instead of the 90's music and canned orgasms) and that's here in full force. It's not real, but it really does. <br /> <br /> For those who enjoyed the Quebec, they produced "Deux Femmes En Or". Another classic movie only on Drive-In Classics, the best $ 2.50 CAN per month you can spend.
