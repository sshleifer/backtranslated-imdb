"The Lion King" is without a doubt my favorite Disney movie of all time, so I thought I should give the sequel a chance and I did it. Lion King 1 1/2 was pretty good and enjoyed it well with Timon and Pumba. Only problem, I sometimes feel, no explanations are needed, because they can create plot holes and just want the feel of your own explanation. Well, I would highly recommend this movie for lion king fans or just an evening with the family. It's a fun movie with the same sweet and sweet characters as the first. So, hopefully, I will get the same with the third installment for the Lion King series. Sit back and think only Hakuna Matata! That means no worries! <br /> <br /> 8/10
