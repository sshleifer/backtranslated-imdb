Although I agree that this is a good but not a good movie, for many of the reasons other posters mentioned, I still enjoy it. One of the reasons is the music: I want to pay attention to the very powerful look of Candoli brothers - Conte and Pete - in a well-behaved nightclub scene. These guys were two of the best jazz trumpeters of their day and they could play Jimmy Stewart's mind convincingly through a hysterical trumpet duet, one trumpet in each of Stewart's ears. The Candolis also played really well, although I suspect that the real music for that scene is later mentioned by them. I don't know much about George Duning, who gets the credit for the music (except that he worked with more than one event with the Three Stooges), but the biscuits of the Candoli brothers as jazz playing games were a lot good contact.
