Prof. Janos Rukh (Boris Karloff) discovers Radium X - a powerful force used for atomic power. Unfortunately, Rukh is polluted by the Radium and begins to glow in the dark - and his touch causes immediate death. Dr. Felix Benet (Bela Lugosi) develops an antidote - but Rukh is getting angry because of the Radium and the antidote and sets out everything he believed to be breaking him. <br /> <br /> The plot is stupid and the "effects" that Karloff glows in the dark are laughing, but it's still a fun cold. It moves fast, has a good atmosphere (note Rukh's "home" and the movie starts on a dark and rainy night) and Karloff and Lugosi (as always) give good performances. There are also good performances by Franic Drake (as Rukh's wife) and Violet Kemble Cooper (as his mother). So it's good, but just a notch among all the other Karloff / Lugosi movies. The plot is just too far-fetched for me to swallow. Yet I did so. I give it a 7.
