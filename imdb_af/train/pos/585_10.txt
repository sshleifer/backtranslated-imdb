When I saw this movie again, this time I found it infinitely better than the last time I saw it. The play is wonderful. The characters are very clearly drawn. Brad Pitt is just wonderful as the evil boy who is rebels. The other actors and actresses are equally fine in every way. Robert Redford created a wonderful period from the days of the 1920's speakers. The scenery is incredibly beautiful of the mountains and streams of Western Montana. All in all, it is one of the best films made in the 1990s. <br /> <br /> You should see this movie! <br /> <br />
