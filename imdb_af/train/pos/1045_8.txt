Lillian Hellman, one of America's best-known women playwrights, was a missionary woman. Her left views were not well regarded at the time of the country. In her memoir she tells her journey to the then Soviet Union, as she was busy with the so-called successes achieved by the system. "Watch on the Rhine" must have come because of those years. The left wing in America, like all over the world, had a problem with the rise of fascism, not only in Europe but also in Japan. <br /> <br /> "Watch on the Rhine" was a play on Broadway eight months before the Pearl Harbor attack by the Japanese. In it, Mrs. Hellman recalls America's entry into World War II. The adjustment is credited to me. Hellman and Dashiell Hammett, her long-time companion. As shown on the screen of Herman Shumlin, the film was well received when it was presented in 1943. <br /> <br /> We are introduced to the Muller family when the movie opens. They cross the border to the United States of Mexico. They continue to Mrs. Muller's house in Washington, D.C., where her mother, Fanny Farrelly, is a little-known hostess. The Mullers, we realize, flee Europe because of the prosecution there against the opponents of the leading totalitarian regime in Germany. In fact, we thought the Mullers might have been better justified if they were Jewish, fled from a certain extinction. <br /> <br /> We find out that Mr. Muller's terrible time in his native land, as well as in other places, because of his exuberance to condemn Fascim. Little does he know that he is coming to his mother-in-law who is one of the worst exponents of that philosophy. <br /> <br /> The movie offers great acting everywhere. This is a curiosity piece because of Bette Davis' supporting role. Paul Lukas, who repeats his Broadway role, is certainly convincing as Kurt Muller, the upright man who wants to make a better world for himself and his family. Mr. Lukas does a good job of portraying Kurt Muller. He repeated the role that made him a stage luminary on Broadway. <br /> <br /> The other best performance is by Lucile Watson, who plays the family matriarch of this family. . Geraldine Fitzgerald is regarded as Martel de Brancovis, a guest of the Farrellys, married to contemptuous Teck de Brancovis, a Nazi sympathizer, played by George Coulouris. Beulah Bondi, Donald Woods, and the rest of the supporting role give good performances by Mr Shumlin. <br /> <br /> The film should serve as a reminder of the evils of totalitarian rule, no matter where.
