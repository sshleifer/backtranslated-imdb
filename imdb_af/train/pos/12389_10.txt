With the usual running stacking movies to see this Halloween I have already seen, I went to The Sentinel. I hope it can make my horror juices flow again. Remember, I just came back from the Dark Castle remake of "The House on Haunted Hill" - complete and complete crap. Fortunately, "The Sentinel" was my way! In a disturbing story about a model moving in a creepy building in Brooklyn Hights, the movie offers everything I hope to find in a good movie. (1) Campy and fantasy juicy characters, exchanges and dialogue, including hilarious turns by Christopher Walken, Jeff Goldblum and especially Martin Balsam, as an absent professor - (2) Terrible Terror! Not giving away a frame, but there are scenes in this movie that chilled me to my pancreas. (3) Fantastic gore, fantastic make-up and shaky (as very uneven) direction by Michael Winner, which flows pretty well with this unreal treat. If you loved "Evil Dead 2", "Dead Alive" and "Deep Rising" it will be your queen of favorites. Just to emphasize my love for this movie - after watching it for the first time, I hit it back and watched it again. It is now one of the favorites of all time. Do yourself a favor and look it out!
