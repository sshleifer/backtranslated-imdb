TIGERLAND / (2000) *** 1/2 (out of four) <br /> <br /> By Blake French: <br /> <br /> Over the years audiences have seen and understood war movies with every point of see possible, and somehow producers and writers always come up with new and innovative methods to portray different soldiers on the battlefield. Joel Schumacher ("8MM," a time to kill), easily one of the most risky directors currently working, was similar to "The Thin Red Line" in how his new drama, Tigerland, was in an individual soldier's shoes tread. This film, written by Ross Klavan and Michael McGuther, has more guts and irony than "The Thin Red Line" or even "Private Ryan Savings." Although the film's dramatic impact is somewhat diminished due to the perversity of the material present, it is certainly relieved of a new perspective of young men training for the war. <br /> <br /> I want to know Joel Schumacher's experiences with the army. Are the men really so unashamed and cruel? I'm sure some of them are, but the film sees its world of compromise through the eyes of a young man named Roland Bozz (Colin Farrell), who is rebellious against the ideas of the war. His personality immediately goes against several other characters, one being his best friend, Paxton (Matthew Davis) and another, Wilson (Russell Richardson), whose flames often exacerbate Bozz's tension with the idea of ​​going to war. The war depicted in this production is not found on a battlefield, but on training grounds of a Louisiana training camp and concepts and fears of the soldiers in training. This film deals specifically with the preparation for the war, nothing less, nothing less. It ends when the soldiers eventually go into the war, a bit disappointing, as the characters testify in action as a supurb benefit. <br /> <br /> About 28 days in space using 16mm stock and a tiny budget, Joel Schumacher displayed a sharp, perverse, cruel and indifferent atmosphere using hand-cinematography, unique lighting techniques and direct sound. Schumacher's grainy and blasted images make the movie feel like a documentary feature. This unusual style of movie entertainment only contributes to the hard core realism of the movie, very graphic in the use of coarse language, perhaps a little too disturbing. Waves of four-letter words knock the audience, some in shock from what they hear. Even the extreme amount of vulgarism does not hold the dialogue of ruling as well as heartbreaking, true and emotional. <br /> <br /> As something, "Tigerland" gives us a slight appreciation for how much our soldiers are going for our country in the early stages of fighting. Such bravery must take to enter the army during the war, to know the hardships and risks that are being taken. Such thoughtful ideas are made possible by the heartbreaking actions of the young aspiring actors depicting the different pupils. This movie is not for all audiences, but one that young men must watch before entering the army ... and adult audiences have to watch the courage needed to do so. <br /> <br />
