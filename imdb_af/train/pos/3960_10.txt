According to the director, this movie was popular in Asia. It is somewhat difficult to take these Mats Helge movies seriously since most of his films are shot at a very tight budget. Almost no dollar. But it is fascinating to find out that Mats Helge eventually completes something that can be called an action movie. The Ninja Mission is - I think - the best of all movies directed by him. Some special effects are quite nice. This is not a "B" or "C" movie. This is a "Z" movie - but a pleasant and fun "Z" movie!
