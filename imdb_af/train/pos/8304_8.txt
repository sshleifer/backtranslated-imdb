I caught my movie late on a Saturday night / Sunday morning with my brother. We drank. This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Of the 'luxury' ocean liner is actually a 'roll-roll-off' ferry, with cast iron all at the doors with glue stickers' staff, and seeing the same door used for something different in another scene - these movie rocks! ! The continuity is so poor you can't help but see it, it hits you with the holes. In the final scene he jumps from a lifeboat with the ferry in the distance. Cut to his son and a new girl (The ship PR director who knows Kung Fu and was in the police earlier, but was fired to do things on his way - where) on the ferry very quickly away from the blast. ...... Then the father is there to hug them. How ???? Who cares, his magic. There is not one reason for this movie. The casino is the size of a large bedroom with one casino table. If you are chased by the villains, there is only one place to hide, you guessed it. Enter the villains who, instead of going under the One table, continue to shoot four fruit machines and a small corner beam (a corner bar in the casino - fantastic). They walk straight over the only hiding, through which our Casper can get them out and take them out. <br /> <br /> Get some friends, get some drinks, turn this movie on and cry.
