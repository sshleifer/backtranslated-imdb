An incredibly small English movie for so many reasons. First, it is a funny appearance of a Laurence Olivier in a light comedy. While his performance is not the standard he will set as one of the greatest actors of the 20th century, he is utterly credible as the headquarters. This film is historically of great importance because of where and when it was shot. Being English did not have the big budget of Hollywood movies of the same era and it often shows, but more interesting is the fact that this movie was filmed just before the war and showed an England that would soon be gone . If we see it today, we think in terms of modern morality and look at the fact that this movie and its closest American counterpart "It Happened One Night" was in their day like "Fatal Instinct" in our day. But after watching and enjoying this movie for the first time I can't help but I feel sad when I see it today. With half the film shooting before 1950, it's hard to save the remaining movies. Unfortunately, movies like this are often transmitted to save movies that we all consider important. The color shift, the lack of contrast and the generally poor quality of the most viewed are heartbreaking. This movie with 'It Happened One Night' is perfect to curl up with a love under a blanket on a cool, cool evening and watch, or better yet, why not have a dual feature.
