This video has shaken! Eddie is one of the funniest comics I've ever seen. He not only has a class, he makes some of the funniest observations about history and culture I've ever seen. Eddie is the most original and most intelligent cartoon I have seen in a LONG time. Tell all the other stand-ups to get off the stage and let this "executive" rule!
