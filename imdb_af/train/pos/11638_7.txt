I had fun watching Red Eye. It is not a masterpiece, but it is well-directed and structured. Cillian Murphy and Rachel McAdams are in the role. Yes, it's the same old story with another institution, but Wes Craven gave it a good pass. At least not another screaming with the usual college killer. It's great when you see a clean, coherent thriller, even when originality doesn't stand out as its main character. Especially from a filmmaker like Craven who has brought in so many innovative ideas for the thriller and horror genre in the past, and which only allows himself to bring home a good TV movie if it was not released theater no. Good work!
