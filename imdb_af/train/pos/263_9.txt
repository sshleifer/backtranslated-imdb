It was a strong Poirot / Suchet, television puzzle choice. The characters were lively and well-behaved. The plot and the main institution - a student residence - were excellent. Yapp was nothing special, but it didn't matter to me. One important point, many Poirot viewers do not recognize good acting or good characterization. I also think they are pretty hard in their judgments of some of the Poirot mysteries. Finally, I read little Christie novels - no one in the past year - and find it annoying that so many viewers are upset about the changes from the novel. Please, viewers, see what you are filming and not what you think there should be. It says that the Poirot secrets are of a different quality, but not as many as judges and reviewers will believe you. With the exceptional exception of The Five Little Pigs, which was wonderful in plot, character and theme, the longer Poirot movies are not as good or bad. For the record I saw all the longer Poirot / Suchet movies. Lastly, movies without lemon, Hastings, and / or Yapp are not good or bad because of their absence. However, that presence is striking (almost always with Japp) or irrelevant with Hastings. Lemon is in the middle.
