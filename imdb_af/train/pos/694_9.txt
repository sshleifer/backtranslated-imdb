An Insomniac's Nightmare is the story of a man's dive into madness. With chronic Insomnia, Jack is harassed by hallucinations; This causes him to try to determine what is real and what is not. <br /> <br /> We find interesting things about Jack near the end, and think that by the time the movie is over, we'll end up with a "Happy First after Hollywood." Wrong. the place where no one sleeps. <br /> <br /> Tess Nanavati (Author and Director) made herself a good movie in an Insomniac's Nightmare, a talented filmmaker and writer (she made this movie after her Graduation High School ), she has real potential and will be one that will be in the coming future. <br /> <br /> While watching this short movie, I was constantly uncomfortable, between music, dark landscapes and realistic depiction of an insomniac by Dominic Monaghan (as Jack), I desperately wanted to turn it off to just escape from it.
