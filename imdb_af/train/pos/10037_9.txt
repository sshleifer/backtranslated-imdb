The ship might have sunk, but the movie didn't! Director James Cameron of The Terminator did this again with this wonderful picture. One of my favorite scenes is 'The Dinner Table' scene in which Rose's family and friends meet Jack after saving her. Rose has a look at her face that every woman should have when you meet "THE ONE". I hope I have that look when I'm with my future husband in the room. <br /> <br /> Jack and Rose have a connection that is 'MOVIE STUFF', but it's good movie. We have captured the greedy mother and all of her elite associates who live up to their husbands' wealth. Rose almost committed suicide, but the Gilbert Grape star rescues her. I really like the hang of the boat scene. It was a good risk. <br /> <br /> The movie is long but it's fantastic !!! Good story, good flow, good actors !!! Go see it twice as you like, it's worth it !!!
