Cliffhanger is apparently to be Slyvester Stallone's last action film before becoming such an underrated actor. It's about a mountaineer who has to help his friend after being held hostage by mercenaries who want them to get three suitcases carrying over $ 100 million. It has a good action sequence, the edge of your seat and a good time at the movies.
