I saw the movie recently at the Boston Film Festival. The movie was very entertaining and is something I believe in the world, and black America is ready to see. It has comedy, drama, the soundtrack is great. It's a good movie. The characters were well-developed, and the film has a wide variety of prominent actors, such as Wood Harris (Remember the Titains, Full Pay), Brian J. White (Trois 3, 3000) and the wonderful Zoe Saldana (Drumline, Pirates of the Caribbean). In a short time, the movie deals with many relevant topics in contemporary society and does so with class and grace. It's not just a story about life in hospital, but it's a story about people and their personal journey to discover who they are or who they're going to be.
