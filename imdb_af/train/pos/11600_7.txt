William Hurt may no longer be an American matinee idol, but he still has good taste in B film projects. Here he plays a specialist in the disposal of hazardous waste, with a tragic passing of a perennial loser - detected by the former beautiful boy Weller - who is infected with a deadly poison. Current beautiful boy Hardy Kruger Jr - possibly more attractive than his father - appears as Weller's arrogant boss in a horrific order at a chemical production plant that makes the story move. Natasha McElhone is a slightly wacky government agent who looks at the incident that inevitably and high-offended love interest for the hero Hurt. Michael Brandon appears on a slimy victim who can't wait. The Coca-Cola company wins the 2000 Product Placement Award, as the soft drink is exhibited during production, which has been lovingly shot in place in a wintry picture postcard Hungary.
