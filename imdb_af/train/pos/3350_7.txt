I can't remember seeing this one before tonight, probably the title sounds so ordinary that it overtakes me. But it is a well-crafted Western, with an interesting devastating storyline that is complimented by an exciting turn of good to corny. <br /> <br /> Robert Mitchum jumps into a wide open village looking for his wife's and her daughter's news, and remains a town-tamer for a while. As usual, the good business people have mixed feelings - they want to get rid of the bad things, but like the business they bring. It still holds true: relaxes drinking and gambling laws and encourages industry, but pretends to regret the seedy effects it can have on ordinary people. What is fascinating about this film is Mitchum's cynical intense depiction in cleaning up the city of bad things, and the residents' acceptance that his violent methods were the only one. Favorite bit: the sudden downfall of 2 of the bad things in the Red Dog Salon. Shooting off the main salon was nasty, but it was an effective way to combat the spread of poison. <br /> <br /> Overall a very good movie with its only fault that tends to be a little stuffy - not so good. For Do-Gooders who probably prefer a lifetime of negotiation with evil rather than ending it.
