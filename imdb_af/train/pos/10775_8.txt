Nice movie with a good soundtrack stretching through the rocky landscape of the 70s and 80s. Radiofreccia describes a generation, it describes life in a small town near Correggio (hometown of Ligabue, the singer who wrote the book that inspired the film). It describes the lives of young people and their problems with the world. It reminds of Trainspotting, with a little Italian touch.
