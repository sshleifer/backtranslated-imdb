I saw this movie at a time when I was playing with the idea of ​​moving into my own apartment and starting my own life. Maybe that's why I took it so seriously. I totally believed in the bad character's psychological decline in a Paris of eternal construction sites, dust, squalor, selfishness, rudeness, malice and decay. I give Polanski's art in his direction, his play and his inevitable script, but I died during the terrible final scene and had to be revived by cognac in the office of the theater's manager. Fortunately for me my life on my own has not worked out as disastrously as this so far, but I have always had a great respect for an artist who can perform such illusions and so completely immerse in the (false) reality he tries to transfer. Simply put, the man is a genius of first order and a credit to mankind. This movie is the sum of many, many cases of great acting and good casting. As some performances were done in English (the screens with Shelley Winters and Melvyn Douglas among others) and others in French (with most other characters) and Polanski did his own dubbing in English and French, I strongly encourage you if you is bilingual, to switch the sound of French to English and vice versa, during the appropriate scenes while watching the beautiful transfer on Paramount DVD. This film is part of Polanski's so-called "apartment trilogy" which also includes "Repulsion" and "Rosemary's Baby". Unfortunately, "Repulsion" hasn't made it into a decent DVD transfer in region 1 yet. Needless to say, the three movies will make a great boxing set.
