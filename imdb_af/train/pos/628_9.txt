This movie is great fun. However, the actors really make the movie the distance. Without giving away the plot, I will describe it as a new Princess bridal cult lover who has to stand the test of time. You get a very different side for Robert DeNiro in this movie! All the elements are from adventure to romance, and well-placed comedy. <br /> <br /> People of all ages will enjoy it. (My parents even did!) Good special effects can be scary for the little ones. Good date movie. Great for a little escape. <br /> <br /> Earn an A. (Hope it does well at the box office)
