No award show can please all the people. Clearly, if your favorite movies didn't win, you'd say the show wasn't very good. This is understandable. <br /> <br /> However, the 74th Annual Academy Awards will be remembered for one magical moment of Hollywood history: <br /> <br /> Woody Allen's first ever appearance at the Academy Awards. <Br /> <br /> Frequently, Allen has avoided the awards as self-sufficient and useless and has never attended - although he has won several of the prestigious awards. <br /> <br /> When the 74th Academy Awards were awarded, the people still mourned the loss of life in the collapse of the World Trade Centers in New York. When it came time to pay tribute to the city of New York, they decided to show a video of the big movie moments of the city cities. Then the announcer simply said: <br /> <br /> "Ladies and gentlemen, Oscar-winning director Woody Allen." <br /> <br /> The place erupted in a very long ovation. The entertainment industry must eventually give their applause to the New York Man, who usually avoids the Hollywood scene. When the applause died, Woody applied some of his legendary whites to the situation. <br /> <br /> NEW HIGHLIGHTS: <br /> <br /> "Thank you - it makes the comic book." <br /> <br /> "I thought they wanted their Oscars back," he said. joked. "I was panicked because the pawnshop was out of business for centuries and I couldn't find anything." <br /> <br /> "But it wasn't. I couldn't work it out because my movie wasn't nominated for any year. Then it hit me - maybe they asked to apologize." <br / > <br /> Allen also announced why he had overlooked his lifelong Oscar aversion for this one special night. /> "For New York City, I'd do anything. Then I got my tux and found it here," Allen said. <br /> <br /> "It's a wonderful movie village. It was a fantastic, moving and exciting movie backdrop and it remains a wonderful city." <br /> <br />
