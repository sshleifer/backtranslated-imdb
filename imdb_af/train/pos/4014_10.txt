Spoiler for anyone lucky enough to ever see this movie (it's not really spoiler). Watched this movie when it was released and can still remember parts of it. It is all in a small town in the west or left over from the village. It looks more like a ghost town with few inhabitants. Among them is a couple, where the woman is particularly angry. She let her husband die in the end of the film and left the village, but had to cross the desert. We never know what is happening to her, but just before she shoots her dying man and deliberately does not hit her. She is not aware that she will be very thirsty. Mark Damon killed a few bad guys in a funny shepherd's house - but that's another story I don't remember too well. The remaining impression of the film was that it was one of the first time that I saw a very bad woman on the film, pretending to be nothing but bad - can't be compared to the witch in "Snowwhite" not, which in comparison is easy to find out. Very strict western with few main characters and still absorbing.
