It's funny how your life can change in a second ... Attending the Waterdance for the first time was an unforgettable experience. The way you need to get used to a new way of life can look scary. Seeing there are other people going through a similar situation can help you continue. <br /> <br /> Eric Stoltz's performances and mainly of Helen Hunt (oh man !, Helen is the purest and graceful woman in the earth ...) are wonderful, Wesley Snipes also surprises in one of your last serious roles . A movie simply and at the same time deep, let's not leave indifferently with the message being conveyed: enjoy every moment of your life ... <br /> <br /> Really a movie like the one hour not attended !!! (sorry, this is a Brazilian expression ...).
