Unlike the general belief, this title, at least for me, is not so bad. In reality. I consider it a favorite movie of all time. Welding stories is not too well structured if you consider the differences between the series, but in spite of this you can see it very happily. For a feature film of his day, the screens are well proportioned and the characters remain consistently credible. <br /> <br /> The sound / soundtrack is my personal favorite. Almost everything has a correct sound effect and many of the voices fit the characters much better than their now bad American dub counterparts. The synchronization is perfect in every shot. I had some problems with the cast for the 'strange' voices (please forgive the rough name, it's been a while since I saw it). Otherwise, the exhibition looks completely balanced. I feel and believe in the characters of this movie. Dubs is often a topic I rarely agree with so long ago. I love the OSDs from then on, but the castings often leave the series off. <br /> <br /> At this point I would like to add that it was one of the first anime I saw in my life. It has historical value to me, but even after seeing the original Megazone 23, it remained stronger and looked more in my collection. <br /> <br /> I think the title has ever made it in Texas in Texas. Personally, I think it's a great shame. If the right audience was subjected to it, I think Robotech the Movie would have been accepted and not become slandered over the years. I am involved in anime every day in my life and everyone I showed this movie thought it was a beautifully composed title. <br /> <br /> Watching the movie after its separate components will allow the viewer to notice the clear plot. holes between shows. But without seeing the original, a viewer wouldn't really see it. Since the animation is identical in style, there was no reason to question it in his day. The UK had very limited access to anime. Laser discs were the most productive media. Personally, I like the way Carl had the balls to at least print the genre. I mean, Harmony won't pay the cash for the series to become known. <br /> <br /> Despite the few fussy mistakes people had with this movie, the eighties of mine fell in love with it. Looking now at Megazone 23, after its original Japanese sound, or the new dub, I believe you'll be very disappointed with the OSD. Return your mind to the original Bubblegum Crisis Dub soundtrack and think of the eighties sound to E.V.E. <br /> <br /> Say it all. The movie's popularity nowadays is likely to be on the open market. Personally, it has created a collection for me. I now sand the world for goods from the three components that made it up. If I ever meet Carl Macek, shake his hand for the trouble and buy him a pint or a crate to get my anime.
