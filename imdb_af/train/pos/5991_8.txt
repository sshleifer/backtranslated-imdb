A sequel to Angels with Dirty Faces in name only, the Angels Wash Their Faces suffer somewhat from the regular Shenanigans of the Dead End Kids. In fact, with the presence of the Dead End Kids and Ann Sheridan, it had to be seen as a real succession of Angels with Dirty Faces, at least for continuity. <br /> <br /> Talking of Ann Sheridan, she is the one true shining light of this movie. To paraphrase a clich√©, Ann Sheridan can read from a phone book for two hours and I will buy the DVD! <br /> <br /> Another virtue of this movie is the chemistry between Ann Sheridan and Ronald Reagan. Unfortunately, this aspect of the movie is kept too far in the background. For a better example of the Sheridan-Reagan duo, I would recommend Juke Girl or Kings Row.
