This film shows artificial movie techniques, rather than a landscape that captures the attention of the camera. These are small details in how someone appears, how the woman might wear a sundowner and wrapped in a skin. How the man can wear a hat and socks and shoes and underwear and both look so comfortable and comfortable. How challenging the woman is is another feature of the tabletop that the director prefers to let us know that she is sexually sexual and for the purpose of enjoying the pleasure she is looking for without directly or with a particular sensitivity to what the man may feel. The relationship between the woman and the man is unique. It's an open one in which she doesn't give back anything, doesn't feel sorry for how she behaved and wants to share these facts with him because her primary focus is always on the fact of their marriage. Nothing and no one can come between them. Only the chances of the fate can intervene --- his imprisonment during the war and what follows after his return. A very intriguing film that absorbs completely.
