Sudden Impact is the 4th of the Dirty Harry movies and one of the best features of these films is that they do not really degrade from one movie to another. So, Sudden Impact offers another thrill ride through the life of Dirty Harry Callahan. This time Harry is trying to solve a series of murders while on vacation. Harry always stays at work. Clint Eastwood plays Harry as he plays all his men, slow, deliberately and without fear. As the first of the Dirty Harry films made in the 80s, Sudden Impact lacks some of the 70's that feature the first three films. This does not mean that its quality is less. Bottom Line: Soon with intensity and action, Sudden Impact is another worthy addition to the Dirty Harry series.
