Polanski returns to the themes of loneliness and insanity he has explored to such a tremendous effect in Repulsion and Rosemary's Baby, in the tenant. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere is brand Polanski - dark, breeding, unpleasant - but there is something uncomfortable about this movie and I'm not sure whether it is deliberate or not. <br /> <br /> Sven Nykvist, who was responsible for some of Bergman's most beautiful films, doesn't really do it here. Since his name was one of the things that really attracted me to this movie, I was a little disappointed with how few cases of truly impressive cinematography in the film are. <br /> <br /> The only thing that really makes the movie off is the play. Polanski is definitely not a bad actor, but he seems to have bitten more than he can chew on the difficult role of Trelkovsky. Some of the supporting role players are big, especially Melvyn Douglas as the landlord and Shelley Winters as the porter, but others are poor and lackluster. It is also difficult to overlook the fact that all these so-called Paris have American accents. <br /> <br /> There are quite a few moments of dark comedy in the movie. Anyone who has seen The Fearless Vampire Killers knows Polanski is definitely a good comic actor. However, there are moments when it is dangerously close to being a parody of himself. Trelkovsky's sudden (and somewhat unexplained) 'transformation' is more likely to raise giggles than eyebrows, detracting from what a powerful moment in his psychodramatic journey had to be. <br /> <br /> All in all, The Tenant is a pleasant and intriguing experience, if it is a little too small for its own. There are a handful of extremely cold moments and a consistently uncomfortable and prosperous atmosphere, but this movie, while very good, doesn't succeed as well as it can have. <br /> <br /> At the end of the day, an 'okay' Polanski movie is even better than most other 'good' movies. Definitely worth a watch, don't expect to be blown away.
