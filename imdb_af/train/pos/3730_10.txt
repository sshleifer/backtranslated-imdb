If you want to see a movie and feel good to watch, Tigerland is the movie for you. I like this movie from top to bottom. This movie's picture-perfect scenes look so real; it is almost like a documentary of something that happened in real life, but with drama. Son, I tell you ... Actual drama they actually actually "fought" in one of the screens (let the DVD listen to the comment, it's not obvious). I see this movie as a bunch of desperate young men trying to escape a fatal destination. Having occupied Private Ryan, I appreciate what a bad lot is and know exactly how the men feel in the movie. . I see this movie as a crossbreed between 'Stand By Me' and 'Private Private Ryan'. What do men do when dealing with a situation that is difficult to live in real life? Some men are mad, some men cry, some men by fists, other drugs, some random sleep with hookers who relentlessly try to eradicate the meaning of love out of their lives, some trying to drink the pain, some jumping from buildings or bridges, some feel guilty and others feel so much pain that they are so sick they are physically falling. This movie rolled all the desperate emotions into one ball. But don't get me wrong, it's not a depressing movie, it's realistic, it's a very humorous movie, the crazy and funny Bozz (Collin's Character) puts it all up. In addition, there are about 5 female actresses in the movie. ; I'll let you find out what they're in! With dialogue, war / action sequences, picture perfect scenes with appropriate music; This movie has everything, as I said, from top to bottom. I don't know why Tigerland is being heavily credited. The best thing about owning the movie is the cover, it says in great boldness "The best movie of the year," and it does not matter. Keep the rare gems in Hollywood, 10/10.
