This movie is one that I highly recommend. It's about a boy, Stanley Yelnats (Shia LeBeouf) who was wrongly convicted of a crime and sent to Camp Green Lake, a boy's detention center. There he is forced to dig holes 5 meters deep and 5 feet in diameter. As he meets there, he meets the other sons of the camp (Zero, Magnet, Armhol, Squid, X-Ray, and ZigZag). Everyone is digging, not building charactor, but banning Kate Barlow's treasure. Through the film (and book), Stanley learns more about the past, more about himself, and more about digging holes. I give this movie a 9.5 because I'm very picky when it comes to books on movies (I want the movie to actually follow the book). But still it did really well.
