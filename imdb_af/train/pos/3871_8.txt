Esther Kahn is a young Jewish woman living in an overcrowded, Jewish ghetto in the 19th century England. She is surrounded by threatening, oppressive, arid, debauchery, worn-out brick architecture, narrow sidewalks and streets, darkened windows and hordes of black and brown jackets. <br /> <br /> She lives in a small apartment with her large family who runs a clothing store in the apartment. As a child she worked, had no privacy, wore colorless clothes, shared a bed, and remained silent to prevent the mockery of her mother and brothers and sisters who had plagued her from mocking them. <br /> <br /> As a young woman, her life remains the same - she has no privacy, lives in a state of spiritual and physical hate and lethargy and inertia, pushing an empty, featureless expression, is dressed in ordinary, unbeatable clothes and constantly suppressed and dwarfed by the gray, everyday, massive imposing buildings and narrow streets, narrow corridors, narrow doors and her noisy mother and brothers and sisters and her family's prose, banal lifestyle. <br /> <br /> Her only form of spiritual escape is the Yiddish theater. Sit in the balcony, front row, lean over the track, there is a great space between her mind and stage, a space that allows her to breathe, think, feel and desire. <br /> <br /> Despite the open-minded freedom of thought, Esther, her face and body remain uncomfortable, petty and indifferent. <br /> <br /> The usual and common-looking summer Phoenix carries brilliantly Esther's emotional attitude - Summer / Esther does not desire any desire or expectation. <br /> <br /> After an unusual explosive confrontation with her mother, Esther finally decided to break out of the dark life in which she was trapped. <br /> <br /> Eventually she is played in small pieces in a few stages, and meets Nathan Quellen, portrayed by the distinctive British actor Ian Holm, who begins to teach Esther the technical skill of acting. <br /> <br /> From this point forward, Esther begins a disturbing double journey to learn how to act and learn how to feel. <br /> <She begins with the experience of emotions she never felt before, and she begins with the experience she needs to fully understand the technical aspects of acting. <br /> <br /> Nathan walks over the stage through the physical and emotional steps of surprise, hesitation, anger, aversion, self-rejection, etc .; she then begins to walk through the emotions in her personal life. <br /> <br /> There are three truths, Nathan tells her - the truth of how a character responds, the truth of how the actor will respond and the truth that a character and actor is not the same person. <br /> <br /> These technical steps and three truths slowly analyze Esther's defense and lead her to two uplifting experiences in the unblocking of the movie that sparked her freedom of thought, movement and emotion. Esther Kahn is a technically challenging movie to watch because of his strange and narrow camera shots, a slender photo-direction that shows the realistic, cowardly setting of the Ghetto, and Summer Phoenix's characterless and unceasing and unattractive depiction of Kahn give spiritual and physical habits and listlessness and uncertainty. <br /> <br /> A Must-See movie for people who want to learn the technical craft of acting, and for those who appreciate minimalism. alms and character studies.
