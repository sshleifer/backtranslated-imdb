It was Keaton's first feature and is in fact three shorts set in different times (Stone Age, Roman Time, Modern Age) on the eternal triangle of romance. The stories parallel to each other as in Griffith's INTOLERANCE, which it seeks to satirize. The strength of the jokes and gags almost all rely on anachronisms, which bring contemporary business to ancient institutions. <br /> <br /> **** WARNING - SPOILERS FOLLOW TO STAY BEST POINTS ****** <br /> <br /> Here are the classic moments: <br /> <br /> Use a tortoise as a woe giving advice (Stone Age); A wristwatch with a sun switch (Roman Era); A wagon with a spare wheel (Roman century); Using a helmet as a band lock (Roman age); Early golf with clubs and rocks (Stone Age); Note that a will is cut out in a rock (Stone Age); The changing weather forecaster (Roman age); The carriage ride in the snow - Use skis and huskies with an extra dog in the wagon's boat (Roman period). The above are all throw away ties we like. However, there are also memorable moments: <br /> <br /> Buster takes out shearing gear to adjust the girl's make-up; The fantastic double takes when an unashamed Buster looks at his plate to find a crab that stares at him (within one second he jumped up from his seat to his chair and back into the arms of the waiter jumped - one of the funniest moments I've ever seen). And the lion - the manicure - just brilliant. <br /> <br /> There is also a variety of racism when four African-American littermates abandon their mistress for a Roman crap game. <br /> <br /> Kino's print is a bit vague and contains numerous sequences of both nitrate and film damage - most likely at the end of the roll. The Metro feature is played with piano and whistle and grievously borrows from Grieg. <br /> <br /> Very fun and full of laughter.
