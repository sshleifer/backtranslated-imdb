William H. Macy is here in his most sympathetic and compelling way as a hit and loving father who wants to leave the family business without hurting his excessive parents. Treads much of the same area as TVs "The Sopranos" in terms of the mid-life crisis of a criminal theme (here too he visits a shrink), but it is still worth looking at, thanks to a stiff direction of Brommel (I look forward to what this man is doing next), an excellent script, and all around great performances. Macy is excellent as always. It's probably his best role since "Fargo." Donald Sutherland is at his best as the dominant father. Tracy Ullman gives a surprisingly sounding dramatic turn as Macy's wife. Young David Dorfman is excellent as Macy's bright and sensitive son (many of his lines sound ad-libbed and are wonderful). Even Neve Campell (who I usually find horrible) is compelling as the upset young woman who catches Macy's eye. All of this is underlined by a moving count and a sharp fit that leads to a predictable yet powerful climax and meaningful and gripping aftermath. This movie deserves a much greater release, as I suspect it would be associated with audiences.
