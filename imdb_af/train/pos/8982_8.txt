Damn, it was a lot to take. I was thinking right through the door. It was pretty perfect, although I would say the editing was a lot to do with it. I can't believe this man stayed on good terms with many of them (especially Anton) to get all this stuff without any serious ... beef. The Dandy's came from benevolent, middle-class children who benefited from their situation (and rightly so!). I felt bad for Jonestown and especially for Anton, who might not have been so many other people felt. Great filmmaking and good choice of subject (s). I recommend it to any music / movie fan. You will probably learn something about making movies.
