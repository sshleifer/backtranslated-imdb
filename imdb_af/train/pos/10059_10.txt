This movie is the best movie ever. I can't remember the last time a movie pulled tears from me. With a tear in my eye, I admire this movie. It has all the elements that a good movie should have: Excellent Dialogues, Music, Acting, Story / Plot. A story of friendship, courage, kindness, and loyalty between a street best known for The King of Masks and a little girl sold as a boy in Serf Bazaar. Little daughter wanted to be his granddaughter and King of Masks had a grandson. They weren't conventional in real life. Every scene they were together was invaluable. The camera work is flawless and grabs you. The acting is inspired. Xu Zhu was excellent as the king of masks. Renishing Zhou "Doggie" looks beautiful and plays her character very well. Zhigang Zhao and Liang Sao Lang were wonderful. He played his friendly and friendly character very well. If you don't have this movie, try it once, do it.
