Although I like EE "Doc" holding Smith's books and David A. Kyle's books by Lensman, the anime, which is loosely based on the books, is quite a fun and somewhat innovative fair. <br /> <br /> Although the story may seem familiar to Sci-Fi / Fantasy buffs, such as a child on an isolated planet, experiencing mystical powers and leaving the death of his family, this is quite a entertaining one. Plus, Lensman was the first Animated motion picture to use hand-drawn and CG animation all at once. Sure, it may look a bit outdated now, but it's still an innovation. If it wasn't for Lensman, nothing of it would ever have happened (personally, I think the computer graphics look better in animation that works directly.) <br /> <br /> Bad, they just have it on DVD / VCD in a few countries in the world (mostly on formats that are very strange and different). I just want them to release the Lensman movie and TV series on DVD / VCD in every part of the world, not just some parts. <br /> <br /> P.S. Create rules! I just think he is so amazing and neat.
