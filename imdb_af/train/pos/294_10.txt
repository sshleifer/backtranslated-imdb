A critical and financial flop when first released, the critics turned around and said that this film was the best of the director. A La Ronde feeling for the film quickly develops like the guys of a detective agency (Ben Gazzara, John Ritter and Blaine Novak) press, fall in love with some of the most beautiful and beautiful women on film (Audrey Hepburn, Colleen Camp, Dorothy Stratten and Patti Hansen). Many of the essays were written on the day of ad-libbed or re-written, giving the film a broad sense. Ben Gazzara is excellent as the lead detective Audrey Hepburn persists after dropping singer Colleen Camp and saw taxi driver Patti Hansen on the side. John Ritter unexpectedly follows Dorothy Stratten and immediately falls in love with her. Blaine Novak has some girls he chases (including Joyce Hyser and Elizabeth Pena). This movie has some good performances by a supurb cast. Standouts are Audrey Hepburn (she doesn't have a line in the first half of the movie). Ben Gazzara has never been better (and an inspiring choice for a romantic lead) and Colleen Camp has one of her best roles as manic country singer Christy Miller. She is a pleasure to watch as she fires off her lines in a gear-a-tat-tat delivery. Highly recommended! ********* stars!
