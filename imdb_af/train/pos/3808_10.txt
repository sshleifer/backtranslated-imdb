I voted it a 10 out of 10, simply because it is the best animated story I could see in some time. The animation is stunning. The artwork behind each landscape was beautiful. From the colors to the lighting to the non-standard price of artwork. I was surprised. Moving past the beauty of the screen, you are immersed in a storyline that is timeless and fresh in the same instant. Character development is short but these tangent moments are exactly what is needed to inform the viewer of what and why and how the character to where they stand. I'm impressed with the whole thing and think it's a must for the whole family.
