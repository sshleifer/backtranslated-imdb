This installment makes the CIA much like a very foolish organization. In fact, maybe they are. The way the plot goes about this looks much like one man has the power to kill sanctions, including his own people, to kill Jason Bourne. Matt Damon does a lot of credible work as Bourne tries to stay one step before the entire movie is murdered. He still tries to remember who he was and how he got where he was. He gets help from a few people and every minute of the movie looks like someone is trying to kill him. <br /> <br /> There is little time for rest in this movie and the action series look very real. There are many pursuits filmed with the shaky cam that somehow adds to realism and it looks less Hollywood than many pictures. These sequences sense realism in the movie. <br /> <br /> The tension in some of the sequences is done brilliantly when you wonder if someone is going to die or if Bourne can kick them off. This is the kind of tension you will see when you want to be entertained. I'm sure this one will lead to the next movie in the series.
