Firstly, I would like to make a correction on another review of this film that said the last musical to win the Best Picture Oscar was "Gigi" in 1958. This is wrong information as 'West Side Story' what won in 1962, 'My Fair Lady' won in 1965 and 'Sound of Music' won the following year. That said, this movie is absolutely fantastic! The story from the novel has changed somewhat, but it is more because of the limitations they had at one stage, which they just didn't change for a filmed version. But I don't care. In fact, I think the whole production is rather better than the novel does. I love Nancy bringing Oliver to the bridge and being killed there instead of later in the apartment. The subtle things in this movie are those that make me laugh. I love the moment Mr. Bumble and Mrs. Bumble starts at the beginning of the governor's office. The underline for that moment is brilliant. My three favorite actors for this movie were Jack Wild, who plays the best Dodger in any movie version of the story, Ron Moody, a playful and humorous Fagin (this character is much better worked out than he is in the book) and Shani Wales, who is the strongest, most distressed version of Nancy. The only reason I give this movie a 9 instead of a 10 is because of the two big production numbers that are 'Concider Yourself' and 'Who Will Buy'. I always hate when the choreography in musicals looks like people who do daily tasks and work. It looks terrible and cheesy, especially when they dance at the London Meat Co. They only had to do regular choreography for these scenes. However, this film is a rare treasure that lives with us forever.
