I only saw it on a German TV channel in 1975 and was immediately addicted, then I watched this movie about 12 times in the theater and nowadays I have a video tape that I watch at least once a year. This movie is excellent in every respect (direction, acting, cutting, musical score ...). The sets are outstanding and very impressive. The idea of ​​a devastating world war that began in the late 1930s is like a 1936 film prophecy. Everytown's dictator is pure Mussolini and Raymond Massey is just charming, credible and ideally cast as "the hero". The positive tone of technology and advancement is quite refreshing by today's pessimistic standards - especially the rounding scene that always brings a tear or two into my eyes even after watching the film. <br /> <br /> This movie is good on TV, but it is made for the big screen, so if you have the opportunity to see it in a theater. please, this is overwhelming.
