Soapdish may be one of the most underestimate films ever made. <br /> <br /> A star, unselfish throw that understands exactly where the movie goes and the roles they played in it. While everyone was heaping it, there was no one-man business. Kline showed white and physical comedy, Goldberg and Downey knew how to make a funny conversation while someone else was talking. I can only go on. <br /> <br /> Don't assist this movie!
