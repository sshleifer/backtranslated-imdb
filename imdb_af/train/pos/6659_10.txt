It is difficult to make a movie on Gandhi in India, in which he is not shown as a man who could not do wrong. This movie shows how a Mahatma was not a decent father (at least in his son's eyes). <br /> <br /> The performances are fantastic, the cinematography is fantastic, the direction fantastic, but the movie is dragging. If the intention was to make this movie without any expectations of the box, which I assume is the case here, then this is a brilliant effort, but if the manufacturers expect it to be a commercial success, the movie is Its fate was doomed to the day they picked this box. <br /> <br /> 20 years from now, this movie will be remembered. for the brilliant portrayal of Harilal by Akshaye Khanna. He deserves an Oscar nomination for this one. And honestly, she's not the only show worth it. Shefali Chhaya is also fantastic. <br /> <br /> Look at the scene where Harilal hears about his father's death. No dialogues, no screams, but a speechless shot by Khanna. This is one of the best scenes ever shot in the history of the Cinema. <br /> <br /> Gandhi, My Father is not at all an exciting cinema but yes, his excellent cinema and a must-see.
