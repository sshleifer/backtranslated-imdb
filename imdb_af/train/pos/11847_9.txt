The horse is indeed a good animal. Picturesque images of wild horses and their grace could never be more majestic in an animation movie. <br /> <br /> The animation is simply wonderful. The fine animation forms the backbone of the beauty that decorates the horses over the movie. More so when the stallions move through different sites, they jump over cliffs and rough waters. <br /> <br /> Soundtrack is also very impressive. The wonderful instrumental music attracts you to appreciate the movie. <br /> <br /> "They say the story of the west is written of the horse's ward." Huh? Well, the story of a fine horse is probably written from the ward of the west. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie is clearly up there with the best. This is one of the best animation movies I've watched. Will be a great choice on a lonely night. An easy 9/10.
