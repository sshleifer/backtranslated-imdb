Wow. Something of a surprise. Although incorrect, it is much better than I expected. <br /> <br /> The brand new spacecraft Arcturus with about 3,000 passengers is in the last days of its sixteen-day trip to Jupiter. Without warning, the ship's Cerebral (central computer) sounds a disaster alarm and commands everyone to evacuate. <br /> <br /> Soon there are only a handful of people, including one of the ship judges (Penny), the captain (Cary) and the director of the shipping line (Kenyon). <br /> <br /> It seems that the alarm was untrue and that the main cerebrals <br /> <br /> act illegally. The remaining passengers and crew have to escape the ship and <br /> <br /> avoid personal conflicts to survive. <br /> <br /> The movie is starting very well. The opening commercial is a very nice contact. There are clear parallels until 2001: a Space Odyssey and the historic <br /> <br /> sink of the Titanic. The movie sometimes slows down and has pacing <br /> problems, but is generally well made and well behaved.
