It was a top-notch movie with a top-notch cast. Danny Glover, Tony Danza, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and especially Christopher Lloyed, are well-cast in this beautiful movie about the real angels helping the English baseball team. You never know it can happen. I loved Lloyd's role in it. He was hilarious. The story is about how to turn your life around, as the child's faith in angels helped to turn evil, hardened, and embittered manager Glover into people's best. The movie is well made and also to see the best in people and to reach your dreams. It was funny, beautiful, touching and sad, everything was done very well. You will love it (or love). I guarantee. <br /> <br /> *** from ****
