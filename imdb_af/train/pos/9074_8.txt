The show is really funny. Nice theme. Jokes and a linen are really good. With a little extra tuning it can be a very popular show. But the only major negative point of this show is the cast. David Spade does a good job as Russell, Megyn Price does a good job. But what hell threw Patrick Warburton, Oliver Hudson and Bianca Kajlich. <br /> <br /> Technically Russell and Jeff are the main characters of the show, who want viewers to watch the show. Russell is a playboy and Jeff is a kind of frustrated relative, Wiz ... with an experience of all the problems a married couple experiences in a relationship. <br /> <br /> Patrick Warburton - doing a horrible job like Jeff, he's not at all suited to the role. He is like a robot, literally there is no punch in his dialogue. <br /> <br /> Cast is actually very important for viewers to satisfy it. The bad play will definitely take the show down ...
