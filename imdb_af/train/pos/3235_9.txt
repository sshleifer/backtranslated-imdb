Excellent movie, a realistic picture of contemporary Finland, touching and deep. One of the best Finnish movies ever made. Capture everyday life in a small town in central Finland, people's desires and weaknesses, joys and sorrows. The bright early autumn sunshine creates a cool atmosphere for this clear investigation of people in a welfare community. Lampela is indeed one of the most promising Finnish filmmakers. He shows that it is possible to make grim movies without machine guns and bloodshed. His next film Eila is also worth seeing, although the story of cleaning women fighting their jobs is not as universally attractive as the destinations in Joki.
