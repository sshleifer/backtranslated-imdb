I look at this page, and it doesn't look good to listen to someone running to a real classic. Certainly, I agree to make everyone feel, but here are mine: <br /> <br /> This movie should not be missed by a classic horror watcher and should be seen as many casual viewers around the world. Certainly, it has lost a flair and greatness with age, especially in today's world of CGI effects, but that's not why you want it. <br /> <br /> You should love it because it's actually a scary movie, even for today's standards. It's total ellyness will crawl you as much as the original audiences, so don't grind a classic if you haven't given it a chance. Look at it, but not with a critical attitude. See how to have fun, how it was originally meant.
