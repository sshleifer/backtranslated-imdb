It is a true story of an Australian couple being charged with murder when their baby child disappears. Meryl Streep is excellent, as always, and manages our interest although she plays a character that is not very similar. <br /> <br /> The media frenzy surrounding this case in Australia is reminiscent of the Sam Sheppard murder case in Ohio during the 50's. These real-life situations show that the media can actually influence how a criminal case is handled. I remember well that the Cleveland Plain Dealer is a big headline titled "Why isn't Sam Sheppard in jail?" The prosecutor finally succumbed to this relentless pressure, and Sheppard was tried and found guilty. Only after years in prison has he been acquitted. <br /> <br /> I love movies that tell a real story, do it in an interesting way and make an important point in the process. This is one of those movies. Other good movies featuring the story of innocent criminals include "Hurricane", "The Thin Blue Line" and "Breaker Morant". In particular, the latter is another highly recommended Australian film. <br /> <br /> 8/10
