The barbarians may not be the best movie anyone of us saw, but really ???? ........ It's so funny ...... I can't write how I laughed when I first saw it. The director really wanted to do a serious adventure movie, but it is undesirable bad .... so bad it is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen ...... so my advice is that you should see it ..... and if you have done tremendously, see it again !!!!!!!
