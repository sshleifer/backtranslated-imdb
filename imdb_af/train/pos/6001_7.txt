In no case a masterpiece, and far from Errol Flynn's best, Istanbul still has a lot to do. The sites and beautiful technicolor cinematography bring us back to some time ago. Errol Flynn shows moments of his former glory, and is right like Jim Brennan, a pilot whose past spins him back to haunt him. The picture is actually a remake of 1947's "Singapore", and the story looks very confronted and clich√© according to today's standards. Many of the supporting role-players also appear to be "moving through the movements" in this photo. Many also compared it to one of the all-time greats, CASABLANCA. While watching the movie, I could see lots of similarities, but hey, Casablanca inspired many imitators, so take it for what it is worth. Eventually, if you're a fan of Flynn, or old-fashioned love stories, you might want to watch this movie. Otherwise, I would recommend Casablanca, or The Maltese Falcon, as a good introduction to some Hollywood classics.
