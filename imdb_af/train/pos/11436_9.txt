This is the kind of picture John Lassiter would make today if it wasn't for CGI progress. And it is just to say that he will also be forgotten if the technology has not made sexy and kewl since 1983. _Twice ... has the same imagination, imagination and sense of true excitement you would find in a Pixar movie, performed only under the constraints of the medium c. 1983. Innovative animation techniques combine with a wonderful screenplay and excellent voices to make a movie that appeals to many levels. There should be talk in the same breath with _Spiritited Away_ and _Toy Story_.
