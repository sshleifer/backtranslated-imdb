I didn't see much German comedy, but if this movie is something to go, I'm obliged to see more! The simple but effective storyline takes two very different people on a journey from Germany to Italy after Eva, an unemployed two-month-old, discovers that her artist has a relationship with the wife of a rich lawyer. I will not disclose anything further, but what is a very funny series of events with the perfect conclusion. My interest in international film has expanded since I first saw. I recommend it to anyone (any adult ... don't let the inclusion of the young ones keep you in mind that it's a family movie) that likes comedy - even those who are unfamiliar with the language.
