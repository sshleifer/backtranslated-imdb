John Cassavetes 'Opening Night' is fantastic and fascinating; fantastic, because it plays with the deepest fears we have in our imagination, fascinating because it never surprises us. With a very long duration of two hours and twenty minutes, anyone who appreciates characters will not be able to take their eyes off the screen. <br /> <br /> The story of an unstable actress, Myrtle Gordon (Gena Rowlands), is trying to get herself together for a play to fight her demons; "Opening Night" is not just about a woman on the brink of a breakdown point, but also about the complexity of the life of theater actors and the theater world. All of Cassavetes' characters here are experienced people who know about the world of theater; So half of the film takes place on a stage, where the artists do their work or in the backyard, where producers and writers and directors do their work. Cassavetes is so loud with his characters that this ignorance turns to the audience, but the audience in the theater. Because there is another audience in the movie theater, it doesn't know what really happens and laughs because they think everything is performance. And that is essentially what it is; It's just that the audience in the theater doesn't see backstage as we do. They did not experience Gena Rowlands' exuberance before she left at that stage, but above all; they do not know the reasons why she does as she does. <br /> <br /> I always thought it's hard to be friends with an actor. Myrtle (Rowland) says she's an actress and that's the only thing she knows how to do; and I think if I had a professional artist, it would be very difficult to tell when he told the truth because I knew he was an actor and he could fail something at any time. Many of the things that Myrtle does during the terrible experiences of the movie, put her through? We suspect she is real; There are also the rest of the characters. <br /> <br /> There's the author, Sarah (Joan Blondell), who can't understand why Myrtle doesn't understand the character she wrote to her. There is the director, Manny (Ben Gazzara), who cannot accept that his best actress might lose it; The producer David (Paul Stewart), who doesn't know where to stand, and Myrtle's aunt Maurice (Cassavetes himself) can't handle the love they have for each other. <br /> <br /> When she witnesses the death of a teenager, a fan; All these things come together and touch Myrtle, but no one knows if her delusions really are. They say nothing because they don't want to upset her, but the movie enters into a state of subconsciousness that only Myrtle accepts. Sometimes we can say that everyone has it. In these moments, Cassavetes brilliant script shows a frightening brutal honesty in the words the characters say in a conversation background. and not just what everyone tells Myrtle, but also what they tell them. <br /> <br /> Here are people who are not afraid to speak their minds and constantly change what they think, just like Cassavetes's way of filming. . And in this respect, the performances are more important here than in "Shadows" because the characters are involved in a bigger picture; a bigger story coming out of the potty. <br /> <br /> But in another aspect, the real way to make cinema, this movie is no different from "Shadows". There is a beautiful thing in the way Al Ruban's camera shoots the characters. When someone talks, the camera doesn't focus on him, it shoots the person who listens; so we can see how he or she responds to the things others say. Sometimes they do not care, sometimes they are happy, sometimes devastated. <br /> <br /> Improvisation can still be there, among all these wonderful performances. Near the end there is an unexpected scene where Cassavetes and Rowlands start talking, non-stop. Whether it is improvised or not is not something we have to wonder about. We just have to look; and watching their life exchange experiences and see words, really comes alive in a conversation that means much more than it shows.
