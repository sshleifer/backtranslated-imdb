Unfortunately for myself - I stumbled on this show late in life. I just caught a few episodes (about three) before it was canceled by ABC. I loved the characters, and the storyline - but most of all the GREAT actors! I was a fan of Sex and the City, so I saw two characters I recognized. (Bridget Moynahan was & The Character "Todd" was "Smith Jared"), as well as Jay Hernandez (Van Carlito's Way: Rise To Power) and Erika Christensen (Swimfan). I like to watch young actors owe them, and feel that this performance would continue their career. I hope this is at least put back on DVD, and maybe WB will pick it up for a second season? Meanwhile, I see it from the start on ABC's website.
