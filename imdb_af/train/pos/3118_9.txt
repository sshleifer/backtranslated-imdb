Having not seen the previous two in the Bourne movie trilogy, I was a little hesitant to see the Bourne Ultimatum. <br /> <br /> However, it was a very exciting experience and I didn't have the problem not to understand what happened because of the first two movies. Every part of the story was easy to understand and I fell in love with The Bourne Ultimatum before it reached the interval! I don't think I watched such a beautiful and grim movie, especially an action movie. Since I usually shy away from action and thriller-type movies, it was such a good news for me. Ultimatum is one of the most exciting movies. Grab your attention from the first second to the last minute before the credit roll. Matt Damon was simply fantastic as his role as Jason Bourne. I heard a lot about his big performances in Bourne 1 + 2, and now this fantastic actor has another to add to his list. I look forward to seeing more of his movies in the future. <br /> <br /> The stunts were styled with style - each one was brilliantly crafted and I was only shocked by the impressions of this movie. Well done.
