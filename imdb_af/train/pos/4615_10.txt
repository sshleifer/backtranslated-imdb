I think people treasure this amazing movie. People see it as a typical horror movie aimed at scaring us and preventing us from sleeping. What if it was trying to do it would be worth 1/10 but I watched this movie with some friends and we found it very entertaining and although it was a good movie, it didn't have Stephanie Beaton. That's why I think it deserves the 10/10 for pure movie entertainment. <br /> <br /> The general view of this movie is that it is bad acting, a simple script that a 10 year old could produce and that it cannot be taken seriously and that people are low as a result regard. But I see it as a thoroughly entertaining masterpiece ... which has a hilarious funny script made even more entertaining by the actors and although not very serious, it's very entertaining.
