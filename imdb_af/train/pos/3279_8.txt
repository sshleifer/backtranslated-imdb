I'm glad it is now available on DVD. This film is an excellent example of the triumph of content and style over empty flashing light and constant loud sounds. <br /> <br /> Essentially, if you have a short attention span or don't have the white and imagination to get involved with literary story you won't like this movie. The reasons for this are fairly simple, but unfortunately it is rarely reached: Matthew Jacobs did a fantastic job of successfully converting the story of Catherine Storr's novel "Marianne Dreams" to a screenplay. A trivial task, like anyone who has seen a book from a book, will no doubt know. <br /> <br /> The casting is excellent so director Bernard Rose can use the actors in a way that is rarely seen now; they enjoy the craft of acting! I know I know actors are doing their work and acting instead of exposing themselves to the lens of the camera, while a kaleidoscope of car hunting, explosions and firefighting around them, a really scarce treatment, but this actually happens in this movie. <br /> <br /> This brings me to the final reason that this is a film for the imaginative thinker and not the spoon-feeding tabloid reader. Apart from sturdy writing, direction and acting, it depends on atmosphere, tension and implied abomination. If it is categorized as horror, the presentation of 'Paper House' is more in the vein of Sophocles and Tobe Hooper. <br /> <br /> Finally, if you have very loud noises, explosions, constant cuts and bright flickering colors you'd better watch Transformers, but if you want an exciting story unfolding through a skilled and appealing use of narration without insulting your intelligence with violence that gives your cacophonic nonsense, then it may just be your thing.
