A Lonely depressed French boy Mathieu (Jeremie Elkaim) on vacation in summer, encounters and falls in love with Cedric (the beautiful Stephane Rideau). Quiet and steady This is a very frustrating movie. On the one hand, I absorbed it and I really felt for the two boys. On the other hand, I was annoyed - the movie is constantly changing from past to present without rhythm or reason. It is very confusing and useless. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS START! <br /> <br /> There are also many plot holes. Mathieu, at one point, does something that ends up in hospital. What is it - we were never told! Then he broke down with Cedric and told everyone he was staying with him. Why? We are not told. Then he inexplicably crocheted with another man at the end. Why? No explanation. It's clear Cedric loves Mathieu and Mathieu living in the same town so ... But this is a tribute to the movie you really care about the characters so much. If only things are explained! <br /> <br /> Elkaim as Mathieu is not good. He is tall, beautiful and has a nice body - but he can't act. His idea of ​​acting is already empty with his face. Rideau, on the other hand, is wonderful. He is very beautiful, has a very nice body and is one hell of an actor. He also has an incredible sexual magnetism over him. There is full frontal male nudity, lots of kissing and a pretty explicit sex scene in the movie that's great. Most movies move away from male love stories. This one is not and it helps to see how the characters care and feel for each other. <br /> <br /> So, a frustrating movie but worth a look - especially for Rideau's nude - that's when you love pretty nude young men! <br /> <br />
