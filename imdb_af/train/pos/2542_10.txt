With a special telescope, dr. Janos Rukh (Boris Karloff) successfully proved that a meteorite landed in Africa years ago that contains an unknown but extremely powerful element. Dr. Benet (Bela Lugosi) is an expedition led by Rukh to locate the element. Unexpectedly, Rukh discovers "Radium X", even stronger than radium and very radioactive and Karloff becomes infected and can kill anyone by just touching them. The sparks really fly between Lugosi and Karloff in this classic science fiction movie during the Second World War era. Director Hillyer uses a few standing sets from the "FLASH GORDON" series that were filmed simultaneously and also included some Frankenstein electric machine footage. Universal has unaware the public about the special effects used in this great classic movie. Karloff and Lugosi were at their best and they both enjoyed working together and will be enjoyed by future generations.
