After I followed it for half a year, I finally got a copy and it wasn't disappointing. <br /> <br /> Not disappointing, because I am one of the stargazers stubborn to see all their work and I finally saw the so-called hot movie of Goro. But I couldn't believe Goro was forced to make a movie as such. In his respected self, he is sure he cut that he made this movie. Nevertheless, they got the perfect person to see embarrassment, sick and comfortable and half depressed. <br /> <br /> Man, I still can't believe he made this movie. I didn't have to believe my covered eyes on many parts he really made such a movie .... hahahaha .... <br /> <br /> But I'm glad to watch it. Thanks, he grew up.
