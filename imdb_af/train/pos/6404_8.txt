As I watched this movie, and I began to develop his characters, I could feel it would be a great picture. If you get that feeling and the movie is perfect, the experience is scarce. I felt the whole feeling through this movie. Robert DeNiro and Cuba Gooding Junior played exceptional and incredibly strong parts which were both worthy of Oscar. The supporting role-play was equally strong and created a winning foundation to grow the picture. I can say without a doubt, see this movie, it won't disappoint.
