I saw this movie by luck, just because I went through a stage where I had a new admiration for Bill Pullman and wanted to see all his recent movies and thank God for what I did! This movie has been holding on to me since then and remains one of my favorites! The story revolves around two girls who start a dramatic journey in a foreign country where they will learn the true meaning of freedom. <br /> <br /> Alice and Darlene just tried to spend a holiday together before going to college but their trip resulted in a much more complicated story. The struggle they are going through if they are arrested in Thailand and become prisoners is very mobile and intense. The acting is great, the exceptional images, the soundtrack are fantastic and so right for the movie and the message is definitely powerful. Actually, I can't even find the right words to describe how this movie makes me feel when I see it. I know some people didn't appreciate me much because I got the rating, but I swear, this one you should see !!! I promise it will stay with you!
