College Girl Joanne Murray takes the trivial task of building student housing to become apartments. This includes selling unnecessary furniture. This happens during a break, so a mysterious psycho bumps the almost empty premises on campus. "Dorm that drips Blood" is a low-budget pounding blower that is very entertaining. The play is pretty bad, the plot is predictable, but the gore effects are pretty good. The film was made by UCLA film students Stephen Carpenter and Jeffrey Obrow for nothing. Such a dreamy atmosphere kicks in, very similar to the surrounding forests of Jeff Leiberman's fantastic "Just Before Dawn" .7 out of 10. It is wonderful to see Daphne Zuniga of "The Initiation" celebrating in a few times run a car.
