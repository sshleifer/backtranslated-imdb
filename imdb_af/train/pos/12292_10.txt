I love this movie, Jouvet, Arletty, Blier, Carn√©. Almost everything has already been said about the movie, but there is one detail I would like to highlight: no footage of rights, still, Les du Nord (is it still? I heard it had to be demolished ...) the movie was used - the whole scene was rebuilt, the main reason being that they could not stop traffic on the St Martin channel for a few weeks.
