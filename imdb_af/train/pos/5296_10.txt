Absolutely hilarious. John Waters's tribute to the people he loves most (Baltimoreans) is a distorted little with lots to watch and laugh. It's like turning into a kitsch museum! I haven't laughed so much in a theater since Serial Mom. I loved seeing old friends of the Dreamland days, Sharon Nisep and Susan Lowe, in front of Waters's camera. The cast is simply wonderful (especially Edward Furlong and Martha Plimpton). Use the best elements of the past Waters atrocities (especially the underestimated polyester) and many new surprises. Made me sick, in a wonderful way. Thanks, John!
