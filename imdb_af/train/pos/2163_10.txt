I just love this movie. This is a perfect example of the well-rounded surprising stories that come from the Asian theater. There was a recent Hollywood remake of this movie, with Richard Gere and the simply horrible Jennifer Lopez. Please don't confuse the two movies. The original Japanese film was touched, subtle and wonderful. The Hollywood version is exactly the opposite. I was terrified when I saw the trailer for the American version and who was in the lead. This is typically Hollywood's most extreme crass commercialism at the worst. The remake cement argues that some foreign films can never be improved. The only reason the original movie is no longer widely regarded is the American audience's aversion to subtitles. <br /> <br /> One of the main reasons this movie never works in a US narrative is that the reserve, ultra social conservative, is the character of the public Japanese persona in this movie. Certainly, the main character wakes up to a more complete understanding of the life of a vibrant life through dance, but half the film's tension comes from the stereotypes and insults ballroom dancers in Japan. <br /> <br /> Please try to see this movie. in its original form, not the terrible full screen. And please, skip the American remake. It is a plain travesty compared to the original Japanese movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, I know the "original" movie is much older, and it's just a Japanese take on the story, but the only two people will see anytime soon. This one and the new American reminder. <br /> <br /> Speaking of foreign films, I will make some quick recommendations: 1. Monsoon Wedding-I call it a reason, excellent movie first! 2.Johnny Stechino-Very funny Italian faulty identity movie! 3.Shiri-A Korean action peak that mixes both Asian flare and American style. 4.Run Lola Run-A German movie that took it technically. )
