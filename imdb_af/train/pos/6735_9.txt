Wow! Stacy Peralta followed Dogtown and Z-Boys with an equally impressive documentary on the history of the Great Wave Surf Culture in America. Along with informative archival material along with interviewing surfing legends, we are transferred to the daring and generous life of the early pioneers, whose sheer passion for sport has been an industry that today touches the lives of millions. <br /> <br /> It's getting to know these icons and their stories that give the movie the warmth. You can have the respect that Peralta has for this group as we hear Greg Noll's accounts coming from a pack of unpolluted co-followers on the beach to challenge the 50-foot sulfur from Hawaii's north coast. Whether Jeff Clark, who had been alone 15 years before the discovery for 15 years and became the surfing destination in California, succeeded the exorbitant Maverick from the northern California coast. And the storybook history of Laird Hamilton, today's navigating icon. Hearing Greg Noll respectfully refers to Hamilton as the best surfer ever to have my spine cold. <br /> <br /> (Noll, Clark and others were also at the Sundance shows. Nol humbly describes himself as an old, over-the-mountain surfer. He was deeply surprised by the audience receiving him and film Both he and Clark were as nice as they were in the movie. <br /> <br /> Riding Giants pay tribute to these extraordinary athletes while rewarding us with an insight into the magnitude and frightening power of the waves trying to defeat them, the intestinal vertebrate droplets needed to get them and the almost incomprehensible combination of adrenaline and fear that the surfers experience every time they swell a monster. <br /> <br /> All this, and the movie has more. For those of us who do not live in California in the 60's, we gain insight into the impact of surfing on American pop culture. (And to my amazement, the impact of the movie Gidget on surfing!) Peralta also weaves a foundation on some of the technical aspects of the sport and the history of innovation in equipment. I'm not a surfer, but like the rest of the Sundance audience, I was absolutely captivated by this movie. Peralta discontinues his claim as the Big Kahuna of American documentary programs.
