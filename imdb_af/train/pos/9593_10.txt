First, I'm a butch, straight white male. But even with that disability, I like this movie. It's about real people. A real time and place. And of course New York City in the 80's. I grew up in gay friends in New York in the eighties and the one thing I always admired about them was their courage to live their lives as they wanted to live. No matter what the consequences are. It is brave. You must admire it. It's a good movie, watch it and take in what it was like to be a flamboyant African American or Hispanic Gay man in New York in the eighties. It's the real life. Bottom line it is real life.
