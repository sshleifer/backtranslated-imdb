Difficult movie to comment on, how do you say it's bad? Well, it's not, but then it's equally difficult to say it's good. What it is, is compelling viewing, it's as close as you will get to destruction without being there. These are the photos of the tsunami that touched the coast of Thailand, you know you want to turn away, but you have to look. <br /> <br /> The Naudet brothers handle the comment very well, even in the most tragic of circumstances, there is a view of something happening in another country, not pandas or insults. The facts are on the cellulose and little is needed for the viewer to understand or understand what is going on. <br /> <br /> You can't change history, and you shouldn't, this film stands as a testament to humanity in its darkest hour.
