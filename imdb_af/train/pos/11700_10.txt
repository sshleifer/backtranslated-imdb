I read most of the comments on this movie. I've seen this movie (and the whole prophecy series) many times with relatives of all ages, we all enjoyed and it just made us meditate on what we already knew to read and read about the rapture and end time Bible. study. No one was scared or traumatized as I read on some posts. The movie is just based on Biblical facts. I have seen many end-time movies "Tribulation", "Armagedon" and so on and by far this one is one of the best in presenting Bible truths. It may not have very special special effects like today's movies, but I believe it's a good evidence tool. This movie and its prophecy series can be viewed for free on this website higherpraise.com, and judge for yourself. Blessings for all.
