JACKNIFE is a fine adaptation of Stephen Metcalfe's play "Strange Snow" (the script was also written by Metcalfe), sensitively directed by David Hugh Jones. It investigates the over-forgotten effects of a battle on veterans permanently damaged by the atrocities of war. It is especially pleasing to return to this 1989 film as we watch the soldiers returning from the Iraq war and the raw treatment they receive in our Veterans hospitals. <br /> <br /> Three friends went to Vietnam War together and only two became alive: the problem is that both men have been hit, one Flannigan's David Highschool (Ed Harris) was so badly damaged by the posttraumatic stress syndrome that he is in a drunk vacuum with his very simple teacher sister Martha (Kathy Baker). As David deteriorates, his buddy Joseph 'Jacknife' Megessey (Robert De Niro) returns to town in an effort to help his friend. In the course of the events, Jacknife initially offered support to Martha and eventually attended the two dates - at a Prom Martha - and at that promotion drunk David was completely apart, destroying the relics of the school in the school and the townspeople and students scared. Jacknife makes Dave relive the moment in Vietnam when they lost their mate and bring David the point where he can start his climb after recovery. And the long-suffering Martha also finds her needs tended to by Jacknife. <br /> <br /> All three actors give surprisingly good performances: Ed Harris offers one of his most fully realized roles while De Niro and Baker maintain high standards. set by their careers. More people have to help revive this, but forgotten film, because it is a brittle reminder of the damage that our wars bring to the men they fight and to the families they receive after the end of the war. Highly recommended. Grady Harp
