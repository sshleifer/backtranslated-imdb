The story is about Jet Li who has to fight his old <br /> <br /> friends. But there is one problem, the friends are superfighters. The film is filled with blood, super action and the best stunts forever. And Lau Ching-Wan is a good fellow actor. Of course, the movie has the typical HK-Fun. But I love it! In Germany, "Black Mask" is uncut.
