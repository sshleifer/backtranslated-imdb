Gene Kelly, Frank Sinatra, Kathryn Grayson, and Jose Iturbi star in Anchors Aweigh, led by George Sidney. <br /> <br /> Kelly and Sinatra are Joe and Clarence, two marine guys on leave in Hollywood. They meet a little boy (Dean Stockwell) and take him home, they meet his aunt (Grayson). Clarence falls for her. She wants an audition for Jose Iturbi. They are trying to help, but there is a mixture. <br /> <br /> It is a very energetic music with great dance and singing by Kelly and Sinatra. Kelly gets to dance with Jerry the Mouse in a beautiful series. Grayson sings Jalousie and My Heart Sings. Not one of my favorite voices, but she does well. Iturbi's piano work is beautiful. <br /> <br /> Sinatra gets its versatility and why the girls swam over him, with the big blue eyes and boys' face. For Kelly, it was a huge break for him at MGM. <br /> <br /> Wonderful movie, very lively.
