I must admit that I was very skeptical about this documentary. I expected this to be the kind of All American Propaganda we love so much in Europe. I was wrong. It is not propaganda, it is virtually no politics at all. <br /> <br /> It depicts the events of 9/11 through the eyes of the firemen called to the scene just after the aircraft crashed. It is a wonderful fact that this documentary is not filmed at all! This movie was initially shot as a documentary network on a newcomer NY firefighter who became a man. We can only thank the filmmakers for continuing their work during the terrible ordeal they faced. <br /> <br /> A great piece of work. Absolutely beautiful material. Highly recommended. <br /> <br /> Greetings,
