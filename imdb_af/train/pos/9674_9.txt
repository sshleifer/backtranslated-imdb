I didn't give this movie a perfect score to be honest compared to great classics like "Citizen Kane" and "Seven Samaurai." This movie is so wonderful, it's really a pity that it's so bad for the general IMDb voter. However, the IMDb voter lends to the geeky and "Paulie" does not qualify for it. <br /> <br /> The only acting criticism I can imagine is that Hallie Kate Eisenberg didn't portray the perfect stuttering child. I'm sorry, but ask a 6-year-old child to run Dustin Hoffman, as the Rainman is asking the impossible in filmmaking. <br /> <br /> Moving beyond the small complaint, the movie has the best of many movies: girlfriend travel, con-games, hero and friendly party-animal (party-bird?), Disney-like humor for young and old, etc. What does not like? Tony Shaloub plays his part as a pair of comfortable jeans. It is normal for him, it seems. (I'm Russian ... I like long stories.) I don't like mangoes, but he almost makes me buy one. Look at the movie and it will make sense. <br /> <br /> Buddy Hackett and Cheech Marin make many appropriate representations in the film. Roles that fit a lot with what we all know about them. I always found Jay Mohr to be a little slender, and his role on the screen also suits it The only surprise to me was that Jay was also Paulie's voice. In the end, it also works well, puts Parrot and Anti-Parrot together as a team and creates a magic of its own. <br /> <br /> If you're trying to find a movie for you and the kids who aren't abusive or boring, Paulie is a perfect candidate. However, I will admit that a happy moment clarifies my Paulie review. was on a road trip during a big heat wave. The car's air-conditioning died, half of the restaurants had dead cooling (as our hotel did) and I said, "Let's look at a movie where there is air condition. Itioning." So we did. So for 100 minutes we were cooled, amused and given a heart-warming experience. When I recently saw it on VCR under less emotional circumstances, I realized how well this film was made. <br /> <br /> It's a sleep movie you won't regret watching.
