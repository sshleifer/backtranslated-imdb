Cinderella In my opinion, the greatest love story has ever said I loved it as a child and I love it, it's a wonderful Disney masterpiece now. It's one of my favorite movies, I love Disney. I can rave over Cinderella and Disney all day long, but I won't give a brief overview of the story. When a young girl's father dies, she must live with her evil stepmother and her equally ugly and nasty stepchildren Drusilla and Anastasia. Made to do affirmative homework, all day poor Cinderella has just the little mice that roam around the house and her dog Bruno as friends. When one day a letter was sent to her house, telling all available women to attend a royal ball. Cinderella's evil step mother and step sister try to prevent her attendance. Cinderella gets her dream and wish and can attend her captive beauty. Genius and beautiful nature help her win her prince.
