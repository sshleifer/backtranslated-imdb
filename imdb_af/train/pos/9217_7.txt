This really funny movie has a very meager character, about every mature middle-aged woman in Hollywood, and a pleasant, funny love story. The Capomezza's and the Malacici's are competitive caterers in an Italian neighborhood in New York. They are also at the opposite - extreme ends of the taste scale. Their children are cast into the main roles of a church production of Romeo and Juliet. Of course they fall in love. On stage! The chaos and confusion it causes, as the parents eat with each other and their children, is played against the backdrop of Capomezza's wonderfully tasteless home, and their wonderful tasteless weddings. <br /> <br /> In addition to the top four parents and the lovely young lovers, the characters include a vaguely sensible priest, a simple grandmother, a rope lady and moving on spiritual advice that She received a medium called The Blessed Roscoe, a motel with beds like the back seat of a car and two pigeons. There is no glance or a punch line that doesn't click into this quick movie. <br /> <br /> Even the family names of the two families are part of the fun. "Capomezza" can be interpreted as "low eyebrows", and "Malacici" can mean "stuffed snobs". <br /> <br /> If you're sensitive to Italian stereotypes, you may not like this movie. If Bette Midler makes you embarrass, you can't keep it because all the women in this movie make Bette Midler like Martha Stewart. The rest of us should love it!
