<br /> <br /> I loved this movie very much. One of those scary movies that Hollywood really doesn't make anymore. William H Macy is just fantastic as a hit with a soul, and Neve Campbell is just fantastic from the woman who puts his life on the trail of redemption. <br /> <br /> If you have a chance, see this movie. It deserves praise
