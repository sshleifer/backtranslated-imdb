I couldn't agree with Nomad 7's and I A HVR's comments. A perfect laid back Sunday morning movie. The humor is subtle (exactly the opposite of "slapstick" as one wrong commentator noticed.) <br /> <br /> But what always keeps me from wondering, how often do I find myself returning to and from this movie. I originally copied this movie on VHS about twelve years ago when it was presented on one of the Pay Cable free weekend previews (maybe HBO?). Never heard of this. Don't know why it's not been marketed so well. ?? When the DVDs were released, it was one of the first movies I replaced. A good combination of cast and write. Plus, the fall of the Montana desert also doesn't hurt. <br /> <br /> It's probably not the kind of comedy for everyone, but what is it? Taking Adam Sandler kind of stuff on you would probably not be your cup of tea. This movie needs your full attention. The humor is mostly in the dialogue. <br /> <br /> I believe my next look will probably be about my 12th. But I still know that when it comes to the screens like the one where the caps of the police vehicles start to blow off, I'm going to release it. (Ed O'Neill's face is LOVELY!). Recommended 110%.
