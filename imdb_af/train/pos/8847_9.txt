If I watch a movie and don't even look at my watch or clock to see how much longer it will last or when I hope the last scene was not the end of the movie, it should be pretty good. I'm not a film intern or bioseks dissectionist. I watch movies and if they make me interested in the end, then they are pretty good because some of the most critically acclaimed movies have killed me. The English Patient, Shakespeare in Love, Reconciliation, Crash. This movie interested me and absorbed it. begins to end. Action is wonderful, story is absolutely original, flash back technique very affective. There was a bit of Citizen Kane thrown in Tho when Hoffman wiped off his apartment after Tomei left him, but I forgive it because I pay it as a tribute, rather than a rip-off from Orson.
