SPOILER ALERT !! <br /> <br /> I just watched the extended version of Bedknobs and Broomsticks. Although I wanted the extended version, I wish they would leave the original version on the DVD. <br /> <br /> The Portabello Road could have been cut to its original length. It was too long and dragged the movie. Although the dance is very good, it would have been much better on the DVD than a distant scene. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a good movie. My 5 year old likes it. And it's great that movies I enjoyed as a kid are being transferred to a new generation. These and Mary Poppins are added to my collection. <br /> <br /> Just like I remember <br /> <br /> *** out **** <br /> <br />
