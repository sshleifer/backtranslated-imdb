The infamous Bettie Page (2005) <br /> <br /> Targeted by: Mary Harron <br /> <br /> With: Gretchen Mol, Chris Bauer, Lili Taylor, Sarah Paulson, & David Strathairn <br /> < MPAA Rating: "R" (for nudity, sexual content and some language) <br /> <br /> Nowadays, every celebrity seems to be making a biopsy about his or her life. From Ray Charles to Johnny Cash, biopics are now very good. "The Notorious Bettie Page" is the latest of these released on DVD. It features Gretchen Mol as the world's most famous pin model, Bettie Page and is mostly filmed in black and white with some color extracts. Unlike "Ray", "Walk the Line" and "Finding Neverland", this movie won't be the one to watch the Oscars this year. This movie lacks the emotional resonance displayed in other biopics, and most of the more dramatic moments in Bettie Page's life are either completely ignored or merely suggested. But that doesn't mean it's a bad movie. In fact, "The Notorious Bettie Page" is a thoroughly entertaining and fulfilling movie - a solid work of the theater. This film focuses more on Page's exciting career and the thin line between sexuality and pornography. Filmed with zeal and care, Mary Harron's direction captures the look and feel of the period as most filmmakers only dream. <br /> <br /> Everyone knows Bettie Page (played by Mol). Whether you know her as an icon or a simple pornstar? You know her. She is a woman who had only a great influence on American culture by revealing more skin than it was considered at that time. Now most people know her as one of America's first sex symbols - a legend for many models, especially those of Playboy and other adult-oriented magazines. She lived in a while when only a thumb of meat appeared under the garbage, someone could be arrested and Page's slavery photos were just the thing to push the American public into a riot. In fact, the photos start with a full-fledged senate inquiry into general decency and the difference between harmless movies and porn. <br /> <br /> The performances in "The Notorious Bettie Page" are absolutely wonderful with Gretchen Mol who stands out. Her performance as Bettie Page is simply brilliant. I understand that when she was announced for the role, many people were skeptical. Her name is not one that immediately jumps into my mind when I think of good performances. Now it will. She completely donated the role and overtook me with her vulnerable yet profound achievement. David Strathairn is fresh from last year's "Good Night and Good Luck", in which he gave one of 2005's best achievements. Here he gives another good performance ?? even though he is slightly underutilized. I was shocked at how limited his screen time was, but quality over quantity is always the most important aspect of any good movie. The only thing I saw from Lili Taylor was "The Haunting" (1999). While most people ignored the movie, I found it to be a pleasant, if not completely, horror movie, and I always thought Taylor was fully credible as the emotionally disturbed Nell. Here, Taylor gives another credible performance. She gives a very muted performance and gives the perfect show to compliment Gretchen Mol. <br /> <br /> After everything has been said and done, I realized that the Notorious Bettie Page cannot be compared to other biopics. such as "Finding Neverland" and "Walk the Line". This is unmatched by this because it tells a woman and her career from the beginning to the end. Her personal life is briefly implied, but it's really her highest impact on the world. We look at the film that knows that Page will finally bail out everyone and we know the impact her decisions will have, but we rarely see the impact they will have on her personal life. She is a woman who never looked back and could find herself independent. After all, she was an adult model who turned Christian missionaries. This movie does not dramatize anything. It could include fictional moments of Page hobbies hobbling and begging God to forgive her. It could have shown that Page is running and shouting through the rain, trying to escape the spirits of her past, and yet it is not. "The Notorious Bettie Page" tells a simple story and it is something rare according to today's standards. Fortunately, it is very refreshing. <br /> <br /> Final thought: "The notorious Bettie Page" is a relaxing movie with absolutely wonderful cinematography. <br /> <br /> Overall Rating: 9/10 (A)
