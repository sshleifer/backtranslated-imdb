This movie is very entertaining, and any criticism is based on personal preferences - not the quality of the movies. Unlike the general excessive curse in some scenes by Murphy, the movie is a great vehicle for his kind of humor. It has some good special effects and exciting action scenes. <br /> <br /> As a finding out of lost children, Murphy's character begins looking for a missing girl who leads him on the road for which others believe he was "chosen" to protect the golden child. The young boy was born as an enlightenment, destined to save the world of evil forces, but whose life is in danger, if not for the help of Murphy and his beautiful, mysterious and mystical helper / guide / protector . /> <br /> There are also moments of philosophical lessons to challenge the audience who are interested in thinking deeply. One such scene is where the Golden Child, who is requested to protect Murphy's character, is being tested by the monks of the mountain temple. An elderly monk offers a tray of ornamental necklaces for the child to choose from, and the child is tested at his choice. <br /> <br /> It is a fantasy / comedy based on the idea that there are both good and evil forces in our world, most of whom are totally unaware. As we accept this plot, we must touch with an observable daily reality and prepare for the earth and crumble walls and reveal an evil kingdom just waiting to destroy us. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent movie, with a good plot, fine acting, and for the most part, a proper decent dialogue that combines a serious topic with a healthy balance of Martial Art. battles, and Eddie Murphy humor.
