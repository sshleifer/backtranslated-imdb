The music of Albeniz decays this movie. For a while, it is played with original instrumentation (eg piano, but never full of orchestra), but it is often accompanied by various contemporary ensembles (eg. Guitar) and treatments (eg jazz piano). Only occasionally is the music the only focus of the movie: the vast majority of the time is the music on different dances, often flamenco, but not always. I would guess there 12? 14 scenes, which are not unified by a plot. Not all scenes will reach the heights of an individual viewer. In my case half reached the height, although the rest was very good in their own way. Those who worked for me exchanged me for the gauze-flesh aesthetic pleasure; Indeed, the final scene reflected me with joy. And in a very magical way, it brings you deep into Spanish culture. If you don't like subtitles, don't worry. The movie is virtually wordless, although each scene contains an Albeniz piece title. Watching this very beautiful movie doubles my complaints that virtually none of the Saura movies on DVD are available in the US. I especially think of his flamenco version of "Carmen", a spectacular artwork available in Europe, but not here (European DVDs will not play on American DVD players). This is a scandal.
