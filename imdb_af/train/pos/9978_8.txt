I must say, I loved vanishing point. I've seen the original, and it's a pretty good repetition of it. Although it didn't follow the original storyline (that's why I gave it 8 out of 10), it was pretty good and it's probably a better story. <br /> <br /> As far as the car is concerned, the DJ's comment at the end of the Challenger, which goes 185 km / h in the bulldozers, is pretty unlikely. (And if you look at the speedometer needle at 145-150), although I haven't seen one on the engine in one of the start scenes where they show the engine, the original storyline has a super-loaded Hemi, so that's possible. For those of you who say aerodynamics doesn't allow it, the normally Chrysler 300C can go 168 mph today. Looking at that thing, it's going on a highway, it's like pushing a stone wall through the wind at 70. mph. Plus, in a wind tunnel test if you place an air dam on the Challenger, it will probably be more aerodynamic.
