This miracle of a movie is one of those movies that has a lasting, long-term effect on you. I have read a review or two of angry people who I think are republicans or child-beaters, and express their extremist remarks from the movie force to confront people with their darkest secrets. Not such an art has ever laughed and combined tears in me and that is the miracle of the movie. The realism of the movie and it's the performance of Bret Carr shouldn't be missed. The nature of this is almost interactive, causing people to leave the theater or free their identity. Bravo at the next level of the theater.
