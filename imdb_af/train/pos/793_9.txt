I really really enjoyed this movie. (That's why it surprised me that it's getting such a low rating from so many users on this site!) I'm not saying it's a movie, but it was a great way to spend a cold, snowy Saturday night . It's funny, awful and a wonderful story of the upward and female friendships that stay through difficult times and the bad things that female friends tend to do to each other! Bill Paterson shines as Reverend Gerald Marsden and Andie McDowell prove she can be a good actress when the role is right and she thinks about it. (And in fact, there's the best wedding escape I've ever seen or dreamed in this movie ... more guts than anyone I've ever known!) You'll laugh and you'll cry --- ignore any marketing campaigns and how this movie marketing .... it is a hidden gem that TONNES had to do from the box office. (now I have to look around to buy a copy!)
