Emily Watson's Natalia is absolutely the most loving and romantic main character I've ever seen on a screen. She is the queen of this film beyond any doubt. Or is she transferred to the king? The interncine weaving of the chess games and the families' struggle for control, strength and victory is amazing. Just as the chess masters do in the movie, the director plays many simultaneous games with our thoughts simultaneously, but all weave in large or small patterns. The era, the costumes, and images of the early 20th century of Italy's more district are immensely captured. Not a single square of space was wasted. <br /> <br /> So many brilliant scenes are abundant, I can't tell them all. I recommend that you spend enough time to disassemble this movie twice, possibly a week, because you may not be able to record all the poetry in a 64-square but multidimensional framework in one institution. <br /> <br /> I didn't read Nabakov's book, but trying to read an analogy of my own, what I read, reminds me of another romantic triumphant poetry-as-game movie, The Natural by Barry Levinson. It ended the horrific ending of Bernard Malamud's fatalistic book in favor of a romantic impressionism that was uniquely American. Well, the director made that one better by entering Russian and Italian morals and mores' seamless routes as a backdrop to the relief. The real story here is that games are zero-sum; there is a winner and a loser, unless both participants sign. But in life, and especially in the context of our immortal souls, we are limited only by the limitations and conventions of life to the extent that we let others breathe our spirit. <br /> <br /> Pure love, as embodied by Emily Watson's Natalia, can exceed and allow us all to be strengthened simultaneously by his gifts. Only the obstacles created by our fears can deter us. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie (10/10).
