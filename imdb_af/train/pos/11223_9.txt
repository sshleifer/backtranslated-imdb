Tommy Jones and Matt Dillon are proud of the gambling world. The various movements with the wrists had to be learned like throwing craps, is a skill in and of itself. <br /> <br /> There are some surprises. As cynical as we are today, I fully expected the "good girl" to cry over his grave, instead of his Buddy's. Especially with her remarks about 'going to the funeral of her best friend' when she first met Matt. And then of course you expect Matt to get the guy who battery acid in Mr. Allen's face thrown, kill (interesting role by Bruce Dern). WRRROOONNNGGG !!! some of the other Hollywood endings happen, but the writing is so excellent, the acting is so careful you are not happy. <br /> <br /> The music is outside this world. Take us back to the 50's when our 'natural passions' were first taken out by Ray Charles and Bo Diddley's music. Even a bit of racism that keeps its ugly head in Chicago, but at a club called 'Biloxi', with a Confederate flag that supports racist remarks. I'll watch it again, just to hear the music. Good thing, I have the FACTOTUM soundtrack, so I can hear it in the car. See both together, and you'll see Matt grow up .... play both characters in characters. Having owned a bar in the Paramount HOtel in NYC, he probably has a good opportunity to do his studies. Great actor, just come in his own. He shows fine nuanced performances ... the good and the bad in his characters. His 'young son of the farm' is a wonderful study made especially by his bassetthound eyes. He also makes love, convincing. Being in various movies with Diane Lane as a teenager, I wonder how to ... love an actress you like. Add conviction, I'll say it.
