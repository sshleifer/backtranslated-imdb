Deadly mistake is a very cool movie! Robert Wagner, Antonio Sabato Jr., Janine Turner, Jason Schombing, Malcolm Stewart and David Lewis are in the movie. The film's role did everything well. Robert Wagner played his part well. The relationship between Saboto Jr and Turner was a nice one. There may be a large age difference there, but they are a unique couple. The two actors really work well together. The music in the movie is really good by Ron Ramin and fits the movie very well. There are a lot of things happening in the movie that you don't know what is going on and what will happen next and this movie keeps you from beginning to end. If you love Robert Wagner, Antonio Sabato Jr., and Janine Turner, watch this great movie!
