If you're a fan of one or both of Chuck Norris and Judson Mills, then this is the movie to watch. It has a lot of adventure in it. This is a good sequel to President's Man. The chemistry between the three major stars (Chuck Norris, Judson Mills, Jennifer Tung) is incredible. My personal opinion. This movie, along with the original, turned out so well that the networks should consider changing it into a regular series. If you've seen President's Man, I recommend this movie to you. If you've seen the President's husband: a line in the sand, but you haven't seen President's husband, let me think you do. You won't be disappointed.
