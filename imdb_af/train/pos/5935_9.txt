Having seen the terrible, terrible, terrible BATMAN: DEAT END, I knew I should see it as soon as I heard about it. <br /> <br /> Press to see the trailer. I thought I was in another, spectacular short of what looked like another bad wannabe filmmaker trying to bring new depth to an existing character. But instead was greeted with a BIG composite trailer for a movie that unfortunately doesn't exist, because I'd like to see a finished movie, even if it was only 30 minutes long. <br /> <br /> WORLD'S FINEST make BATMAN: DEAD END and then some. <br /> <br /> I'm looking forward to the next short!
