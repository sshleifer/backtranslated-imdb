I saw it at the theater in the early 1970s. The most memorable and scary scene is when the German army is attacking yellow mustard for the first time. The Germans and their horses are covered from head to toe (or need) with fearless protective suits. The experienced British soldiers only serve gas masks and wait for the clouds of gas and German attackers again. The gas clouds are approaching closer, and eventually British invaders enclose. The Germans are moving slowly, frighteningly in their terrible clothes. Suddenly there is a scream of the defenders ... This guest is like no one else they have experienced before. <br /> <br /> Now you will know why I remembered this scene for the past 30+ years and still tremble, I think you will too!
