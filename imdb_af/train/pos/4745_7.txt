I can't understand why they decided to release this movie to introduce the American audience to the dynasty that Jet Li is. Fists of the legend would have been a much better choice. Anyway, Black Mask is not terrible, but it's not good either. The final battle series is well performed by Yuen Woo Ping who will co-ordinate the Matrix. But the English edition suffers from rough editing and dubbing. (I beg the Hollywood studios to make these movies unavailable with subtitles.) Jet Li shows his distinctive charisma in the title role and Francoise Yip has a cool but short role as the female 701. <br /> <br /> Black Mask has a strange goth style that adds a little interest, but it is overloaded with gunfights and explosions. More focus on Li's fantastic physical skills was in order. Black Mask is a decent movie, but do yourself a favor and get Fist of Legend if you want to see a great movie that really shows Li's skills.
