I saw the movie and really couldn't stop my tears. His tragedy that India does not have such leaders to freedom dares to do with their own children when they do not act properly. In the current generation, politicians bring their children into politics without measuring their caliber and skills. I remember Gandhi's dialogue "What kind of society do we want to create / create with such people (about Harilal)?" No wonder it will be a dream that India will have almost such a leader in this or next generation. Einstein was right when he said about Gandhi: "After 50 years one would hardly believe that such a person with body, soul and mind (Mahatma Gandhi) ever lived on this earth. 'I would like to thank Anil Kapoor, Feroze Khan and all the film actors / actresses for this great movie about big person and relationship with his son. All father and son should watch this movie once and take some lessons for both roles.
