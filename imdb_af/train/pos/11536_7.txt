It is difficult to watch this movie without thinking about the television program, especially if I like the TV program more. But much has been said for the source. <br /> <br /> Oscar Madison (Walter Matthau) is a top sportswriter from New York City. He lives in an apartment with eight rooms, a divorce divorce and his own stubbornly sloppy attitude. Enter his friend Felix Ungar (Jack Lemmon), and need a place to live after his wife threw him out for his stubborn neatnik disposition. The result is a train wreck and one of the most popular movie adaptations of a Neil Simon stage play. <br /> <br /> First thing's first: I love the apartment! Poker table, novelty dartboard, dirty photos of baseball players, empty liquor and beer containers, even some Roman columns. It's a place where men can be men. Simon and director Gene Saks are doing a great job opening the play's single set, Oscar's living room, by shifting the action into the bedrooms and kitchen and giving more and more tension between Oscar and Felix. <br /> <br /> Neal Hefti's well-known score was heard on the TV show, but never orchestrated as advanced as it is here, in various arrangements that make the screen action rise when played. Real-place work and night shots from Manhattan give the film an energy that is common to films shot in that place and time ("Buddwing", "The World Of Henry Orient", "Midnight Cowboy", "Manchurian Candidate," "Rosemary's Baby," etc.) <br /> <br /> Are Lemmon and Matthau too heavy compared to Tony Randall and Jack Klugman? To be honest, the film is meant to be a more serious matter, dealing with the then unusual state of the middle divorce and the frustration inherent in not being able to do a relationship work. Simon has more in mind than to enter Felix and Oscar in a "Password" game or a wits' fight with Howard Cosell. But I don't know ... <br /> <br /> Both Lemmon and Matthau were great comedians I love to enjoy in the middle of this movie, as I often do in their separate movies, but I never understood why they were not. considered a great comedy team. Here it looks like it is acting in two different films in their best rated partnership; Lemmon in a comedy drama and Matthau in a farce. Matthau is fantastic in the beginning. He captivates us with his teddy bear attitude around the poker table, but near the end of the movie he takes a turn like Jack Torrance's in "The Shining". He responds to Felix to clean and serve his apartment. good food for his friends in a way that totally damages the delicate balance of the debt. <br /> <br /> As the end bother me, the part looks a lot because most of the obstacles, the beginning, work well as I see it. To watch Felix embrace trying to kill himself is not a big comedy, but it's a great way to get into a big comedy, and set us up with some pain in the reality before we bring in the warmth and laughter. (In the middle of the film, this scene had a misunderstanding, but it works as a way to get Felix's trouble and a sharp relief to come when we see Oscar and his poker friends bicker and feud. < br /> <br /> That's where Simon's lines are so big, they're the underlying power of the movie, he gets the banter right and right, and makes it funny. "I don't care, Felix. You have things to say. What scares me is that I start to listen. "The TV show showed how wrong it is to take the movie is always better. In fact, the TV show once had Good point to assume nothing, but the film makes for a solid foundation and is a joy in its own right.
