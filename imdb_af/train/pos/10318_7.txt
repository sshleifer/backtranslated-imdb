It said The Movies and Baseball both thrive during the Great Depression. It seems that the nasty realities of a nation caught in the aftermath of this economic catastrophe create a need for occasional relief for the population. A temporary escape can be found in the refurbishing soap opera Baseball. <br /> <br /> Similarly, a 2 or 3-hour event excursion in the darkened auditoriums of the film. The presence of a radio in just about everyone's house instituted the Depression Era America simultaneously on World Events and provided many Drama and (especially) Comedy programs for a pleasurable interlacing of the harsh reality. <br /> <br /> The literature of the time has also flourished at all levels. The young reading habits helped to create the Strip as we know it, with all the fantastic characters and super exciting adventures. But the Comic Book just didn't appear magical, everything developed fully with all the colorful 4 color pages, all in itself. There were mediums that were their ancestors. It was clear that the newspaper article was one older, telling the visual / narrative method of story. <br /> <br /> The other direct ancestor was the Pulp Magazine. The inexpensive, prose story publications that carried many stories of the same adventure characters, but not necessarily serialized, tell. The pulp medium has been around for decades and introduced us to the Edgar Rice Borrough's TARZAN and Johnston McCulley's ZORRO. The 1930s brought a big crop as feature characters such as THE SHADOW, THE AVENGER, G8's BATTLE ACES and the SPIDER, MASTER of MEN all on the way to the news reports. <br /> <br /> Another was DOC SAVAGE, a bloody superhero of the written story; The cover of the masses may have been the only "picture" of the hero. Doc has the super hero of prototype Super Hero. <br /> <br /> He also met 5 of his former Army Buddies in a small, free team of adventurers. Each of them was an expert in a given field. So we have a top-rated: Chemist, Attorney, Construction Engineer, Electrical Engineer, Geologist-Archaeologist-Paleontologist, etc. <br /> <br /> The Doc Savage stories were popular in the 1930s and 40s, and were published in the mid 50's. Then they gave a boost for a good 12-15 years. Then brainstorm the old novels in a new "container", the paperback book. A new look at the cover art has been launched, with a highly styled range of very muscular Doc paintings, with an everlasting ripped shirt. <br /> <br /> The re-introduction was very successful, with the publication of a title per month (and for a while longer). Soon there was a rumor of a Doc Savage movie! But when, by which producer? Well, the honorable "Man of Bronze" was back on the news reports for more than 10 years before any real project was put together. It was the veteran Stop-Action Animator and producer of the Top Special Effects movies, Geoprge Pal, who did the movie with Warner Brothers. <br /> <br /> When DOC SAVAGE, BRONZE MAN, arrived in Movie Houses, it boasted. from a well-cast team of actors, although largely "No Name" as well known to the viewers. With former Tarzan of TV, Ron Ely's almost perfect decisive role in the lead, come Beauty of a Starlette, Pamela Hensley in the female head and veteran character Paul Wexler (as the villain, Captain Seas); no other name would have been recognized. And maybe it was a plus in this case. <br /> <br /> The story does a great job of making both the audience aware of the incredible group and making a plot at the same time. Use of narration by Paul Frees and short film cuts is the method used to move the introduction to the main body of the story. <br /> <br /> From the start, there are hints that this story goes with the same kind of "Camp" humor created as the Batman TV series. Some really good-natured early scenes involving Doc and the entire crew doing their individual specialties are thrown to humor by Paul Frees' narrative and the unexpected, unlikely outcomes. (For example, an experiment by Docs with a miniature rocket / rocket seems to be part of a method of catching a fish, a small one on it.) The whole story unfolds so, and hits the viewer with a little 'Camp "Every so often, to remember we don't take it too seriously. We are also surprised at Mr. George Pal's Producer (his last). He was so well known for special effects, certainly a factor that can be well used in a sci-fi action setting of the Pulp Character's world. <br /> <br /> I can remember that it's quite alive. Mrs. Ryan (Deanna) was in hospital, and only gave birth to our 2nd child, Michelle (08/14/75). Our older girl, Jennifer, was visiting her grandmother. After hours, the maternity ward had passed. It was straight to the old Marquette Theater, 63rd & Kedzie, here in Chicago. <br /> <br /> After we saw It was a man with a good familiarity with Doc. I was similar to the final product. I can accept a bit of this 'Camp' business, but would not object if Mr. Pal would have seen it well to hang it all out and has some real, neat Dinosaurs and Volcanoes to make it a little more Pulp / Strip / Series-type excitement. <br /> <br /> And yet, the film by Mr. Ely and the other were set up, made the whole movie enjoyable, if not love. The sets and locations were, as far as we can see, much like those of a 30-year series or adventure movie that would be pleasing to anyone. <br /> <br /> And maybe that's just what they tried With this DOC SAVAGE, MAN BRONZE.
