I read from the previous comments that this movie went straight to the cable. Well, I paid to see it in a theater, and I'm glad I did it because it was visually a striking movie. Most of the settings look like they were made in the early 60's (except for the shrink office, which is dated in some other way), and if you leave the Neve Campbell rows, the whole movie has a washed out early 60's. atmosphere. And the use of restaurants in the film was fascinating. For a first time director whose background, I believe, is in writing, he has a good eye. Within the first ten minutes I lacked the plot credibility, so I just willingly suspended my unbelief and went for the ride. In terms of acting and depicting father-son, mother-son, male-wife, parent-child relationships, the movie was mockery. William H. Macy, a pleasure to watch, seems to be filling the gap left by Tony Perkins, if it and Magnolia are any indication. Tracey Ullman as the neglected woman moved me properly. It was a three-dimensional depiction of a character that is often seen by society as two-dimensional. Of course Donald Sutherland can add it to his collection of memorable depictions. The portrayal of the parents (Bain / Sutherland) reminded me indirectly of Vincent Gallo's BUFFALO '66, although a little burnt down! I would definitely pay money to see a second movie from this director. He will never have the self-discipline of a 50-year-old b-crime film director (something P.T.Anderson!), But he has a visual style and a way of acting with attention-grabbing actors.
