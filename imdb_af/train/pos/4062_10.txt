I just realized that I've been using IMDb for years and I've never reviewed my favorite movie. By favorite I do not mean something I like from now on. I mean, this movie is so supernaturally perfect that there is never another animated experience to touch it. Obviously I will never be a child again; I saw this film on ITV in the early nineties. I was 12, and this is the age group this movie is aimed at. I'm also masculine, the generation for which this movie is meant. The overwhelming majority of Miyazaki's lead actors are female. As a result, this film has inspired my childless psychology indelibly and I am forever guilty of Carl Macek (sp.) For the production of the English dub of this film which is much better than the new production that is not even funny - I has never been This can of course be subtitled. The only way is finally that the Macek version is so good (the voices are virtually the same as the original Japanese actors) that this version is available on the Japanese DVD! It is not available on any distribution in an English speaking country. Go figure. <br /> <br /> There are hundreds of competent reviews, so I'm going to make a few trivias here, not that I'm the definitive archive of information for this movie. <br /> <br /> First, I agree with the reviewer that you need 20 out of 10 to review Miyazaki's movies - they are so in their own league that they almost combined the entire catalog on IMDb into insignificance . <br /> <br /> The fascinating story with this movie is that Miyazaki settled the countryside around Slag's Ravine (Pazu's village area) on the Welsh mining communities. He visited Wales for a few months in the early 80's (perhaps in the late 70's), just after one of the major mining strikes. Being a zealous supporter of the student's socialist movements in the sixties, he experienced their fate. The struggle between the townspeople and the pirates at the beginning serves to illustrate this empathy with the working man. The countryside and the clouds, especially in this movie, remind me where I grew up, as his film depicts a fantasy version of the hills of the Middle British Islands. <br /> <br /> Of course, the island is of Swift's ingenious satirical novel of the eighteenth century - the story in Swift's book is deliberately ridiculous. In Castle in the air, Miyazaki weighs together myths like Atlantis and the Tower of Babel. I think architecture is also based on Peruvian ruins, although I'm not sure, someone told me. <br /> <br /> Anyone who comes to read this review and who likes this movie will actually want to investigate Miyazaki's epic series Mirai Shounen Conan - Future Boy Conan - based on the briefly written novel 'The Incredible Tide' by Alexander key (novel available online). Conan is basically a prototype for Laputa's Pazu and Shita. In addition, you may not be familiar with his earlier masterpiece theater work - some of his keyframe animations. He also did the key framework for Sherlock Hound - it has some of the best backgrounds I've ever seen. Also look at Miyazaki and Takahata's first feature film, Horus Prince of the Sun (1968) - incredible by today's standards. What else ... Go the Cellist and the Flying Ghost Ship - though it's pretty scarce. <br /> <br /> This movie is such a gift, I don't know what we would do without it This other storytelling around, it's like an oasis. Arigatou Miyazaki-sensei!
