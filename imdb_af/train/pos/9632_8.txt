The notion that Laurel & Hardy this time works in the role of chimney sweeps is surprisingly hilaries. It sometimes guarantees some funny situations and stupid antique, especially from Stan Laurel. <br /> <br /> The movie also has a subplot with a useful professor working on a rejuvenation formula. It doesn't really sound like a logical mix of story lines and incoherent, but both plot lines combine perfectly to the memorable end. It's quite a bit strange, but it's funny, so it works for the movie. <br /> <br /> The supporting movie from the movie is surprisingly good. Sam Adams is great if the stereotype butler and Lucien Littlefield go over the top as the nutty professor. <br /> <br /> The movie is filled with some excellent timely and hilarious sequential sequences, all of which are reasonably predictable, but are hilarious to see yet thanks to the way they are all performed. It all helps to make "Dirty Work" as one of the better Laurel & Hardy shorts. <br /> <br /> 8/10
