It must be one of the best movies about serial killers I've ever seen, and it comes from someone who absolutely loved the silence of the lambs. HBO hit the jackpot here. This movie is compelling from the first moment to the last. <br /> <br /> This movie has so many underlying themes, it's hard to tell exactly what it's about. It chronicles the decade-long search for Russian serial killer Andrea Chikatilo. Stephen Rea gives a brilliantly reserved performance as the inexperienced forensic expert in charge of the investigation. Donald Sutherland gives even more performance than his cynical superior and the only person in the Russian government wants to help him. Both of their performances are subtle masterpieces --- Rea begins naively and reluctantly to compromise, while Sutherland begins to detach and almost amused by the situation. At the end, Rea becomes more global and hit by the system, while Sutherland finds himself more passionate and idealistic. <br /> <br /> In any other movie I would have said that Sutherland's performance stands out. but here it is even shot dead by Jeffrey DuMann. DuMann brilliantly creates a character here that is inspiring rather than the hatred we think we will find --- he's a monster, but he doesn't want to be, and we get the idea that he's just as disgusting about what he does as we are. He is tortured, ashamed, but also angry. <br /> <br /> If you can take the incredibly dark topic and it's very disturbing, you should see this movie.
