After a critical eye for film and a love for good theater, I went to see Antwone Fisher with my breath symbolically. While being a petty fan of Denzel Washington - both his skill as an actor and his public persona; I'm a fair enough fan to award the (very few) times when he didn't hit the point in a movie or two. And I can be wrong about that - after all, I'm not an actor. But it was different - Denzel would experience his career in, and lead, a movie that casts one of the most sensitive subjects that man knows - abusing a child. As his director's debut, no less. And develop the film to show that it will successfully host a man's triumph. I didn't want to be disappointed. <br /> <br /> And I wasn't. <br /> <br /> What I saw is a film full of promise that has joined several audiences and the inexperienced viewer a short but true eye in the life of a young man whose childhood was a living hell but what it triumphs in spite of everything. This film did it - and a dry eye of any color in the theater proved it. It takes someone to know the topics in this movie to know when the truth is offered. It takes a talented movie maker to tell you the story convincingly when you haven't experienced it. And if he could move on to an audience and respond to an audience, the filmmaker did his job. In any movie. Black, white, purple or polka dotted. It makes good cinema. Bravo, Denzel Washington, Derek Luke, Joy Bryant and most of all, Antwone Fisher - you have indeed won.
