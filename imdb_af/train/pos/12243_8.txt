Kate Beckinsale is as good as no better than Gwyneth Paltrow as Emma in this movie, although I really liked Gwyneth Paltrow in the other Emma version. They are both good in different ways. However, Kate Beckinsale as Emma looks more interesting, almost. And I also liked the woman Harriet Smith played in this movie, better ... she was more credible sweet and sentimental. There are some things I like better about the Gwyneth Paltrow version, like how the humorous side is clearer.
