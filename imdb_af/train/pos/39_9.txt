This is apparently one of Shemp's first shorts at Stooges. (This includes his many earlier vaudeville years with the team). But the threesome's comic timing is the best here. Apart from the intense slapstick scenes, others are subtle but just as funny. Watch Larry when Shemp asks him to look at the camera for a snapshot. Or look at the true object that Moe calls out, "Oh ... highly polished mahogany!" <br /> <br /> Emil Sitka is on his disturbed goofist. And the goon may look scary, but he's somehow funny. He looks so frustrated and confused with the Stooges as ordinary people in other shorts. <br /> <br /> For Shemp actors, it's an episode. It won't disappoint.
