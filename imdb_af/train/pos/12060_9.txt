I really miss the production of good old fashion spooky movies. If the Ismail dealer and James Ivory were given the job of producing such a movie, it might be the one, except for the lack of an internationally renowned top loading. It is one of those movies that you see alone on a dark night with a pizza and some popcorn, and you don't even bother the dishes until the morning, because you just want to stick under the lids. Bravo to Director Herbert Wise, Authors Susan Hill and Nigel Kneale, Top Production designed by Jon Bunker, Art Direction by John Ralph and an excellent role to make me feel and feel so isolated, even though I live in one of the most populous cities in the world in the early 21st century. I gave it a "9" out of "10" because with the television production and budget constraints they really made a big show.
