Lots of love and life can be learned to look at the people around the corner. <br /> <br /> Ernst Lubitsch got another quiet triumph at his credit with this beautiful movie. With sparkling dialogue (courtesy of his prolonged colleague Samson Raphaelson) and wonderful performances of a cast of talented artists, he created a memorable movie. Always believing in the intelligence of his viewers and promoting the sophistication of slapstick, the director created a brilliant movie story that was crossed with the elusive, enigmatic quality known as the Lubitsch touch. "<br /> <br /> Although The story is in Budapest (and there are a lot of accents among the players), it has no effect. The beautiful simplicity of the plot is that any large American city or small town easily the locus for the action. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Stewart & Margaret Sullavan are wonderful as the clerks fall in love with romance and then with each other - without knowing them. Their dialogue - so properly handled that Looks completely natural - carry their confusion and silent despair as they seek for soulmates, one of the classic love stories of the theater. <br /> <br /> Cherubian Frank Morgan has a more serious role than usual, of a man whose transitional interest in his small world is broken when he finds himself a cuckold, a completed playwright, he leaves no emotion to escape, and in addition, Morgan presents the film with his most joyous moments - near the end - When he determined that his shop's newest employee, an arm a rm, enjoy a memorable Christmas Eve. <br /> <br /> Joseph Schildkraut adds another lively portrayal to his grid of screen images, this time that of an obscure, sycophantic Lothario who deserves the punishment, eventually invented him. Soft Felix Bressart has his best film role as a family member who really can't afford to get involved in shop fashions, but remains a solid friend of Stewart. <br /> <br /> Sara Haden grabs the small role of a sales clerk. William Tracy is hilarious as the ambitious worship service that benefits from unforeseen developments to harness itself at the outlets. <br /> <br /> In small roles, Charles Halton plays a no-nonsense detective and Edwin Maxwell appears as a pompous doctor. Movie Mavens recognizes Mary Carr & Mabel Colcord - both unreasonable - in their single scene as Miss Sullavan's grandmother and aunt.
