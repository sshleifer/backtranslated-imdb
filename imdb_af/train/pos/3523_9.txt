A bizarre and brilliant combination of talents between director, Robert Siodmak and Ella Raines as secretary trying to save her electric chair boss by tracing a mysterious "phantom" woman, and Franchot Tone as a mad and murderous sculptor. In addition, there are some fascinating smaller parts played by Elisa Cook Jr. as an outdated drummer, as well as other characters that form part of the conspiracy. If you see Raines in more healthy parts, she may go overboard here, especially in her scenes with Cook. Franchot Tone also plays someone else, and although it is not a convincing part, he acts phenomenally. While the conspiracy is too continuous, the film has real atmosphere and is very interesting.
