Fascist chief, Miss Togar (Mary Woronov, who is knowledgeable by expert photographer Dean Cundy as if she was ten meters long), has a plan to turn her high completely square. Complications come from the challenge of the beautiful rock'n'roller Riff Randell (PJ Soles who lights the screen - she also has a hot bid) who is an obsessive fan of the punk band THE RAMONES. Pal Kate Rambeau (Dey Young, whose big-eyed goggles and nerdy role can't hide her beautiful beauty) commits Riff to an end to the supposed crisis of killing Rock'n'roll for good, which Togar's desired mission. /> <br /> Vincent Van Patten has a hilarious role as Tom Roberts, a success in everything but being laid. Kate loves Tom. If he could just pull his head out of the sand, he saw it. Clint Howard almost steals the movie (honestly, who can steal this movie away from Soles?) As Eaglebauer, "the provider" who can almost get anything. His office is in the boy's toilet! Paul Bartel is also hilarious as a music teacher who becomes an ally of Riff's when he enjoys THE RAMONES concert. <br /> <br /> A High High School skirt that defends all the rules of normality. And I loved it. It's like someone just says, "Let's make life fun for 1Â½ hours." The movie is really anarchy. A plot-less chaos that the RAMONES loves with all its hearts (even if they are horrible actors, they have the opportunity to get new audiences with this movie.) <br /> <br /> The ending pretty much the movie as a whole. Riff and her classmates take over the high school and start a massive party. To be honest, I don't want the party to end! Not conventional in any way whatsoever, this movie just lets us lose a madness. Guided by a great soundtrack with some of the best songs from the RAMONES, this movie allows a viewer to take a life time when war does not dominate and people just have a good time had. That, I think the days were.
