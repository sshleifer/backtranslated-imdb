It seems to be an elegant production with a low budget. The variety of characters is wonderful, from ax-wielding dwarfs to 7ft ghouls! I enjoyed the relationship between the leaders, not too sentimental, but romantic enough to keep the interest. I also enjoyed the mix of humor (it can be very easy to be wrong, too much / not enough), which means it hasn't become too dark or too spooky. It was a big step from Eaves' other efforts, Hellbreeder and Sanitarium, in terms of storyline and production. They have a good site worth checking out. Can't wait for jobs, if the level of improvement persists, it should be fantastic.
