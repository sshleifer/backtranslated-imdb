Yes I have a copy of it on VHS, rude in good condition that I transferred to DVD and if anyone wants to bring back the memories of a Christmas classic, please send me at dmd2222@verizon.net. I searched everywhere and found nothing. this and I thought I could not be the only one on this planet who has these classics on tape, but should be other people and if they fit in, it is very little with these classics, so I consider myself happy and I has all the muppets Christmas except one that John Denver did with the muppets, I think she calls a smoky mountain vacation, not sure but his proximity.
