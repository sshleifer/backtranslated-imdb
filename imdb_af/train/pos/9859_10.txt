Ice Age is not just animation of the year (in my eyes), it's also the best animated feature I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> Last year, the teaser excited me and I have many happy hours on the site. Scrat is cool! And so is the rest of the Sub Zero Heroes. <br /> <br /> The animation is great. Your heart really goes out to the characters in this movie. They have good dialogue and are well developed. It's hard to tell who really steals the photo. <br /> <br /> I experienced their journey with laughter, tears and amazement. Nothing is forced or done. The emotion was real, especially in the dramatic second half. The last film that made me so profound was Anastasia in 1997, also a Fox Production. And before that was The Land Before Time 1988. Everyone has real charm and tries to entertain all the audience, not just the cynics. 10/10 <br /> <br />
