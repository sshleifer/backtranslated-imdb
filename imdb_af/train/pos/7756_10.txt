I'm not sure if it's a kind of masterpiece or just a fluffy fluff raised by the performances and visuals. Whatever the case, I'm sure I loved it. From the wonderfully twisted, lousy, intricate stories to the wonderfully sinister performances of Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone to the vibrant, gaudy color that captures it all, it is a high-class waste and is very enjoyable. Not to mention the amusingly clever and thinly veiled sexual sub-texts that penetrate the entire movie, always threatening to escape from the image in the dialogue, but never to do so. I would lie if I said that the film's entertaining value did not add my love for it, but there is some bizarre artwork behind the unintended (or was it?) Comedy and I really dug it. I could really get into these melodrama things.
