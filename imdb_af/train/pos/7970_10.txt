This movie is definitely on the list of my top 10 favorites. The voices for the animals are wonderful. Sally Field and Michael J. Fox are both brilliant as the salty cat and the young inexperienced poker, but the right look is Don Ameche as the old, faithful golden retriever. This movie is a good family movie because it is appreciated and loved by children as well as adults. Humourous and exciting, and guaranteed to make every animal lover! (happy tears!)
