I have to vote for this 10 out of 10 in the rare chance of seeing this review, compassion, seducing me in Hollywood and engaging me in her freaky / funny world. But in all seriousness it was good. The first episode finds it clear that it is the feet, but it has completely gone through the Silverman weirdness. It's not a loud kind of comedy, but it's good, too much has a laugh track and it won't be right with clues when to laugh, it's for the audience to hear their inner girl at the absurdity of everything. I can easily see it as the bizarro Drew Carey show with its strange characters and incredibly strong central character. Well worth a watch, looking forward to the following episodes. A very good chance of the usual comedy out there. <br /> <br /> ps, Sarah? Call me ....
