Make no mistake, Maureen O'Sullivan is easily the most beautiful Jane ever, and there will never be one more beautiful. She is visually amazing. In addition, it takes more than a beautiful woman to make a good movie. It's a good movie. It not only has the classic Tarzan aura, but also the feel of the continuing saga. We are involved with the two white hunters looking for ivory, one of them in love with Jane, the other, a rye-like catalyst whose character is one of the best described and best explored in the film history. And these features are what make big action movie stand out as a classic. There is the awkward racism portrayed. The Africans, however, are portrayed as individuals, and in the end two become even more heroic than the white hunters, and stand out as such. In fact, the one who is not mentioned surely makes the audience more sympathetic than any other character. The final is also one of the reasons to enjoy this movie. The big lion attack has never been duplicated, and the abomination is well implied with character reactions more than a modern gore movie would have with graphic depiction. If I left something out, it was because I didn't want the picture to be grounded for those who didn't see it. But that's all you want in a movie.
