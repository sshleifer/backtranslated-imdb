It's not a profound movie; Most of the plot aspects are pretty predictable and "faithful and true", but it was well-done and made interesting points about what we can regret (we call "mistakes" like the movie they are) when we look back over our lives. I didn't read the book, so it didn't know much else than the story of a dying woman who had strong memories of long ago that she didn't really share with anyone. Luckily they got a highlight ... Meryl <br /> <br /> Stripe's daughter, Mamie Gummer, plays the young Lila, and then Meryl appears at the end of the movie like the old Lilac ... In addition to an amazing deal (duh!) the younger actress did a good job (maybe not quite to her mother's caliber, but who is?) All the others in this movie were good, although i wanted to be more of Glen Close and thought Buddy's character was too dramatic. <br /> <br /> It's more of a girl movie than the guys, but a good one to watch with your mom or your daughter, and maybe start a dialogue. How hard it is to really know a parent as a "person"!
