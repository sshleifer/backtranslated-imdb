Eddie Murphy Delirious is by far the funniest thing you'll ever see in your life. You can compare it to any movie, and I will warn you that Delirious is the funniest movie ever! This movie is about 1 hour. 45 min., And throughout that time there was hardly a moment where I didn't laugh. You will laugh for hours after it is over, and play the punch lines over and over in your head. Eddie Murphy has so many funny performances about his career (48 hours, Trading Places, Beverly Hills Cop, Rouge, Come to America, Nutty Professor, Shrek, etc.), but that's by far his MOST HILIERE moment. I've seen this movie so many times, and it's harder every time. It never loses its edge. From this day forward, every major act of Delirious will be emulated. ***** and two inches up!
