I was very impressed with this small, independent photo. The story, about some social publishers who meet, becomes friends, offering each other a support system that looks like children, sometimes hilarious, sometimes sad, but always challenging. Music, mostly through underground ties, was of great influence as well as experimenting with camera angles, filters and slow or fast motion techniques. The performances (the leaders are played by the authors and directors of the film) are among the best I've seen in the past few years. If you ever felt like a square pin forced into a round closure, I really believe you would appreciate "By Hook or Door Crook".
