This movie is hilarious, original and beautifully targeted. I became a BIG SWIM group and followed it up to movie festivals whenever and wherever I could. I've seen it for about half a dozen times, and each time the enthusiastic audience response confirmed my feeling that it is one of the best movies to come out in years. Almost every festival has selected it, it has either sold out or won the audience favorite award. Clearly, people like this movie, and even more clearly why they do it. The cinematography is wonderful, the characterization and acting brilliant, the end fantastic, and the direction of compassion, wisdom and the art of perfect timing. It's hard to believe it's Ishai Setton's first movie. I hope it will be released soon so everyone can see it.
