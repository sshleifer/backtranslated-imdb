As someone born to a German mother and English father (who took five years in a prisoner of war camp), I come from a unique position. One of the different Nazis on one side of the family and the victors of World War II, on the other. These miniseries cannot be obscured in every part of Hitler's psyche and must give the viewer a general flavor of the situation and at that time Hitler's state of mind. In this the series does very well. Carlyle is very good like O'Toole, but I wanted to find out more about the relationships with others in the party. Because Hitler did nothing on his own. He had people around him who often followed him after the letter, no doubt and certainly no doubt later in his murderous career. What did Goebbels, Goring and Hess think? It would have been helpful to see more of these relationships. But I hope it will make people investigate the topic more. It can also make people understand why someone like Saddam Hussein cannot be allowed to stay in power.
