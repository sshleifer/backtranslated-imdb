Okay, so it comes a few weeks late, but it's here. This is usually due to statements of different negative nature. Start with the technology. When Star Trek: TOS walked in, special power technology was extremely low, and more than that, the crew had little money to do any kind of proper mockery. In the 35 years since TOS premiered, Star Trek's crew became economics experts. <br /> <br /> Eventually, they definitely decided on the appearance of TOS and reverse engineered TNG et al. So, if they decided not to make the carrier gold glitter, or did the phase guns look closer to Star Trek II's? Being neatly picked over the first contact with the Klingon Empire, it is based on comments by Kirk and Riker that the Earth only met the Klingon in 2200. Nothing was firmly established. <br /> <br /> Enterprise gives us the most promising place of exploration we've seen for a while. That's what Voyager could have been. No series can develop without some inconsistencies, but be thankful that Star Trek has so little. So, don't touch and enjoy.
