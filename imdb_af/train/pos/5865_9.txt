Seen it on the cable back in the early 90's and loved it. Never saw it again before it recently appeared on the cable. Still, it finds a great Vietnam movie. Not sure why it's not higher. I found everything about this movie compelling. As a vet (not from Vietnam) I can relate to the situations brought by Harris and De Niro. I can only imagine that this film is now more gripping with our situation in Iraq. I wish it would be on cable more often for people to see. The human toll on our soldiers is not left on the battlefield. It was brought to the rest of the house. And this movie is one of many that brings the house in a very hard way. Excellent movie.
