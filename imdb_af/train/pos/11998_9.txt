This movie was beautiful. It was full of memorable images, good acting, and subject matter. It will be very easy to write it off as too sentimental, but these are the sentiments that try to achieve this type of movie. I was completely involved in the unfolding and presentation of the story. There were some stocking shots, but it is expected in a religious propaganda movie. The only complaint I can call is there were not a lot of details. However, this film was not created to explain every element of Joseph Smith's life, ministry, triumphs, controversies, failures, etc. It is designed for a quick look at some of the highlights of one of the greatest American and historical religious figures of all time.
