I've enjoyed Still Crazy over any movie I've seen for years. A successful band from the 70's decided to give it another three. They start out with some performances in some seedy European locations, with hilarious results. The music is fantastic, the screenplay and acting are great. The characters are on the verge, especially the lead singer with the high heavy metal voice, makeup and personality issues. The concert at the end was unreal. Check out, preferably in a theater with a good sound system :)
