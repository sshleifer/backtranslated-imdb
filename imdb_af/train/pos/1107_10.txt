In the classic sense of the four spirits (which is not specific to the concept of funny or even entertainment), Altman is "H.E.A.L.T.H." Treat all the moods, and actually in very funny, entertaining ways. There is the Phlegm, as personified by Lauren Bacall's very slow, guarded and protective character. Esther Brill, whose mission appears to be alive, is all about the look and protects the secrets of her age and beauty more than her well-being. There is Paul Dooley's Choleric Dr. Gil Gainey, who, like a sore from a fish (perhaps more like a seal) flanking, barking and admonishing the crowd to subscribe to his waterly madness. The Melancholy of Glenda Jackson's Isabella Garnell bangs on Shakespeare's upset and self-righteous Hamlet - even a soliloquy or two. And don't forget Henry Gibson's Bile character, Bobby Hammer ("The breast that feeds the baby ruled the world"). Then there are the characters Harry Wolff and Gloria Burbank (James Garner and Carol Burnett respectively), relatively healthy characters who find a kind of balance between all the companions and extreme humor that H.E.A.L.T.H. invested. - a kind of world trade organization specializing in H.E.A.L.T.H., anything other than health. This is Altman's classic best.
