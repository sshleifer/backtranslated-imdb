I saw it as on the wonderful world of disney as a child, so I didn't recall much of it. As I recently watched, I sat there thinking, "This is the weirdest thing I've seen." <br /> <br /> The 'travel' scenes look like something caused by an overdose of LSD. The animated characters are mostly strange colored / pronounced versions of Jungle Book and Robin Hood characters. Some non-so-Disney stuff I noticed: children are being threatened at knife tip and prostitutes (during the Portobello Road song). <br /> <br /> It was very entertaining, though the music numbers were long and I can't see children getting bored with them. The subject was also a bit dark, as it was set during World War II.
