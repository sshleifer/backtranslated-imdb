This is an excellent movie for female body builder and female action fans! I think Sue Price did a good job in this film series (Nemesis 2,3,4) and was a good fighter. She has a very striking look and an iron fog to withstand the powerful Nebula (Nemesis 2). Although it is not a great movie and Sue Price's acting skills have not come across the best in my life, the movie itself was great, a valuable jewel for fans of female bodybuilder action! Well, some parts of Nemesis 2 have been copied by other well-known sci-fi movies, such as Terminator or Predator, but that's not the point. The point is that A.Puyn has thrown into that movie, a talented builder who shows all her energy and body numbers to show us the best she can do. I really enjoyed that movie and watched with the same enthusiasm Nemesis 3 (a little boring successor) and Nemesis 4 (a much more interesting sequel than 3). What a pity it hasn't been shown on DVD yet :-(
