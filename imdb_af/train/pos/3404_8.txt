Audiences back in 1936 had to be amazed at what they watched: a full-fledged, full-length Technicolor movie. I can't say for sure, but it could be the first one (3-strip). Anyway, it still looks more than 70 years later beautifully on DVD. In fact, just how good it looks, is wonderful. <br /> <br /> Kudos has to go out to director Richard Boleslowski, director of photography Virgil Miller, Selznick International Pictures and for the DVD MGM Home Entertainment. Everyone has combined to give us one of the best movies of the classic era. <br /> <br /> I thought the story was so great: excellent in the first half, stagnant in the second. It eventually gave a good message, even though many people were not satisfied. I can no longer say without spoiling things. <br /> <br /> Marlene Dietrich never looked better, I don't believe and certainly never played such a soft character (Domini Enfilden). Heartbreak Charles Boyer was the male star and Domini's object of love, but some of the little characters were the most interesting to me. People like Joseph Schildkraut as "Batouch;" John Carradine as "The Sand Diviner;" The most memorable, at least for me, was the dancer "Irena," played by Tilly Losch. Wow, there's a face and a dance you won't soon forget! I have never seen anything like it in the thousands of movies I saw. Just to see her, her thing is worth the price of the DVD. Watch her IMDb resume, she was only in four movies, but they were all well-known films. <br /> <br /> Basil Rathbone, the actor who really got to play Sherlock Holmes, is also here as well as C. Aubrey Smith, another famous British actor of his day. Schildkraut is incidentally recognized by classic movie buffs as the man who played the arrogant sales clerk in the big hit, The Shop Around The Corner, with Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullivan. <br /> <br /> The beautiful direction, photography and color, and Tilly's dance, are the things I will remember best about this movie which is very good and not-so-good that went into one role . If the last half hour had been better - though I admired the end, I'd have rated it even higher. It's definitely one movie collectors want to add to their collection.
