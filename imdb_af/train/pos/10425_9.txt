THE BIG CARUSO was the biggest hit in the world in 1951 and broke all the box office records at Radio City Music Hall in a year when most movergoers watched their new 7 "Motorola TVs. - because they do not adjust to inflation, it is clear that today's $ 10 movies will dominate, and in 1951 it costs 90c to $ 1.60 at Radio City, 44c to 75c first run at Loew's Palace in Washington DC, or 35c to 50c in neighborhood circles What this number is is the number of people responding to the photo, not unadjusted cash office "media spin." The genius of the GREAT CARUSO was that filmmakers took most of the real life of Enrico Caruso (really not a good story anyway) and it was thrown in the trash, instead of 90% of the film's focus on music, MGM made us the best live opera singer MARIO LANZA to make the music of the best ever historical opera singer ENRICO CARUSO, the result at was a great movie So will LANZA throw his life and career away from overeating. Too much to play the STUDENT PRINS, Edmund Purdom went his place - called Lanza's voice, and with the previously attractive and non-fat Lanza that appeared in the ad. If you want to see the BIG CARUSO, it's almost always on eBay for $ 2.00 or less. Do not deter the low price as it only reflects the easy availability of copies, not the quality of the movie.
