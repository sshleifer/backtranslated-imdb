From the opening scene aboard a crowded train where a ruthless bag case is at work (RICHARD WIDMARK) stealing a woman's purse (JEAN PETERS), PICKUP ON SOUTH STREET is constantly fascinating to watch. Partly because the play is uniformly strong throughout the film, the B&W photography is sharp and adds to the strength of the story and characters, and because Samuel Fuller's direction places him in the same league with the biggies like John (ASPHALT JUNGLE) Huston. In fact, it has the same urgency as the Huston movie about a wrong hoist - but the payout isn't quite as strong. <br /> <br /> JEAN PETERS is excellent as the hard edge that Widmark describes as "much overturned". She gives a lot of raw energy and sex to her role of the not too shiny woman wearing a microfilm in her wallet for her boyfriend (Richard Richley), something the FBI already knows. They are on her route when the theft occurs. <br /> <br /> THELMA RITTER adds realism to her portrait of a woman called "Moe" who buys and sells everything to make a profit and eventually pay her life. She becomes especially in her final scene with Kiley. <br /> <br /> This one is guaranteed to keep your attention by running one and twenty minutes of running. Good noir from Fox and notable for the performances of Widmark, Peters and Ritter.
