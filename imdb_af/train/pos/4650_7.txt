As an employee of the Swedish Air Force, I enjoyed the beautiful Gripen and Hkp 9 (MBB Bo 105) flight scenes in this movie. One of the few disappointments was the EWS 39 sorry pod, in this case an inert Rb 75 (Maverick) missile was painted black with the letters EWS 39 in white along the side. Real sorry pods certainly do not look like that, at least not the one I saw. <br /> <br /> But apart from that, it's an entertaining movie with a very amusing end (last minute). Anyone interested in watching several Swedish military units, including the now legendary CSS, on film, should see this one. <br /> <br />
