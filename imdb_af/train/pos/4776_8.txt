I watched this movie at one of my usual times, which is really late at night. Usually, if a movie doesn't interest me, I start to fall asleep and touch the fridge to stay awake. <br /> <br /> Initially, I thought that was what I had to do since the beginning of this film's pace, along with the fact that his shots were tending to stay with the character long ago. But after a while I start more in the movie, as more about the main character is told by his story. By the end you feel that you know him all your life. The film kept my interest so bad that I didn't even know the sun was going to rise. <br /> <br /> Not much of Lynch's bizzare style, but there are plenty of quirky characters to make the movie amusing.
