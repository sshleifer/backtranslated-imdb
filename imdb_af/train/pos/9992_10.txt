... it's a classic with so many good dialogues and scenes that nobody should miss. Fun story, funny wealth-to-clumsy situations, Mel Brooks is not a bad lead, maybe not perfect, but he's funny; D Don't pay attention to the rating, it's BS. Look at it, see something like the final destination (2009) and tell me that Life Stinks deserves the same rating. If you do, I don't think we can be friends. XD At this stage, I recommend the fourth season of "Staying Enthusiastic" to every Brooks fan;) Vote 10 against the ignorance of inchworms! I need to make 10 lines here to post a comment? I don't want to write a book here: P
