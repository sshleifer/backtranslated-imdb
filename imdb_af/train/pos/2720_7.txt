IN COLD BLOOD should be classified as first-rate movies, even if the subject is as grim as it is in the make-believe world, but movie noir fans must definitely find this one a grabbing piece of work based on the fact It is a real life crime spree. <br /> <br /> It opens with Quincy Jones' music under the credits and strong dramatic views of a highway bus heading to Kansas City, effectively setting the scene for the movie. even before the credits end. The B & W photography of Conrad Hall is a great work from the start. <br /> <br /> Also clear from the start: ROBERT BLAKE and SCOTT Wilson are naturally born actors. They do a great job of setting up generous friends looking for the next excitement. "Do you ever see a millionaire braai in the electric hair? No, there are two kinds of rules in the world, one for the rich and one for the poor," Wilson says, while sitting for a while behind the wheel. <Br /> <br /> Both are meant to cross the path of a farm family, show no mercy, and leave no witnesses behind. <br /> <br /> Blake, reminiscent of movies and thinking of gold in Mexico, says: "Remember Bogart in" The Treasure of the Sierra Madre "?" (An ironic moment, because Blake herself was in the movie as a little boy selling lottery tickets). "I held you for a natural-born killer," Wilson said to Blake. <br /> <br /> JOHN FORSYTHE is one of the chief investigators on the scene, discovering that all four family members are tied up, shot in the head and one has cut his throat. "Don't people shut doors here?" asked PAUL STEWART. "They'll be tonight," the sharp answer. <br /> <br /> After the murders, the murderers discovered that there was "no big grease in the wall," as their prison informant told them. So, in the end, it was really a stupid, senseless crime. The question is: why did they do that? And this is something that explores the second half of the film in depth. It takes an hour and a half in the movie before the detectives catch up with the killers and start the interrogation. <br /> <br /> These are the final scenes that carry the most conviction and interest as the boys are told. I made many mistakes and left a living witness. The real events up to the murder are saved to the end. "It doesn't make sense," says Blake Forsythe. "Mr Cutter was a very good gentleman. I thought so until the time I cut his throat." The script by Richard Brooks is concise and to the point - and so is his direction. <br /> <br /> Summary: Brilliant depiction of two aimless young men on a crime boom that's not or not just $ 43.
