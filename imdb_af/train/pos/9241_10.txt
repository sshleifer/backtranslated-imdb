Hey people, how are you? This is my husband, the only Mike "Sonny Sakura KIller" Kelly. You know ....... you can't really write a review on Sakura's writing, because we didn't have one. As far as I know, the story just made up when we went along. I had the best time of my life to make that movie, and I pushed so much that I ran out of Jism ... nice times. So glad you're all enjoying the movie. I really didn't do the battles I intended. Every time I set up a few moves, the fighter director changed it. Yet I experienced an explosion and met some very good people. Especially the purple female ninja who seems to fall from the movie scene.
