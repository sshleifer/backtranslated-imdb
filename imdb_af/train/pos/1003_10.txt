Another masterpiece of Aussie, it delves into the world of the unknown and the supernatural, and it does very well. It doesn't matter for the big special effects left over like American movie, but focuses more on emotional impact. A relatively simple plot that Rebecca Gibney & Co. bring to life. It follows the story of a couple buying an old house that was supposedly home to a very old woman who never went out and whose husband had disappeared in mysterious circumstances since. Strange things started happening in the house, and John Adam began to turn into the man who disappeared, who was actually a mass murderer. Highly recommended. 8/10
