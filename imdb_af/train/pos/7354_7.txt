For the first time over 25 years ago, I watched this movie on British TV and only bought it on the DVD copy last week that ebay bought. I remembered the musical sequences, the color and the beautiful fashionable set of clothes, but the plot is weaker than the early Anna Neagle / Michael Wilding movie. The spring in Park Lane and Maytime is not as good after the years have passed. . But Michael Wilding is a joy in the film, charm, funny, debonair, seems to have fun and on top of his form. Worth watching for him alone. Anna Neagle appears a little matron next to him, and a bit too old for the role she plays, but by the end of the 1940s their movie partnership was well-established with the film that the public will do. Spring in Park Lane was a highlight for 1947 and a big money maker. In his autobiography, Wilding wrote his great interest for Herbert Wilcox the director and author of this London series of films.
