After the sitcom world was set up with 'Father Ted' Arthur Matthews and Graham Linehan's next creation, a forgotten gem for the BBC was called 'Hippies'. Although created by the couple, Arthur Matthews wrote the six scriptures alone. <br /> <br /> In London in 1969 - hippie Ray Purbs is the editor of an anarchic magazine. His friends are his buddy, the very laid back and cannabis smoke. Alex, his "girlfriend" is feminist Jill and the not too bright Hugo. <br /> <br /> Simon Pegg was great like Ray, but he's great. In everything he is. This sitcom had a sense of 'Citizen Smith' about it. Ray was much like Wolfie Smith, trying to hit society, but failed. Eventually, this sitcom will be released on DVD in March. I can't wait to buy it. As it was in 1999 and repeated on rural television, my memories are not too good for the sitcom, but I remember two episodes very clearly. The first is the opener 'Protesting Hippies' that I thought was a good start. - Where Ray goes on a shrug and the other episode was "Hippy Dippy Hippies" I think episode 4 was, again a clear memory of the police. Unfortunately, the sitcom had a negative reaction from viewers (I can't think why). The BBC has ordered another series, but Arthur Matthews has decided to do so because of the negative reaction. Oh yes, I can't wait for the DVD. <br /> <br /> Best Episode: Hippy Dippy Hippies Series 1 Episode 4.
