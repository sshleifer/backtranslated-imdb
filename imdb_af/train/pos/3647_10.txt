I love it when they actually do a sports story. So much in the past was so hokey it was embarrassing to watch. Not this one. It's just a really nice movie, an old-fashioned story - and based on a real man who did exactly what Dennis Quaid did in this movie. He plays a high school coach who is spoken to later athletically speaking, to become a jug in professional baseball. Eventually he achieved his goal of making it to the big leagues, even though it was very short. <br /> <br /> All the characters here are beautiful people, the kind you are rooting for, from Quaid to the players on his high school team, to his little boy (Angus T. Jones, now a bit of a star television.) <br /> <br /> Quaid is credible in playing Jim Morris because, unlike past actors in sports movies, he knows how to throw a baseball. He looks like a jug, a man who can burn 90-plus miles an hour. And most of these movies are true, as witnessed by the actual jug in one of the documentaries on the DVD. <br /> <br /> So, if you are looking for a beautiful, inspiring real life sports movie, you can't do this one wrong.
