Eight simple rules started out as a very entertaining series. I love John Ritter and his character, Paul Hennessey, and the relationship he had with his children was the best part of the show. <br /> <br /> I always chose Kerry for Bridget, Bridget has been done before, Kerry is quite unique and I can relate to her in many ways. Although I am not sure, she is heading towards her character in later series. <br /> <br /> Early episodes were nice, good simple teenage plots about Paul and Cate discipline The kids, but I think the show lost it when John Ritter died. I admired the team and the crew for the wish to continue the series, but when he died, I felt the program had. For me, the whole point of the show was based on the guide of the 8 simple rules to date my teenage daughter. It was written by a real man with teenage daughters and the relevance and angle of the show changed without the Hennessey father. <br /> <br /> Bridget was more annoying, Rory remained the same, and Cate always gave her offspring the lessons of life that were more enjoyable when it all left Paul. I think the grandfather is funny (especially when looking at Great Escape), but C.J is unnecessary for the show. He is funny in parts, but I felt that the story lines at the time of his arrival were very similar to other American comedies. About all the latest people is not bad, just excitement is missing and someone else finds it annoying that Cate works at school and C.J and Oupa are always there too? I would recommend this show to both friends. It was very strong at the beginning, and worth watching for Paul and Kerry, but later it was at its best average.
