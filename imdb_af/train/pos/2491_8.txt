Budget constraints, time constraints, shoot a script and then cut it, cut it, cut it ... This crew is a group of good, young filmmakers; thoughtful in this writing - yes, allegorically - clever in zero-dollar effects when time and knowledge are all you have, depending on actors and friends and others for their time, dedication, places, and get a first feature in the look , a 1-in-1000 thing. These guys make movies. Goedes. Watch their shorts collection "Heartland Horrors" and see the development. And I can approve, to work with them, about the best thing you will do in the business. I am amazed by harsh, abusive criticism for this film, and wondering if one reviewer even heard one word of dialogue, considered one thought or concept, or if all that was required of this work was the visual gore of bashing and slashing some to satisfy senseless view of what horror should mean to an audience. Let "The Empty Acre" bring himself to you. Don't presume what you expect, it just has to be because it's placed in the horror / thriller genre because of its supernatural premise. It is a drama with depth above and beyond how far you can hold a blade in someone with a reverence for a message that does not assault your brain's visual center, but rather on your empathic imagination to the suffering of others sense and spirit. brand ridgway, Curtis, "The Empty Acre"
