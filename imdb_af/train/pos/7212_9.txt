I would not hesitate to ever post this adaptation of "Death Trap" to a top 5 list of the best scene-to-movie adaptations. Caine and Reeves (an underrated actor who never really had a chance to do more than day-romance and "Superman") play each other very well here. Even Dyan Cannon - which I don't normally care about - was perfectly thrown into a role that her annoyance used to actress. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure Deathtrap's comparisons with Sleuth - another brilliant screen alignment with Michael Caine - are valid or even fair. Yes, the two stories are very common. But "Sleuth" is so much about war warfare as the battle of wit, and the house in "Sleuth" is at least as much a character in the film as the two actors - the house does not really have an equivalent in Deathtrap. "is not so much a fight of mind, as it is a pointed vignette on how people are not well condemned (and never as smart as they think they are) and deserve everything they get. that both movies are excellent examples of the genre, and worth your time and money - this is America, you do not have to choose! <br /> <br /> I will not give away the twists of the plot but I don't think it matters anyway. I watched the DVD eight or nine times in a dozen years, and still enjoy the chemistry and timing and the common moments when everything goes "pearly." done so well that the ride became more important than the real destination. <br /> <br /> Anyone who enjoys black-and-white comedy and excitement in the Hitchcock style of film production will probably enjoy 'Deathtrap'.
