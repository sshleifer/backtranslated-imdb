With beautiful cinematography and a thread of Kafkaesque absurdity, this movie features the simple but fascinating opening scene. The movie is much like a dream, and I think it might be why people don't hate or love it either. Characters are superficially drawn and the story itself is slim and perhaps a bit senseless. But these are failures of the movie, but conscious choices. The film works do not work as history, but rather a deconstruction of war films from the 1940s. <br /> <br /> I would struggle to argue that there was a lot of real content for the movie, but the movie is such a wonderful wonder that I've been completely swept away. It's one of the most beautiful filmed movies ever, and there's a wild imagination in its style. I can quite understand why people will hate it, but I give it 9/10.
