'Presque Rien' is a beautifully observed portrait of the experiences of a young French gay. To distinguish stereotypes and preaching, it is a wonderfully naturalistic film, performed excellently, shot with a feel for the coastal village where action takes place, never melodramatic, but often painfully real. As something, it is almost too realistic, because there is little in the way of conventional plot, only plays from a life. But the absence of conventional dramatic tension counts for less than it can be subtly drawn in a world. 'Presque Rien' may not have been the most exciting movie ever made; but its simple humanism serves it well in comparison to the preconceived festive or perceived views that often treat treatments of this theme. Worth a watch.
