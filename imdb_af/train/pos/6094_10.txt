These two stars are the only iconic heroes / villains I know have a good TV show, so let's compare. <br /> <br /> Freddy - 7 movies Robocop - 3 movies <br /> <br /> Freddy - 1 TV series, 2 seasons, about 40 episodes Robocop - 1 TV series, 1 season, about 22 23 episodes. Freddy - 2 extra movies (Freddy vs Jason, Freddy vs Ghostbusters) Robocop - 4 extra movies (Robocop: Prime Directives: Dark Justice, Meltdown, Crach & Burn, Resurrection) <br /> <br /> Freddy - 1 upcoming movie Robocop - 1 upcoming movie <br /> <br /> Who had more screen time? Well, they both have 7 movies, 1 TV series and 1 upcoming movie. But Freddy wins it thanks to his 2 extra films (one is a fan movie) and 17-18 TV episodes. <br /> <br /> As this is a comment for the series, between Freddy's Nightmares - ANOES: The Series & Robocop: The Series I will personally choose Robocop.
