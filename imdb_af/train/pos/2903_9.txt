Tiempo de valientes is a very fun action comedy. After his big fist film El fondo del mar and the spectacular TV program Los simuladores, Damian Szifron has done another good job. Tiempo de valientes made for a moment a movie in Hollywood. Diego Peretti and Luis Luque are two great actors and here they have good performances. The movie is fun and funny and it has wonderful moments.Tiempo de valientes is a very fun action comedy that I totally recommend if you have a good time. And I must congratulate Szifron for all the talent he has. <br /> <br /> Rating: 9
