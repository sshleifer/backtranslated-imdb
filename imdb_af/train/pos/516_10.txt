One of the few best movies of all time. The change from black and white to color for Heaven and Earth Sequences was Directorial Excellence. <br /> <br /> The Plot is extremely clever, the full movie makes you overwhelmed by all the human emotions, and although a war film discriminates against it. I had to see this movie more than anyone else, and I never tire of it. This is a film that challenges your own deaths and beliefs about what happens after our demise.
