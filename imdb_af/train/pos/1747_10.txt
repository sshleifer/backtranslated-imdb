This movie was one of the best movies I've seen this year. I didn't see a cameos in the movie, but it's pretty good. It's similar to Anchorman in the humor department, but I think it's a better composed movie. It actually has a point. If you are going to see a lot of T&A, you will be disappointed. Just a great movie together !! If you have nothing to do for the day or you need a lot of humor, you'll find it a very good movie. I definitely think Ebert and Roeper's review of this movie is right. I mean, I don't really like Ebert at most movies, but that's the movie I'm going to vote for. The film has a good enough story that it's actually credible that these people are out there. There is definitely something to say about how they treat virginity in this movie. Yes, sure, you are laughed at when it is invented, but it still suggests waiting. Steve did a wonderful job of portraying the person he did in this movie and yet it is still funny.
