This is the most compelling and outstanding achievement Robert Taylor has ever given. It even outperforms its wonderful performance as "Johnny Eager" who comes to that movie for a full 14 years. His appearance is still a miracle to look at, but he has a maturity that now gives him the edge in this eager, violent role. Charlie Gilson (Taylor) is the last of his breed, a buffalo hunter who doesn't kill for the money, but for the fun. His wild eyesight of not only buffalo, but humans, is great to watch. He is basically a lonely man who needs the people around him, but they don't like him because of his sociopathic behavior. His partner is Sandy McKenzie (Stewart Granger) who is sick of the hunt, and just goes along, because he's a failure at anything else. Along the way, Charlie kills a family of Indians and gets the beautiful Debra Pagent. Charlie tries to seduce her, but sees that Sandy is also interested in her. Granger is a little sad to look at, so excited about the hunt, who wants to get away with the girl and her baby. Lloyd Nolan as the drunken runner is wonderful with his way of cracking and chord playing. Russ Tamblyn plays the half race trying to fit into a white world. The group is a strange mix of good and evil, young and old. In the end, Taylor is being rinsed by the buffalo, as many hunters had in front of him, and Sandy walks away with the girl. On his return, Sandy goes away with the woman the night and sets Charlie in a hiding place in a quest to find Sandy and have the girl for herself. The final confrontation comes in a snowstorm and the last scene is so shocking that you will never forget it. This is Taylor's movie altogether and he was truly a very underrated actor of the era.
