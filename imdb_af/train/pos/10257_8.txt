What can I say about this movie that has not been said yet? Well to tell the truth, it looks very fake like some of the bangs and kicks. how Charl Charlie, though it was, I don't know. I'm sure they'll hit and kick her much harder than it was. But the scenes with the pinch and the hot oil look very real. And the final needle in the eye scene has been amazingly done and is probably the only thing on film that ever shocked me.
