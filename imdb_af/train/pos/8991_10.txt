DIG! is fun, fun, amusing, interesting, stylish and very well done. Knowing that it was made on such a shocking budget in about 7 years, it is surprising that such a story can be told, especially with such a style and substance. If you are a music fan or a documentary fan, this is a must see. <br /> <br /> Focusing on Brian Jonestown Over the years Masssacre and The Dandy Warhols are a brilliant way to show the contrast between a decent bond that meets with moderate success through perseverance and the ability to compromise and a brilliant megalomaniac lead singer, supported by a variety of role players who sabotage their own success through drugs, alcohol and madness. If I didn't know it was footage of real people, I would swear it was an incredibly well written and imaginative piece. The story is compelling, concise and simple.
