For me, this review may include spoilers, but I like watching movies with no idea what is going to happen, so I think many of the other reviews of this movie contain spoilers! <br /> <br /> I just watched this movie again, and I have to repeat that it has the BEST end to any movie. Ever. Ever. Ever. The correct translation, 'The Beat of the Butterfly's Wings', is not used strangely as the translated title. I think they thought most Americans would not know what Chaos Theory was (except for those who saw or read "Jurassic Park"). The movie is based on the chaos theory and how one small event can affect the outcome of seemingly unrelated events, all leading back to one event. The movie is a whirlwind of wonderful cause and effect, as we follow the chain of chaos as it connects between different characters (about 20?). In a way, however, the end seems inevitable, but if you think about it, it's a perfect ending. Think about yourself, "what else has to be said"? At the same time, it is a very brave end. Sorry, we have to go overseas for a jewel like this one, but an end like this will never come out of Hollywood. <br /> <br />
