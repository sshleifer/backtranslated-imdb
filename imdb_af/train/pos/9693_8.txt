I was very surprised with this movie. I was touched by the life Paulie touched along his way to find his "Marie", the little girl he was divorced. The humor was also very good and it didn't hurt the story, as I thought it would probably do. Actually, I expect 'paulie wants a joke' jokes to hurt this movie, but even this is done in a very humorous scene that gets a lot when Paul is in the research lab. So if you're a good "animal talking" To see, look at this one, much better than Dr DOLITTLE in my opinion. PAULIE also has a surprising turn in the end which is also very well done.
