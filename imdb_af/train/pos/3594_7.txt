Michelle Rodrigez was made for this movie when I first saw her in Fast and the Furious. You could say she was a tough woman. With this movie she not only proved her acting, but she has no fear and is tough as she should be in this movie. She's more of a bad girl and that's what I love about her. This movie is about a troubled girl who lives life as a Tom boy and becomes in constant trouble with school and family. As she is interested in her brothers' training to be a boxer, she decides to go after her love to fight and asks her brothers coach to train her. Although they do not think she has the potential, they are shown incorrectly. <br /> <br /> I think this movie was a bit slow at the end but was well done. It shows that people can do everything, even if they don't think you have the potential. I recommend this to be seen.
