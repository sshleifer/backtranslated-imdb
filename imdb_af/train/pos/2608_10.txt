The last season of Roseanne was a trail of the roller coaster. This last episode does just what a previous comment says, it tells us that as much as we thought we knew the characters we didn't know. Roseanne comes back to season one, and tells us that this show is her performance of her life. She says in this last episode that she changes the events and people as she pleases them. Scott wasn't really with Leon, but he did exist. Mark and David married in real life opposite women, and Dan died when she made him live. As events happened in her life, they changed it in her writing. Don't we all wish we could. We don't all have a moment in the time we wish we could just use and change an eraser. That's what she did with the whole episode. And for another comment I would say I didn't feel cheated, the family was really in my mind, she just changed the way events happened in their lives. An A + ends at an A + show !!
