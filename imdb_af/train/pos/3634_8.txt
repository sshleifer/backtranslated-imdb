I had low expectations for this movie, but I was looking for something unobtrusive for an evening. I was delighted by the theater and a little surprised. It's a very good baseball tribute movie, and a nice lesson about the dream of your dreams. Dennis Quaid does a masterful job with his role, and I was touched by his performance. Definitely a full price tag and a few hours of your time!
