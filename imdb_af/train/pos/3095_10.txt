So what is the reason? Is there a kind of vendetta against this AWESOME show or someone involved? Why would the best show I've seen in years be canceled? I'm addicted. I saw this show randomly in the fall, and immediately loved it and watched it every week. Then it went away and I tried to put it to Tivo, but it was not broadcast. So I forgot for a while until I found the episodes on ABC's website. Now I want MORE. I agree with everyone else - with the rest of the junk on TV today, it was refreshing to see something as well-rounded and developed as it was. I watch Boston Legal for my eccentric-comedic fix, and House for my intellectual-mystery jackass fix. My wife loves Grey's Anatomy for his "realism", and I love / hate the show, but it couldn't go beyond me. AWAY too much drama. Everything that can go wrong does. But for once there is a drama that really is. Real people, real problems. Sure, there are a few extremes like a former gangster got good, girl running down the gang, etc. But these people (especially in NYC) are really out there and I relate to each one of them. I can't get enough. I just hope ABC will get their heads off their bean boats and continue with this show. Get respect for a QUALITY drama out there. It can be one of the best performances of all time. If anyone just lets it go.
