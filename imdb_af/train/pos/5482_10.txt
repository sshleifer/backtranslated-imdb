It's an amazing movie. Apart from the fact that the active footage of key events in the failed coup is shown to eradicate Chavez, we get the background picture describing a class-divided society. Many of the wealthy seem to have a choice with the people's democratic choice, and are prepared to use the army for regime change. "Be careful what you say to your servants" is a revealing comment. The head of the country's largest oil company presents itself as the new president, with American support, and these young Irish filmmakers have it all on camera. A good film to educate young people about democracy. We see transparent documentation of how media can be manipulated and used in the interest of large business to use the interests of the democratic wishes of the people. Sounding good.
