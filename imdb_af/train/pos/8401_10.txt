Love is an independent film. When I sat down to watch the movie, I came in with low expectations, but left with a blessing. The story is poetic, substantive and creative. The author moves you further and further, which is every scene, so you relate to the realistic characters that each one can identify with. The movie has allowed me to reflect on my life and what I think is to be. The film showed what love really is, action does not emotion. I was also impressed with the quality of cinematography and the soundtrack of the movie. The whole presentation exceeded my expectations. I give the movie two big inches and recommend it to everyone of all ages and backgrounds.
