This movie was incredible. This is an inspiring piece of cinema. The characters are fully developed by the truth in which director, Lucy Walker brings the film. I recommend it to someone looking for the special movie that mankind shows in the human condition. Lucy Wlaker displays the beauty of the landscape. This movie id is a true example of man against nature and sometimes man vs man. The inner turmoil and triumph are immense in his subject. The topic of how the Tiebtans view blindness as a sign of demons is interesting. This film sheds light on a particular culture that has never been shown. Lucy Walker gave Erik Weihenmayer a voice when he could not be heard. Thank you, Lucy, for being faithful to your vision as a movie maker.
