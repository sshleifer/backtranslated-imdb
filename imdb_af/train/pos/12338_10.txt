Joan Fontaine stars as the villain in this Victorian era movie. She convincingly plays the married woman who loves a loved one, and also puts her on a rich man, Miles Rushworth, played by Herbert Marshall. Mr. Marshall is pretty good like Miles. Miss. Fontaine performed her part in perfection - at the same time, she was cunning, calculating, innocent, frightened and charmed. It takes an actress with extraordinary talent to pull it off. Joan Fontaine looks absolutely beautiful in the elegant costumes by Travis Banton. Also in the film is Joan's mother, Lillian Fontaine as Lady Flora. I recommend this movie.
