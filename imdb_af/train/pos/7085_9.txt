I just bought the DVD and I have to say after I saw Brazil and Fear dislike in Las Vegas. Terry does it again. While also a fan of the Monty Python movies, Terry Gilliam's genius follows this sci-fi thriller, which Bruce Willis plays a wonderful role as James Cole, and also (perhaps my favorite character) Brad Pitt who the insanity of Jefferey Goines. A must have for sci fi fans, or movie fans of any kind, because it includes tension, drama, action, etc. In. <br /> <br /> In the future, 1% of the world's population survives a disease designed to wipe out humanity, which has been unleashed by the "army of twelve monkeys" in the past. James Cole (Bruce Willis) is sent back to 1996 (which is when the virus is detached) to find out about the disease, so scientists can find a cure in his time. Before I continue, James Cole lives in an underground society, and the animals rule the world on the surface because of the disease that will kill people. Anyway, when he is sent back in time, he is actually sent back to 1990 where he is sent to a spiritual institution because of his notes to people of the virus. During his stay, he meets Jefferey Goins (Brad Pitt), who is later primarily responsible for the extinction of humanity. He also met his psychiatrist (Madelein Stowe) who eventually settled with Bruce to save the world (as she sees correct in his scores), he is sent back and forth from his time to the past and eventually sent to 1996. where he then asks his own common sense, but later penetrates to reveal an exciting end of quarter of the movie and later build up to the somewhat shocking climax, where he tries to the man carrying the virus (not actually Brad Pitt ) and instead shot by the police as the killer gets away.
