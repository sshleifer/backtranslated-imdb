As part of our vocabulary in the late 1950s, we have the Ponderosa, Little Joe, Hoss, Ben Cartwright, and so on. Well known. on that wonderful show "Bonanza." <br /> <br /> It came on Saturday night and everyone was glued to the television. It was a real show depicting family values. There might have been a weekly crisis, but it was the strong family atmosphere that everyone had drawn. <br /> <br /> Lorne Greene was dominant as the patriarch of the family. His words depicted wisdom. We often left to wonder that Ben Cartwright, a widower, should have been the best of men to the poor woman of her who died. He raised wonderful boys. <br /> <br /> Of course, we all wondered why Pernell Roberts left the show. The show was a gold mine and Roberts surrendered a lot of money when he left. His career has never diminished, as he is associated with a Cartwright boy. He had to try to get back in the series. He certainly lost a bonanza by falling out.
