The Bourne Ultimatum (2007) Review: After an exciting set of two, we get the final installment. Here's my take: <br /> <br /> The Bourne Ultimatum has it all. We have Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) on the societies of those who know everything. He ran too long. This time it ends. <br /> <br /> The Bourne Ultimatum has a great plot, wonderful writing, great direction, excitement, and the best action of the summer. Matt Damon may be delivering his best performance to date. He has the conviction and swinging desire of the troubled murderer. <br /> <br /> There are some intelligent humor here and some good excitement. The reactions to certain events will either laugh or cheer you in a good way. (or both) I heard a lot of intelligent laughs in the theater and banged a lot. The audience loves it. <br /> <br /> The Bourne Ultimatum delivers everything in a nice gift pack. All the goods and then some. In my opinion, this is the best movie this summer. <br /> <br /> The Last Word: Excellent Conclusion. The best of the trilogy. That's how summer movie thrillers have to be done. I love the Bourne trilogy.
