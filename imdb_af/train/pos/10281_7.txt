Here is my first David Mamet-directed movie. Fitting, as it was also his first. <br /> <br /> The story here is uneven and moves, like any other movie, from the minor drawbacks to the major drawbacks of the all-encompassing concept. It's like "The Grifters," but without the film's movie. (In that movie John Cusack was so dirty, but that was the character of his character.) The acting here is very flat (I sometimes wondered if the mere play of Crouse would be a kind of attack on psychoanalysis). At least in the beginning. It never really touches well, but it develops after about ten minutes after painfully tight line reading. Early in the film, Lindsay Crouse's lines - as she reads it - sound as if they were inner monologues or narratives, which they are not. When Mantegna arrives, things come up. <br /> <br /> The dialogue here is not as enjoyable as it should be. I thought I had a random song rolling from the tongue, but it didn't. It sounds much read, rather than talk. Maybe Mamet developed and released this movie, but if not, then maybe he should let others say the words. He is too precious here, and as a result, they lose their rhythmic, jazzy quality. What is strange, is it different from that, the movie doesn't look or feel like a play. The camera is a lot of theater. My only issue with Glengarry Glen Ross was that it looked too much like filmed theater, but in the movie the actors were not just perfect, but relaxed and free. Everything flowed. <br /> <br /> I won't mind as much as talking about movie characters talking to movie stripes - or even playing characters playing playing lines - but here it sounds like characters (or even book) characters talk about playing lines. It is a strange jumble of theater and film that just doesn't work. This doesn't mean the movie is bad - it's not, it's often very entertaining. The best piece is in the middle. <br /> <br /> It's the standard movie: the new guy (in this case, girl) Margaret Ford (Lindsay Crouse) gets involved in the seedy con underworld. How she gets involved is: she's a psychiatrist and one of her patients, Billy is a companion. She wants to help him with his gambling debt, so she walks into The House of Games, a pleasant game room where people work in a back room. I will admit that the setup is pretty unlikely. (Were they just going to come in to Crouse? Were they thinking they would want to write a check? Was Billy there? One of these questions is definitely answered by the end.) <br /> <br /> And from here the disadvantages start rolling out. I found the beginning kids - the little ones - to be the most fun. We get a lesson in the art of the concept as much as Crouse is. <br /> <br /> We see the end coming, and then we didn't see the second end coming, and then I didn't see the end, but maybe you did. The ball just goes back and forth and bounces off and at the last scene in the movie we realize that the second Crouse was in the House of Games. She got her true calling. <br /> <br /> I go for the annoying forgiveness, the unlikely bits and the strange line reading because there are many good things here. If the first part of the movie looks dumb, hold it. After the half hour it really gets a momentum. If you want a fun movie, then she's here. If you want Mamet, look again "Glengarry Glen Ross" - James Foley made him better. <br /> <br /> ***
