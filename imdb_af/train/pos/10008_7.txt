You know, Robin Williams, God bless him, constantly shoot himself in the foot with all those dumb comedies he did this decade (with the exception of "Death To Smoochy" who bombed when it came out but now a cult classic). The plays he made recently were fantastic, especially "Insomnia" and "One Hour Photo". The night listener, despite mediocre reviews and a quick DVD release, is one of his best work, period. <br /> <br /> It's a very different story, though it doesn't include a serial killer or someone it's physically dangerous. The concept of the film is based on a real case of fraud that has not yet been officially confirmed. In high school, I read an autobiography by a child named Anthony Godby Johnson, who suffered horrible abuse and eventually contracted AIDS. I was moved by the story until I read online reports that Johnson may not actually exist. When I saw this movie, the confused feelings Robin Williams had shown so brilliantly revived in my mind. <br /> <br /> Toni Collette also probably gives her best dramatic performance as the ultimately sociopathic "overseer". Her role was far from those she had in movies like "Little Miss Sunshine". There were even times she looked in the camera, where I thought she had gone right to me. It does take a good actress to play such a role, and it is this underlined (still revised) role that Toni Collette is likely to make one of the best actresses of this generation, even for an Oscar award (from 2008 ). . It's amazing that there is at least one woman in this world that is so, and it's also scary. <br /> <br /> It's a good, dark movie I highly recommend. However, be prepared to be unforeseen, as this movie makes you end up feeling strange.
