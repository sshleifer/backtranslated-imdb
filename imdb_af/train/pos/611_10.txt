I claim that anyone who is ultimately responsible for drafting / approving the trailer for this movie was completely astonished. No one I knew wanted to see this movie based on the previews, and everyone who actually saw it loved it absolutely. The advertising campaign is disgrace / disaster / blunder. <br /> <br /> Opened at # 4 behind ... <br /> <br /> # 1 rush hour, which I didn't see, the average IMDb score of 7.4. <br /> <br /> # 2 - The Bourn Ultimatum, which I saw, awesome movie but 3rd week, average IMDb score of 8.7 (deserving I would say). <br /> <br /> # 3-The Simpsons Movie, which I saw, okay movie but 4th week, average IMDb score of 8.1 (a little high in my opinion). <br /> <br /> # 4-Stardust, average IMDb score of 8.4 (lower than Bourn, but we were there for 3 weeks). <br /> Whether it was poor scheduling or poor advertising. I think the powers behind this movie have been big time! It had to be advertised as a wonderful movie that happens as a fantasy / fairy tale and not advertised as just another fairy tale? Too bad: (Anyway - Now that I've been totally relentless, it's impossible ... Awesome movie, will see it!
