I had the pleasure of watching the short film "The Cure" by director Ryan Jafri for the first time. What really impressed me is the camera work and music. <br /> <br /> I think many young filmmakers (like myself are one of them) will often experience cinematography when they are just starting out. We see that the output is not exactly what we depict or less than our ambitions. But this film, director-debut of a young director, handled very well on the screen. The camera movement, color, lighting, composition all contribute to the film's story and emotion. <br /> <br /> And music, as a key element of movie language, also helps a lot. <br /> <br /> It's hard to portray a woman's heart, her desire, her fear, especially in a short. But I have to admit that I am not a fan of v / o (narration), especially when the film is progressed through narration, rather than shots and cuts. My personal feeling for part of the narrative part is, my guess was that the narrator tried a bit too hard. So the energy pushes the audience back from the emotion of the movie. <br /> Overall, this is a short movie that was well done, I could see the input of a director. Away to go, Ryan! Greeting from China, look forward to your next. <br /> <br /> hour
