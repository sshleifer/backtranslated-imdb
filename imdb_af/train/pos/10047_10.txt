To all the miserable people who did everything, complaining about the dialogue, the budget, the this and the what .... who wants to hear it? If you missed the point of this wonderful movie, it is your loss. The rest of us who love this movie very much don't care what you think. I am a thirty-year-old guy who has seen thousands of movies in my life, and this one stands in his own entity, in my book. It wasn't supposed to be a documentary, or a completely factual version of what happened that night. This is the most wonderful love story ever attempted. I know it's the cynical 90's and the millennium has all been in dizziness, but come on. Someone on this comment board complained that it made too much money! How lamb is that? It made bundles of money in every civilized country on the planet and is the top producing movie in the planet. I would like to work with the majority this time. Good, cynics, time to crawl back under your rock, I'm done.
