Erroll works for the Department of Public Security and his work is to look at sex offenders. Sometimes he pushes the line at his work and hits the sex offenders. I don't blame him, but his boss is ready for him to retire, so Allison comes. Erroll is now practicing her to do his job and it is like work shadow. Allison is a bit naive about the job at first, but she doesn't realize how much she really is and that's all Erroll's fault. He started too far with his obsession to find a missing girl when his job was not a police officer. <br /> <br /> It's a pretty decent movie about a crazy man pushing the boundaries and outside working his "scope of practice." Erroll did a good job, but for the sake of Allison's safety. It also has good secrecy and just when I figured it out there was more.
