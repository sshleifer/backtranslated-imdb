I found this movie a few years ago in the video store and rented it. My husband and I enjoyed it so much, we bought the VHS and enjoyed it since then. <br /> <br /> The plot is well discussed, so we don't have to go over it again. The point is that this movie deserves recurring views. Americans, especially, won't get all the jokes for the first time. I know I didn't. <br /> <br /> This movie is funny, touching, sad - all at the same time. When Ray presents the toast at his daughter's wedding, it is an invasive induction. When Karen Tony calls "Brian" while trying to kiss her, it's heartbreaking. When Beano is finally cut in black by the woman, it is too funny for words. <br /> <br /> And the music: it's as good as any movie soundtrack I've heard in years. I danced in the lounge to "Over the World." <br /> <br /> Every show is absolutely perfect. Bill Nighy was justified for his portrayal of Ray, a man who had had too many bad journeys. Stephen Rea is perfect as Tony, the lovely keyboard player who has been carrying a torch for Karen for years. He has an attractive hangdog look that makes women want to embrace him. But all the actors are equally brilliant. <br /> <br /> Ignore any pans you read about this movie and watch it. It's a jewel.
