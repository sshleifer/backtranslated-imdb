When it comes to creating a universe, George Lucas is the undisputed master and his final Star Wars movie is very, very good (and more appropriate compared to the previous two films in the original saga). If you've recently seen Revenge of the Sith, this movie really puts you in perspective. The last battle seems even more climactic to know what Anakin Skywalker has through the manipulative hands of the emperor. It also makes the last battle between Luke and Father more bitter in light of the love he felt for Padme and the love she felt for her children. Actually, while the new movies (especially Episode II) are inferior to the original movies, they are just for some reason good. They make the old movies look even better. <br /> <br /> Mark Hamill does a special job in this movie. He really brings out the changes Luke has undergone. In all fairness, I believe he has become a great actor based on these films because he really does a good job. Harrison Ford is still good. However, you can feel that he did Raiders and Blade Runner between the two last chapters of Star Wars, as he seems to have grown quite a bit. He adds more comedy (which is of course inspired by Raiders) to the character who works brilliantly. In short, Han Solo is better than ever. Carrie Fisher was never really a good actress, but she does a decent job and is definitely acceptable. Ian McDiarmid appears in this movie and seeing Episode III I can safely say he's one of the most accessible villains ever. James Earl Jones still offers the voice to Father and he is still very, very good. <br /> <br /> In terms of how the movie looks, it's pretty safe to say that the Star Wars universe looks better than any of the previous (two) movies, but it was always Lucas's fort. so it's really to be expected. The last battle over Endor is very well made, both in terms of overall effect and tension. It was also a pleasant touch that Lucas decided to place three battles at the same time, as it added to the overall tension of the climax. <br /> <br /> The only thing I feel is dragging the movie from an otherwise deserved 9 is the Ewoks. These little creatures are so annoying that they destroy almost every scene. I also find it a bit too kiddy when a group of teddy bears with bows and arrows can defeat a squadron of Storm Troopers with laser guns and mighty machines. br /> <br /> All in all, the return of the Jedi is a great movie, but the fact that Richard Marquand is less director than Irvin Kershner means that the overall feel of the film is less than brilliant. Also George Lucas's dumb decision to add the Ewoks to the universe means that the movie is not brilliant. <br /> <br /> 8/10
