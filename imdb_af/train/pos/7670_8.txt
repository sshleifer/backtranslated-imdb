I really enjoyed "Doctor Mordrid". This is a low-budget movie, which may be the best for some, but I have no problem with it. I admire it even more because it makes WAY more entertaining than the one that Hollywood eliminates every year. Too bad it didn't get a theater release; I don't know of anyone else, but I would have gone to see it in theaters. "Doctor Mordrid" is a very entertaining science fiction movie that can enjoy just about everyone, especially if they are in science like me. I don't see why this is an R-rated movie; There is only one f-word, and there are no abominable death scenes, and there is no blood at all. The timeless rivalry between wizards Anton and Kabal (Anton wanted the use of his powers to save mankind while Kabal wanted to add them) gave the story a sense of enchantment, while the mythical plot line charm added to the story itself . Basically, it's a movie that's just fun to watch. There is one unintentionally funny thing in this movie, though: Jeffrey Combs holds a straight face while wearing that dull blue cap and suit. It makes me laugh every time I see it. But I fail ... Anyway, the acting is wonderful; the main characters (Anton, and his wife friend, Samantha), are very nice; Anton is sympathetic and hospitable, and Samantha is friendly. Plus, the settings were wonderful. The swinging island in the other dimension was very cool. we only get a glimpse of it twice; It would be great to see more scenes here. The main setting was also very neat; Anton's apartment is very spacious, and he has some cool appliances, especially the monitoring system he uses to keep up with the world's events. He even ravaged a pet he likes in his flat called Edgar. Overall, it's a wonderful movie; It was fun to watch, and the lead players felt a lot in their roles. If you can get a doctor Mordrid, you must rent it (or, in my case, buy it. It was definitely money well spent)! <br /> <br /> My rating: 8 stars out of ten. <br /> <br />
