God! Zorro is the subject of about as many films as Tarzan, and probably has about as many actors in the title role. <br /> <br /> This Serial is one of my own personal favorites, and as mentioned before, it is one of the Top 5 Sound Serials. Oddly enough, this is a production that came out in the year 1939. * By the time of this production in '39, Zorro was really known as a (Pulp) literary and film character. The film opens with a small footnote on the history of Mexico's struggle for freedom of rule by the European Monarchy, Spain. The story compares to the American Revolutionary War. <br /> <br /> The story focuses on the mythical province of San Mendelito and its 'Council'. This is addressed by Benito Juarez ** on their gold mining relationship with the new Republic of Mexico. Gold shipments must be through Mexico City. <br /> <br /> Don Francisco Oom after Diego Vega, declared that he organized a group of patriots to serve as a protective force for the golden convoys. A thief of the Don del Oro mob, shoots an "insult" for himself and sets Don Francisco out for a duel with swords. Don Frasncisco is on a continuous basis. <br /> <br /> Suddenly, the dark-skinned masking sword fighter seems to be fighting and, after the trademark "Z" on the face of the bad guy, sends him to the afterlife. Don Francisco, with his dying breath, declares to his Ramon ward (William Corson) that Zorro is his cousin of the city of Los Angeles. He also tries to tell the true identity of Don del Oro, but expires before the statement is completed. <br /> <br /> There is a great reception for Diego at Don Francisco's Hacienda, where Diego Ramon'sister disappears (also from Don Francisco) with his deadly act. "A FOP !!", she explains. <br /> <br /> Later, Diego and Ramon leave to join a volunteer meeting. When they ask, "Who will lead us with Don Francisco now dead?", Ramon declares "Zorro, we are Zorro's Fight Legion!" Well, there's a big battle with the Legion, now all gray dressed, with masks and sheaths that protect the Golden Train. Then Zorro looks trapped at a man-made avalanche destined for the convoy, when, well, you know the stone hanger end of Chapter One. <br /> <br /> Wow! It was a lot of writing for one chapter, but like most other Serials, the opening is one longer and has plenty of ground to put in the story line. Let's say enough to say that there are 11 more good, well-made, filled chapters. <br /> <br /> ZORRO's CONFIRMING LEGION has all the elements that made for top climbing hanger action. We have an unknown evil leader who keeps the trouble between different groups. There are a number of suspects who were really behind the Don del Oro mask. We had soldiers, apostate whites, hostile Indians and the Legion. <br /> <br /> In short, it's safe to say that there is everything you want, and so in this series. And by the way, they choose carefully that the actors don't affect any Mexican accent. <br /> <br /> Just what is there, does ZFL make up the rest? What makes it different or unique? Well ........ <br /> <br /> First, it has a much more extensive and exciting musical score that underlines the drama and action on the screen. The opening theme even appears in a flamenco guitar version at the Cantina in Chapter One. It is probably the only time that such a highly specialized innovation occurs in the serial soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Yet there is another feature that really puts the Fighting Legion saga ahead of everyone else. That is, the movie does not just have a heroic music theme, but it is also sports Lyrics, yes, the Legionaires sing! We hear them singing in the opening credits and in several chapters! It works really well and adds to the feelings we get from the show. <br /> <br /> Once the Serial was shown on our local television (circa 1955), the gang immediately recognized Reed Hadley's voice as belonging to Captain Braddock of RACKET SQUAD, the TV series. Mr Hadley had a very distinctive, deep voice. *** He also handled the role very well. His costume and especially the elongated mask look very good and was probably very functional. <br /> <br /> There's a slight slip on it. A kind of small anachronism occurs by Benito Juarez (Carleton Young) addressing the San Mendelito Council, since Juarez was about 18 years old (1824) and although he was later the largest single figure in Mexico's history, he certainly had not yet reached such a prominence. His inclusion in the story was probably in the release of Warner Brothers' JUAREZ that year, which Paul Muni played in the title role. <br /> <br /> It's not just my choice as a top 5 audio series, but also my favorite Zorro movie. <br /> <br /> * We are reminded of the great harvest of top flight movies that year, which goes with WONES WITH THE WIND, MR.SMITH TO WASHINGTON, THE CITADEL, JUAREZ, OUR WARNING, MOUSE AND PEOPLE, ONE MILLION BC, ZENOBIA, WE, WE WANT WE MUMMY ALL BELOW THE OUTSTANDING THAT YEAR. <br /> <br /> ** Juarez has not yet risen to any national interest until 1850, about 25 years later. The political subdivisions are also referred to as 'Provinces' in the story. In fact, they are called 'States'. Just as we are called the United States of America, so also south of the border, they call them Repubhlic the United States of Mexico. <br /> <br /> *** Reed Hadley was prominent in some very 'A' pictures. in which his rich toned voice is used to the best. Watch and listen to his story in THE HOUSE AT 92ST STREET (1945) and GADALKANAL DAYBOOK (1945).
