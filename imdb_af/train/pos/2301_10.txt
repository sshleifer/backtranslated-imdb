Really ... and an incredible movie that is not very popular ... is getting very touched and almost life-changing ... at least for me. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing and buying ..... Add to my favorite movie list .... it's number one now .... <br /> <br /> This is a very touching movie that all people should see. <br /> <br /> The Man in the Moon ..... we will just be incredible. It is now my favorite movie and I only saw it today and I would recommend it to someone over 15 as long as you are a little mature. If you don't really try to feel the characters' emotions, I never get the true meaning and value of this movie ... But it's really amazing ... just watch it as the way some people look at life change.
