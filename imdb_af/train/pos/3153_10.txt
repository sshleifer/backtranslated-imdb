I'm going to make it short and sweet, because I don't think there's much you can tell anyone about this show it has never seen, except its hilariously funny and unique. For me this may be the funniest show ever. <br /> <br /> You really have to see it to understand its humor and it took me a few episodes to really get in, but once you get in there is no longer going back no. For example, the way Hydes character always wants his friends to get into some sort of trouble, the more it gets, the more strange it gets. <br /> <br /> The whole classic, I mean the cast, the authors, the director, it's just a recipe for success. One actor who thinks I'm always hard is Ashton Kutcher, but I think he's wonderful in this show. I don't think it's possible for the character Kelso played by someone else, it takes someone very smart to play someone who is stupid. All the main characters are wonderful and it won't be worth it if I didn't call the cold fox Mila Kunis. Now it's a spicy ball.
