I need it urgently on a tape, not a DVD, and soon! <br /> <br /> I have one infantry cousin but haven't been deployed yet, although he goes to Iraq after December 2008. I lost my beloved son in Ramadi Iraq on 09-15-05 of an unmanned rocket in a green zone. I have another cousin who joined the army as soon as he graduated from high school this year because he, like his older brother, has an ideal and romantic idea of ​​what is in the army. My stepson dies after just 10 days in the country and he never went out on any missions, so my cousins ​​have no way of showing any of the experiences shown in this overt documentary evidence of any kind of personal experiences I could now transfer my late son. . <br /> <br /> There is nothing I can do about those in, or now gone, but I have one ear that didn't raise his hand and was sworn in YET. I want desperately to be so informed. None of the others did it. <br /> <br /> Nice to help me with this. <br /> <br /> The movie documentary The ground truth is the best visual reference I've ever seen. I have to somehow let my youngest cousin see him coming in before it's too late. BUT: (Don't laugh) I need my mom to see it first. She must actually see and hear these men and women, not just the idea of ​​them, but the truth of what they will be immersed in, possibly forever. Then she will have the emotional determination to have my brother look at this movie and as soon as he can, he will also show his son, my youngest cousin. Then my nephew can take it seriously. <br /> <br /> ((Is there another time when it will be shown on TV? If so, please tell me when?))) <br /> <br /> But my problem is , my mom does not own a DVD player, she still uses video (is it correct? With ties?) So, I have to find a way for her to see this movie. Can I buy it from anyone in that form? If not, is there any other way to get it in the form of a band of someone? Is there a legal link from which I can pay to download it on my computer and then transfer it to a tape. If so, who will I contact. I'd like to pay for the privilege if it's a legitimate link. <br /> <br /> Or, if you have any alternative ideas, I'll consider anything you can imagine. <br /> <br /> Please help me, I've already lost a lot of valuable worship and beloved, I already know my eldest cousin will never be the same when he comes back and I can also lose him. I can't lose three and the emotional toll for everyone who does it back is too high to pay for every male in my family of that generation. Please help me. I'd love to call you, send me a number if it's the best way to get the necessary information. Thank you for any help you may have. <br /> <br /> Sincerely, Lori Swanberg l.swanberg@yahoo.com
