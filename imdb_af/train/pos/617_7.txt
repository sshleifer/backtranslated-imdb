Greetings again from the darkness. This one will be compared to "The Princess Bride" and although it does not meet the classic criterion, it is extremely entertaining and well-made in its own right. The story line is a bit odd and the whole wall thing is never really explained, but the performance is good, even strong tension builds up. <br /> <br /> Charlie Cox plays Tristan, who falls for the wrong girl (Sienna Miller), and agrees to make her a fallen star ... played by the beautiful Claire Danes. Not much stress about what happens to these two, but the exciting part comes in with the evil witch played by Michelle Pfeiffer and King Peter O'Toole's prince son seeking to win back the ruby ​​necklace we wear "star". Many of the bad ones are good. <br /> <br /> Along the way, you'll meet with the strangest pirate (including any of the Carribbean). Robert Deniro plays Captain Shakespeare - tough on the inside, and will tell us about his female side. Another encounter is the brilliant Ricky Gervais as a quick talk trader and it is good for a few laughs. <br /> <br /> Not your typical chase, age or fantasy movie, but director Matthew Vaughn's ("Layer Cake") deserves an audience. Unfortunately, the poor marketing campaign is likely to prevent it from making money. I think it will find great success on video.
