(contains small spoils) <br /> <br /> It's interesting how Anthony Mann uses James Stewart here. Of course, Stewart is remembered by many as Frank Capra's George Bailey's "It's a Wonderful Life", so it's easy to find parallels between the two movies. In "It's a Wonderful Life," Bailey gets the world as it would have been if he had never been born. Stewart's Jeff Webster, by not getting involved in helping someone else (except himself), gets essentially the same thing: a world in which he (for all practical purposes) does not exist. /> <br /> By not engaging (and trying not to care for anyone), Webster is forced to see those whom he can't help but to care for, to be overturned, and even kill while standing. do nothing It reminds the viewer of George Bailey to a world that looked upside down because he also decided not to get involved by never being born. <br /> <br /> Both movies end up with the same image - a close-up of a bell. Stewart, turning his philosophy of non-involvement, earned his lips ".
