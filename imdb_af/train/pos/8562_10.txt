I liked it! The plot was strange, Drew Barrymore and DC make up were both uncomfortable for both. Drew's acting was dodgy in places, but it could be in her life right now. Dennis Christopher as the shrink was pretty cool, and as always, he does his best. Anyway, I'm a big Dennis fan, so I bought the DVD. <br /> <br /> I didn't get the end! that strange animatronic red skeleton thing looks like it was from film school, what is OK, I think it could have been more. <br /> <br /> ... and the whole thing with the knife. If it was so uncomfortable, didn't they just get rid of it? <br /> <br /> It was very confusing if it was the Doppelganger strange thing or when it was DC, or was it Dennis all the time? Because the Doppelganger worked out with Dennis and Patrick. In the scenes with Patrick when it was Dennis like the Doppelganger, I think Patrick will see. <br /> <br /> The music was OK but intrusive in places, the whole orchestral score was turning a theme, but this theme was exaggerated. <br /> <br /> A great blend of lots of blood and free shots from Drew Nude. <br /> <br /> All in all, a bit of a GPM Guilty Pleasure Movie. Don't read too much in it, don't look for secret messages and fantastic writing, because you won't find it. There are a few diamond moments and feasts to a great extent. Say it and just have a little fun!
