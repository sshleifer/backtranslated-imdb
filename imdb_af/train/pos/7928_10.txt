Let's get a few things straight first: Zombies don't exist so the movie maker can have them. WALK, run, fly hell even if he wants to. This makes this original Zombie movie so good. Everything they did was so damn original. I hate it if filmmakers do everything like Romero or when boys expect everything like Romero. Some idiots think that zombies, like a typical Romero movie, have to grow zombies again, so that a filmmaker can whistle zombies whenever he wants. The zombies in this movie all look very good, but they do not fall off bodies as they just die freaking! They are pretty messy and full of snapped faces and blood. One of the coolest scenes was a half-eaten cat. It looks so damn real, my daughter cried when she saw it. This movie really got good reviews in Fangoria and Rue Morgue so I wanted to see it. I'm glad I listened. They are always right when it comes to the real horror of their taste. 10 out of 10! Go hire it!
