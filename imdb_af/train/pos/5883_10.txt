I watched, enchanted and hypersized through the vocal and physical acting. The roles played by each character were done with excellence. The lyrics, the words, every gesture, the sunrise, all told it. The movie spoke to me. It relieved me of another perception of a person who believes in man. Who believes in peace and gentle behavior. I was also held in disbelief, by the sacrifices and human dignity. Power without mercy is demented and without feelings. Seeking power at the expense of mankind is so incredible. This movie made me so scared of the people who are no longer in this world. And it is with sadness that I think of them. I like this movie for conversations and facial expressions. May this movie be blessed.
