No message. No symbolism. No dark downfall. Just a wonderful mix of music, nostalgia and good fun is given by people who did it well, of course. It is a refreshing antidote for some of the pretentious garbage that is being milled by the studios. Of course, something with the incomparable Judi Dench is worth watching. And Cleo Laine's brilliant jazz song is a bonus. This woman is in the same league as the late Ella. It continues on my movie shelf to be pulled out again when I feel the need for a warm experience and a hearty good natural bell. Just a great movie!
