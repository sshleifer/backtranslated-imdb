This movie deserves a 10 for its brilliant portrayal of the world as experienced in the mind of a playboy. While I have found the world morally repulsive, the film has done the best thing that should tell narrative, and it takes us through an experience we will never undergo. Tim Meadows depicts Leon Phelps so convincingly, and the story so drawn me into the reckless world of Leon. I soon forgot that I had watched a parody of the playboy world and forced it to rebel. Herein lies the film's withdrawal because its great and brave performance in story telling comes to its own success. In the understanding that the vast majority of filmmakers will only respond to the story of this film lying on the surface and rejecting that story, I hesitate to misunderstand them and to admit that I love it. Not only did I love his fascinating insights into the playboy's deceptive thought, just for his amusing depiction of the idiot of the human sex drive, but also for his courage to explore carelessly in the shadow of heterosexuality. Besides, it's just funny.
