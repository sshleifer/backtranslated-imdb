While the story of a troubled kid who changes to box for self-respect and anger management is barely a new thing, the story is given a fresh twist when the lead actor is a girl instead of a boy. <br /> <br /> Diana has problems at school. She just can't stay away from fighting. At home, her father is constantly sitting. Her brother pulled a box from a gym and one day when she picked him up, she decided she wanted to train. <br /> <br /> It would be easy to call this movie a "Rocky with girls", I think. But it is not at all about it. The story actually benefits much from the main character, rather than a boy, a girl. That way, you can handle more problems at the same time. First, the problem of her is not accepted because she is not a girl, and then when she arrives at the box gym because she is not a girl at all. It's also a story about how a goal can change someone's life. How positive things can make you grow. I don't want it to be pretentious, because the movie doesn't feel pretentious at all, but what I say is true. <br /> <br /> Also Michelle Rodriguez is very good at the lead. It's a pity she's caught up in the "Tough Girl" typing because it's really not what her part in "Girlfight" is about. Sure she is a female boxer, but rather it is the more sensitive moments that really make her shine. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it is your average storytelling story with a twist, but it is raised by the crowd by Rodriguez's action. I rate this 7/10.
