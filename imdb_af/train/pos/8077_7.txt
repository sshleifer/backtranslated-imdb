A movie made for contemporary audience. The masses get to see what they want to see. Action, comedy, drama and of course sensual scenes. It is not exactly a movie that will make you feel comfortable with the whole family. It's not for children's eyes. I had to move several scenes forward. <br /> <br /> If it's just entertainment you're looking for, this movie has it all. The songs are striking. An exuberant production, I must add. <br /> <br /> However, the message of the movie is not universal. It emphasizes the idea of ​​karma. That is, if you do well, you will be fine. And if you do evil, you will get angry. The fruit of good works is good, while the fruit of evil is wrong. <br /> <br /> In real life it is not always true. It is well known that most people do not get justice in this world. While it is true that some evil people meet with an evil end, many escape. And then there are many people who do good, and yet they come back with a sorry end. <br /> <br /> If you don't care about the message and all you want is an escape from worldly reality, this movie is an entertainer in order.
