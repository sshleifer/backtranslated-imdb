I watched this movie on DVD several times, the first time I watched the second half after the hour and then went back to the first hour. An impressive entertaining movie, thank God, no Kiera Knightley in it, refreshing and it gives us all a real insight into the difficult life of Queen Victoria and the difficult choices she had to make. Nothing bad about the movie, no real bad language or anything of a sexual nature that would insult for family performance. Perhaps the children are asking a little about the Queen's Victorian self and perhaps less well-known characters like Conroy and Lord Melbourne
