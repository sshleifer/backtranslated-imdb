One can only hope that there are many times when someone as powerful as Morgan Freeman can take the time to help someone who needs help. <br /> <br /> All this comes down to loving people. As Will Rogers said, "I never met a man I didn't like." Of course, if you meet Paz Vega, how can it be? That smile from her can melt diamonds. She is just as fantastic that I can see anything she is. The same goes for Freeman. He's just magic on the screen. <br /> <br /> The two of them gave us a movie that was funny from start to finish. From the Mexican supermarket to Lorraine & Bobby to Packy. It was soft, charming and just funny. <br /> <br /> You should see it below.
