It is a refreshing airliner if a movie actually gives you a story line with a start, a means and an end, a clever secret, with an attractive heroine for all ages that we conquer with her well-being and charm. Andrew Fleming's film is indeed a modern wonder, a return to the good old reliable storytelling that was the norm in Hollywood. He throws the over-confidence on special effects that are now entertaining and giving us a great movie, with a very capable young actress and a talented supportive role. <br /> <br /> The movie is based on the old books, but it has been updated enough to place in this century; However, the props can be different, the heart is still a good mystery, and there is one smart, one that connects the traditions of the old and the nuances of contemporary youth. Emma Roberts is an old-fashioned girl who believes in good behavior and respect for others; details that are lacking in today's movies. She is still good enough to get boys' attention, but she also knows how current pussy and self-respect. She earns her medals by working hard and is not afraid to show a little fraud when it comes to achieving her goals. <br /> <br /> While taking a vacation to California, our heroine is in the riddle of a Hollywood actress who was the victim of foul play; Suddenly she is visited by her ghost and it sets off a series of events that can solve the mystery or lead to something terrible for herself. What makes the movie really entertaining is the small details, as she discovers that her habit world is nothing compared to the California scene, and it is well presented, without using unnecessary vulgar language or something graphic or openly sexual. Eventually, the director had enough control to encourage all kinds of audiences, from the young to the adults in the audience. It's a movie that needs to be earned, appreciated and enjoyed, a scarce and delicate movie, and it's not afraid to be classified! Five stars
