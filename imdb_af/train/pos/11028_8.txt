To be honest, I didn't like much of this movie when I first saw it. But I think the problem is that I haven't seen it in a theater. Big mistake! Because the # 1 thing to see in Cliffhanger is the settings and # 2 is the cinematography. Try to watch this movie on the biggest TV and a good sound system. The music is good and puts the film at a higher level (and a commercial potential). The more I see it, the more I like it. <br /> <br /> This is definitely one of Renny Harlin's best movie. This old man of action. The Hard 2, The Long Kiss Goodbye, etc. And this is especially good in this movie. The special effect is wonderful and spectacular. Stallone really needs the movie to come back with success. Still good to see him!
