Almost 30 years later I remember this original PBS movie as almost unbearable tender. I regularly look at IMDb and hope someone has the right sense to buy the rights and put them on a DVD. It's September 2004, and I still hope - deeply sigh. <br /> <br /> One of the two main actors went mainly to a former evening soap after a small career; the other, Frances Lee McCain, has been in small roles for a few years here and there. But nothing they did before or after this picture, which, as I recall, produced on a short-lived PBS series, showed original scripts by new and emerging actors. <br /> <br /> I watched it every time it was shown on PBS, maybe 2 or 3 times. This was before the era of videos, so I have no record of it except in my mind. <br /> <br /> 12/31/2006 additional to top: Happy New Year, ladies! This wonderful movie is finally available on DVD at ladyslipper.org. My understanding is that the DVD's are burned by the author's own personal copy.
