I'm actually outraged by the comments I read that this movie was "boring" and the beautiful scenery was destroyed by black and white imagery. It was made in 1925 !! I think it's absolutely incredible because it's time! <br /> <br /> The journey that these people had to go through is quite remarkable. It took them a week to just cross a river. The women carried their children in heavy wooden carts on their backs and climbed a solid piece of rock, sometimes barefoot in the snow. I want to see someone do it now! <br /> <br /> I thought it was a great movie with some incredible shots and an amazing story.
