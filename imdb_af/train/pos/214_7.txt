An old vaudeville team from Willy Clark (Walter Matthau) and Al Lewis (George Burns) was one of the best known, but they hated each other. More than 20 years later they agree to get a TV specialist together ... but find out they don't hate each other yet. Willy's cousin (Richard Benjamin) is trying to work with them. <br /> <br /> A great hit in his day and it won George Burns an Best Supporting Actor Oscar. I liked it (somewhat). It was written by Neil Simon, his non-stop one-liners. Some of it was funny, but jokes of Willy and Al's senility were NOT. I never liked Matthau either. I never thought he was a good actor, and something about him just rubbed me in the wrong way. His character here is so persistent that you quickly get sick of him. All that was aside was fun. Burns is just nice to throw out one-liners and even Matthau was good with him. Their verbal battle is the best series in the movie. Benjamin is also very good as Willy's cousin, trying to get the two of them to work with each other. For me it's worth seeing for Burns. This leap started his career in a big way and two years later he hit another "O God". So, that's good. Just fine - not good. Matthau's character really makes it difficult to love. I give it a 7.
