I'm a massive fan of Jet Li! He's the best HK action movie star alive ... and consequently - this movie rocked! I saw it in the video store and, as it was in the mainstream section of this mainstream video store, I didn't even get its presence and I had to look twice. I knew right away what I was going to rent. My only blame (I suspect I expected it) is that it was called (AAARGh) and not subtitled. Elsewise, the movie's original / strange / cool plot, and full of action made it one of Jet Li's better movies. Although they all fall under the category ....
