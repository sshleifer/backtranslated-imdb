This movie is not pornography, it is not meant to be porn, and unless my uncle runs for president of the world, it should never be considered porn. <br /> <br /> Now that the problem is sorted out, I can say I thoroughly recommend this movie, as it is still widely available. It's funny, the acting is great and it brings serious (curious) questions. <br /> <br /> I can't fully understand why this movie was so abused. It's probably my intention to never go to us. Lena is the true pioneer of modern riot grrrl movement, confusion, curiosity and white are her main features, she is sometimes angry, but aren't we all?
