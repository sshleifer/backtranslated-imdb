Robert Culp (they call his character "doctor" ... I think he's a veterinarian or something) and family moves to a wealthy, low-tax, zero-law enforcement suburb. Lantern-jawed Culp and his dog are almost killed when some local idiot neighbors get drunk and "crawl" at his 60mph. He puts pressure on the children to get worse, and suddenly he and his family are the victims of a violent and disturbing prank campaign. <br /> <br /> There, Marilyn Manson, there, Marlyn Mason, rather plays his fretful, boiled woman, urging him not to use violence against his delusional nemeses, and who actually wants to move somewhere with decent public services. But the system nowhere gets Culp, and he won't leave his house because of some punk kids and their crazy rock and roll music. And we all know what movie people do when the system fails ... (but it's based on a real story, which makes it even better). <br /> <br /> It should be noted that while the villains do have a comfortable 70-year-old funk-mathematical "teen" theme music that warns us if they are not good enough. This movie actually even ends with the parentheses (really!). It doesn't make a big generation thing out of it. Kudos for that. <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you like dogs (or at least believe in protecting their civil rights, like me), and you like justice, and you like fire, and you like justice for dogs by way of fire, and you think people who are staggering from nervous communities are "too damn soft", then this movie's ethos rose on you. No, it's not really 'good', anyway not in a widely recognized sense of the word. There is nothing subtle or underestimated or clever about it, it's just a PSA for vigilantism. However, it takes the feeling of some memorable scenes in other, beloved works. Remember Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns when Batman drives the Mutants to reclaim Gotham City? Remember that scene in a Christmas story where the child is pounding the face of the bully? Remember how cool it was? Or are you just really funny about your neighbors? Yes, sir. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it was a 1973-made-for-TV movie I just caught at my local affiliate's affiliate at 04:00, which is probably not for DVD release. But after I was inspired by this movie, do you think I'm just sitting here and taking it!
