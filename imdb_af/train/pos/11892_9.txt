Pialat roles people in extreme emotional situations, usually with several violent scenes. In La Gueule's overtime, he deals with the devastating effects on a woman's husband and son while dying of cancer. In a nine-hour period, the teenager's sexual experiment leads to violent confrontation with her family. Here we have a spoiled young woman who leaves her husband to take a sexy ex-con. Her motivation is a bit cloudy, as Loulou is unable to read or discuss anything more challenging than TV shows; On the other hand, he has a fantastic body (I wonder why Depardieu never made a sports film to point out that body - he would have been good as a rugby player). <br /> <br /> The casting is impressive. Isabelle Huppert may not give a mere, unexpressive performance (she has given much); Depardieu plays Loulou with all the dynamics and charm you want - see the scene in the bar, where he is stabbed in the stomach, run away and seek treatment, and soon start with Nelly again. Guy Marchand, with those coal-black eyes and distress, plays Nelly's husband beautifully; This is a good repetition of the mating in Coup de foudre.
