The boys work outside a recording studio when they hear the voice of an angel. It would be Mrs. Van Doren be, audition and go under the name of me. Andrews because her father doesn't approve of being a radio singer. However, she hopes a big wig, Mrs Bixby, a friend of her father's will to appoint her, and then he must give his approval. <br /> <br /> She left but within minutes the boys joined Amok in the studio causing havoc and other musicians to kill them after they destroyed the recording session. Eventually, calm down. "Whew, we avoided them," said Moe. "Yes, we also got away," answered curly. <br /> <br /> The boys then walk around in the studio, sit on me. Van Doren's record and curly is dressed in women's clothes and pretends to sing. Mrs Bixby step in, is impressed and rent "Seniorita Cucacha" on the spot! For an extra $ 500, she is asked to sing at their high-party party that night. The rest, as they say, is history like Krullerige pretending to be an opera singer with some funny results. Oh, at the same time he accompanied "Senior Mucho" and "Senior Gusto." What happens at the party is simply that the truth wins, but not before some slapstick antics occur. In all, a pretty good episode. I enjoyed it, but would not rate it as something special.
