I actually found this movie 'interesting'; finally one that is worth my time to watch and rent. It is true ... some scenes were on top of emotionalism, shouting, etc. But what movie doesn't stress his agenda, genre or ax to grind? Almost nothing! What surprised me was that I downloaded a review elsewhere by a S.Fran adjudicator on another review site, but instead found its negative review a more accurate description of its own review of the movie; Not from the movie. Anyone watching this movie will realize it's good to recommend to family and friends; no car chasing, yes !! Being "in" an Italian family, I can fully relate to the environment displayed on the screen. The film also has parts of the tear. This is what real life can be in such an environment. Nice movie.
