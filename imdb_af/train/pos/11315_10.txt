Luchino Visconti was light years ahead of his contemporaries. The great directors of Italy of the 40's and 50's were men who understood the medium, but it was Luchino Visconti, a vision, who dared to bring a movie to show what he was able to do . He shows his genius early on in his coveted career with "Ossessione", a film based on James Cain's The Postman Always Ring Twice, later made by Hollywood, but turned the version into what Visconti did in the movie. . Luchino Visconti and his employees on the screen include an unknown Alberto Moravia, a man who knew about the effect of passion on man. <br /> <br /> The movie has been well preserved in the DVD format we recently watched. The film is a requirement for all serious film lovers, as we can see how Visconti's vision translated the text into a movie that is likely to be true, something the American version lacks. <br /> <br /> What comes up with watching the movie is the intensity the director of his key players got. The wonderful Clara Calamai does a wonderful job as Giovanna, the wife of an older man. But when Gino appears in her life, all she wants to do is get rid of the friendly man who gave her an opportunity in life. Giovanna is one of the best creations in me. Calamai's achievements in Italian theater. The last sequence of the film shows Mrs. Calamai at her best in the ironic twist that serves as the moral redemption for the monstrous crime committed. <br /> <br /> Equally excellent is Massimo Girotti, one of the best actors of his generation who appears as Gino, the man who awakens the obsessive passion in Giovanna. Gino is the perfect man for Giovanna, something Mr. Girotti is so comfortable and sophisticated, it didn't look like it before. Mr. Girotti makes the man alive in a performance that looks so easy, but with another actor it may not be so clear. Juan DeLanda is seen as Giuseppe, the older man who fell in love with Giovanna. In fact, his character rings are more valuable than his counterpart in the American film, where he is seen more than a buffoon. <br /> <br /> The film is beautifully photographed by Domenic Scala and Aldo Tonti. They gave the film a naturalistic look, as the Italian directors of the era benefited. Giuseppe Rosati's original musical score is perfect. Visconti, a man who loved opera and was one of the best directors, also includes Bizet and Verdi arias that fit well into the film's context. <br /> <br /> "Ossessione" is a movie to treasure because we see a big Luchino Visconti at the top of its shape.
