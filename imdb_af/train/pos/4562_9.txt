See this movie on DVD yesterday and was gob-smacked and flabbergasted. The untouched play of DDL just blew me, and I was amazed at the whole role and its excellent acting. All the character was so authentic to me, I really took DDL for Christy Burns and Brenda Fricker for his mother. Go see it! You will call your heart, but you will experience a wonderful catharsis! In addition, it teaches you one important lesson: Determination is everything. You can be a cripple in the poor suburbs of Dublin, but if you're strong enough, you won't have any problems at all. If you can only use your left foot, you are still good enough to be a painter or writer. The worst thing you can do when you are spiritually challenged is to enjoy yourself. It won't get you anywhere and the only person who will be sorry will be yourself.
