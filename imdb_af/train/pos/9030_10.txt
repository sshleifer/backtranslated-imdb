This movie surprised me. My friend told me that this movie was a "chick flick". Son, was he wrong! This movie has a great family appeal, without sex scenes like _other_ movies. Jake Gyllenhaal does an excellent job in Homer Hickam's shoes. The supporting film is also good. <br /> <br /> Science, age, family laws, good train scene ... This movie has it all. The soundtrack is good, although the score is very choppily presented. The 50's music kicks the movie over the edge of greatness. <br /> <br /> The DVD is definitely worth weighing in coal. Repeat value is great - I've seen it a few times.
