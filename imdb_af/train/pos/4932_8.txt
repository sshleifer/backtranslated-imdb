Panicking in the streets Richard Widmark plays US Navy doctor who interrupted his week uncomfortably with a pest-containing body. As Paul Douglas points out, the man died on two dots in the chest. This is not the problem here, the two of them become unwilling partners in an attempt to expose the murderers and anyone else to the disease. <br /> <br /> As noted by any number of people, for some reason director Elia Kazan did not bother throwing the small parts with someone who sounds like they're Louisiana. After New Orleans where the story takes place, I can personally report it. Richard Widmark and his wife, Barbara Bel Geddes, can be excused because he could be assigned as a naval doctor, but for those who are natives, it doesn't work. <br /> <br /> But with plague out there and news As a secret, the New Orleans PD begins a trawl of the city's underworld. The dead man came from Europe and he had underworld connections. A new Orleans wise man, played by Jack Palance, jumps to a whole bunch of inaccurate conclusions and starts touching a cousin of the dead guy who starts showing pest symptoms. Palance has fantastic reviews in the first film he received notice. <br /> <br /> Personally, my favorite in this movie is Zero Mostel. It happened just before Mostel was blacklisted and around that time he played a specialty to play, would be tough guys who are actually toadies. He plays the same role in the Humphrey Bogart movie, The Enforcer. Unfortunately, I can identify with Mostel in the last chase scene where he and Palance are pursued by Widmark, Douglas and half of New Orleans police. See the weight challenged. Zero tried to look after Palance, was something else, because I'm now in Zero's league now in the league. <br /> <br /> Kazan kept the action on a good clip, there is very little down time in this movie. If there was less, it would be an Indiana Jones movie. Panic In The Streets this year won an Oscar for the best original screenplay. <br /> <br /> Kazan also used the New Orleans waterfront and the French quarter well. Some of the same kind of shots are later used in On the Waterfront. In fact, panic in the streets is about people who do not cry if they really have to be in their own interest. Very similar to the Waterfront again. <br /> <br /> Panic in the streets makes everyone proud of what went with it. Now why could Elia Kazan not get decent New Orleans people in the roles.
