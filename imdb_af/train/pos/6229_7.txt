One of several musicals about sailors on leave, this is the usual sailor meeting girl, complications ensue, fortunately sorted out sort of plot. It moves smoothly, but it also drags in places. For example, the dialogue is not as sippy as 'Top Hat', and Randolph Scott seems impossible. <br /> <br /> There are fees. It has a few Irving Berlin's most powerful songs, including 'Let Yourself Go', 'I'm putting all my eggs in one basket' and 'Let's Face the Music and Dance'. It has Fred and Ginger who, when dancing, take any film in heavenly heights and they don't disappoint. They do a funny tap dance, a knockout comic dance and a swirling graceful dance, all in the same movie! Great versatility and artworks. <br /> <br /> It also has a fairly good role in Harriet Hilliard. She had a varied career, which became the best-known Harriet Nelson with Ozzie. Here she touches without being sentimental. Here, two songs are delivered simply and effectively. She makes a good contrast with Ginger, but you can believe they are sisters in the movie. <br /> <br /> More enhancement made the movie even better. Pretty good though.
