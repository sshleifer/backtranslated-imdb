This movie was a fantastic comedy. It had many comedians in it, such as Akshay Kumar, Rajpal Yadav, Paresh Raval and John Abraham. <br /> <br /> Rimi Sen was good at playing Akshay Kumars's wife, and so were all the women's women. Mr Hot as Mac (Akshay Kumar) and Mr Cool as Sam (John Abraham) are two fashion photographers who love the same girl Maggie (Neha Dupia). When John Abraham cheats on his job, he becomes Akshay Kumars senior and Akshay Kumar becomes very jealous because his apartment is to be given to John Abraham and Neha Dupia. Akshay Kumar wants to be better than John Abraham so he gets a flat and he goes out with three different girls (Nitu Chandra, Nargis Bagheri, Daisy Boppana).
