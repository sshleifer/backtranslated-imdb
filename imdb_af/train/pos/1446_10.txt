Has Al Pacino ever been in a bad movie? His name seems to be an imprimatur for top movie theater. It's as good a show as he ever gave. Pacino is an American Olivier. And it's a political thriller as good as they get. There are no good guys and no bad guys. But the system has its relentless effect on the people who think they are running it. Not only is Pacino's performance compulsory --- the promise at the dead child's funeral is terribly powerful --- the movie has a fast, eager realism that facilitates the fine performances without encouraging. This outstanding portrait of metropolitan politics also manages two hours of wonderful movie viewing without unnecessary violence, overheated sex or gut language. There is murder. There are bad people. But they come across effectively without crossing the line. A movie like this restores my beloved belief in Hollywood. I don't know many ten. This one deserves it richly!
