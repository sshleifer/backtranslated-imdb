I really like the original, and this movie has its ups and downs. Here are just a few: <br /> <br /> Ups: Most of the original cast has returned. <br /> <br /> Downs: I didn't have the voice of Timon's Mom. I know she did a voice in The Simpsons, but the show is just stupid. <br /> <br /> Ups: We see Simba as a 'teenager'. <br /> <br /> Downs: They wasted it with a slap game between Timon and Simba. <br /> <br /> Ups: It was Rafiki who told Timon of Hakuna Matata. <br /> <br /> Downs: How did Pumbaa find out about it? <br /> <br /> Ups: Songs again. (Some of the original songs were there, but they were just background music.) <br /> <br /> Downs: But silly songs. (including Timon's solo.) <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a pretty good movie. I would recommend it to fans of the original. But if you don't like the original, chances are you won't like this one. <br /> <br /> My Score: 7/10
