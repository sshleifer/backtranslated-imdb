Prince stars as "the child" in this semi-autobiographical film by a talented but narcissistic young musician who lives less than stars at home. It is true that the play is a bit to be desired. This includes Morris Day and especially Clarence Williams, both on the scene, but the movie is still big and one of the best from the 1980s. It has the best soundtrack of any movie of the past 50 years, at least, highly quotas, and the dumpster scene is HILARIEUS !! Plus Apollonia is simply STUNNING. On an unrelated basis, when I saw Prince in the concert in 2004, he canceled the stadium. He is a knowledgeable showman and it was one of the best concerts I experienced. <br /> <br /> My Degree: A <br /> DVD Extra: CD 1) Comment with director Albert Magnoli, Manufacturer Robert Cavallo, and director of photography Donald Thorin; Theater Trailer; Trailers for "Under the Cherry Moon" and "Grafitti Bridge" CD 2) a 12 minute featurette on the First Avenue Club; "Purple Rain: Bachstage Pass (half an hour featurette on the movie I will be watching later);" Riffs, Raffs, Revolution: Impact and Influence of Purple Rain "10 minute featurette; 30 minutes of MTV's Premiere Footage (when MTV didn't suck donkey balls); 5 Prince music videos (Let's go crazy, take me with you, when devils cry, I'll die 4 You / Baby I'm a star and Purple Rain; 2 videos at The Time (Jungle Love and The Bird), and a music video for "Sex Shooter" by Apollonia 6 <br /> <br /> Eyecup: Apollonia shows her fine donkeys
