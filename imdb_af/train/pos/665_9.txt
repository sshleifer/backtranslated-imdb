"And all through the house" is a special crib episode, not just because it comes from the first season, but this episode was the first one I saw! I remember a young man on holiday with my parents that this summer saw our episode in our South Carolina hotel room in 1989 and I am buried now and then at the Crypt! I've always been a fan of horror-suspense series and like monster movies, and with this series started by HBO, I had great fun again. This episode is the first one I've seen, is unforgettable for me and one of my favorites, it's just as nice with a nice twist. "And all through the house" has a nice, cozy environment on a snow-covered sand, which is a perfect way to relax your holiday home! Well, anyway, you have Mary Ellen Trainor (who is on the road in various warner brothers' works, usually small parts) as a greedy woman who takes care of her men while waiting for money and a new romance . Like most horror series, things make a turn for the worst and bad people they earn. The chance is largely stacked when a maniac, dressed as a santa, escapes from a local nutmeg, abandoning a Christmas adventure! From the old E.C. comic lessons you learn to get bad people for what they are biting for! Well, this story ends with a perfect holiday screaming! This story was also in the 1972 movie and featured Joan Collins, which is without a doubt one of my favorites and probably one of the classic cryptic episodes of all time!
