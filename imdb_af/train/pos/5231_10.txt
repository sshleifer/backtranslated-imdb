To communicate in movie-essential things of life - like what is life, does it have meaning? - is impossible. Of course, possible answers to these questions are shown in each movie (story), but communication needs a direct appeal to consciousness. This happens when the input from the senses surpasses the "input" of our mind, that is, our thoughts. Few managers know how to communicate essential things. Tarkovsky, is one. His "Stalker" shows images of existence, communicates life as it shows itself and yet escapes. I think De Zee and De Graaff do the same.
