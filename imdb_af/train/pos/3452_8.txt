I thought it was a good movie and had to be released in the theaters. It wouldn't have been a great blockbuster, but it would have made some good money. The movie has tension and makes you wonder just how much of it goes on in the real world. Justin Timberlake did a good job. I didn't expect Justin Timberlake to do such a good job. Mostly it is his first movie he did well. It's a movie that's good to pick up and watch when you just don't know what you want to rent that night. It should be pretty good. The throw was wonderful. So I recommend everyone watches this movie!
