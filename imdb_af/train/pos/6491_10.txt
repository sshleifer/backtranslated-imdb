World At War may be the greatest documentary of all time. The historical research is virtually flawless. Even after a quarter of a century, it is the most accurate and definite documentary on WW2. An invaluable historical work that includes interviewing some of the most important and fascinating figures from the war. I highly recommend it as a learning experience.
