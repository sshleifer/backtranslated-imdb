I can come here for myself, but even though the film itself was a technical masterpiece for his time, I watched it at TCM last night. The question arose for me: Why did they do it? To put their lives at risk, many of them died on the move, why would they undertake such a life-threatening journey, just to get food for their animals (!) as soon as they reached the land of milk and honey, why didn't they "They just stay there? Do you want to endanger your life and that of your entire community just to get food for a herd of cattle? Just as dangerous as it was to do it alone shows the innate simplicity of these people. Risk dead for a cow ?? Better them than I do!
