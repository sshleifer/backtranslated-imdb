In the view, a wonderful film exploring the tensions that occur in family life in the idyllic environment of Galiano Island along the coast of British Columbia is being investigated. The Lotus Eaters_ is mocked by the fact that it is packed as a television for television, reducing itself by adding chirpy music over potentially powerful scenes, as if getting ready for interruption of advertising. Sorry, really.
