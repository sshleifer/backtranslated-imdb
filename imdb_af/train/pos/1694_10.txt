If the creators of this movie made any effort to introduce reality to the plot, it would have been just one more time, money and creative effort. Fortunately, by throwing all the appearance of reality on the winds, they raised a comic wonder. Who can accompany a movie in which an alien pilot uses the entire movie, such as Jack Nicholson, complete with the Lakers-T shirt. Do not discharge this film as garbage.
