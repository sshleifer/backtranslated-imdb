Here writer Pamela Katz explained to me why MvT JG introduced a specific character in the film: <br /> <br /> "... the historical record is very clear: Joseph Goebbels was directly responsible for the release of the Rosenstrasse prisoners, so we need a way to get Goebbels himself in our movie ... For a woman like Lena, a woman from an aristocratic family with connections, it was not unthinkable that she made an effort would try to go to the top The idea of ​​coming to Goebbels was not impossible for her, it got us hooked. <br /> <br /> Those of you who insist on a real sex act here see my new thread below and then burn away. <br /> <br /> Jan Lisa Huttner FILMS FOR TWO
