Until today I have never seen this movie. Filmed on the sets of the Old Dark House and Frankenstein, it relates to a small Bavarian town where so-called giant bats suck the blood of the residents. <br /> <br /> First, it's a damn good movie that saves atmosphere. and a role that won't stop, Lionel Atwill, Dwight Frye, Faye Wray and Melvin Douglas play a character called Brettschnieder that matters to me as it was my grandmother's stomach name. <br /> <br /> It is a carefully modulated film that has tension and witty one linen that slowly builds for its short run time, but only about ten minutes before the end, they realize they had limited time to do everything. wrapper. From that point to the end, it's a straight run to the finish with very little fun. <br /> <br /> Leonard Maltin and IMDb list a running time of 71 minutes and warn for shorter prints. The problem is that IMDb and Maltin can be wrong, and in this case I think they're since a source I trust, the full run time is 67 minutes. (The Overlook Film Encyclopedia). Quibbling about this I know is insane, but since most prints are available, it's about 60-63 minutes long. The amount of missing material is significantly less than just 67 minutes. Personally, I don't think it will matter so much, as it is at most five minutes and I doubt it will make or break the movie. <br /> <br /> What ever the running time, if you like handsome old movies, do, anyway, watch this movie, it's a big dark and stormy night movie.
