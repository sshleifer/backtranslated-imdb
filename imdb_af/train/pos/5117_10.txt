Very few films have had the impact on American culture like Urban Cowboy. Thanks, it was temporary. But UC is almost in a class as one of those flashes that when you switch channels at 3:00, you just can't turn your eyes off. My top three is Animal House and Walking Tall BTW, but that's the point. I remember Urban Cowboy hit the theaters and there were honeycombs opened at each corner. Men were sports-cowboy hats with their penny rolls, and if you didn't know how to do two-step, you're considered a social moron! Personally, I think it's a good movie. Travolta really surprised me on SatNiteFever's heels. Who has a dunk. He is also credible. The soundtrack is wonderful. Bad Charlene Tilton, of the Dallas fame of TV, destroyed Johnny Lee's career because that man was just great. The show stealer here is Scott Glenn as the finer ex-con redneck cowboy. And I didn't find anything against the female ex-cow cowboys I am, but I always enjoy what I feel to be the biggest powerline of all time .... "Pack-at S * # t!" Kind of like Clint's "make my day." And watching him hit Sissy is the closest thing I can see to my Julia Roberts fantasy. As I said, beautiful. 9/10
