It's wonderful how this movie pulls you together. I honestly laughed. Don't mind it's low budget, because the thing works for me. To be honest, my wife didn't really go the same, but she prefers another kind of movie. She admitted, however, that it was very creative and well-constructed and probably all on a twist. These characters, whose lives are, are strange and upset, giving me something to relate to in my own world. Hold on and be who you are. Dreams are what you make of them. Looking at this movie a second and third time, I realized that there were a few hidden moments that I had first passed. What can I say, I like my fun with some complexity. Anyway liked it. Hope to see more.
