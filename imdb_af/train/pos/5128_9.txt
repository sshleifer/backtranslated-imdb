First let me say I'm not from the south, but I'm an American. I don't love Country music, but I can stomach it. I will never wear a cowboy hat, but I wear hats. I don't live in a trailer, but I eat tuna salad and own a home. What does this have to do with this remark? Much if you are one of those people who say only "country" likes this movie. This movie is loosely based on the "They Have Beloved and Lost" premise. James Bridges sets up an American love story as much as it gets. In a Jerry Springer era and "Lets put it out there" mentality, this movie rings hotter than ever. <br /> <br /> Bud is "of age" and starts with a little help from his aunt and uncle, with some help, so he moves to the big city with them. Bud finds himself dressed in the local base-toned world for the only escape that a blue collar can afford. He quickly meets Sissy who is of a similar background and the two have a whirlwind romance filled with painful ups and downs. <br /> <br /> * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * / Seeing the transition from single to married, the film highlights some of the modern struggles that a woman has when marrying an old-fashioned man, as well as the male ego with women and competition.) <br / > <br /> Bud is challenged and excited when Micky's sitting in an electronic bull. Sissy gets ideas to enjoy, but is reminded that she is married and has to start playing like this. The emotion between the two characters is raw and expressive and the plot continues from there, especially when they are (NOTE THIS IS A REQUIRED BY THE STORYLINE ROAD), and Sissy falls for an ex-con with a love for abuse and cruelty. She soon realized that the grass was not always greener on the other side. <br /> <br /> How anyone can compare Bud with Vinnie Barbirino is shocking to me. John Travolta delivered an exceptional performance that was worthy of recognition. He was credible and real. The scene where he shaved his beard and you first saw him at the bar. I give me chicks. Remember, I'm not a big Travolta fan, but come on, I see why Sissy kicked in the role of her boots so early. Deb Winger was so sympathetic to her when she spent a note of emotions on Bud, after having cleaned up his house in the house. <br /> <br /> The supporting role was incredible. West played by Scott Glenn has a first-rate show that makes you hate and curse him for abusing Sissy. Madolyn Smith-Osborne, like Buds Mistress / girlfriend, was so authentic that big-dressed girls across the US prayed to wake up to wear the clothes she wore in the movie. My biggest kudos go to Barry Corbin and Brooke Anderson as Bud's aunt and uncle. They looked like someone's aunt and uncle somewhere in Texas and how small their role was, they made the film so much bigger and alive. Two memorable scenes were the Dolly Parton game and the unforgettable scene where Bud and his auntie died behind one of the characters. The dialogue between them affects. <br /> <br /> If you can see it, it's a true American love story. Then I advise you to take it for what it is ... a movie before the time we gave voyeurism in a world, other than our own, but really enough for our enjoyment and entertainment. If this world sounds similar to yours, you will enjoy it so much more. Lastly, however, the music that is dated will send you back in time if you are over 30 years old.
