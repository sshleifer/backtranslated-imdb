This movie is about development. People grow and blur people, surprise people and disappoint people. It has everything and more. There is hope, frustration, injustice, justice, love and hatred. It is truly a classic drama that plays fantastic performances from all over, but especially Whoopi Goldberg in her debut role. <br /> <br /> This movie made me very human and proud, and I suggest that this movie should be compulsory every Saturday in all prisons in the world - it touches your compassion. Rating: 10 out of 10. <br /> <br /> PS: I admit it: I poured a tear of joy into the final scene.
