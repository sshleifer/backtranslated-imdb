... in our household. Like everyone who communicated on this movie, my brothers (7 and 4 years old) and I (10) would see this movie over and over again. We all loved Star Wars, but we always went back to this one because of the big songs and the adventure. We all loved the Camel and sang during his song on our lungs. There are a few slow moments (the time he spent with King Koo-Koo in his court) and we usually got bored with The Knight's song ("The reason I have a sound effect is because I loooooove you "" but we loved the trip to save Babbette and the end and were all a bit frustrated by the picture of King Koo-Koo floating there and dominating the entire horizon and laughing at the end. I sing to this day 'Hooray to me! Babbette of gay Paris! ' To my friends (I am now 33) just looking at me as if I lost my head; However, if I sing it, I am 10 years old and remember the wonderful year of Star Wars again.
