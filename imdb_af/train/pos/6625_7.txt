If you've ever seen the trailer for the movie "The Recruit" with Colin Farrell and Al Pacino, you'll never have to watch that movie. Unfortunately, Renaissance had similar exciting trailer-makers. <br /> <br /> The story of Renaissance is about a detective investigating the kidnapping of a young woman and medical researcher. The institution is a futuristic Paris, and science fiction elements are found throughout. However, the particular aspect of Renaissance is its visual style, not its story. Renaissance is 3D computer animation, like Final Fantasy, but highly stylized in black and white with ultra sharp contrasts. The result looks stunning (although the problems of 3D animation of people are still visible from time to time: slightly robotic movements, slightly woodwork, etc.) As a highly stylized, beautiful film noir, Renaissance manages to surprise the audience, especially visually. However, the story and writing are not quite at the same level of quality as the visuals. It's not a bad story (and supposedly, if you haven't seen the trailer, it's much more exciting than it was for me). But it is a story that is not highly original and accompanies the chicks. A few lines of dialogue were painfully corny, so the writing sounded like a beginner's first attempts. <br /> <br /> I would definitely recommend Renaissance for friends. This is different from what I have seen visually before, and I believe that its originality only makes a valuable experience. It's also a viewable story, even if it's not perfect.
