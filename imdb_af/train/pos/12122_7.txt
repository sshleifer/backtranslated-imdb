The movie can be wonderful. I watched it last night, but I can't feel honest about it, because I read the book first. The book is so much better than the movie I was disappointed with the movie. If you want to look at "Human Bondage", don't read the book in advance. On the other hand, the book is so good and contains so much more than the love relationship Phillip has with Mildred. You can still enjoy it after watching the movie. I don't make this claim light. On average, I read a book every 4 days and read such diverse writers as Danielle Steel, Ovid, Faulkner, Plato and Shakespeare. "Of Human Bondage" gets my voice as one of the top ten novels ever written.
