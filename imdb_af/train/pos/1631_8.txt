This movie has it all. Sight gags, subtle jokes, plays on words and verses. It's about a patchwork group of boys from different ethnic and social classes who come together to defeat a common enemy. If you watch it more than once, you'll find you call it Animal House (and yes, I also like Animal House). I sit in the top 15 funniest movies. The master of a boy's military academy is paranoid that every child is bad and wants to cause problems (in this movie he is right). He is sadistic, unaware, cruel and must be photographed. The group of boys who do not even come together end up with each other to survive and get rid of Major with a crazy plan that only Mad Magazine wrote. A must see - you'll love it!
