Having seen briefly at horror movie marathons a few times, I believe it is a humorous parody that cuts into the main point of its reference. <br /> <br /> Although the themes are cramped and outdated for today's viewers, this is certainly not a waste of time. <br /> <br /> Although it is a student profile, it does not give an excuse, the proof is that it looks carefully with a budget of little or no dough. br /> <br /> As noted by another reviewer, it's less than ten minutes to clear the time of the show with a toast of joy, sit back and sit in the movie. <br /> <br /> I think this short roll of film should be enjoyed as a starter for the title reference and the viewer should relax and work with it.
