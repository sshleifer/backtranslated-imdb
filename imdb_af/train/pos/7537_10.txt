Contrary to Christianity's hatred, the 700 Club offers real answers as well as inspiration. It also offers reliable news, logical comments and a different view than what ABC, CBS, NBC and PBS think is best. Contrary to other programs that offer social and religious comments, those behind the 700 club provide assistance to the needy, such as the hunger of Operation Blessing, providing medical assistance to those who live and give hope to poverty-stricken communities those who need hope. It is not hateful at all. If the 700 club violates you, I suggest that you reach the remote and set the channel on your TV. I do the same thing when I find CNN Headline News or the case, programs that I find biased or offensive. What I find offensive is the way in which the ABC family indulges that the view of the 700 club does not reflect that of ABC family.
