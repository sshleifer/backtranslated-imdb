I took the end of this movie channel that followed through the cable film channels. I was so intrigued that I was looking for the next show. <br /> <br /> I didn't really know what to expect after reading the program summary, but I got away from this movie, which is quite disturbed and distressed. It also gave me a little better insight into what our children should do today in the 80's high school. <br /> <br /> The fact that you don't see the shooting just adds to the coldness of the plot. To see both children and adults struggling to understand and talk to the senseless shooting was sometimes overwhelming. And I would admit that I had poured a few tears throughout. <br /> <br /> Overall, not a movie I will be looking for, but I'm sure I saw it.
