Making an old collection of stories is a challenge for the production team, how to bring this classic character up to date and make it interesting to catch a new audience while stirring memories of her former audience. In my opinion, their goal has been achieved. A must see for young children, pre-teens, teens and their parents. OK there are a few scary moments that are resolved in short order, but parents with young children need to sit tight, the movie goes to better things. I go with the smart user judges who point out that Emma Roberts offers us a positive role model for young women, not even poppy. Nancy balances her femininity with career-oriented sleuthing skills. Lots of here likes, laughs, doesn't take too seriously, a real riddle to solve (one can find yourself as an extra bonus and similar characters. Nancy Drew even makes me a good date movie .
