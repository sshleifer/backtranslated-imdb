This is the best movie I've been facing long ago. Not only is it the best movie of its kind (school shooting). The way Ben Coccio (the director) decided to film was wonderful. He filmed it using teenage actors who attended high school. He filmed it in the actors' own rooms and used the actors real parents as their parents in the film. Also, the actors were filming with video cameras, which made it look much more like a video diary. It's almost art. (If it is a word) There are some slip-ups, but when Cal calls brads (?) Land rover a series of rover (or vice versa, it's been a while since I saw it)
