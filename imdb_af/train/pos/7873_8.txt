Page 3 is definitely a very exciting and engaging eye-catcher that exposes the hypocritical lifestyles of Mumbai's elite very cleverly. From the false kisses to the plastered smiles, there is no stone untouched to reveal the shocking lives of the rich and famous. Backstabbing, gossip, corruption and scandal glance in every dark corner in the world of shine and shine. Humanity and generosity are analogous to an oasis in the desert in this world where social Darwinism is the prevailing mentality. Everyone is constantly looking for more money, more celebrity and a higher reputation. They manage them to do the most disgraceful things that are meant to be the signing of movie contracts at a funeral for child molestation. Anything is possible in this metropolis where there is such a wide gap between the social classes. The audience sees the ugliness of both these classes through the eyes of the protagonist. She looks at the suffocating atmosphere and the staggering madness with which the social people live. Bollywood, business tycoons, politicians and the underworld are all in a completely destroyed rubble! Kitne Ajeeb Hai is a nice job like the fiery Kuan Main Doob Jaongi. Great movie with excellent character development!
