In the colonies we are not all familiar with Arthur Askey, so I almost skipped this movie (which recently had its TCM preview) due to the negative comment on this about his appearance in "Ghost Train" - which I expected to be thoroughly irritating. Instead, I was pleasantly surprised to hear myself audibly. The physical aspects of Askey's comedy and his timing to make a line suggest what you would get if Charlie Chaplin and Woody Allen had a baby. There is no comparison with Bud Abbott or any of the other common providers of comic relief that appear in films of this genre. One can also link the thread Askey commits to British comedy 30 years later; At least it is clear from an American point of view that it has more in common with the Monty Python troop than with any of its peers above. As for the rest of the movie - the more movies you've seen, the more likely you'll be guessing, but it's still very entertaining and atmospheric and worth waiting for the next look.
