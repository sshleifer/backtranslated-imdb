Well, here's the deal: if you're easily offended, you may want to stay far from this one. There are some painful funny moments in the movie, but I probably left as much as I laughed. Actually, I probably saved more than I laughed. And if I didn't literally blush on the outside, I left inside. If there is absolutely nothing in this movie that makes you embarrassed, you simply have no shame. Whether it's a place of honor or not, is in view of the premise. I will not deny that I have laughed, but it is a movie I simply cannot offer a blanket. because of his subject. If I wanted to say, "This movie is hilarious, look it out!" and a cute, cute church woman goes to the theater and has a heart attack in one of the graphically explicit sex situations. Well, that's just something I don't need on my conscience. <br /> <br /> So, how noisy is it? Hmm, try about 100 times worse than The Wedding Crashers. Honest. My mother would have come out during the first scene. I feel it is my duty to at least warn you of what to expect. <br /> <br /> There's a smart intelligent comedy here, but that's what I expected from the man (Judd Apatow), who had a hand both Freaks and Geeks and Undeclared. I'm all for the fun of Michael McDonald; the only man whose hair and beard is white enough to give Kenny Rogers a run for his money. Paul Rudd proclaims, "If I hear you will be again, I will burn Ya Mo this place," is hilarious, but this is one of the things the majority of the audience will not appreciate. <br /> <br /> And when we see a quick 3-second jump back from Steve Carrell, he tells Cameo's Word Up, I laughed for two minutes after the joke was over, while most everyone was out and then forget it. <br /> <br /> Oddly, despite the raunch, there is an admirable morale to the story. The film does not release Carrell as a freaky loser just because he is a virgin. He is really portrayed as a lovely, admirable character. Sure, he's a little weird. He has a framed Asia poster, 'more video games as an Asian child,' and a toy collection that knows the Million Dollar Man's BOSS, but we never led to believe there was anything wrong with the fact he is a virgin. As strange as it may seem, there is a bit of a "It's OK to Wait" message. <br /> <br /> But man, oh man, be warned it's pushing its R rating as far as it can. It was definitely Apatow's intention. He says he is improving some of the guys (especially Rogen and Malco) and talking as they normally speak, all in an effort to find many new ways to be dirty. If you can handle it or speak for yourself, then you will love the movie. <br /> <br /> I'm not a big fan of excessive curse and sex. I find that subtle, clever humor is much more entertaining than about 200 uses of the f word or fratboy sex discussions. But this is me. As I said, there are a few hysterical moments here, but you have to ask yourself if they are worth sitting through one of the most vulgar movies you'll probably ever see at the theater. I just don't know how interested most women will be in what is being discussed by men while playing poker. Honest ladies, you might not know. If you were ever curious why some girls think guys are gross, this gives you a good idea. <br /> <br /> There you go - my humble, honest take on what to expect. Be it your guide It should definitely not be seen at your Sunday school class, mama, grandmother, any opposite-sex family, any age-old child or someone who is easily offended by excessive profanity or explicit sex discussion. If you see it with any of the above, you obviously have no understanding of what it means to be uncomfortable.
