This movie came and went into the theaters. Because of its nature, you can see why it was not well received. It is unfairly breaded because of its subject matter more than the actual film itself. Higher learning is not spectacular, but it was good film trying to talk about a dreaded subject in America: racism. <br /> <br /> Plot / story: Higher learning is mostly around Malik (played by Omar Epps), a naive track star that is to deal with not fast enough, and a strict professor (played by Laurence Fishburne ). He is a friend of Fudge (Ice Cube) as well as a beautiful lady named Deja (Tyra Banks). Later they end up with some skinheads on campus. Remy (play by Michael Rapaport) is confused child who eventually befriends some local skinheads on campus. When they put their views on him, he becomes as racist as they are. <br /> <br /> Advice: Higher learning is not without its flaws: Character development is scarce, okay performances by Omar Epps, Tyra Banks and the leader of the skinheads (whose name I forgot), Busta Rhymes fits smoothly not in this movie. Plus, women who become gay after being abused by men were clich√© for this movie so you know I didn't like that part of the movie with Kristy Swanson. Other than that, this movie wasn't half bad. Laurence Fishburne was good as Professor Phipps (although I could do without the accent), Fudge was Ice Cube's best performance and Michael Rapaport was good as the confused Remy. All in all, it was one of John Singleton's best movies and one is one of the reasons I frown on the junk he is now shooting. Cinema needs more movies like Higher Learning, Mississippi Burning and American History X and less movies like Baby Boy, 2 Fast 2 Furious and a very useless remake of Shaft.
