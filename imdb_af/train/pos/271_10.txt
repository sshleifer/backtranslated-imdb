It's all about Mitzi. I loved her in this. And didn't she look fantastic? I like this lifetime Sunday afternoon popcorn movies. It's like one of those nails where they always go commercially at the most annoying times. The Richard character was completely creepy. I dated such guys. Well, not quite so nice. I wish Zack was not killed. He was a tuck shop and very easy on the eyes. I love these stalker types of stories. It always makes me and makes sure my doors are locked. My husband doesn't usually like these types of movies, but actually puts me through the whole thing and actually enjoys it. I can't wait to see what Mitzi does!
