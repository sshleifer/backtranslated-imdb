After my experience of Finland for just over a week, I would say this movie shows the nature of Finnish society very accurately. Especially the phenomenon of the young-couple-with-a-baby-serious-issue is very familiar to me, because I saw exactly the same person when I was in Finland. The relationships and problems of people, the fragility of the marriage institution, the drinking culture, unemployment and the rising money problem are all very well put, without any subjectivity or exaggeration. <br /> <br /> There are a few points in the movie that are not necessarily easy to understand and link to, but the collective big picture is still rewarding. Not every one of the short stories is exciting or deep, but as mentioned above, the big picture fails to deliver the feeling of "real life" and enchant the viewer. I think now in a quiet moment: What happens in the lives of all these people on the street? Well, that's what happens. Movies like this are good to feed your imaginative power. It will be safe to assume that this film may apply to life in many countries, but it reflects Finland especially as it is, and fairly damn. <br /> <br /> One comment about the play: Being the fan of Finnish cinema I'm, I have never seen any of these actors on any other movie, but I have the play in this feature right along seen the door to make the overall perfect. Maybe not a masterpiece, but a very good try throughout the crew. I keep an eye on the future releases of the director and the cast. <br /> <br /> 7.5 / 10
