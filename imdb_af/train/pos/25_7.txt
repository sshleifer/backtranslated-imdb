I never saw it when I was a child, so it was seen with fresh eyes. I have never heard it and hired my 5-year-old daughter. The idea of ​​Christopher Walken to sing and dance also made me curious. The special fx is cheesy and the singing and dancing are mediocre. But the story is wonderful. My daughter was enchanted. I liked watching Walken in this role and thinking about what the future holds for him. Very amusing to see him dance! And if the songs weren't big, at least they weren't Disney-over-manufactured saccharin sweetness. The ogre scene in the beginning was a bit scary for her, and she was a little nervous when we saw him again, but it was mostly benign. Interestingly, we recently read "Puss in Boots" and I wondered about the flawlessness of the story. But while Walken's acting was almost every aspect, it made it credible. Great fun. I'll see it again with my daughter.
