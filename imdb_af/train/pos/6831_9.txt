I just know of another movie that could possibly compete with Opening Night, and that is Bergman's Persona. Both movies are simply amazing, they have a wealth of ideas that are hard to grasp at first sight. We have a deep meditation on the relationship between art and life as one actress, Myrtle Gordon (Gena Rowlands), finds herself more in touch with the character she plays on stage than she wants. The accidental death of one of her supporters, a young girl who declares her love for Myrtle and she is hit by a car, leaves a deep point in the actress. She starts asking herself about her aging that begins to affect her until the only solution becomes alcohol. But it doesn't help much, and Myrtle is one step away from complete madness. The scene where she kills the imaginary (or not) spirit of the dead girl is one of the most exciting scenes I've found in a Cassavets movie. The movie ends with a brilliant performance for the director while filming a stage scene where he himself and Gena Rowlands improvise a scene. Myrtle gets drunk to the opening night to perform her part accurately. This scene is spontaneously filmed, with a lively audience, the laugh is real, the chemistry between Casavates and Rowlands is absolutely incredible. If you like Persona or are interested in a movie that offers great ideas with great entertainment, this movie will suit you.
