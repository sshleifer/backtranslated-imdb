It's a wonderful movie, both for the incredible energy that comes from frenetic flamenco dance, and from the unique way the filmmakers intertwine the story of stage production with the lives of the characters who prepare for it. Spell binding is the only word I can use to describe the experience. It's not Bizet's Carmen by any standard. It's not an ordinary movie by any standard. Every animated look, every stump of the foot, is every piece of music so surprised that you can't take your eyes off the screen. You don't have to love opera or flamenco (I don't) to get caught up, hurry up, surprised by this movie. Subtle and direct; hard and quiet; One of, if not the best, movies of its kind, because there is as little as that.
