Scott Henderson (Alan Curtis) is unfairly accused of killing his unfaithful wife. The night she was murdered, he was with a mystery woman who refused to give her name. When he was charged with the murder, the police visited all the places where he was with her, but people remember him alone. He was condemned to die and his secretary (Ella Raines) introduced the killer herself because she was his. <br /> <br /> It's made as a Universal B movie (watch the role players - all character players and one star - Franchot Tone - on the decline). The budget was small and the cast was mostly unknown, but what came out is one of the best movie-shoots of the 1940s. Beautifully directed by Curt Siodmak, it has a fantastic script that came from an excellent book by William Irish (a pen name for Cornell Woolrich). It moves fast and looks just fantastic. And there is the infamous jam session with Raines and Elisha Cook Jr. that just comes out of the screen with incredible sexual energy (I'm surprised the sensors didn't cut it.) There are just a few flaws that prevent it from being perfect. Tone gives a terrible performance. He looks terrible and he's just awful. Curtis is also stiff and slim like Henderson. You really wonder why Raines loves him - he's so unmotivated. But Raines is pretty good in the lead. She is beautiful and full of life. Also the last scene when the killer is after her, never ring true. He is physically a threat and her reactions just seem overstated. <br /> <br /> I still give it a 9. A very good movie - aside aside.
