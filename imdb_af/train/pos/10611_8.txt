What another reviewer called lack of character development, I call understatement. The movie did not throw one over the head with excessive or unnecessary retrieval. Yes, there were many unprecedented stories that we just got a glimpse of, but it was mainly a one-day snapshot of an event that catalysed the change in the characters' lives. Henry Thomas's performance was a wonderful study in the power of acting that focused on reaction rather than action. Good rental.
