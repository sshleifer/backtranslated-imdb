I went to Nancy Drew expecting the worst ... because of everyone's bad reviews. I thought: Even if I didn't see the books, it didn't look like the Nancy Drew I heard. But I was wrong. Certainly, it wasn't a carbon copy of the books, but if you make a movie out of something, you'll need to change it to become a big screen entertainment. The plot was pleasant and exciting with very real scarce and I thought Emma Roberts was really credible in her own way to portray this classic character. There were several funny moments and, unlike many statements, at no point in this movie, Nancy comes down like a ditz. She was intelligent, conservative, polite and sincere. One thing that this movie also did well was balance the whole thing with a mix of comedy, romance, excitement and warm moments. I loved this movie. What a movie, what a movie! And if you are wise and decide to trust me and see it, be prepared for some SCARY like heck moments because I was like freaking out! Go see or make a bum bum and just let other people decide what you think of this movie for you ... a mistake I almost made. I love it, I want to own this movie! I also love Emma Roberts. She is like a mini Bree Van De Kamp from DH. Love it, love it.
