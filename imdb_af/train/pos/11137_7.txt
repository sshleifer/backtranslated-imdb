Midnight Cowboy made a big fuss when it was released in 1969, with an X rating. At today's standards it will be difficult to draw an R rating. Jon Voight, who was better off, is competent in his role as Joe Buck, an out of town hick who makes it big with the ladies in New York. He meets a seedy street hustler named Ratso Rizzo, who tries to befriend Buck for his own purposes. The two eventually create a band that is both touching and pathetic. As Ratso, Dustin Hoffman appears. Hoffman was often brilliant, but never more so than in this depiction. He is such a character that everyone else compares to him. Release of the Oscar Award to John Wayne is one of the most ridiculous decisions ever made by the Academy of Moving Arts and Sciences. Director Schlessinger has a smart hand with his production, but this film has a grungy underbelly that leaves a bad taste in the mouth of the viewer. Worth seeing Hoffman's performance alone.
