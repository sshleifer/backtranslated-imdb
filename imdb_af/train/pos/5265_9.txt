I remember for the first time when I was 9. I wanted to be one of the "barbarian brothers". This movie is still big. One original aspect was that the battle scenes were very short. This implies that the "barbarian brothers" where so good are that they are fast enemies there! Plus, you have chases, a loft, a dragon, and even a barbrawl! <br /> <br /> Yes, the acting is bad, so it's not a ten, also the story line has got a lot of criticism. I think it's pretty original. Not too many movies in his genre have the same original story lines, or colorful dialogue. <br /> <br /> I definitely recommend this movie.
