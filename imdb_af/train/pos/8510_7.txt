It was the eighth and final Columbia Whistler movie and the only one without Richard Dix to retire from movies and die next year. It is still a skilled thriller, the machine is perfectly executed without it, but? something missing: Dix! The stories in the Whistler series have always been interesting, sometimes brilliant, the scenes are often never atmospheric, but it was not just the Whistler himself who hung it all on the screen. Dix also did. <br /> <br /> A two-week-old couple gets the urge to marry in the pouring rain, but is frightened when the potential bride first disappears. It is discovered that they are already married before she appears to be angry. Is the potential groom cut off, even when the private dick he hired to sneak her, snails or lambs suddenly, or is he blind? Who doubts who the question is. Michael Duane in his penultimate film is OK as a little bit of sweet Lenore Aubert's most beautiful moments come the next movie in Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein, and Richard Lane was wonderful as ever at Boston Blackie. Also the only excursion where the Whistler should be wet to grease the rain unless he is sprayed with sea foam in Voice. <br /> <br /> There has been a lot going on in this last hour, and it's worth looking at and again as usual to fans of the genre like me. The Whistler radio series, which began in 1942, lasted until 1955 to approximately 700 half-hour performances. Almost everyone is available on mp3 and based on what I have heard so far, almost everyone is also worth listening to.
