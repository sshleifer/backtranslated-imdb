This one will get reviews across the map as it does not fit easily with any form. It's horror - but not an explosion. It's equal to Suspens as well as Horror - but without the usual Hollywood screams and jerky camera. <br /> <br /> The feeling of the movie is saving and leaning alongside no special effects because I think you should listen to the faces of the characters. Forget Brendan a graduate of the Buffy universe. It's a red herring. He works here. 'Camp' is a deception of the tone of this story. Adrienne Barbeau gives a rock solid performance - so she must believe the script has something to say. We all know the sorry excuses that the actors no longer care about and are just waiting for the director to catch "Cut" and get their salaries. This is not the case here. <br /> <br /> Forgive the fact that the bodies are beginning to fall with virtually no-frills regularity. I don't think the intention was humorous, but to keep you out of balance. <br /> <br /> Think of it less of a Horror Movie and more of a Horror 'Play' on a stage - that rounded whitewashed house. Then you see it's really about paranoia, fear and spiraling madness that takes place in a remote location in the US. <br /> <br /> It's winding. Time travel, Mind Control, secret experiments and Nazis who may NOT be dead. . .yet. <br /> <br /> I say renting and trying it if you're in the mood for something a little cerebral. It will be a good choice for a midnight Saturday.
