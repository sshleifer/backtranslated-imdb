What a good movie it is. The idea of ​​nations sending people fighting giant robots is tough. The end is not just an appropriate one, but it is more inspiring. <br /> <br /> But I was captivated by the characters. It is a pity that we never develop the relationship between Achilles and Athena more than just kissing and Athena's fear of Achilles safety. Their romance is very pleasant. <br /> <br />
