After the success of the second installment, Richard Curtis and Ben Elton decided Blackadder should have a third appearance. This time, instead of Tudor times or Elizabethan times, Edmund Blackadder (BAFTA nominated Rowan Atkinson) lives at the time of the French Revolution. Led by the now stupid but sweet Baldrick (Tony Robinson) Blackadder is the "faithful" butler to George, the Prince of Wales (Hugh Laurie). During this third series after the wonderfully written sitcom, Blackadder tries everything he can to get rich and powerful. He is trying to pick a Lord for a rotten city, trying to sell a book, trying to win a bet on The Scarlet Pimpernel, trying to be a highway man and finally as the Prince. It's a very good installment for the popular comedy. Includes performances by Robbie Coltrane, Tim McInnerny, Miranda Richardson and Stephen Fry. This won the Best Comedy Series BAFTA, nominated for Best Design and Best Make Up. Rowan Atkinson was number 18 on the 50 largest British actors. He was number 24 on the comedian's comedian, and he was number 8 on Britain's favorite comedian. Edmund Blackadder was number 3 on the 100 largest TV characters, and he was number 3 on The world's largest comedy characters, and Blackadder (all four series) was number 2 in Britain's best sitcom. Outstanding!
