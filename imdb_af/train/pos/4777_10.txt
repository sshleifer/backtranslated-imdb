Perhaps the most personal of David Lynch's works is his most accessible. This time, rather than the enigmatic thematic structures that may involve a plot or something other than vibrant nightmares, Lynch offers a reflective, fragile meditation on the universal subjects of aging and family and finds comfort in both. The simple true story of a Iowa farmer (Richard Farnsworth) traveling a mower to Wisconsin to visit his estranged, married brother is still a lot of unique and original visual dream spirits (some striking aerial photos of the heartland) , filmed by veteran filmmaker Freddy Francis) to make it an unmistakable Lynch effort and characterization that is most memorable. Farnsworth is excellent in a stoic but pleasurable way, so the stories he hears on his journey become part of his life. Sissy Spacek turns in some of her best work into a smaller role than his mentally-challenged, daughter-in-law (whose painful Secret is revealed in a good way by a gentle twist in the sensitive script by John Roach and Mary Sweeney) But the rest of the little role play for a person produces indelible performances, one of the best known Barbara Robertson, whose casual murder of a deer is both riotous and sad at the same time. But it is vintage Lynch with its ability to engage and disrupt you at its best. For those who are unfamiliar with Lynch or just know him by his violent, disturbing reputation, this is a great place to start; For those who know its work, it is one of the best in its repertoire.
