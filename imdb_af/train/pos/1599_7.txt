"Moonstruck" is a beautiful little film arranged by great storyteller Norman Jewison (In the heat of the night, Fiddler on the Roof, The Hurricane). The film is good on many levels. It shows a good piece of Italian culture, has a pleasant romance, and best of all is a hilarious comedy. <br /> <br /> One thing I liked most about the movie was the relatively unconventional appearance of the actors. Nicolas Cage looks positively strange to most of the movie, and Cher. Well, Cher always looks a little strange. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a fun movie, and easy to recommend. <br /> <br / >7.4 out of 10
