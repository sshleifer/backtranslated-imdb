This movie is an excellent military movie. It may not be an excellent Hollywood movie, but it doesn't matter. Hollywood has a reputation for providing accuracy for good entertainment, but this is not the case with this movie. Other reviewers found that this movie is too slow for their taste, but ?? as a retired soldier ?? I appreciate the pace the movie crew has deliberately taken to tell their story as fully as possible, given the two hours and nine minutes allocated. The story itself has been told and recalled several times, but it remains for a professional soldier ?? and an African American? to report on the story presented by film staff, and as it represents the US fleet to the world. The story of Brashear's work to become a naval diver, and his life as a naval diver outside his graduation, is not the only story being presented. There I also told the story of how Master Officer Officer confirmed the illegal command of his commander that Petty Officer 2nd Class Brashear was not passed in his test dive, however good he did and paid the price of a loss of one Stripe has. and a change of command. It also told the true story of how Brashear found the third hydrogen bombs lost in the Atlantic from the coast of Spain in the 1950s and how he saved another sailor's life in the line of the broken. running line was broken, in two as Brashear did not move him out of the way and took the shot himself. It was a complex story that was worth telling, and I would admit that two hours and nine minutes was not enough to tell the full story and I can tell from the raptures on the DVD that the crew try to tell a story as full as possible. As a professional soldier I was proud to see such a great story told in such a comprehensive way and to preserve the traditions and honor of the fleet in such a natural and full way.
