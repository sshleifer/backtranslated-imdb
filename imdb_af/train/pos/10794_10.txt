I always enjoyed watching Chuck Norris in film. Although the play may not be excellent, the battle scenes are fantastic. I also enjoyed seeing Judson Mills next to him. In my opinion, the Norris Brothers proved that they were good entertainers and that was another great production! I hope you have the time to watch this movie!
