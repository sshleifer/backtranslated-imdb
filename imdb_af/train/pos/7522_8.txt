"The Notorious Bettie Page" is about a woman who always wanted to be an actress, but instead became one of the most famous girls in America's history. Bettie Page played by Gretchen Mol was one of the first sex icons in America. The modeling type Bettie Page participated in enclosed nudity and slavery that led to a US Senate investigation in the 1950s. <br /> <br /> From the movie I'm just about how far we've come from terms of pornography since the 1950s. You can now go on the internet and find some of the most disturbing and shocking images ever shot, that the images asked in "The Notorious Bettie Page" look almost childish and innocent. Most of the footage, including the slavery, did not have nudity when Bettie Page was involved. Today we have sick images where we can see that women have sex with animals. I think maybe the envelope has been pushed a little too far since the 1950s, because look at the movie about contemporary pornography. It was very tastefully done. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I was very impressed with "The notorious Bettie Page," I found the movie to be very well done and interesting. The movie is exactly what the trailer leads you to believe it will be and is a very interesting look at one of the first female sex toys in America. Gretchen Mol looks just like Bettie Page and gives a very good performance. I also thought that since the movie was shot in black and white, the film looked realistic because it made the audience believe they watched a movie created in the late 1950s. <br /> <br /> My only complaint about the movie was the run, there were a few scenes cut and were a little shorter than they should have been. I watched it and it seems that 10 minutes have been cut from the movie since the original show at the Toronto Film Festival. Also the end was pretty tame and I expected a little more or maybe a few paragraphs to get on the screen to tell the audience more about Bettie Page's life where the movie left. These are my only two complaints about the film, except that directing was solid, the drama was especially Gretchen, and the writing was good. <br /> <br /> Mary Harron, who directed "American Psycho" one of my favorite movies, is the director and author of "The Notorious Bettie Page." I feel that Mary is a very talented director who knows how to create an environment and create good movies on characters because, like 'Psycho', Bettie Page is a character study and a good one. Harron captures the 40's and 50's with ease as well as all the characters. She is a very talented director who I hope will be many years. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: "The Notorious Bettie Page" is definitely worth a look. This is a very interesting story that shows how far America, as well as the world, came in terms of pornography. The film also offers a good performance by Gretchen Mol, who nails literally the role of Bettie Page on the head. And hit it off with a talented director who could capture the look and feel of a previous era and you have a good movie on your hands. Unfortunately, this movie is likely to flop as not much, except people who grew up in this era, will show interest in the movie, but I think it's worth checking out. <br /> <br /> MovieManMenzel's final review for "The Notorious Bettie Page" is an 8/10. This is an interesting character study about one of the most famous pin-up girls and sex toys in American history.
