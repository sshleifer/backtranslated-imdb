In a word - excellent. This is the movie. Go see it. Director Ron Howard ... I mean, director Ron Howard did a fantastic job, as he usually does. An incredible attention to detail, bright colors and decorations, breathtaking Whoville atmosphere, astonishing variety of costumes. Wait, there's more than that - the story is also very good.

I'm sure she has a good future. The dog is cool. All in all, this is a very good Christmas fairy tale. If you like fairy tales, it's for you. If you like Christmas, it's for you. <br /> <br /> Read more reviews here ... Get a life. It hurts me every time to see people there who ... well ... their hearts have two sizes too small.
