Shocking, well-made chiller is an undervalued story of horrible murder and evil forces. <br /> <br /> Small village doctor is trying to discover who or what a series of violent sexual murders is committing to. <br /> <br /> Incubus is a tough secret, with some horrific murder sequences, building after a discount and ominous climate change. The murder tones are intense and stingy, so it's not a movie for the seakek! The direction of John Hough, along with a bizarre music party, combines to create a dark atmosphere of fear that runs through the film. It also carries a kind of Gothic atmosphere. Good filming stations and a few attractive cameras also work out. <br /> <br /> The roll throw is also not bad. The big John Cassavetes performs a solid performance as the new doctor in town. Also good are the performances of Kerrie Keane as local reporter, Helen Hughes as the city historian, and Duncan McIntosh as a plagued psychic teen. <br /> <br /> Everything around Incubus is a forgotten horror movie that needs to be re-discovered and reassessed. <br /> <br /> *** from ****
