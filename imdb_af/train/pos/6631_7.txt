I have no idea how to describe this movie, and I would also like to offer other opportunities I had - see it without prior knowledge of what to expect. I enjoyed it very much, but can also say that I hardly understood what was going on, if something was to be understood in the first place. Fans of David Lynch (tangential) or especially Guy Maddin movies should especially enjoy it, and any fans of the comic book EIGHTBALL will probably be next to themselves with joy and wonder (it came as close as any movie I saw and mood Dan Clowes creates so effectively. <br /> <br /> A light note just to easily offend someone - this movie, if graded, will be NC-17 sure. Fans of male full frontal nudity, but ... hmm, well ... yes. These are strange wild things.
