The last assignment (1928) is a silent film directed by Josef von Sternberg. This shows us the Tsarist General, Great Duke Sergius Alexander (Emil Jannings) in his days of glory. In 1917 he had all the strength, but after the revolution and the collapse of Imperial Russia he had nothing. He also had the love of a woman, Natalie Dabrova (Evelyn Brent). Over ten years later, he played a small role in a film about the revolution. His old enemy, Lev Andreyev (William Powell), is the director who chooses whether or not to treat him as a film. The Last Command is a very good quiet drama. Emil Jannings plays unforgettable role in the lead. Evelyn Brent is great at playing the woman's head. William Powell is wonderful as always. There are many scenes to remember in this movie. Like many scenes with Jannings and Brent. And then there's the end with Powell and Jannings. It is a movie that affects many parts.
