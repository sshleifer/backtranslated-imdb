I really enjoyed it - I am a huge fan of movies that have wasted your thoughts and debated many questions and ideas, and this was a great example. But then, Terry Gilliam, is always good with it. (Well, almost always. Let's just forget Jabberwocky and The Brothers Grimm, will we?). <br /> <br /> I especially liked the way it handled the time spent theme. and the avoidance of paradoxes - the way in which past and future events interweave and fed. <br /> <br /> It was also well done aesthetically - the art direction was really great, and I wish I could see it on the big screen. The futures had a similar feeling on Brazil, and even the current scenes were often really visually compelling. <br /> <br /> But perhaps the most striking thing about it was that it was two actors I usually know Not much like Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt, and they both performed fantastic performances here. Pitt in particular - I saw one or two movies before I realized he could actually do (as opposed to what I originally thought), but this one really surprised them. I actually found that I asked my friends at one point: "Are you sure it's Brad Pitt?" This is probably the most memorable performance of his career (although it can't say too much).
