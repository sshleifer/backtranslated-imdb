I love Ashley Judd and think all her movies are great. Ruby <br /> <br /> In Paradise is one of her best. It's a very underestimated movie that you really should watch to appreciate it. A story of a woman trying to make it herself and refusing to give in to temptations that will make her life easy. Some of her movies like Kiss The Girls and Time to Kill have probably done better at checkout and video rentals. They were also very good movies <br /> <br /> but take the time to really watch Ruby and I think you'll agree it's one of Ashley's Best. <br /> <br />
