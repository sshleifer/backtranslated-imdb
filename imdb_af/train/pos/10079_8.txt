I enjoy China's cinematographic recreation in the 1930s in this beautiful movie. The story is simple. An older male artist wants to surrender his art to a young man, though he has no live children. The faces of the actors are great to watch. The story reveals the dedication and gratitude of children to those who treat them well and their longing to be treated well. The operas in the movie remind me of FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE, which was more sophisticated and complicated. The story here reminds me of a Dickens story of days when children were almost chatting. The plot is a bit predictable and a little too sentimental to me, but time is worth watching for heroism, humanity, and history depicted.
