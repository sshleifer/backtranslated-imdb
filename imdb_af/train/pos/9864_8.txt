I watched 'Ice Age' in the movie and I enjoyed the movie. Despite the fact that the ice age has many errors and scientific errors, such as people, sabers, dinosaurs and mammoths living in the same period, and even the place where the story passes (looks like North America, but has some features of Iceland. , we can even have fun (unless you are very serious!) <br /> <br /> The planet enters an ICE AGE, and many animals migrate to the south where warmer, Sid is a stupid sloth left by his own family, who can no longer stand him, in his way he meets Manfred, or how he calls 'Manny' a cheerful mammoth, who does not care for extinction or immigration and goes to the north. Concerned that he can easily be caught, Sid decides to follow Manfred, and in the middle of their journey they found a human mother with her baby, the mother dies, but Manfred and Sid decide to take him and the baby for giving the people back, Diego, one of the sabers, decides to follow and help them to get a short cut d go to man's camp. What Manfred and Sid don't know is that Diego is a saber clan who hates people and wants to kill the baby and also pretends to betray them to make their saber's food. What will happen will depend on Diego's behavior and conscience ... <br /> aka "A Era do Gelo" - Brazil
