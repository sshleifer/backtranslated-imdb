If you read the summary of this movie, think it is something of a strange movie, and in some ways it is Gerard Reve's (Jeroen Krabbe's) primary character, especially through visions and hallucinations. The visions Gerard sees are all (more or less) subtle tips on what will happen to him, as the story continues and it is great fun for the viewer to try to figure out the symbolism used in the film. Despite the use of symbolism and a few tips to the end of the film, the movie has a very high excitement and does not become boring. This is mainly due to the great performances of Jeroen Krabbe and Ren√©e Soutendijk (Christine) and the great direction of Paul Verhoeven. His director style is clearly visible and one can say, look from different angles, that 'De Vierde Man' is a typical Verhoeven movie. Not only will it be typical of people who are familiar with their American films because of the nudity and the graphic violent scenes, but it will also be typical of people who are familiar with their Dutch films, due to the same things and their talent to tell a wonderful story. . When people look at Verhoeven's American movies, short-sighted people can say he has no talent to tell a good story and focus only on blood and sex. This is what some people think, while thinking that he is a very talented director who tries to convey a deeper message in each one with each movie. Although not a good film, Hollow Man (his last American film) is an example that Verhoeven can do more than science fiction, and companies can trust him more and more different movies. He needs it. Just look at his Dutch movies. Not only do they show that he needs some degree of freedom, but they also show that he has remarkable talent. "The Fourth Man" brought him one step closer to Hollywood and is certainly one of his best. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
