Let's look at it; Nancy Drew was never good literature. It's in the same category as babysitter club, magic tree house, Goosebumps, ABC Mysteries. In fact, it was one of the original formula stories. Nancy is perfect, beautiful, considerate, "nice", has no internal conflict ever! and never change. Ned is almost the same. The movie was true to that style and I have to say I liked it. It will never be a good movie, but it had the same nostalgic flavor as the books kept. It just had the right tension for my kids (8 and 10.) There was almost no offensive language. I like the pressure for more conservative dress. <br /> <br /> Corky was a bit of a nuisance. He was out of place on a high school campus. I never really found out why he was there in the first place.
