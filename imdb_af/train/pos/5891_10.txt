THE ITALIAN is an astonishing film that is busy for her time. Beautifully shot, with lighting effects truly sublime, it is an early gem that directly reveals that REGINALD BARKER is a pioneer director of equal status with D.W. GRIFFITH and MAURICE TOURNEUR. How much control Thomas Ince has exercised over production is difficult to know, but this film still has extraordinary power. The simple story of an Italian immigrant struggling to keep his family alive in New York is moving a lot. The themes of social injustice, revenge and forgiveness are completely relevant today. The use of close-ups is excellent and the power generation of GEORGE BEBAN is electrifying. What we need now is a very good print that is transferred to DVD so we can truly appreciate this early theater masterpiece.
