I recently had the pleasure of seeing The Big Bad Swim at the Ft. Lauderdale Film Festival and I have to say this is the best movie I've seen all year and the only movie I ever felt to write a comment / review. This film was beautifully targeted and combined with a writing with realistic dialogues, excellent acting and an inspirational message. Ordinary lives come together in an adult swimming class and become extraordinary in celebrating the diversity of life. It is sharply illustrated by the images in the first minute of this fascinating film where we see that only the legs and torso of individuals in different shapes and sizes come in a pool of water. This film is brilliantly targeted as the actors are placed and placed in fascinating scenes that keep your attention and imagination.
