What a wonderful movie that qualifies for so many labels it never gets: Science fiction, film noir, with a high intelligence script and dialogue that accepts an educated, cultured audience ..... the kind of English language movie just before 1960 showed England (and only in the US art movie houses when it first arrived), and never ever in the US. <br /> <br /> Major characters in the man in the white suit Alec Guiness and Joan Greenwood regularly use polysillabic, scientific reference words such as "polymer" and discuss and explain concepts of chemistry such as "long chain molecules" and then communicate their importance to the average man and benefit science offers him. <Br /> <br /> The man in the white suit (1951) is the opposite of the video game explosions, which now dominate (2009) world cinema and certainly dominates the big American cinema ....... that is A meticulous action, intelligently told tale by gifted and credible English actors (who bothered educated, perfect people), and all done with comedy, charm, pathos and ironic feelings that ancient Greek playwrights would have approved. <br /> <br /> Everybody should see this movie, and someday, somehow, a worthy movie maker and his fans should make another like it. <br /> <br /> It's great.
