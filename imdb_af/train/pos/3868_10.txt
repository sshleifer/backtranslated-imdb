A masterpiece. <br /> <br /> It may not be for everyone. <br /> <br /> The camera works, acting, directing and everything else is unique, original, fantastic in every way - and very different from the trash we used sadly. <br /> <br /> Summer Phoenix creates a deep, credible and intriguing Esther Kahn. Like everything else in this movie, her play is unique - it's completely her own - not 'British' or 'American' or anything else I've ever seen. There is something disturbing about it. <br /> <br /> The long, unbroken natural shots are great, and we remind ourselves that we have become too accustomed to some limited ways of shooting and editing.
