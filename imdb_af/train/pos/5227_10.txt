The movie "Men in White" is definitely one of the funniest, if not the funniest, comedy movies I've ever watched! (and I watched a lot!) It's about two garbagem, which is called "Men in White" and then stops in the space. It is also a parody of many classic movies, such as "Men in Black", "Star Wars" or "Dr. Strangelove". Anyone who says this movie is crappy has something wrong with his head. There are tons of funny gags and jokes here, and you can actually hurt your mouth to laugh too hard (it happened to me!). If you can watch this movie on TV, watch it now - you won't regret it!
