In the early to mid-1970s, Clifford Irving proposed to write Howard Hughes' ultimate biography. He claimed he had been preparing for the book for months, interviewed by the retired millionaire. When all was false, Irving was accused of perjury and spent several years behind bars (although his findings were always acknowledged, it was accurate). Flash forward to 20001, a few months before September 11, a book titled 'Forbidden Love' (announced in America as 'Honor Lost: Love and Death In Modern Day Jordan') by a previously unknown author below the name of Norma Khouri, a woman from Jordan, who reported death with mercy murdered by her best friend Dalia, because Dalia, who was a religious Muslim background, was a Christian man. It's like Irving's biography of Hughes revealed as a potential hoax. Australian filmmaker, Anna Broinowski, tries to dip into the evil marrow. It was Khouri's attempts to remove herself from the lie (s). Over the 104-minute period, the film's attempts to reveal, Norma Khouri is telling the truth, or is she just a juggler with an agenda / vendetta of her own? Interview with those who know and know her (including an ex-husband, her publisher, and others) tell their side of the story. It is a dental, well-crafted documentary that can show many fingers to as many guilty parties as possible. Not graded but contains a continual bad language and a re-enactment of the Greek murder scene, which is played over a few times (but nothing as nearly as graphic and disturbing as you would see in the latest torture epic , like Saw: Part 84). Not a good choice for the little ones.
