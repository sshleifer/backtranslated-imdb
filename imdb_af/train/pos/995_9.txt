This movie surprised me. Some things were "clicheish" and some technological elements reminded me of the movie "Enemy of the State" with Will Smith. But for the most part, very entertaining-good mix with Jamie Foxx and comedian Mike Epps and the 2 wannabe boefies Julio and Ramundo (offering some comic relief). It's a movie you can see again - say ... a Wednesday night when nothing else is going on. I gave it a 9 for entertainment value.
