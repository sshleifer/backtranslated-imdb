I missed the show all season and watched it on the ABC website during the summer of 2007. I absolutely love the show. I think the whole cast is excellent. This is one of my favorite shows ever. I just checked the ABC program range for this fall and didn't see it on the schedule. It's really sad. I hope they'll bring it back ... maybe they're waiting until Bridget Moynahan has her baby? Or is it not my wishful thought? <br /> <br /> I read some of the comments made about the show and see so many glowing remarks, similar to the mine. I certainly hope that ABC will reconsider its decision or hopefully another station will pick it up.
