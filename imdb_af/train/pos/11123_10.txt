Greetings from this Portuguese man :) <br /> <br /> I believe Sopranos is one of the best production ever, it blended reality and fiction so it's hard to see the difference. It has the same quality as Godfather! James Gandolfini suits the paper as a glove! I would like the Sopranos to never end. It's perfect! It must be a subject at school. I saw Sopranos when I was a kid, but I was too young to stay awake until the episode ended. So I bought all the episodes in DVD format and I watch all the episodes at home before and after dinner and I'm addicted, as I did with jail. According to me, Prison Break and The Sopranos are the best television series. The argument of both is beautiful and the actors are perfect. Congratulations to such a job. <br /> <br /> Sorry about my English. Thanks for reading.
