What a beautiful skirt ?? A very capable film that has so much charm and a feeling of feelings, that many romantic comedies are missing. Einstein is brilliantly dealt with by Walter Matthau, while Meg Ryan's Catherine is memorable ?? better than I saw her in those movies against Tom Hanks? as the young mathematician struggles to be recognized. <br /> <br /> You don't have to be a young woman to understand Katarina's struggle and feel sympathetic to her right away and as a young man it's easy to understand what needs to be done by Ed's (Tim Robbins) thought to pursue his true love. There is universal appeal in these emotions, even if I.Q. keep it all light, fun and tied. <br /> <br /> Sure it's not hard, but if you look, there are a few sub-texts. People remember Albert Einstein as a scientist, but he was a great spiritualist; his words like something like, "If it is not impossible, why do it?" suggests that he is a believer in fulfilling higher goals than immediate understanding. In this movie there are questions about what an accident really is ?? as if Albert and his intrepid collapse into a brand new Catherine away from stiff upper lip, loveless James (Stephen Fry, who gives this other cardboard character life and you can't help but feel for his lack of feeling). How much intervention happens in our lives that we don't see, and come across as serendipitous? <br /> <br /> Of course, we want to think in real life, despite the fact that we often observe the people that we have to teach Edwards the Catherines and Jameses to defrost the ice water in their veins. How nice to know that it can work out imaginatively in IQ's innocent (and disturbing, exclusively Caucasian) era.
