Of all the movies of the seventies, no one caught up to the true essence of good versus the evil battle like the Sentinel. I mean, yes, there were movies like the Eksorcist and others; but none of them caught the human element of the protagonist like this one. If you have time, make sure this one. You may not be beyond the dated devices as such, but this is a worthwhile story. Then there are all the stars and soon stars. My absolute favorites were Eli Wallach, Sylvia Miles and Burgess Meredith. Then there are the subtle clues that lead to what's going on. Pay close attention. I had to see it four times to catch all the smaller weird statements like 'black and white cat, black and white cake'. Plus, the books are also really good. I'm sorry they won't turn the second book into a movie. It is so scary that it will exceed this movie.
