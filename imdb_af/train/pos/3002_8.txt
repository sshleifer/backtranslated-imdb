"The Kennel Murder Case" starts with a twist and does not stop until the end. Everyone had reason to kill the victim and several people tried. William Powell is great like Philo Vance, Mr. Detective. Mary Astor is refreshing as the mission cousin who only wants to marry her Scottish husband and enjoy her legacy. This movie comes with "Nancy Drew, Reporter" on DVD, which is also fun. If you have to rent the disk (or look it from your local library), do it. It's pure entertainment!
