A hilarious and informative perspective of the world is portrayed in this anticipated comedy by first-time writer / director Peter M. Cohen. The story unfolds as the four male protagonists meet at the local dinner every week to talk about their tributes. We meet Brad: a nice, wall-street playboy with a fast and sharp tongue; Zeek: a cynical, sensitive author; Jonathan: A sexual confusion nice man with an affinity for hand cream and masturbation; and Eric: the married man who cherishes his weekly encounters with his only friends hoping for some relief from his boring and banal married life. The trials and tribulations of the men's single lives in New York are expressed amusingly, reflecting the face of the city and HBO's new comedy, The Mind of Married Man. The story takes a turn as the three singlets meet Mia - wittily played by Amanda Peet - and everything falls to her. She gives them each with her inability to meet the personalities they exhibit. When they realized that they all met and fell in love with the same woman, they chose her for their friendship. Whipped is a realistic depiction of the dating world, one that the critic failed to recognize. In simple language they missed the point. The protagonist here is caricature of real people. The exaggerations are hysterical, blending satire and humility, and should not be taken as seriously as the critic's denial indicates. See this movie, you'll be laughing from start to finish.
