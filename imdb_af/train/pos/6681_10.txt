This movie deserves better It's great, has wonderful jokes and siggats, some in-stuff for the "Geeks" among us (and we know who we are), and the effects are indeed effective. To see Paul Reubens speed in the face of an Oscar winner is the price of admission alone. I never read the cartoon series before I saw the movie, but have since. as good as they are, I still recommend to MM the movie. (Although the Flaming Carrot would have been cool as well) Greg Kinnear is ... amazing as Captain Amazing, and no one else can be The Shoveller except William H. Macy My favorite line in the movie? "We have a blind date with Destiny. And it looks like she's ordering the lobster." See this movie. BUY THIS MOVIE! It's just $ 5 and a few changes at your local Wal-Mart. You will thank me. Really you will. Oh, and Mrs. Garafolo is in it. IT ONLY WAKES IT UP
