"Chinese Spirit Story" is one of the most wonderful Hong Kong movies I've ever seen. It is a brilliant mix of fantasy, comedy, romance, horror and martial arts.The movie has wonderful visuals and wonderful battles. I especially love the fight. scene between Wu Ma and the tree demon tongue. Right original and refreshing film and another Embalmer's good recommendation.
