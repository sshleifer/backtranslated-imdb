As much as I enjoyed the Hanzo-Razor movies, three are definitely enough: "Who has the gold?" The final adventure for the Japanese lawyer with the impressive package is a pretty pleasant piece of Pinku theater, but offers a little new In terms of ideas, while taking a big step backwards in terms of outrage. <br /> <br /> The film opens with the appearance of a female ghost, and seems to be investigating supernatural territory, something that would have taken the series in an interesting new direction; unfortunately, after the ghost is nothing but a Scooby Doo style ruse (called by a corrupt treasurer who wants to keep people away from the lake where he hides stolen gold), director Yoshio Inoue is content to regain familiar elements . Of the first two films, the result is a rather boring relationship. <br /> <br /> Once again, Hanzo is investigating what it takes to question women by using its powerful penis, cutting out its enemies, and abusing it. its superiors. Along the way we get wild orgy, good morning rape (Hanzo forces himself to women who are thrilling) and bloody swords. <br /> <br /> If you have all the first two movies, you can also see this delivery to complete the set, but be warned. It is probably the least satisfactory one of them all. <br /> <br /> 6.5 out of 10, rounded to 7 for IMDb.
