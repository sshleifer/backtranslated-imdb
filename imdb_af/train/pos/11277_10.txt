Tarzan and Jane live happily in the jungle. Some men look for ivory and take Jane back to civilization. But Jane loves Tarzan and refuses to leave. One of the men falls in love with Jane and is determined to take her back ... even if that means Tarzan is being killed. <br /> <br /> It's a rarity - a sequel that's better than the original. "Tarzan, the Monkey Man" of 1932 was good, but dragged some terribly special effects and kind. This one has much better effects and is much more mature. There are tons of blatant racism (a black man was shot dead, pointless - and no one really cares), but it was 1934. There was also a lot of blood, gore and violence (for a 1934 movie) and uncut prints Jane did a long underwater swim completely naked! There is also obvious sexual content and Tarzan and Jane carry almost nothing and (it is implied) they sleep together and have sex - without being married. It won't bother anyone today, but in 1934 it was pretty extreme. <br /> <br /> It's also good, moving very fast and full of adventure and excitement. Seeing Weissmuller in that thin lion canvas is definitely a surprise to the eyes and Jane's outfit is also very revealing. I still think Maureen O'Sullivan is bad like Jane, but Weismuller is perfect as Tarzan. Everyone else is OK. <br /> <br /> It's easily the best Weismuller - O'Hara Tarzan out there. Well worth seeing, but not for kids!
