I only saw this movie as a young boy and recently bought it on DVD. <br /> <br /> James Stewart brings great depth to Chip Hardesty's hard-working and dedicated FBI agent. His life in the Bureau is confused with his family life, which is not all rosy. His wife (an excellent portrayal of Vera Miles) lives in fear of the dangerous nature of his work, and they even separate for a while; Chip's best friend and co-agent Sam Crandall (Murray Hamilton) is killed in a gunfire; Chip's son, Mike, signs in the Marines during World War II. Through all this, the family continues with bravery and dignity. <br /> <br /> The action sequences are very exciting and the semi-documentary style of the movie works effectively. And the music by Max Steiner says it all; loyalty, bravery and integrity. <br /> <br /> This country is a big thank you to the men and women of the FBI and also to J. Edgar Hoover. As Mr. Hoover's kind of vigilance has been met, our 9/11 could have been spared, the revival of crimes against children, and many of the friendly politicians we had to rise since his passing.
