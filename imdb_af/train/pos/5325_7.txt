The idea of ​​making a movie about the Beatles sounds doomed because no production can capture the idea of ​​the real Beatles. Then perhaps it is best not to try to recreate the past, but to produce an illustration that works best with the other available Beatles material. This is exactly what 'Birth of the Beatles' offers us, the simple story we know without any extras. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS here *** <br /> <br /> Be warned that not everything is as accurate as some Beatles graduates can expect. The Beatles are seen as performing songs that were almost even composed by that time. The Beatles perform 'Ask Me Why', 'P.S. I Love You 'and even' Don't Save Me '. The Beatles graduates have to see that if the Beatles on the film only performed songs that they actually did in Hamburg, the younger viewers could no longer recognize the Beatles who had learned to know them. Of the original Hamburg repertoire, only "Johnny B. Goode" and Stu Sutcliffe's "Love Me Tender" are retained. <br /> <br /> The guys who play the Beatles in this production hardly look like the original, but the rest of The movie still makes good performance, as the role for the rest is fairly accurate. The guy who plays Lennon is good and the rest of the group isn't bad either. Brian Epstein is wonderful and the moment he drops Pete Best from the group, it's probably the most memorable scene in the whole movie. Also as a bonus you get the original Cavern club in the movie.
