One must admit that Dev has an eye for beauty and talent. He gave a breakthrough to Zeenat Aman, a successful model, and also the former beauty contest winner, by throwing her into a role adapted for her debut. Her outrageous, stoned appearance, and her swing at the hypnotic music, treasure her for a moment. This movie is a surprise to the eyes, with its spectacular places, ethnic people, those Buddha temples, and chirpy, naughty Mumtaz, which looks attractive in her ethnic dress and dance skills. Of course, Dev is treasured and this is one of his commercially successful achievements. Her Rama succeeds in keeping the interest, with carefully written writing, editing and captivating music. Like Des Pardes, she has treated other film, Anand, the subject of young people who occur in the habit of drug addiction, and the theory of them originating from disturbed families, and the restless childhood, is reasonably likely. A good entertainer, this movie retains the freshness to date!
