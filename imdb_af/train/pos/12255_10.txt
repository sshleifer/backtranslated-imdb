From the flurry of Austen movies from the 1990s, this is my favorite, even more than "persuasion", which is the one that transformed me into Austeniana. Before I saw this Emma, ​​I saw two previous versions, but in one, Emma looked everything wrong, more like Lady Teazle, and in the other, she was half wrong, like a possible fraudster, just right, young a judgment. and stubborn. In general, I thought the attitude and atmosphere of the production conveyed the charm of the novel very well; Indeed, this is one of the loveliest, most delicious things I have ever seen, rather in the nature of a Christmas treat. The writing is exceptionally well-formed, and the addition of the adapter, such as the shaft of light that Harriet reveals to Emma in church, keeps everything in hand. Mark Strong and Knightley are not what I expected, but I really enjoyed it. He speaks out the clear, practical side of the character, unlike Emma's affect, and his choleric outbursts against Frank Churchill are very funny. . Bernard Hepton makes Mr. Woodhouse a figure of almost Carrollian absurdity; Samantha Morton as Emma's protégé is exactly as soft and exactly as firm as she should be. And as in the same producers' "Pride and Prejudice", it is ensured that the ultimate links of characters can be believed - unique in some cases. For me this production was and remains a joy.
