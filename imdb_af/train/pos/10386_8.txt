What is wrong with your people, if you are not blown away by the action trolleys and jessica simpsons body, then you are mainly screwed into the head. Of course the movie is not a masterpiece, I don't think it was the intention to be. It was fun and funny, I never watched the show when I was younger, I just saw one episode recently, and when I watched the movie, I felt it had the same kind of atmosphere. The movies were almost shaking, and the cars were good, as it didn't bear me and pulled out like some of the screens in 2-fold. and Jessica Simpson is simply warm, I just wish they used her more in action rows. All in all, I've been watching it for a long time and I'll see it again soon and I'll buy it on DVD. People, enjoy it for what it is.
