CAT SOUP has two "Hello Kitty" type kittens that start a bizarre journey through the aftermath, where anything can happen and do it. This spirit-tripping Asian short uses no dialogue, replaces word balloons instead. There is no way to describe this demented cartoon except to tell you to see it for yourself. And make sure no one under 10 is in the room. Dissolution and cannibalism and cruelty and cruelty and sudden death and indifference to others are common themes. Honest. Perhaps the most memorable image is that of an elephant made up of water that swims through the kittens and also drives. But like almost everyone else in this movie, that foolish, spicy intermeet soon comes to a horrible end.
