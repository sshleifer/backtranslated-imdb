If you just read a summary of the plot, this movie will look like a typical 1930s movie. The story looks pretty confronted, the subject of maudlin. The strength and beauty of this film is in the direct, earthly performances of the cast. I have rarely seen Jean Harlow show a variety of feelings, rich and subtle nuances floating over her face. If you see their faces during the wedding in the chapel, there is such a clear depth of feeling between the main characters. The raw emotions are portrayed so sincerely, so true. The final row is almost unbearable: when Clark Gable looks at his son with so much joy and surprise, lift him up and say with pride: "My Child!" Gable's own son was born. him posthumously. This is one of the best examples of the Depression era theater.
