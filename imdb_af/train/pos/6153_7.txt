The clear parallel between Walt Disney's charming fantasy Bedknobs and Broomsticks and C.S. Lewis Chronicles or Narnia is pretty clear. There are more coincidences than comparing Bedknobs and Broomsticks than to Mary Poppins, although many creative talents went into the two Disney movies. <br /> <br /> Like The Chronicles of Narnia, some English children leave London. during the blitz and come to live in the country. And those kids are dealing with a world of magic. But unlike C.S. Lewis, the Rawlins children invaded the magic of their world and helped them defeat the people who make a mess in the here and now. No return to a fantasy like the Pevensie children. <br /> <br /> No heavy philosophy here of Walt Disney, except perhaps it's not a good thing to beat witches, even students like Angela Lansbury learning their magic from a Charlatan like David Tomlinson. Mrs. Lansbury was not one of the most bankable of artists for nothing. She wears her own brand of magic that even the special effects boys at Disney can't. And they won an Oscar for the Magic Kingdom in that department for this movie. <br /> <br /> Two artists bid farewell to movies in Bedknobs and Broomsticks. Tessie O'Shea played her final role in this movie. She has blessed a lot in the UK as one of their best-loved music performers. And this great character actor Reginald Owen as the retired general leading the Old Housekeeping in the war and in the song, presents to the film audiences around the world. <br /> <br /> The team of Robert B. Sherman and Richard M. Sherman who wrote the score for Mary Poppins wrote a good and useful one here. The age of non-glowing was nominated for an Oscar, but lost to the theme of Shaft. Personally, though, like David Tomlinson's tribute to this colorful of London's streets, Portabello Road. <br /> <br /> Bedbugs and Broomsticks are a fine fantasy film that still performs well after almost 40 years. Imagine how it will be with computer-generated graphics.
