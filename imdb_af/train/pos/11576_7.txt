It is trying to be the epic adventure of the century. And with a role like Sh√¥ Kasugi, Christopher Lee and John-Rhys Davies, it's really the perfect B-adventure of all time. It's actually a fun, swashbuckling adventure that, even with its mistakes, captures your interest. It should have been the biggest movie ever for the people who made it. Even if it's made in the 90's, it doesn't have a modern feel. It felt more like an old Errol Flynn movie. Big adventure movie is again the big thing in Hollywood, but I'm afraid the feeling in them will never be the same as those old movies. On the other hand, it just felt the right feeling. You just can't hate it. I think it's a good adventure movie. And I really love the soundtrack. Damn, I want the theme song.
