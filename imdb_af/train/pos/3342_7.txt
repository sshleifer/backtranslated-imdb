If you enjoy romantic comedies, you will find this story of two 30-year-old singles who fall in love with the American League races that are satisfactory. On the other hand, if you're hanging around to wait for Kill Bill Volume 3 or Sin City 2, you'll probably have to stay away. The plot contains the compulsory old meet girl's friends, girl meets old friends, and guy meets girl's parents scenes. There is even a man who meets daughter's pet dog tones. It's all for the course in a movie like this. But what I liked was that the plot was buried in the decision making process that people make when they realize that their romantic interest is not perfect and almost a bit strange. The plot centers on answering the questions; How much strangeness is too much and how much love does it take to trump those qualities? It's interesting to see how the characters work, because deeply (if we recognize it), we all have attributes. Barrymore has a very good job in her role and Fallon sorta surprised me - he's good too. I rate it a 7 out of 10 as a romantic comedy. Add one point if you are a baseball fan or romantic involved with one. Add another point if you are a Red Sox fan and subtract two points if you are a Yankees fan.
