Before anything shown on TV was predictable. You can predict who will die or find something, but in Lost you can't predict anything. Every thing was so amazingly amazing and it was really a mystery because it has so many secrets, but because there was nothing to it before everything was so good. I literally got addicted. Lost is a classic artwork. It gives you something to look out every week. This is genius. The environment is brilliant, it is calm and warm on the beach and so scary in the jungle. The characters are a brilliant job, each one of them, especially those already on the island. The castaways are so dramatic, but we can never predict their deaths because they have so much to do and so much more to say and they have secrets that affect the other castaways that die with them.
