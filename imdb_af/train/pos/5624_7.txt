I have never been a fan of Farrah Fawcett. Until now. She was truly wonderful in this movie. The emotion she has to go through the shooting has to be repeated again. It was a very difficult movie to watch, the subject is definitely unpleasant and you feel so helpless to just sit and watch a woman being abused for what looks like an eternity. I actually felt the whole thing was slightly deflated when her friends returned to the house and I didn't find the conclusion. The director was keen to use the height in his shots and was loved with mirror reflection. I believe he should pay more attention to the pass in the second half of this piece. I'm sure it makes a bat of a powerful piece of theater, this movie for me, although it has merit, just got short.
