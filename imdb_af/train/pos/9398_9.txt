It's an excellent contemporary film noir .... "excellent" because it's interesting, start-to-finish. There are a few holes here and some goofy parts that make you shake your head in disbelief ... but I didn't find anyone caught in this story. The movie has the right amount of action, excitement, intriguing and interesting characters. In addition, it has some nice colors and cinematography, plus a good guitar-based soundtrack. <br /> <br /> I tagged this crime movie a "film noir" because it's gritty and all the characters aren't good. Even the only supposedly good man, played by Nicholas Cage, gets himself into trouble and has a quick relationship he shouldn't have. He also does something that is not right, but I'm not going to spoil it by saying. However, it is enough to say that the rest of the characters are so bad that their Kage looks good! <br /> <br /> Speaking of "bad guys", does anyone better than Dennis Hopper? Not much. At least in the "strangled" category, he is tough to beat. Lara Flynn Boyle is fun to watch for a lot of reasons. J.T. Walsh also gives a great supporting performance. <br /> <br /> It's one of those movies that never got much publicity, but it should have. You will enjoy watching. By the way, try to say the name of this movie aloud three times without overhauling it!
