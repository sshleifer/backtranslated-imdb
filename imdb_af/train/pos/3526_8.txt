Phantom Lady (1944) Dir: Robert Siodmak <br /> <br /> Production: Universal Pictures <br /> <br /> Scott Henderson (Alan Curtis), who has a nasty battle and split with his wife, looks like its sad at the local waterhole. There he spies a woman in a similar emotional state and looks for a company to get a show at a club to get their minds out of their problems. She agrees, but only on condition that they keep their names for themselves. Sure enough, if Scott comes home, he finds the police there and waits to ask him. His wife was killed. Where were you at 8 o'clock tonight, ask Insp. Burgess (Thomas Gomez)? But Scott has an alibi, right? Just he didn't know the woman's name. And the barman remembers Scott but not the woman. Also the taxi driver. Also the drummer (Elisha Cook Jr) at the club. Even the dancer at the club, who clearly caught Scott to the woman (they both had the same hat), would not admit that someone was with him. There is something going on, but whatever, Scott is helpless to hear himself during a trial and is sentenced to death for his wife's murder (on the flashiest "evidence" in Hollywood's legal history). It is left to his loyal secretary, 'Kansas' (Ella Raines), who was later joined by a sympathetic inspector Burgess to find out the right killer before Scott was executed. <br /> <br /> Phantom Lady is built on themes that repeat, almost compelling, in Woolrich's work. For example, the schizophrenic antagonist is also seen in Black Angel and The Leopard Man. In addition, there is the character spiritually unholy by the death of a darling or spouse found in Rendezvous in Black and The Bride Wore Black. It can make a viewer feel like he's walking on good ground. But in the right hands are the feverish images, sorry dialogue, the narrative contradictions, everything but the point. Fortunately, Phantom Lady is led by good hands. <br /> <br /> This is Siodmak's first noir. He would distinguish himself as one of, if not the foremost, style practitioners (The Killers, Criss Cross). Here he happened to be accompanied by cinematographer Woody Bredell (they are reunited on Christmas holidays and The Killers). A great storytelling was done in the camera. In one shot, the degradation of a character is shown, as he is sitting in front of a 3-way mirror, representing several personalities. The same character, who is an artist, has Van Gogh's self-portrait with the knotted ear hanging in his apartment on the wall. But what Siodmak and Bredell really do in Phantom Lady creates virtually noir. Released early in 1944, it's all here; the wet paving, the pockets of atmosphere and the fear, the sharp contrasting b & w, the wild expressionist versions of reality (when Kansas goes to jail), the indifferent leagues, etc. It's a fantastic picture to look at. /> <br /> Aside from the Franchot Tone, the cast, as well as the subject and relative inexperience of the director (and presumably the budget), suggest B-movie ambitions. I thought Tone was a little hammy. Alan Curtis (High Sierra) is not too much, and actually looks a little poor in some scenes. Ella Raines is usually good (and very nice). Her "sex scene" with Elisa Cook Jr. is so delirious that it should be seen to be believed. Another striking scene is when Kansas goes to the bartender to question him. It comes down to a chase, as she relentlessly drives him through the streets, with a stop at a subway station. There is some good tension there. <br /> <br /> *** out 4
