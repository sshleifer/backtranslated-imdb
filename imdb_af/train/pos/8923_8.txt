The Blob is a classic 1950's B-movie slideshow movie. You probably know the story: two teenagers (Steve McQueen & Aneta Corsaut) see a meteor hit the ground and when they go looking, they walk into an old man with some strange ... blob on his arm. They took him to the doctor's office and then found out what had happened. From there the blob spreads and everyone eats in his path. The special effects are cute fun, just like the story. There are many good touches, such as police playing a policeman in another district over the radio. It's not a masterpiece, but it has a special place in its genre. Steve McQueen is very good. 8/10.
