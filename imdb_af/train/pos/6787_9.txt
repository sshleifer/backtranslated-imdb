Last night I stumbled upon a TCM. <br /> <br /> Didn't see it as it originally came out, but it never forgot. <br /> <br /> I completely forgot how beautiful and talented Signe Hasso was when she was young, it was for Shelly Winters before she was provoked. <br /> <br /> However, Ronald Coleman was the actual state actor of his time - I read Othello in high school English - and HAT. After seeing a double life, I read it again and finally understood what the play was about. <br /> <br /> The Gordon / Kanin writing team was at the height of this script. <br /> <br /> A movie worth remembering and watching,
