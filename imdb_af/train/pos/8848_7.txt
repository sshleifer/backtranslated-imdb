I watched this movie in a very strange way - I listed it on my Netflix list and couldn't remember why (except I knew Philip Seymour Hoffman). Since the movie has no opening credits, I couldn't even remember who did it. <br /> <br /> Like my wife and I watched it, I came to her about 45 minutes and said, "You know, I like to decide I hate this movie, but I won't just stop watching. "Then there's a piece of about half a dozen scenes in the middle of the movie that is really electrifying in the actors' performances. <br /> <br /> It was only as the end credits rolled, that I realized it was a Sidney Lumet movie. And I thought - wow. I am surprised that Lumet assumed what was really a dirty, tiny little story about really mean, broken people. But it's a proof of his talent that I was so caught up when I didn't even realize it was him. <br /> <br /> Philip Seymour Hoffman is really good at this movie. Like very good. Put it up against Capote and I would rather claim the Oscar that it was rather for this movie. <br /> <br /> I also recommend the narrative special feature with Lumet, Hawke and Hoffman, who talk about making the movie - it's entertaining and educational, with Hawke wanting to teach the student to the master to teach his feet. Lumet definitely teaches you the first rule to work with actors - constantly kissing their asses! <br /> <br /> There are many violent, melodramatic movies out there that are empty cifiers when everything is said and done. And there's an element in this movie - that the actors fill the air with sulfur-like explosions, and when the smoke cleans, there's nothing left. Nothing resonates at a deeper level. <br /> <br /> But Lumet has given us Network and Twelve Angry Men - films that each have their own way to the highest echelons of the theater. <br /> <br /> This movie is not at that level. But there's something about it. And maybe that's enough. <br /> <br /> My last comment concerns the comment - if you look at the number of comments on this little movie here on IMDb - and the depth and intelligence of the comment, pro and it's a good indication that something special is going on with this movie.
