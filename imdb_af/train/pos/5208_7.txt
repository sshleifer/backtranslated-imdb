If you want your Chaplin vision limited to a lovely tramp and you get your stomach of pathos, look something else. However, if you love a slapstick comedy performed by one of the best, you should see this one. <br /> <br /> The picture is of the tramp that the girl really can't find. He mocks another couple on a park bench, and he has a blast that destroys their fun. <br /> <br /> It's one of Chaplin's "park comedies" filmed in Mack Sennett's park, with bags and police and couples. These shorts, such as the format allow Chaplin to shine as he weaves through predicaments. <br /> <br /> I checked the box as it could be considered a spoiler, even if you didn't see these movies. Everyone ends up in the dam, except Chaplin. He gets the girl, who in this case is played by Minta Durfee, viz. Mrs. Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle.
