I really enjoyed the 60's. Not from that generation (I'm waiting for the 80's). It was interesting to see a unique four-hour capsule for that era. <br /> <br /> However, one major problem in the movie was how unbalanced the film was in portraying the families. According to promotions I saw for the movie on NBC, the story was basically about two families struggling in the 1960s America. Now I may have missed something, but I think we learned more about the white family than the African American family. <br /> <br /> I really think the 60's uses music to better describe the scenes than any dialogue that can come from the mouth of the actors (everyone is very talented.) It is very visible at the end of the first part (about two hours) of the mini series. <br /> <br /> Very good movie!
