Corbin Bernsen's letters to four criminal associates he worked in the past are a truly intergenerational mix with Fred Diamond, Lou Diamond Phillips, William Russ and Ruben Blades. They will meet him in this obscure Montana city and he doesn't explain why, because he is being picked up on a warrant by the New Jersey state police. <br /> <br /> They all know Bernsen from the criminal group that came together, but don't know each other. A lot of comedy is that they feel each other. As the oldest Gwynne denies, take it to the other as they gather. Especially when they find out what Bernsen had in mind. <br /> <br /> As far as Bernsen is concerned, he is fortunate to be picked up by a few bumblebees in Ed O'Neill and Daniel Roebuck. He gets the drop on O'Neill and escapes. <br /> <br /> Then it's the four criminals trying to complete what Bernsen started and Bernsen escaped the police. In the intricate sketch game, it is fascinating how both story lines connect each other. Hoyt Axton as the local sheriff looks surprised at what unfolds in his village. <br /> <br /> Disorganized Crime is an incredibly funny hijacking movie by a lot of players who mostly had a background in television or would soon have wanted. I can't say someone knocked out, they look so good together. <br /> <br /> It is ironic that none of these people are comedians, but they all have a light comic touch that has good guidance. <br /> <br /> Disorganized Crime is a very funny caper movie, the kind of movie that the famous pessimistic Mr. Murphy would have written.
