There is one detail, which is not very common to Jackie Chan movies, but is present here. It has a very difficult and serious atmosphere about it, while the funny elements are also present. Jackie is threatening and psychotic here. He is not a hero who is attacked and only then fights back (in a normal lay-back pattern), but he is the one who can go and start the noise. His way to hit that evil man in the glasses is incredible. Every time it goes "crack!" I also especially enjoy the scene when Jackie goes to the bar and defeats the villains that were on his girlfriend. This is one of the best flash graphics on the screen. In addition, the whole scene is shot with the backdrop of an action character painted on the wall (it also looks like a "rabochiy" poster of our Soviet era) and a few lines in Russian on the left (I have it accidentally noticed). It looks wonderful (and nostalgic for Russian people). I also like when the windows are hit in the movie. Here are a lot of these things. It's amazing to watch the characters fall / jump / run / drive through all sorts of windows. <br /> <br /> All three movies are great. I prepared myself to see the quality, but I saw a perfect trilogy with sense and incredible stunts (and not only Jackie Chan's character appears in all three movies - it is also excellent and keeps continuity). <Br /> <br /> I just want to describe every movie in a few words: No.1 - big (in all respects - it's a gripping story from start to finish) and funny (many scenes are ridiculous ); No.2 - furious (Jackie is really * beep * here) and painful (Jackie is tortured); No.3 - unbelievable (the woman fighting with Jackie is incredible) and bombastic (should I mention a lot of guns and explosions?). <br /> <br /> As far as the rest is concerned, many are mentioned by others. <br /> <br /> It's a trilogy that can be watched over and over (at least by me). The place is in the top 10 under action / comedy jewels. Lastly, it was released on DVD in Russia (the 2nd movie has the best options - Chinese / Russian soundtracks and English / Russian subtitles). Solid 10 out of 10. Thanks for your attention.
