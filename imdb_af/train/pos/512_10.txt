"Trap to Heaven" is an excellent invention of movies, probably never duplicated. I rank it with "The Wizard of Oz" and "African Queen," though it is a completely different kind of movie than "African Queen". "Trap to Heaven" is a psycho-drama that uses performance concepts and technical effects that, to my knowledge, are completely unique. <br /> <br /> For example, there is the combination of B&W and color material - as in "Oz", but the significance of the contrast goes far beyond the simple but beautiful effect of Oz. In the "Trap", the purpose and effect of the contrast can only be described as powerful. <br /> <br /> Another brilliant aspect of "Trap" is the concept of "time" and how it is used here. How can someone be better thought out to make time quiet? literally? And then there is the Stairs themselves! <br /> <br /> If you have any imagination, you will agree with me. "Trap to Heaven" is a real gem.
