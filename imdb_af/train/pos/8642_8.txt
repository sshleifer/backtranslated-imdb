A surprisingly effective excitement. <br /> <br /> David Duchovny and Michelle 'Ensign Ro' Forbes are a successful professional couple, he is a writer, she is a photographer. Forbes is desperate to move to California, and in a compromise, Mulder agrees on the condition that they visit visitors of historical interest on famous serial killers. His idea: he writes the words, she takes the pictures, with the end result a bestseller coffee table book that will set them up for life. To help finance the trip, they decide to share and advertise the car. As they have been accused, Brad Pitt will see the ad and shortly after murdering his landlord, he and his girlfriend, Juliette Lewis, will meet the writer and start their cross country stretch. Inevitably, the evil occurs. <br /> <br /> Pitt is excellent as the really cold inspiring Early Greyce and is pulled back by Lewis. She plays her usual white trash character, which is her default setting. Duchovny and Forbes also make a convincing dual action, and if events fall out of control, you as the viewer become sucked in and feel the stress scourge. <br /> <br /> Intelligent, sinister and beautifully shot, it deserves recognition beyond its current status. A top movie.
