Let's pursue: If you are a baby boomer, you have inevitably spent time wondering that in 1976 McCartney had the glue to fall into the city's hermit life and spend the day with him . You also probably wondered how things went. I heard exactly the same reports the author of this movie heard from John and Paul's perspective, and I admit that I reconstructed the meeting in almost the same way as this movie does. But none of my imagination could have bought tears in my eyes like this amazing piece of work and acting. I found it incredibly lifelike, perfectly credible and 100% saccharin free. Now, can anyone explain why I didn't hear from this masterpiece before it was shown by the CBC last night? I mean it's been three years old for the sake of the good name! And yes, if you're a Beatles fan, it's a must-see show! Even the subtle paraphrasing of the Beatles' melodies in the background was inspired.
