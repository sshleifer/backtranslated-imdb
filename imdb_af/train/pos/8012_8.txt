However, for the Muppet line, it's not the best or second best. It is marketed for the kids, but has a few dark, and emotionally disturbing, moments of moments that parents don't want to expose their children to. One shows that Miss Piggy is "jealous" in a jealous rage, which actually lasts for the duration of this work. <br /> <br /> In addition, the story is progressive and very entertaining. One scene in which Joan Rivers and Miss PIggy go berserk in a mall is simply hilarious! And there are other parts of this work that contain the same level of vitality and fun. <br /> <br /> I love this and enjoy it today. <br /> <br /> It's a 7.6 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> The Enemy :.
