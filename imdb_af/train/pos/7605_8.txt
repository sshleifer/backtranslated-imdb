Lost is a well-made TV show about some people who are lost to an island. there are so many twists that you can't really decide who your favorite character is, but one moment he is, then he does something, so he is the coolest, then she will do something, so the coolest then tension builds on just like you are going to break out the episode and you don't want soooooooooooooooooooo !!!!!! so you have to wait a whole week to see the next episode, but it's worth the wait. Suspension, action, romance, humor, it's all from the topless girls, but it's good because it means you can actually focus on the story and the story it's about. so if you want a good story and like a thrill, it's a good one, but I think it's probably better. (I also have a review on this.) I will lose a good 8 out of 10. Because it is so unpredictable, you never know what will happen next.
