This is one of the few films in which I consider the movie transmission to be an improvement on the original book. The story is clear, accessible, amusing and interesting and the musical numbers are exceptionally exceptional. I loved the cyclical version of 'The Old Home Guard' and the beautiful 'Portobello Road', a great combination of early animation + real actor techniques that, although dated, does not detract from the charm of the piece. The backdrop to World War II worked well and has not been omitted since the film was in progress, so often in 'evacuee' stories. <br /> <br /> Frequently underestimated films do not endorse people of all ages. The performances of the actors are extraordinarily well done and the whole text is neatly bound and well designed. Guaranteed to put a smile on your face!
