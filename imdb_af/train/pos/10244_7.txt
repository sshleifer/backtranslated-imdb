I won't be We're Back! ' N Dinosaur's Story, "but a kiddie version of" Jurassic Park ", I found it more interesting than that. Like the former, it puts security into one-day creatures. my eyes really when I saw who gave the voices: John Goodman, Rhea Perlman, Jay Leno, Walter Cronkite, Julia Child, Kenneth Mars, Yeardley Smith, Martin Short and Larry King Paraphrase: a given actor, the "Cheers" woman, the "Tonight Show" master, the most trusted name in news, a well-known chef, police chief "Young Frankenstein", Lisa Simpson, one of the Three Amigos and the CNN man. > <br /> But I think I shouldn't just focus on the cast, I thought this movie had something for both children (pure fun) and adults (natural history) True, these are the refugees, but the I would say John Goodman is doing Rex's voice here is a precursor to his voice work at Monsters Inc. to see.
