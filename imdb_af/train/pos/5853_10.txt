I really watched this Summerslam because of the appearance of the arena, the curtains and just the overall look was interesting to me for some reason. Anyway, it would have been one of the best Summerslam if WWF didn't have Lex Luger in the main event against Yokozuna, because it was time to have a big fat man, at a strong man, but I'm glad times have changed. It was a terrible main event just as every game in Luger is terrible. Other games on the map were Razor Ramon vs Ted Dibiase, Steiner Brothers vs Heavenly Bodies, Shawn Michaels vs Curt Hening. This was the event where Shawn called his big monster of a Diesel, IRS vs 1-2-3 Kid, Bret. Hart first took Doink and took Jerry Lawler and things with the Heart. Lawler was always very interesting, and Ludvig Borga destroyed Marty Jannetty. Undertaker took Giant Gonzalez in another terrible match. The Smoking Gunns and Tatanka adopted Bam Bam Bigelow and the Headshrinkers, and Yokozuna defended the world title against Lex Luger. This game was boring and it has a terrible end. However, it earns 8/10
