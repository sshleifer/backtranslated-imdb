** Warning - this post may contain spoilers ** <br /> <br /> I only got a Gamecube in September 2005, and the first two games I bought were James Bond games, the decent Agent Under Fire and the dull Goldeneye Rogue Agent. The next game I was planning to get was all or nothing, because my friend told me it was better than the two games I had. I must say he was right. <br /> <br /> I bought it for a dog in HMV, and when I got home, I hit it in my cube and played it for hours. It was much better than my other two games, and there was a much better and more interesting story. Graphics were the best I've seen (but now that the XBOX 360 came out, Farcry Instincts Predator has some of the best graphic features for humans). The storyline was clever; crazy man (Willem Dafoe, called Nikolai Diavolo) and beautiful henchwoman (Heidi Klum, called Katya Nadanova), trying to destroy the world with small nanobots, which must destroy at the beginning of the game, James Bond. a train. The bad thing is that one of them is hidden in Katya's boobs. You must then thwart their plans and save the world. <br /> <br /> The big thing about this game is that it actually has actors portraying the characters, such as Cleese, who speaks Q. There are 27 levels, some of them short and some of them are very long and tricky. <br /> <br /> Game - 10/10 Graph - 9/10 Sound - 9/10 Repeat - 7/10 Multiplayer - 8/10 <br /> <br /> I give this game a great total of 90%
