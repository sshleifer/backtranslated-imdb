As a child I loved this game. I played it a couple of times with my friend Andrew during the spring of 1993. I played Axel or Blaze and he was Adam and no matter how often we played it. We never got bored. Then streets of anger 2 came out. And we soon forgot that this one even existed. <br /> <br /> You play as ex-cops Axel Stone, Adam or Blaze Fielding, giving up the power to tackle the bad guys in their own way. There are 8 levels to work through a run-down and corrupt city led by evil Mr. X. To defeat all the bad guys and the end of the level boss is fun. Level 4 (The Bridge) was my fave, because you can put bad things in the holes in the river. You even have the chance to X's right hand man to be at the end of the game (at a price). This leads to the 'bad end' in which you become the syndicate. Exactly how this is possible is a secret because you are heading for the syndicate. X destroys, but never cares. <br /> <br /> Streets of Rage also has really great music. The composer Yuzo Koshiro did absolute miracles with the limited technology of the Sega Genesis. The main theme, level one, level 4 and final boss are stand-out tunes. <br /> <br /> As a Wii owner, I'm proud to have it on my console forever. But with Streets or Rage 2 also available, it gives the first one slightly outdated. <br /> <br /> Front: <br /> <br /> Average graphics, but nice wallpapers presented in a comic book. panel progression that matches the tone of the game. <br /> <br /> Great songs. <br /> <br /> Easy to get in and difficult to put down. Disadvantages: <br /> <br /> Very inferior to the infinitely more complex streets of anger 2. <br /> <br /> Poor enemy AI. Bad things often run away from you instead of fighting. It is especially busy with Level 5 boss. <br /> <br /> Lack of combination moving. <br /> <br /> Lack of decent weapons. <br /> <br /> Bad guy models are repeated too often. <br /> <br /> Graphics B- Sound A- Gameplay B- Retaining Appeal B-
