I watched this movie well over 100-200 times, and I love it every time I watched it. Yes, it can be very thin, but it is also very funny and enjoyable. The camp shown in the movie is a true camp that I actually attended for 7 years and is portrayed as the camp really is a good place to spend the summer. Everyone who has ever visited, wanted to go to camp or send a child to the camp must see this movie because it will bring wonderful memories for you and for your children.
