A young girl who survives as a prostitute. <br /> <br /> A cheap hustler who wants the big score. <br /> <br /> They meet in Thailand. You may think at the opening titles it will be a violent movie, but it is also a story of love with two people in their own struggle to get the money for a better way of life. This movie sometimes feels like an essay because of its changes in images, but still refreshing. This story is also about Eros and Thanatos. "It is not an original joke, but it is well told", says a character and this also applies to this one: We have seen the story, but this way we see it. Thailand appears in warm tones, the picture goes from one color to a multicolored place. And it captures the city as the cage of these imperfect people. There is also a good use of the music to spot the actions.
