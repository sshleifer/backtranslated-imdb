A magical journey by Alexander Korda and Michael Powell. These two TITANS from the British cinema have mixed some fantastic ingredients to produce a movie masterpiece! Some of the most surprising early Technicolor, a sublime and brilliant Miklos Rozsa music count, along with the youthful exuberance of Sabu, the theatrical and malicious villain of Conrad Veidt and the beautiful beauty and voice of June Duprez as the princess, all work wonderfully . Miles Malleson, who plays Duprez's father, the Sultan of Basra, also wrote the perfect script that is quite big. do not miss this one! Since the above comments have been posted, I received the recently released DVD and can honestly say that I have never seen the picture properly until the DVD version has been watched. The brightness and resolution are so accurate and the colors are so bright that I am stunned. wonderful classics can be watched again and never fail to charm and entertain the viewer. Again, one must see!
