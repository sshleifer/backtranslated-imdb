Beautiful movie that shows an unusual genre mix in just eight minutes: mystery, thriller, musical. In short, we can tell the story: a girl comes in a European cafeteria and then ... Soft transport from nonsense mystery to narrative logic. In no time did Vigalondo have a joy in B / W through imagination and despite (thanks to) the strictest budgets. <br /> <br /> Due to the unity of time space, the film reaches the intensity of a short poem (almost a haiku). Spain, country of fast poetry in B / W (¿remember the early Buñuel?). <br /> <br /> One must see to ensure our faith in the young theater outside of the states.
