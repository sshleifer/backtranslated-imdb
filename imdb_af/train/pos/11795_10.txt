I will never forget this movie or the events leading to Jonestown in Guyana. It looks just as tragic, but must be said. Forces Boothe commands the leader Ds. Jim Jones from ambiguity to total madness. It would have easily won him an Academy Award if it was released in the movie theaters. It's the kind of mini-series you won't forget. You will not forget the images of the cult's brutality, control and obsession with his leader. His rise and fall and the threat of the outside world to destroy what he considered paradise. The mass of suicide is terrible, almost unreal for anyone's imagination as to why so many people (900+) were willing or against Jones's orders. They no longer make mini-series like this where we are open-mouthed and hungry to know what happened to the other.
