I've always been eager to watch Hong Kong movies, but everyone hasn't met my expectations ... until now! BURNING PARADISE does not include the flat humor that most HK movies have, nor a second story line dragged into the movie. The story is not complex, but there are never scenes just there to fill an "intelligent" space (the only true intelligent martial arts movie I saw is CROUCHING TIGER, but since Hollywood is involved, it's not a real HK movie for me.). There are some incredible battle scenes in this movie, the first one (one of the coolest I've ever seen, but so short) to the last main screens! But understanding, there is also a lot of blood flowing (people cut in half, decapitated, etc.). The production is pretty good and the special effects show that the writer's imagination can be fulfilled, although some shots must be reasonably technical (notice: the sheet of paper he throws and is pinned in a wall!). Yes, it's not Tsui Hark or John Woo who made my favorite Hong Kong movie, it's Ringo Lam! And I'm sure if hell is going to see more of this director! Ace.
