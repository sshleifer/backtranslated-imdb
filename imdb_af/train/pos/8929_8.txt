First of all, I have a lot of the central idea of ​​finding the '' intruders '' Others in the fragile Self at different levels - mainly subconscious, but sometimes more allegorical. In fact, the invaders are ubiquitous in the film: in the Swiss-French border where the minister leads a secluded life; in his repeated daydream and nightmare; within his ill body after heart transplant .... In the last half of the film he became invaders himself, returning to the old French colony hoping to reconcile for reconciliation. <br /> <br /> The overall tone is bitter rather than pathetic, full of regret and guilt, and the feeling of failure is more or less dominant. It's a pretty grim picture of an age, seemingly self-reliant but hopelessly empty and just inside. The director composes the images more to give sensations of anxiety and desire than any explicit meanings. Some of them are mesmerizing, not without humor, but some absurd play can only visualize somnambulism.
