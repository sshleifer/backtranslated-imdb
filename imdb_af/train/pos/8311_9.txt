I really like this movie, it was good, and the actors were brilliant! Leon Robinson, who played Richard, and many other classical singers, is very good at his job, if you see him in a music movie, you know it's going to be good! I would suggest that people watch this heart warming, sad and special movie if they want to know more about Richard! Outstanding! Fresh!
