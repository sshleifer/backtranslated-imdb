About her dead body was a nice little movie. It was decent and entertaining while it was quite funny. There were some clich√©s, but I found most things fresh. Initially I didn't think it would be good. , when it started. However, if you can pass the first 20 minutes, the movie starts to look more interesting. This movie was not exuberantly laughed at and OH MY GOSH was not wonderful. It was just a movie that you could sit down and enjoy for how enjoyable it was. I don't see how this movie was bad. The rating is just a little too low. I could have dealt with a 5.5 but a 4.8. A 1 is disgraceful. It was pretty good, and there was nothing terrible enough to give it a 1. This is what most people gave it.
