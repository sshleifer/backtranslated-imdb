It was the first movie compiled by Joan Crawford and Clark Gable and they will continue. Crawford stars a young rich girl whose father is wiped out in the stock market crash and there's nothing left for her and her brother. They have never worked, and brother William Bakewell gets a job at Gable, who is a gunman and Bakewell thinks it would be an easy job, but he soon gets over his head. Crawford becomes a newspaper reporter, but wants to work on the big stories, but is giving worthless things to work on. They are a massacre in which several of Gable's men are killed and Crawford was a witness for the whole thing. This is a good movie but not one of their best.
