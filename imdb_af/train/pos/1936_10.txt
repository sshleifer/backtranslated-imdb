This independent film was one of the best films at the long grass movie festival I've ever seen there, I loved it. There are so many things that were good about the movie, above all that the role and crew I had the opportunity to meet was absolutely phenomenal. I thought Avi did a good job in his role. and Ricky Ullman was absolutely loyal to his role as a Disney actor. I was amazed at his talent of going from a cute teenage comedy to such an adult role, without any problems. The talent in the movie was just amazing that cinematography was just fine if you wanted to see an independent movie, which is one you should see. I think Mr. Gruver would be so proud to have such a presentation at his festival and his parents loved the movie so much when it won the audience favorite. and saw it again. It was really a wonderful movie, it was dark and funny and sad and really emotional. It was just fantastic. I'm honestly just as enthusiastic about this movie and I really don't want to spoil it because anyone sees it and gets really surprised. I think these filmmakers really need to go places and I hope to see more work from them in the future.
