I've seen this movie three times now, and each time I see it, it becomes more personal and emotional to watch. <br /> <br /> The acting is great, and it's not hard to believe, because it's Daniel Day Lewis, a great actor. However, Brenda Fricker is the surprise wonder in it. She catches your heart as the mother of a physically disabled boy who can't walk or talk until he's in his late teens. <br /> <br /> I can't say enough good things about the movie, but I'll stop here. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys real-life films or just enjoys good drama in general.
