Eric Clapton, Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker reunite to play all their songs from 35 years ago when they formed a trio called "Cream". These were the psychedelic days of England and America and these guys watched it: all skinny, very long hair, wild clothes and loud music. They played a combination of rock and blues and were mostly good things. <br /> <br /> Well, these guys are now 60 years old and can still sing and play at a high level. as this amazing DVD concert disc shows us. I was always very familiar with Clapton, who had never been out of the spotlight, but I didn't know what to expect from Bruce and Baker, nor from whom I hadn't seen in decades. They surprised me. When he was young, Baker was so busy, he looked like a speed freak near death. Now he looks healthy, in shape and his drum play is solid. Bruce looked a little haggard, but his voice was good, as good as always and a pleasure to hear on these old songs. It's just excellent material and acts by guys who know what they're doing. <br /> <br /> Some people criticized this show for being low key. I do not agree. I have no complaints. The concert sounds very good. The second song, "Spoonful", was excellent, the highlight of the concert for me. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
