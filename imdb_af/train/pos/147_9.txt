The stories in this video are very entertaining and definitely worth it! The first one relates to a young couple who have been plagued in the bush by two rednecks, with a large but unexplained turn at the end. <br /> <br /> The boy is the best of the lot, and it alone makes it worth it. A man is attacked by a dog who fears being rabid. He finds shelter in what appears to be a hospital, but he finds the employees there aren't exactly what they look like. turn to the end, and this episode alone counts 10/10! If the other was aware of this one, it would get 10/10! <br /> <br /> The third is the worst of the bunch. A girl meets with some guys and has wild sex! There is apparently no end to the story, with a good twist, but it is spoiled by the terrible first part! <br /> <br /> Still, it's a good movie that won't do you anyway! Well worth a rent!
