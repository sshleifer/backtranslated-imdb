I remember recently watching the American Gothic when it first broadcast. I recently came to my mind. All I could remember was the same man who appeared in Midnight Caller, what is Gary Cole. I don't watch much TV, but I watched the American Gothic, I bought the full range on DVD, and it's still as good as ever. This is one of the best TV shows ever. The reason I don't watch much TV is because it's just junk, except for Derren Brown. all Reality TV or soap, such as Vet, Big Brother, etc. I'm very fond of having the full range of American Gothic for Â£ 16.97 from the Asda website, it's the cheapest I can get.
