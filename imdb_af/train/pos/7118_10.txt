It's a good movie classic from the 40's and well produced. There are many dramatic scenes in this film featuring John Garfield (Al Schmid), Force of Evil, 48 and Dane Clark (Lee Diamond), Last Rites 88, who defeated the Japs in World War II. and with just one machine gun. When Al Schmid went home after being injured with a terrible injury, his problems just started with his family and fiancee girlfriend. Dane Clark played an excellent supporting role as Lee Diamond, who did everything to help his buddy. Even though she gets back to life. There is never a complete victory for the war and can not forget all the brave wounded military personnel in veterans hospitals of all the wars and our current Iraq Fat!
