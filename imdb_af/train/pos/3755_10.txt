I remember this movie from many years ago. Definitely the best movie on the subject in my experience. The fact that I remember so much of the film so much time testifies to its impact. <br /> <br /> Commenting on language barriers is difficult at the level of performances. But they were still very powerful. <br /> <br /> This subject is still tempting us for years. And this is best treated here, with the right relationship from historical perspective and skepticism. <br /> <br /> I wish it would be shown on TV at least once. Or at least available on tape or DVD. Or is it? Is there a copy of the art movie archive?
