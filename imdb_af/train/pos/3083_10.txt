It earns a 12 out of 10. An absolutely refreshing display with real characters and real stories. This show has to come back, I've seen every episode and it's real quality. <br /> <br /> The show centers around a few New Yorkers, playing around with the concept of six degrees of separation and cleverly interweaving their lives. Bridget Moynahan and Jay Hernandez are beautiful and so is the beautiful Caseman. The scenery is wonderful and the wardrobe is beautiful. <br /> <br /> We need more apps like this that make viewers feel intelligent individuals who are not careless. <br /> <br /> If it never returns, six degrees will be greatly missed.
