In my mind, it remains one of the best portrayals of Superman on TV, as well as one of the most loyal to a particular cartoon period. <br /> <br /> This series pays tribute to both the Superman 70s / 80s movies and the 1986 Superman comics "Reload" ("Man of Steel", "Superman Vol 2", "Action Comics, "Adventures of Superman," etc.). The opening show and titles were at the helm, based on the John Williams score of the movies, updated for a Saturday morning action series. Marv Wolfman, one of the main contributors to the cartoon recharge (author of "Adventures of Superman") was a perfect choice to get involved with this animated series. Overall, the range had a more mature feel while still being very child-friendly. <br /> <br /> Superman is presented as credible, strong and iconic. His recurring nemesis was Lex Luthor in his megalomaniac / CEO incarnation. The Daily Planet characters Lois, Jimmy, and Perry are well portrayed. One of my favorite appearances was by Wonder Woman, and the story turned around her home island of Themyscira ("Paradise Island"). Both her designs and those of her mother Hippolyte were in line with the similar restart Wonder Woman's comic book series of the era, and it seemed as if a well-made animated series could develop for her if it was treated the same. <Br /> <br /> The one thing that is hard to believe is that it is not released on DVD / Blu-ray! It deserves to be.
