A number of posters commented on the unsatisfactory conclusion. It is always a problem with long, complex dramas. Crime is mainly banal, so the installment is always anti-climax, while detailed explanation detracts from the human drama. The author used a number of smart devices to try to convert it, but it wasn't quite successful. Answers to exactly what happened and why may be provided, but if so, they are well buried. The viewer inevitably feels a bit cheated. <br /> <br /> But in a sense it's unimportant. The drama was never about the crime, or even the investigation, about the impact of events on the lives of those involved; the family, the investigators, the witnesses, the press. And as such it was gripping. The writing was a significant cut above the course of the mill for the first time drama, and the performances are uniformly good. In an ensemble piece, it is unattractive to focus on individuals, but Penelope Wilton deserves special mention for an extraordinary tour de force as the mother-in-law daughter, and Janet McTeer was in the form of a tough old cop. <Br /> <br /> One of the most interesting aspects of the drama is the handling of race, such as the elephant in the room nobody is willing to mention. Subtle, powerful things.
