It suits a musical Sunday to make your heart pump, and nobody can do better than Little Richard. The man can describe the drawers of the ladies of the ladies and define rock and roll. <br /> <br /> Look at Leon to give a definite characterization, as he did with David Ruffin in The Temptations and Jackie Wilson in Mr. Rock done. A 'Roll: The Alan Freed Story. <br /> <br /> It was a fascinating movie as our little Richard struggled with his father, with his church and with himself over just who he was. He won the battle and no one else has his voice or style.
