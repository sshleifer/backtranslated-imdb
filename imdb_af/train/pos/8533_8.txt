This movie is more Lupine than most, especially from Funimation. Unlike the bad dub, it's not bad. <br /> <br /> The first hour is much like the Comic (which is all that Lupine is based on third). Lupine is trying to get a big treasure. Fujiko uses Lupine's weakness in women to try to get something out of it. The last bit is not that bad, he is with other women, but of course Fujiko is still the number one. <br /> <br /> Many of the other Lupine movies are more Family with cuss words than Lupine. Any good Lupine fan I think will be pleasantly surprised (I know I've heard so many bad things about this movie). It may be a little better without the small animations rolling over the credits (they make it a little tired), but it's not a bad movie. Good enough to be one of the few I will watch from the Lupine III movies again.
