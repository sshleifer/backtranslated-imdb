The Haunting is a movie that boasts a very creepy house, good effects work and healthy work, a role that believes everything around them is real and that home. There are scenes that let you jump, and I found the sinister aspects of what happened in Hill House. There are really stupid moments in the movie and I like the way the ghosts manifest themselves in sheets, curtains and the house itself. Jerry Goldsmith's score gave it the right atmosphere and the sound design overturned voices around you. What I could have done is a bit more intense. Jan De Bont had a PG-13 rating to compete and I think he has held back a little too much. Poltergeist made me very mad when I saw it many years ago, and it still keeps up. The Haunting could have used a few more screens of pure terror. The end was for me, a little anticlimactic. Overall, I enjoyed it. The acting is good and there are moments that let you jump. I just wish it scared me more.
