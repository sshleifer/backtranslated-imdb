If anyone is interested in obtaining a copy of this movie, PLEASE READ THE BOTTOM OF THIS DESCRIPTION: The first broadcast by CBS on November 30, 2003, the made TV for John Christmas is a successor to last year's A Town Without Christmas, with Peter Falk depicting his role as versatile guardian angel Max. Valerie Bertinelli plays Kathleen McAllister, a divorced nursery nurse whose depression ... about the fact that the hospital is keeping her, can be forced to close because a $ 100,000 debt is briefly lifted when she sees a newspaper photograph by photojournalist Noah was taken. Greeley (David Cubitt). The photo shows an act of bravery performed by Noah's firefighter brother Hank (William Russ). He left the mysterious town 25 years ago and has not been seen since. Hank would like to quietly step back to town without any explanation or fanfare, but it seems impossible when Noah's newspaper paid a $ 50,000 reward to identify Hank, known only to the public as "John Christmas." And there is something, very, very curious about the photo: It also shows a Santa Claus suit that seems to be floating in a midnight without a resident. The elusive "Santa" is, of course, the angelic Max popping up on the story about various objects to solve problems, give advice, fix loose strings - and even share a musical duet with Kathleen's talented daughter.
