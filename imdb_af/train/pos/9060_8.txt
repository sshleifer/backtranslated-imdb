Seen it today with me 8 years old. I thought it was cute. I agree with the other poster that it was nothing like the book I can remember, but we still enjoyed it. All the kids are pretty good and everything is fun. Billy is the new kid who accepts a fool at school to eat 10 worms in a day. If he loses, he should go to school with the worms in his pants in the hall. The start of the movie is set to show that Billy has almost anything a VERY weak stomach. Hilarity follows a variety of ways to cook the worms. Good message about the rise of bulls and of course a juicy happy ending.
