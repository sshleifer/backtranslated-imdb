seriously, I loved this movie. I started reading the book and I loved it ... how everything was set up and everything had a purpose ... I think this movie did so well because Louis Sachar wrote the script. . And of course Andrew Davis did it ... Shia Lebouf gives a good performance for his first movie ... the storyline is very cool and interesting ... there's humor, heart and intensity ... it's very similar to the book .. i find this movie not the least boring ... i absolutely loved it ... and i encourage someone to read the book. Everything in this movie is very well composed and carefully made ... two Thumbs up for me in every way
