He-he-hello !! It's a very nice movie. Basically, in Party Girl, you have your fun-lovin ', independent, early 90's New Yorker chick. Together with her party friends she meets an adult Turkish Vendor. It's an age story for those new adults who are looking for what they want to do. It is encouraging to see that a female slacker develops into an adult woman. Hope is given to all of our slackers who may feel that their only skills will be able to maintain while they are hammering and a neck to throw good parties. <br /> <br /> On a synoot Parker Posey makes this movie good. I've never been a big fan of her, but this movie makes me want to see all her movies. There are subtle maneuvers that have perfected her character. If you have good laugh and a fun time, make sure you watch this movie. Repeated views are a must.
