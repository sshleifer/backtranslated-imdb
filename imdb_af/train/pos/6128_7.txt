Yes, it's a B-grade horror. But at least the producers, directors and role-players don't do it, this movie is manna from heaven. The plot is granular, a psychotic serial killer on the way to execution is splashed with genetic acid that turns him into a snowman. The snowman, Mr. Jack Frost then goes on a murderous edge to find the little village sheriff who eventually arrested him. With a limited budget, the crew had to do with limited special effects, most of the money apparently spent on the snowman's costume. Particularly difficult shots are driven by cartoons or pan-away shots (shots where the camera moves away to disguise the details). <br /> <br /> It's not a kid's movie and shouldn't be confused with the same title Disney movie. If you don't allow your kids to watch only Pg-13 movies as parents, they shouldn't let their kids watch this movie. This movie has two demands for fame. 1. Beautiful Shannon Elizabeth (American Pie) had her first big movie. The scene where Jack Frost Shannon Elizabeth is attacking is worth a look a few times. 2. This movie has the worst snowman joke ever. The joke is so bad that the directors acknowledged the joke in the credit list.
