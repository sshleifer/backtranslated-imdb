In the 1970s, Charlton Heston died in sci-fi flicks of varying quality. "Soylent Green" is one of the better ones. He plays Robert Thorn, a detective in 2022 New York. In this future, most food is so expensive that everyone needs a product called Soylent Green. But when Thorn finds out the careless truth about this product, he finds himself going. <br /> <br /> I think it's just natural that this movie should be dated for us today. But it still brings interesting questions about what will become of our agriculture. Also with Leigh Taylor-Young, Chuck Connors, Brock Peters, Joseph Cotten and Edward G. Robinson (in his final role).
