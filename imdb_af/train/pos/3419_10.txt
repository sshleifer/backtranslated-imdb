I just had a "Welkomed Home", my 23-year-old daughter in Iraq, the Camp Anaconda medical support unit, forced me to get this DVD. I wanted to hear other feelings of returning veterinarians trying to understand her mentality better on arrival and not wait until something bad happened. Regardless of your attack on war and peace, this movie serves as a good start for all Americans to begin the healing of our return vets' emotional void. The main explanation of the whole movie is "Take Action" on the issue. Incredible emotional movie. I would highly recommend this movie to the vet, the veterinarians, the entire adult family, and ask them to come through with a plan to listen to comfort, help the returning Gulf war-controlled freedom veterans. <br /> <br /> Fast forward almost one year later & My daughter saw this DVD. Taking into account her emotions and actually making a commitment to get up again for 6 years. Her time spent in the sand is that she did well. Local Balad children received first medical treatment for a number of common ailments that cannot usually afford an escort and translator for free. Her gaze on her shoulder was during her tour of Iraq. "We have changed some hearts and minds to that." Great DVD, you have to be open-minded and see all sides
