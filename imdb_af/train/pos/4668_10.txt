This movie now appears on digital TV at least once a month, I watched it a dozen or more times, and it never stops me. If it was tomorrow, I'll see it again. Thus, the works of art that Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith, two great acting wizards can create, were by no means helped by the beautiful supporting trio of Karl Malden, Bob Newhart and Robert Morley. <br /> <br /> It's a simple story, simply said, from an ex-con, a lovely eclipse, struggling and succeeding with the then "new age" technology, computers, and finding love in the process. Even if it's a touch (tongue in the cheek) impeccable, even incredible, the characters are not. There is no violence, no sex, no bad language, and best of all is not a terrible method that is so common today. A real lesson for modern filmmakers on how to make a great show, with almost nothing but outstanding talent.
