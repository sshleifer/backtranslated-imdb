Well, the main reason I agreed to watch this movie is because it was announced by Trey Parker and Matt Stone of South Park. But as soon as the movie started, the laugh started to run out of my stomach. From the subtle gestures to a joke, to the blatant toiletry throughout, along with a constant confidence in some very witty innuendo. This movie can ruin the event he faces most, let alone his poker underwear. Some of the funniest clips and you will miss out, ever depicted in Hollywood, along with the constant criticism of themselves being thrown into the bargain. <br /> <br /> I'm just going to show that Trey Parker is not just a writer to write. He is not too mean at the old acting game. I was amazed at the amount I absorbed in this movie. However, I am very concerned that it is not available to buy over the internet, here in the UK. Sort it out of boys! <br /> <br /> I am, and will show it to all my friends, showing the funny bits annoying and sometimes sniffing in my army. All in all, an excellent movie if you are a fan of unnecessary comedy. However, if you have no sense of humor, it is unclear or rude! However, I am sure that the inclusion of Jenny McCarthy and Jasmine Bleeth can take you over the prejudices.
