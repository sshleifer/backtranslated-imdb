I think every time I see one of these old movies from the 80's, it puts me back at a simpler time, no matter how wheat they may look today. This movie is a good one. I remember it as a small child and thought it was the biggest movie ever. It has all the heroic characters a young cowboy wants to be. Now as an adult I can look back and laugh and still feel sad, but this time I actually know what's going on. I found one thing strange. How many people can go to Houston and join Sissy, marry, pull a trailer, fall out, cheat, have an uncle die, then come back together, all in a month? Just in America.
