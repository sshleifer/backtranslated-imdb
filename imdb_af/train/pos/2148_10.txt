I always look forward to this movie when it is on TV. Must get the DVD, I think. The variety of different kinds of people is wonderful. It tells me that someone can be a dancer if they try hard enough. My favorite character must be Mr.Aoki. He is so peculiar, but so full of emotions. It's a perfect movie with great dancing. Unfortunately, we never get the chance to see them at Blackpool. Would make for the perfect successor if they had. But I think this leaves your imagination to what it can do. <br /> <br /> A very simple and innocent story. He remains faithful to his wife and daughter. <br /> <br /> I didn't see the Hollywood remake. Not sure if I want it. I don't really enjoy Jennifer Lopez. I think Richard Gere is more like the original than Lopez. I have a feeling that the remake is not so simple and innocent.
