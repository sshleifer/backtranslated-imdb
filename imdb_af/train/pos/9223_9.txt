Ashanti is a very 70-year-old movie (1979, to be exact). It reminded me in a way of The Wild Saying (Richard Burton, Richard Harris and Roger Moore on a mission in Africa). It's also a great movie, and I really enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> David (Michael Caine) is a physician working in Africa and is married to a beautiful Ashanti woman named Anansa (Beverley Johnson) who has been trained in medicine in America and is also a doctor. While they are a doctor, they are beaten one day by slaves. They work for an Arab slave trader named Suleiman (played perfectly by Peter Ustinov, of all people). The rest of the movie is David trying to get her back. <br /> <br /> Of course, Michael Caine is a brilliant actor and plays a very determined character who is willing to do something to get his wife back, but hopelessly hopeless with a gun and action. He was first assisted by an Englishman who fights the slave trade that no one recognizes (Rex Harrison!), Shortly thereafter by a helicopter pilot (William Holden), and then by an Arab called Malik (Kabir Bedi). Malik has a score to settle with Suleiman (he is very intense, a very engaging character), and so drives with David to get him and get Anansa back. It involves a wonderful scene in which David fails to come on his camel. <br /> <br /> Then there's a lot of adventure. There is also a lot of morality questioning. The progress of the story is a bit predictable from this point, and there are some freedoms taken with the plot to move things faster, but all are pretty forgiving. The question is, will David go to Anansa before Peter Ustinov sells her to Omar Sharif (yes, of course, Omar Sharif is there!)?
