What a beautiful movie. The characters were not only alive but alive, reflecting daily life and strife in a family. Each character has brought a unique personality to the story that the audience can easily associate with someone they know within their own family or circle of good friends. <br /> <br /> The story has a real-to-life flow that the viewer can assimilate into and be part of the drama, laughter and tears as the plot of the movie develops. The script does a good job of capturing the general emotions, actions and reactions of the characters for conflict, opinion and resolution. <br /> <br /> Not an epic, but it's a great movie to watch with loved ones. . Many notable headbands and 'ahhh' moments to share and enjoy.
