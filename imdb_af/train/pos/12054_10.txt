I only saw this movie in the UK in December 1989 when Central TV broadcast it. I still have the videotape, although it has been exhausted (over the years many friends and relatives have borrowed it and also boiled there!). <br /> <br /> Anyway, I remember coming home at night, grabbing a Christmas nipple, turning off the lights and watching what was advertised as a "Christmas Ghost Story." Even now, I remember some scenes that are still pointing the hair on my neck ... <br /> <br /> I saw some comments on the movie that say it's not this and that. .. I think those people are frightened, stalking and slashing on Friday 13th and so on, which is ridiculous. This is a 'traditional' ghost story; there is no big budget action or special effects ... no curse, no blood, no free sex scenes, no chain saws or guns etc. It's atmospheric. If you like the horror of horror, well written, well-acted and with a really scary atmosphere, it's the movie for you. I like the original horrors; Just last night I saw the original Haunting and this is an excellent movie. Very atmospheric weather - and so is the woman in black. The end of the film differs from the book, but still very good. I recommend it. Try it ... you'll love it if you like traditional ghost stories ... SO ... turn off the lights, turn on the fire, open the doors, make a drink ... and enjoy ...: )
