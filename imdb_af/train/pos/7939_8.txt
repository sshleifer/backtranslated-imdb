How nice to watch the whole family watch together. Josie Bissett and Rob Estes (who are married in real life) play a couple marrying in Las Vegas and not only breaking the news to their children, but then trying to report their households (each has two sons and two girls) in a cohesive family unit. What happens when the group, which includes four teenagers, two pretenesses and two younger children, begins to wonder first if Carrie and Jim can ever be true happiness. The battles between the children (and one small love affair between two of them) make one wonder if anyone can ever join. More interesting than the Brady Bunch, which is a very enjoyable way to spend a few hours. Recommended as a good movie for all ages.
