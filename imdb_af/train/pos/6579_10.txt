Find the best screen version of Quo Vadis? ever made. Well, yes, the plot is not as strong and visible as in the book, sometimes winding and losing its tension under aesthetic subtleties. But the film is really and beautifully "strange", has a mystery and style, those other versions - with R. Taylor and the new one from Poland - are definitely a lack. It has the air of Roman decadence, the beauty of falling paganism and infantry. At least I believe it has. Brandauer, Forrest and Syudov did an excellent job of portraying their characters. Forrest's Petronius seems to be the greatest success of the cast (let alone Brandauer, who is one of the greatest actors ever) and the essence of this dying world (IMHO). That's it. This is how it happened, guys ...))) IMHO
