If there is one thing to recommend about this movie, it's interesting. The point of departure is definitely the audience because it is a mystery, and through the film there are tips that there is something dark about. However, there is not much tension, and Williams' soft, manipulated depiction does not do much to connect us to his obsession with the boy. <br /> <br /> Collete is much better than the woman's true nature and intentions are not very clear. The production feels rushed and holes are clear. It definitely feels like a preview for a much more complete and better effort. The book is probably better. <br /> <br /> One thing is for sure: Taupin must have written something really good to inspire at least one laudable effort.
