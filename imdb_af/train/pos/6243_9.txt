a film about the cruelty of this world. I found deliverance, just the truth. It also contains some funny pieces. The acting is extraordinary, for example see Maria Hofstätter. The director tried to portray life as realistically as possible. Composed of the sex scene is explicit and no longer false than that of a hard core movie. Although I hardly understood a sentence, I found the vision of the original language film with subtitles far more satisfying, because with the double half the actors' work is lost. The voice of the character Maria Hofstätter played is particularly difficult to duplicate a duplicate. <br /> <br /> My favorite movie
