I remember it in a Salem theater (where I attended almost every Saturday, "Kiddie Matinee" in Dayton, Ohio, when I was a young boy and never forgotten it. It just surprised me and my friends. I wish there was a way I could see it again, I tried to find a pair of shorts or something, only recently discovered that it was a Cousteau movie and it made me even more pressing. How the gate he has reached is beyond my mind. The fish is virtually in the cat's mouth at one point, if I remember correctly! If anyone can help me find a way to see it again, I will be very grateful!
