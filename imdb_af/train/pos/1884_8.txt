This is one of my favorite comedies ever. Not to condemn the uninspiring lifestyle of his hero, but worth it and not trivializing alcoholism, the movie is just great fun. It tells the unlikely story of an eternal drunk, irresponsible 40 baby, named Arthur, who wants to inherit a great fortune, but only if he marries Susan, because the family thinks she can do something about him. Arthur suggests, but falls incessantly to Linda, a waitress and little thief. <br /> <br /> Dudley Moore is perfect as Arthur, the world's most engaging drunk, whose fiance is a bit lazy. True, Moore IS Arthur and I agree with those who can represent no other actor in the role. The ladies of the piece are also well portrayed. Liza Minnelli burns like Linda, and her on-screen chemistry with Moore is wonderful. Jill Clayburgh plays Susan, the rich and more fit woman chosen for Arthur. <br /> <br /> However, this film is literally made by Sir John Gielgud, depicting Arthur's sarcastic but moral butler, Hobson. Obviously, these two had a great mutual love during Hobson's long-term employment. Hobson is Arthur's best friend and caregiver of unsolicited comments and advice. The most interesting relationship in this movie is not Arthur's romance, but his unusual report with this witty and, of course, persistent disapproving servant. It is the butler that will best remember you long after the closing credit.
