Rated E <br /> <br /> I've never actually owned a Nintendo 64, but I've played many times. In my opinion, along with Conkers Bad Fur Day, Super Mario 64 is one of the best video games for the Nintendo 64 system. . I played this game many times and it is good every time. If you have a N64 and don't have this game, try to find it. The original Super Mario Bros games were additional video games, but Super Mario 64 has a 3D Mario in a nice 3D environment. The game is kind of weird, but there are many things you can do in the game. You play as Super Mario and again you have to save Princess and the Bowzer's 120 power stars. Now, you can do it in a 3D environment. Super Mario 64 is a fun and good N64 game and I recommend it. <br /> <br /> 10/10
