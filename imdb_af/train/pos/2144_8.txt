A lovely and totally beautiful movie, will we dance? made me laugh and cry. With the first appearance, Sugiyama-san wasn't terribly appealing - a sincere payman who was apparently dedicated to his family, but all too easily enchanted by a face in a window. The object of his obsession is far and cold. But by the end of the movie I fell in love with him, her, his wife and daughter, all the dance instructors and dance students. This uncomplicated story of transformation and renewal is a small gem I would love to see again.
