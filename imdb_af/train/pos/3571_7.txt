I saw this movie twice with my teenagers who like it. This one should be a cult fun! The best rule, "Your dress is cool!" says the Prince to Cinderella. Kathleen Turner shines as the stepmother. I also like the 1950s era cars and motorcycles. The melancholic prince is a good deviation from the typical swashbuckler. He tries to stay cool, but fails to hide his love for the fairy-tale princess. Her slipper is not glass (threatening to the original story), but Cinderella is lost, but gets it back from the throne successor. My only complaint is that it is no longer shown and it seems almost impossible to get it. Hopefully, Blockbuster or Amazon will soon turn on this stocking.
