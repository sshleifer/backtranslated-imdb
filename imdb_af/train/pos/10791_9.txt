A true hero of modern times, Chuck Norris left TV "Walker, Rexas Ranger", and watched new steps for his artistic career. The president's husband is the second film of a future TV series, with Norris in the title role, and with young actors such as Jennifer Tung or Judson Mills (one of Walker's young players). The old master teaches young aspirant. This is one of the most powerful themes of the president's husband. At this time, a line in the sand reached world surprise for its proud US terrorism, months before the tragic September 11. Eric Norris, son of Chuck is the director. The movie is amusing, good action work, lots of fighting and heroism. Chuck Norris has many plans for the future. Clocks of innocence, his next photo, will be the next. <br /> <br />
