I watched this movie for a while, after ordering it for my friend, who is a great Dominic Monaghan fan. The movie itself was very interesting, although it had positive points, which gave me the Donnie Darko kind of "wtf?" Wash. factor after the movie ended. <br /> <br /> Of course, positive ones also come down. For me, the young girl in the movie was incredibly good, and Dominic Monaghan also did a good job. Unfortunately, I do not have this opinion about Daniel Burke, who played Lonnie. It can only be me, and I do not claim to be a serious critic, because I do not find myself adept, but he just did not convince as an actor. But maybe it's even more noticeable, because although I'm not a critic, it gets my attention. <br /> <br /> To conclude, I think it's definitely a movie worth watching. It's interesting, confusing, and you just had to see it.
