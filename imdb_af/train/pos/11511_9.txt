Poor scripts at times? Yep! Cheesy special effects at times? Yep! Much guilty pleasure most of the time? Yep! More about Carl Kolchak and Darren McGavin? Yep! I always enjoyed science fiction as a kid, but found so much of the Dracula / Frankenstein / Mummy / horror stuff as much crazy. It took Abbott and Costello to give me a new perspective on the classic Universal samples, and it won Carl Kolchak to transfer me to the "dark side" of entertainment. The Duke had Rooster Cogburn, Eastwood had Dirty Harry, Garner had Maverick and Rockford, Selleck had Magnum, and Darren McGavin had Carl Kolchak. Commune with all the bad scripts, cheesy special effects, those baroque group supporting characters and actors and guest stars, there was Darren McGavin as Carl Kolchak. In spite of the danger, he had a cruel sense of humor, being an idealist in pursuit of the truth and a realist when it comes to accepting the mandatory incompetence and eventual coverage by government officials. In addition, unlike 98% of us, Kolchak was prepared to keep his neck out and do what had to be done, even though it was the end of his journalistic career or jail term. For all his flaws, with no taste in clothes, Carl Kolchak was a man of charm and whiteness who rode a beautiful classic yellow Mustang (then an old used car) to save the day for humanity. As well as any other fictional hero Carl Kolchak was the allman hero brought to life every week for one season, thanks to Darren McGavin. Now that he has succeeded and his performance on DVD, I hope he has so much fun seeing me playing Kolchak The Night Stalker again!
