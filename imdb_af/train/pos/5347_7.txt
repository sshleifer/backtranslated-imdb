Another Spanish film about the civil war in 1936. This time we are told about the story of Carol (lovingly played by Debut Lago), a small girl who goes to a small Spanish village from New York. It is such an initiative journey, and soon they will find the inconsistencies of the human race, their dumb battles and conflicts. <br /> <br /> Imanol Uribe has been making his best film since "Días Contados" (1994) with such a sober pulse, beautiful photography, and beautiful writing. He tries not to take part in the conflict, he just shows us some facts and lets us decide (ok, the facts are clear enough to decide in which band we are) and he takes a big advantage of the presence and the freshness of the young main couple: Clara Lago and Juan José Ballesta. <br /> <br /> A well-groomed production. <br /> <br /> My rate: 7/10
