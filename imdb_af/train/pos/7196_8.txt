As the series "Zorro's Fighting Legion" goes, is one of the best action series of the 1930s. Made in a time when the studios could still play a major role, this one in its 12 chapters has a wall-and-wall action. <br /> <br /> In 1824, the president of the newly formed Republic of Mexico, Benito Juarez (Carleton Young) tried to put his new country on a solid financial footing. For this reason, he arranged to send rich golden shipments to the capital of the local San Mendolita mine. <br /> <br /> Members of the local council plan to steal the shipments on behalf of Don-del-Oro. golden armored god, who, with the help of the local Yaqui tribe, hopes to install himself as the ruler of Mexico. In front of him is Don Francisco (Guy D'Ennery) who forms a legion of locals to help Juarez. When Don Franciso is killed by Don-del-Oro's men, a stranger, brave Don Diego (Reed Hadley), comes to town. Diego aka Zorro takes over the legion with the help of his friends Ramon (William Corson) and Juan (Budd Buster). The token heroine of the piece is Ramon's sister Volita (Sheila D'Arcy). <br /> <br /> Both Diego and Ramon hold seats on the local governing council. It soon becomes clear that some of the other members of the Council are in line with Don-del-Oro. Firstly, there is the President of the Council (Leander de Cordova), the head of the militia Manuel (John Merton), Chief Justice Pablo (C. Montague Shaw) and Gonzolez (Edmund Cobb). Zorro suspects that one of these men is Don-del-Oro, but which one? <br /> <br /> What follows is escaping several hair raising by Zorro and his allies of Don-del-Oro's followers. We have the ever-present collapsing rope bridge, the deep gorge between two cliffs over which only Zorro can safely jump, and the usual variety of explosions, fires and coaches and wagons that fall over the cliff. Hats here to Republic's fine team of stuntmen, led by the legendary Yakima Canutt and the Yrigoyens, Bill and Joe. Canutt performs his signature stunt jump on a team of runaway horses and then falls under the coach he repeated in other films like John Ford's "Stagecoach" the same year. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Zorro eventually ends up with the false god Don-del-Oro and restores peace in the valley before heading to sunset in chapter 12. <br /> <br /> Others in the movie include Jim Pierce, Curley Dresden and Charlie King as Don-del-Oro's men and if you look closely, you can get a little bit of future serial star and Lone Ranger Clayton Moore and stuntman Canutt in pieces. "Big" Jim Pierce by the way, can best be remembered for playing Tarzan in 1927's Tarzan and the Golden Liom (1927) and for his marriage to Joan Burroughs, the daughter of the Tarzan creator Edgar Rice Burroughs. <br /> <br /> Very pleasant.
