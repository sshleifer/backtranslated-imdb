Myself and my groovadelic 20-something pals just can't get enough of this wonderful Parker Posey CLASSIC! I tried to rent it on DVD, but I can't find it - too bad, because I'm sure the features will be "extra special" !! :) We all recommend this uber-cool comedy flickerino for a date, or even just a cozy night house alone! It will also be the purr-fect-type movie to watch with your cat, or even throw a party, such as a Party Party party, just like the one in the movie featuring the lovely, fanciful, printable Parker Posey goes to the end. Oh, and watch out for a gripping and hilarious surprise ending ... move away, The Sixth Sense, you've just been obsolete by a way-rider movie! Sorry, no offense, call it just as it is! Take it from an old flick lover, comedy just doesn't get any better than 'Party Girl' with Parker P! Feel it! Sincerely, Ronald Marie MacDougall (also known as DJ Cyber-Rap)
