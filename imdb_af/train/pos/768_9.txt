Combined, this movie stinks. So many do the acting. But I <br /> <br /> don't care. If there is a strong representation of what the 80s were <br /> <br /> (for many of us in the inner world anyways) and what hip-hop, Zulu <br /> <br /> and break dance was really like.Great music, great <br /> <br /> dancing! It almost looks like a documentary of a time gone by <br /> <br /> when hip-hop was a way of life. It's also interesting to see New. <br /> <br /> York looks like zero from a nuclear attack. Some viewers <br /> <br /> may be too young to remember that during the 70's and 80's it was a poor, run-off city <br /> <br />. This is the best of all the hip-hop / break <br /> <br /> dance movies that came out around that time. Of course, the <br /> <br /> 80s are now seen as a joke with all the bad TV shows and <br /> <br /> movies, but those of us who lived there will always remember <br> /> <It's fine for a time when music, dance and graffiti were fresh, yourself!
