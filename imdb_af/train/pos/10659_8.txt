"I like cheap perfume better, it doesn't take long ..." - Ralph Meeker's conviction (Lawson) tells Barbara Stanwyck's Helen character after he gets a cut of the perfume she's with her man took out. in Tijuana ...! This line cracked me, and also looked like a metaphor for this movie. The cheapest is better than expensive, because a cheap perfume lover who has a 2 x 4 way is a better man to stay around in the long run. ! I agree with some other comments on Helen's appeal to Lawson. Although her narrative says she wants Lawson to be thrown away, she has apparently drawn to his fiery nature, and the passion he has raised in her probably won't wash off with the tide!
