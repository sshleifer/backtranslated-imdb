An American woman, her European husband and children return to her mother's home in Watch on the Rhen, a 1943 movie based on Lillian Hellman's play, and Paul Lukas's lead (which I believe she repeats stage role here), Bette Davis, Lucile Watson, George Coulouris, Geraldine Fitzgerald, and Donald Woods. An anti-Fascis, an underground movement worker who has been injured many times, and wanted by the Nazis, Kurt Muller (Luke) needs a long vacation on the estate of his wealthy mother-in-law. But he finds out that there is really no escape as one of the homeowners (Coulouris) is suspicious of his true identity and more than willing to sell him out. <br /> <br /> Great performances are abundant in this film, written. much to express Lillian Hellman's liberal position. It was definitely a powerful propaganda vehicle at the moment it was released, as the ills of war and what happened to people in other countries came to safe US homes. The film's big controversy today is that Paul Lukas won an Oscar on Humphrey Bogart in Casablanca. Humphrey Bogart was a wonderful screen presence and a fantastic Rick, but Lukas is transcendent like Kurt. The monologue he is about to kill is just a scene. To name but one scene. <br /> <br /> Although not what one sees as a Bette Davis movie, she gives a masterful performance here as Kurt's loyal and loving wife, Sara. Her acting tugs in the heart and the love shows between Kurt and Sara are beautiful and soft. <br /> <br /> The last half hour of the film had me in tears with the honesty of the emotions. Lillian Hellman is not everyone's cup of tea, but unlike "The Little Foxes" she wrote some very sympathetic, wonderful characters and a fine story. A given and production values ​​by Warner Brothers. Highly recommended.
