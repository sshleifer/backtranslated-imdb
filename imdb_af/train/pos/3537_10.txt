This James Bond game is the best band game I played in my life. This is my favorite James Bond game so far because: <br /> <br /> The missions in this game are really fun, it can be very difficult to make it more fun to play the missions, many actions have weapons you use really good. The cars in this game are wonderful. The motor missions have a lot of action and are really fun to play. The voice over actors is really good and it's cool that Sean Connery does the vote for James Bond as well. The way tire work looks is really cool, as it looks like Sean Connery when he played James band in the movies and the other character looks the same as the look in the movie. The graphics are pretty good in this James Bond game. Also, the game follows the picture pretty much, but not all of the time it does is cool. <br /> <br /> Overall score ********** ***** *****
