Titanic is a classic. I was really surprised that this movie didn't have a solid ten, overall in the IMDb user rankings. Maybe it's just cool not to give Titanic credit today, but once it was made, it was really something. When the movie came out, people fled to the theaters. When it came to video, my sister and I would see it twice a day for a month. It was safe to say we were obsessed and for good reason. Some of the ruminants were hard to forget, such as the frozen baby, or the man who commits suicide after killing someone in the unfair crowd. Many people died on that ship and passed it on film with the immediacy and emotion it needed to be a tough challenge James Cameron sustained. And let's not forget the wonderful romance between Jack and Rose. Whether their relationship was a consequence of someone's imagination or not, it was nice. They hardly knew each other, but they would die for each other. They trusted each other. They are probably like hell, give Romeo and Juliet a run for their money. "I'll never let go, Jack." Titanic is a good movie to its core. It's a powerful story told by brilliant acting, excellent cinematography, beautiful music and a crew of hard and dedicated workers. It really touches my mind when someone says they hate this movie.
