I will give away nothing by describing the plot of this movie, except to say that it starts with returning to Israel from a young blind woman whose closest friend and companion committed suicide. It unfolds like a detective story when the blind woman tries to figure out why her friend ended her life. As she pursues her inquiry and accumulates the information, it inexorably leads to a devastating conclusion. The film is proficient and the acting, especially by Talia Sharon as the blind woman, is excellent. Israeli film is definitely old-fashioned and is now fully competitive with other foreign films, although few people in the US have found a large audience.
