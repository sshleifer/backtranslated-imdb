I enjoyed watching Brigham Young and it was a positive and largely true portrayal of the LDS faith. I think a repetition of this epic journey across the plains would be beneficial, as many people today are not familiar with the trials and persecutions facing the early Mormon church. It is an incredible story of a strong and dedicated people. <br /> <br /> As a member of the Church, the most disturbing aspect of the movie (most of the historical inaccuracies did not bother me much) was the portrayal of Brigham Young as "consciously refused" church members had to believe that he was called to be Joseph's successor as a prophet. Although I understand the dramatic reasons for this plot line, it creates the impression that his doubts in this regard are historical fact, when in reality both Brigham and most of the church members understand and believe that he is called to the church. Brigham did not mislead the saints; rather, he led them with inspiration with confidence. The point is important to Mormons because it is an important aspect of our faith: that God is really speaking to prophets today and that Brigham Young, like Joseph Smith, was an inspired prophet of God. <br /> <br /> Whether or not you believe this statement, just know that the movie doesn't accurately reflect what Brigham himself believed.
