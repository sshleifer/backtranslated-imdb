Like Al Gore, with his painstakingly honest and cleverly presented documentary film, we have an uncomfortable truth, "directors Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield remind us that it's time to improve our way of life to save our beautiful planet. "Planet Earth" is also a wake-up call that the global warming of our planet has disastrous consequences for all living creatures around the world. Al Gore showed us the dark future of planet Earth by compiling hard facts, supported by documented examples by long but always interesting monologues. The creators of this documentary choose a different but equally powerful way to achieve it. They do not offer us a future representation of what may occur on our planet if we do not radically change things, but rather show us the true beauty of planet Earth in all its wonderful glory. We see places we knew, but never thought they could be so beautiful. In this movie we see a wide variety of the most extraordinary places such as desert deserts, giant forests full of fauna and flora and icy landscapes as far as the eye can see. And in all the amazingly different environments we see the most beautiful animals trying to survive. <br /> <br /> This is exactly the kind of movie to be made, in combination with the one of Al Gore, in To make us realize that our planet is too precious to mix with. The voice over by Patrick Stewart is always relaxing and therefore very well done, although it initially sounded like I had let down an X-man movie! The cinematography is probably the most remarkable thing about this documentary. Sometimes: what you see is so unreal that you tend to forget that a man with a camera should actually film all those great footage. <br /> <br /> In short: This is definitely a must-see for everyone since it is about every single person on this beautiful planet Earth! The truth is: I never thought our planet was so amazingly beautiful!
