One of the most enjoyable elements of a Gilliam movie is that the benevolent visuals, the disturbing background, and the manically frustrated characters are evidenced by the creator's involvement. Instead of most movies (where the filmmaker is a director-for-hire paid to play a star or two), you can experience Terry Gilliam's presence through the experience. "12 Monkeys" is proof of Gilliam's own vision and style, as opposed to making extravagant films for their own wishes. "12 Monkeys" is a variation on similar themes of Gilliam's repertoire: repressive / recessive societies, the loneliness of the protagonist, the frustration associated with unbelief, and parallel realms. In this film, Gilliam does a fine work of fading lines between the two realms, using ambiguities to force the audience to rather believe than to know. This tendency for Gilliam to fail to fill in some gaps leads to criticism of house advocacy. The difference between Gilliam and artsy posers is that Gilliam's choices clearly have a purpose and all his images have meaning. Cole's two almost identical tracks in the beginning are meant to make comparisons that leave the audience untouched. His bald head is a sign of uniformity in the disease-driven future world, but makes him recognizable in the 1996 world. The title itself is a sign of Gilliam's creativity, as the majority of the story needs to be blown out because its meaning is fully understood. All in all, Gilliam's dedication to making creative films that are interesting to watch also requires the mind and interpretation of the audience. The movie has enormous revaluation value as there are subtle details and tips that can be missed during the first viewing. Definitely one of my favorites.
