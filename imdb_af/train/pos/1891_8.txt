When you see this movie, you begin to realize what a drastically underutilized asset the late Dudley Moore was. There must be a dozen movies like this in our archive. <br /> <br /> He was a leading talent before going to Hollywood, both as a comedian and a musician. But mostly he is remembered for his couple with Peter Cook, on television and in one or two indifferent British movies. Perhaps the best of this was 'Bedazzled'. <br /> <br /> He always tended to darken Cook, whose jealousy and meanness exchanged their partnership and enabled Moore to realize his true potential in America. "Arthur" is the result. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie. Moore's clownish comedy as a drunkard is unmistakable. The writing is perfectly suited to his way with lots of hilarious, almost surreal conversation disorders. There is something so British about him that I actually surprised, he found such appeal to American tastes. Tommy Cooper, an anarchic comedian to the same way, tended to draw an empty sign. It is Moore's almost childlike vulnerability that is so special. <br /> <br /> Liza Minelli and John Guilgud tend to play straight roles against him, but still have some excellent one-liners. In particular, John Guilgud delivers her with a sarcastic and anxious authority that is a treasure to watch. He always steals a scene in which he earns his Oscar properly. Correct me if I'm wrong, but he has never played another comic role. <br /> <br /> There's a sequel movie called 'Arthur 2 - On The Rocks'. It never reaches the same sublime levels of fun this one reaches, but it's still pretty good. Guilgud first gets a como look and ghost. This is darker. And there are some interesting soul-searching. It will disappoint if you first look at 'Arthur'. <br /> <br /> Hollywood looks after those two outings interested in cuddly Dudley. He eventually returned to Britain, killing and apparently dying. <br /> <br /> But "Arthur" is an example of what might have been. We can only imagine the other big movies he made. <br /> <br /> You were sadly missed, Dudley.
