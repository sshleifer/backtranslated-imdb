LOL !!! messy was so funny .. i was in tears. Eddie Murphy's impressions are absolutely spot on. The best impression was of James Brown and Mr T> SO FUNNY !! It's strange how Eddie Murphy was back and how he is now DELIRIOUS is a must see, but if you don't like false language, don't look BUT AMAZING AND SO FUNNY. I saw it 6/7 each time. It's Eddie Murphy at his first and you can see where he has the humor and ideas of movies like nutty professor. He also has impressions of his family, which is really funny. <br /> <br /> If I was just there ...
