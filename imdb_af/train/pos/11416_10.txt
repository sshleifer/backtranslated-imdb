An excellent family movie ... much to think of ... There is absolutely nothing wrong with this movie. Everything is not perfect. The writing is wonderful - it's so ... really ... such things can happen in everyone's life. And don't forget to act - it's just fantastic! Just look at Frankie and you will know what I thought ... This picture is real, can't miss it !!!
