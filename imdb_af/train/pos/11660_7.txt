A beautiful piece of children's theater buried in a world of archaic Celtism. To put the story around the famous book Kels, presumably consisted of monks from the small island of Iona, from the west coast of Scotland. <br /> <br /> The story tells of a young abbots pupil descending into the forest looking for Crom-Cruic, the fierce headless rider of pagan mythology. Hoping to recover a lost artefact. <br /> <br /> The movies 'real beauty lies in his' animation. Shadow shadow in a shining and inspiring style of deep complexity leading to a glimpse of less simplicity. The secret of Kels creates a consistently affective Celtic world that takes place under the shadow of the Viking invasion. <br /> </ span> </ p> <p> <p> <p> History may be very inaccurate and the lifestyles depicted do not have realism, but these facts are completely irrelevant, as the film set in a world of fantasy and Celtic revival style mysticism. The girl from the forest is a wonderful addition and in my opinion the picture is what it is, as she slips from branch to branch. Appear and disappear like a mysterious nymph with features similar to the legendary Alice and Wonderland Cheshire Cat. <br /> <br /> The secret of Kels is an absolute surprise. For all generations, of all ages, it is a beautiful family theater. <br /> <br /> Don't expect to be despised, but rather pleasantly impressed!
