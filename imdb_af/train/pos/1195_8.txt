I saw this movie about the late show about twenty years ago. I still remember the movie, especially the show by Robert Taylor. I always thought Taylor was underestimated as an actor, as most critics saw him as solid, almost dull, front-facing male, and women simply loved watching his movies because of his appearance. However, this film proved what an interesting actor he could be. He didn't have enough roles during his long career. This is his best performance. He is completely credible in a truly ominous role. From what I read, he was a very hard-working and easy-going man in real life and never fought enough for these roles. He would basically just do what MGM gave him. This film proves he could handle more diverse and difficult roles. The other thing I remember about this movie is how annoying Lloyd Nolan's character was. Nolan was a good actor, but this character really made me worse. The last scene of the movie has been stuck with me for all these years. This film is definitely worth a look.
