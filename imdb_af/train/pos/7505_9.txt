If there's one genre that I've never been a fan of, it's the biopsy. Always misleading, filled with fake information, over-dramatic scenes and bars everywhere, biopics are almost never done right. Even in the hands of the truly talented directors like Martin Scorsese (The Aviator) and Ron Howard (A Beautiful Mind), they often do a great disservice to the people trying to capture them on the screen. Skepticism takes the place of hype with the majority of biopics making their way to the big screen and the Notorious Bettie Page was no different. Some critics and filmmakers objected to Gretchen Mol, who gave Bettie Page the role, and said she was no longer a celebrity and did not have the khaki for the part. I never doubted that Mol could handle the part, but I never expected to blow away so far through her performance as I just had to watch the movie. Mol delivers a knock-out Oscar-worthy performance as the iconic 1950's girl who, after an early life of abuse (delinquent and delicately done, something few directors will probably do) accidentally becomes one of the most talked about about all models all the time. The photo covers a lot of land in its 90 minute running time, but despite no less than three subplots, there is another feeling that a small portion of the story might be missing. Director / co-author Marry Harron and Guinevere Turner's amazing screenplay is only surprised by a too abrupt and not so clear violation. Yet, the two ladies should give credit for the creation of an almost flawless cinema that manages to pay tribute to both its subject and the decade it believes masterful. Come Oscar's time, Mol, Turner, and Harron must receive nominations. Doubt it will happen, though certainly no three women are more deserving. 9/10
