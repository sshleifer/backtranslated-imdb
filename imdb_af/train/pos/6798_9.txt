(No spoilers, just plot details) I can't understand this hatred for this episode. You want to watch a bad episode of Smallville? Look underground - now there's a bag of shit. Tom Welling gives a good performance (I don't say much), and Michael Rosenbaum is great, but he is most of the time. The alternative universe scenario looks honestly realistic. The Martian Manhunter, who previously appeared in 'Static', returns and tells Clark that the doctor who heads the insane asylum they are holding is actually a ghost of the phantom zone. And as Clark goes to his universe, he must kill him. An overall great episode, with good acting and a decent fit.
