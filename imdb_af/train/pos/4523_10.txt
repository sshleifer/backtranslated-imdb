When I heard that Adrian Pasdar was in this movie, my expectations were that I would see the whole movie low. The only reasons I gave it were the wonderful Julie Walters and a friend's recommendation. <br /> <br /> What I thought would be a broad "Ms Doubtfire" type of farce, was a soft and informative comedy. Pasdar is completely credible and empathetic as the ambitious businessman who must release the female part of his being through cross-bonding at times. He sends these needs to the audience in a thoroughly credible manner. Julie Walters is wonderful, is like her habit, like the landlady who teaches him unconditional love.
