Nothing (3+ Out of 5 Stars) Another weird representation of the director of the movie "Cube". This time, there are two main characters who find themselves transporting their home to a mysterious white gap. There is literally NOTHING outside their small two-story house. Intriguing to be sure, but I thought the comic play for this movie from the get-go was extremely poor. There must be a bit of humor, definitely ... and I have no problem with the humor that is ultimately derived from the fate of our two heroes (their final "revelation" was definitely a hoot) ... but I really think the movie would have been much better if it remained more rooted in reality at first. After watching the movie, I watched the "Making of" feature on the DVD and a short trailer at the end is almost completely without the "softer" comic aspects. It looks like a completely different (and slightly better) movie. The last half hour of the movie is where things really start coming together ... similar in a way to the recent movie "Primer." The actors are fine when they don't shoot the comedy. They are really credible in their more "normal" moments. I was probably ready to write this movie off as a failed experiment at the center ... but it won me over. (And look at the credits for the final scene ... Just ask me to explain it.)
