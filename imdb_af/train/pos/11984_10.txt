I have never seen a show as good as Full House. Full House puts all the latest shame, great time! Anyone who has never seen it, what I don't see is possible, must see it. It is a good performance for anyone of any age. Full House will make you laugh, it will make you cry, it will surprise you. True, some people feel that there are some "cheesy" aspects at the show, but the positive aspects weigh on all the "cheesy" aspects. Full House ran the first episode on September 22, 1987 titled "Our Very First Show" and this is the last episode on May 23, 1995, titled "Michelle Rides Again Part II". <br /> <br /> The plot of the show is very credible. Danny Tanner (Bob Saget) lost his wife, Pam, in an accident with a drunken driver. Danny has his son-in-law, Jesse Katsopolis (John Stamos), who is Pam's younger brother, and Danny also brings his best friend, Joey Gladstone (Dave Coulier), to help him raise his three daughters. Danny's daughters are known as DJ (Candice Cameron-Bure), Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin) and Michelle (Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen). Joey and Jesse plan to spend a few months with Danny and his three girls just to help and end with them for eight years; what is the number of years that the show went on. <br /> <br /> The following is a brief description of some characters and the actor / actress who played him / her: John Stamos (Jesse): John Stamos is a good actor. He plays Jesse. Jesse is a rock star waiting to get his big break. In the full house, John Stamos does a good job depicting his character. He watched and played music like his idol, Elvis Presley. <br /> <br /> Bob Saget (Danny): Bob Saget is also a good actor. He lost his wife in a car accident with a drunk driver. He must erect three girls without having the girl's girlfriend. Bob Saget does a good job depicting a single parent working full time and still has time to find his three girls. <br /> <br /> Dave Coulier (Joey): One word, Dave Coulier, can be funny to describe. He is wonderful. Playing the character of Joey was perfect for him. He does a good job waiting for the stand-up comedian for his big break. <br /> <br /> Candice Cameron-Bure (DJ): She's a great actress. She plays the oldest sister, DJ, who is short for Donna Jo. She's one of the best actresses I've ever seen. Her acting ability in Full House was very credible. <br /> <br /> Jodie Sweetin (Stephanie): Two simple words can describe Jodie Sweetin, incredibly wonderful! I wish I could say everything I wanted to say about Jodie, but I would only use the maximum of 1000 words on her. She started her in a children's show called Mother Goose Stories and as she came to the full house, she blew the audience and the creator's thoughts. Her great appearance and absolutely wonderful acting ability helped make the show the success it was. According to Dave Coulier, Jodie was supposed to be the star of the show. It was supposed to be where she would get her big break. Jodie, five years old when the show aired for the first time, could beat every line perfectly. She showed great enthusiasm. Most young children can't do that. As you can guess, Jodie Sweetin (Stephanie) is my favorite character in Full House. <br /> <br /> Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen (Michelle): Great actress. Full House is where they started. They received the part of Michelle because they were the only babies not crying in front of a camera. <br /> <br /> There are many more members to be recognized. These are the original characters of when the show only aired in 1987. <br /> <br /> The only negative thing I can say is how Full House ended the Michelle show. I think it was at the end of her focus. Especially when I think Jodie and Candice were much better at acting. <br /> <br /> Full House is a great show for everyone. It can teach you a lot. One of the biggest things you can learn is that everyone can live a good life, even if a tragedy happens, such as losing a family member. Full House continues to adhere to new fans. With all that said, there are only a few things to say; Full House will never die, and thank you, the Cast or Full House, for giving everyone a show they can enjoy.
