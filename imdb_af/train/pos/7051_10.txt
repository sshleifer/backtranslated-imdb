Let me first say that "War, Inc." is not everyone's cup of tea. However, it is very pleasant (and let's think - "O crap"). The movie's comedy is not at all obvious - it's quite subtle (Tamerlane tanks, dry cleaning services, etc.), and it changes with the twist and turn of the plot. <br /> <br /> I'm allowed only one, but I won't compare it to "Grosse Point Blank" because it's different. John Cusack - I don't want to say he was "amazing" or "brilliant" - but he was good. On the other hand, his sister (Joan Cusack) was incredible in her delivery of lines and comedic timing - although she was almost in the movie (I will say the same about Ben Kingsley). <br /> <br /> Marisa Tomei plays a convincing reporter and controls it. Hilary Duff is very grateful for her role as central Asian pop star Yonica Babyyeah. Duff's development as an actress is very noticeable in the film, and she does a very good job (although her accent is a bit unreal). <br /> Overall, the movie is what I would call "entertaining". It doesn't have a specific storyline, and it's sometimes silly, but it does have a subtle message. I want to say it's worth a watch.
