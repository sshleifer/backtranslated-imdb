All Kira Reed fans should see it. The film's prospect has faced romance novelist Kira not finding any new ideas. She also gets divorce. However, she met this man at a restaurant and he helped her out of her shell (and clothes). They go in a corner room and they do it. Fortunately, Kira gets a condom. (Never tell me that these Playboy movies are worthless heaps of fluff. Remember kids, safe sex). Later she wondered to her publisher how big it was, but she didn't get his name. Despite this, the man finds her and they keep their kinky games. But eventually she ties his sneakiness and wants to know more. When she does, hell breaks loose and I'll release it with it. It's easily the best of these soft-core Playboys movies I've seen. Check it out and marvel at Kira's greatness.
