Certainly, Titanic was a good movie, the first time you see it, but you should see it a second time and your opinion of the movie will definitely change. The first time you see the movie, you see the underlying love story and think: ooh, how romantic. The second time (and I'm not the only one to think about it), it's just annoying and you're just sitting there watching the movie thinking. When will it think? And even that is not as impressive if you see it several times. The acting in this movie is not bad, but certainly not good either. Was I staying DiCaprio not winning an Oscar for that movie, I mean who does he think is Anthony Hopkins or Denzel Washington? He does a half-good movie and won't make a movie for less than $ 20 million. And then everyone is surprised that there are virtually no movies with him. But enough, in my eyes, the worst character of the movie. Kate Winslet's performance on the other hand was wonderful. I also think the director is very talented to put together such a film. There is one lesson to learn about this movie: there are too many love stories as it is, filmmakers should not try to add a nice romance to every movie !!! From a possible 100% I give this movie only 71%.
