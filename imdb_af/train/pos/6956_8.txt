I must say that Uma Thurman is the sexiest woman on the planet. this movie was cute and i mean u cute. It has all the "sex" content that most Ivan Reitman comedies have, but with something a little extra, CHEMIE. Uma and Luke both have this unbeatable but credible chemistry that sticks out in every scene. Both seem to create this strange, twisted and interesting relationship with powerful "sexual" tension that you laugh until you can't feel your face anymore. Anna Farris and the rest of the supporting role play look perfect from each other's roles and even Wanda Sykes's rather small role will make you laugh. Although these comedies are not for everyone, but I have to say I went with a person who usually does not enjoy these movies and he laughs like crazy. This movie is definitely not for everyone. especially younger children since some moments are also few. Well, we can say ADULT for younger viewers. All in all, I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. The end I found was a bit poor compared to the rest of the movie. (3 1/2 * of 5 *)
