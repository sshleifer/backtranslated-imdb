Kubrick once again puts his spectacular ability to create a perfect atmosphere for a movie. Mainly through cinematography, but also with ingenious score, he creates a cold and ominous tone that sits across the film and takes care of my spine from the beginning. It's really this flawless atmosphere that makes the Shining the masterpiece it is in my eyes. Of course, it doesn't hurt that Jack Nicholson is one of the biggest shows I've ever seen. A terrifying authentic portrayal of a wicked mind. Duvall and Lloyd are artificial, to be nice, but it's easy to look past the two when the rest of the movie is so brilliant. Plus, it is the actor with the greatest name of all time (Scatman Crothers).
