This Filmfour funded Sci-Fi movie is definitely a must see. While enjoying great influence from the Manchurian Candidate and showing nothing new or original plot; It is handled with the utmost skill that it is down, fresh and inventive, although it is actually a repeat of a previous movie. It's good to know that movies like this are still being made (even if they don't get wide expense), and Cypher is refreshing. The plot turns and turns, giving it an element of paranoia and also serving to keep the audience on the edge of their seat while trying to find the meaning of Cypher's mystery. The plot follows Morgan Sullivan; a bored suburban man who decides to take a job at Digicorp, which means he listens to the speeches of several competing companies and for reasons unknown to him. However, his work is interrupted when he meets a mysterious young lady known as Rita. <br /> <br /> This movie contains a number of strong white backgrounds that give it a very surreal edge and blend well with the apocalyptic imagery of the future. This gives the film a very strange look that distinguishes it from the majority of other films of the same kind. This is the only thing that mimics what Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange is. The plot is also very efficient and concise character development in favor of the more stylish - and more exciting - plot development. You never really know where you are with the plot, which serves to make it more intriguing. The acting is largely good with a largely unknown role supporting the team of stars. Jeremy Northam and Lucy Lui. Northam looks the part of the quiet and discouraged man in the middle of the story, and does well with his role. Lucy Lui is an actress who has a resume that doesn't suit her talent, but she looks at her that fits this movie. <br /> <br /> Cypher is far from perfect as some of the rows are illogical and sometimes it may be inconsistent; but generally, if you want an inventive, recent scientific film; Cypher is the way to go.
