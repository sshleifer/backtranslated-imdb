Actually, the movie could be one of the most stunning titles made by one of the two Scotts (Ridley and Tony). Let's make it straight, the movie deserves its hype as one of the most stylish action / thriller ever made. <br /> <br /> When it comes to unhappy tragic heroes, Denzel Washington and Tony Scotts really make a perfect duo. Both this movie and Deja Vu are better exciters you can expect. Washington has become very comfortable in the shaky cameras and every executive scene in the movie. One would easily be related to his character's emotions and thus enjoy all the murders on the road. It is a success that they have created a super-dark Mexico city with lots of shots. One will easily be convinced by the scale of corruption depicted in Man On Fire. I don't know what the Mexicans would think if they saw it. <br /> <br /> Let's see it again. This is one of the best of the Death Wish genre, but it has also suffered from great violence. It's a little annoying that they justify the actions of a vigilante by making the movie very realistic and playing Denzel Washington, the "missing sheep" type of tragic hero. In the end, they even shot the kidnappers in his own pool like a documentary. I checked on IMDb if the movie was based on actual events. So it is for your consideration if you also find the movie's theme is a bit foolish. <br /> <br /> In the end, I hope one won't really take this movie. <br /> <br /> 8/10 for art management / editing / cinematographic / Denzel Washington.
