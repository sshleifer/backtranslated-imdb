I'm not a very good writer, so I'll keep it short. World at War is the best WWII documentary I've seen. I saw several WWII documentaries (not just English / North American) and this documentary documentation seems to be the most complete WWII documentary I saw. I think it can talk a little more about the Great Depression and why / how Hitler came to power, but it is a very good job to cover the war. It seems to be complete and objective / just for everyone. It does not exaggerate or diminish the roles of different nations. It has many original footage, including color material and many eyewitnesses (made in the 70's when much more lively). It has good music and narrator. All-in-All, I gave this one 10/10 because it's so good. (I didn't see special offers in DVD version, so I can't comment)
