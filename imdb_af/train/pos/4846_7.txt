It is a classic British comedy thriller that I have always wanted to watch, but so far there was no opportunity for it. It is based on a popular play that has been filmed a number of times (especially by the same director in 1931, but unfortunately this version doesn't quite survive!); For the redesign being investigated, the plot was updated to the then war situation. <br /> <br /> In any case, I was especially familiar with early British comedians by Will Hay's films: since this one "after similar plot of legendary ghost, smuggling and enemy agents, it's a lot in the year ( it is actually written by Hay's regular writing team from Marriott Edgar, Val Guest and JOC Orton); the stranded travel part was then an equally tried formula. The star this time is Arthur Askey (who was punished by Richard Murdoch). Not one of whose films I've been watching before - which is as unlikely to be a hero as Hay himself, and whose personality seems to be just as potentially annoying. up to him and Askey certainly come up with quite a few sensible lines and amusing issues to justify the fact that the main character of the plays (and the 1931 movie version) is divided into two here, with Murdoch acting as the Star -right partner. <br /> <br /> The remote single setting (the film's events occur mainly during a stormy night) for a wonderful atmosphere; The last half hour - with the sudden appearance of a mysterious couple (Raymond Huntley and Linden Travers) and ultimately the arrival of the titular vehicle itself - is particularly gripping and well handled. Of the remaining roll list, Kathleen Harrison is also the stereotypical, terrifying spider, with a parrot as her constant companion and driven by all the excitement to take her first drink.
