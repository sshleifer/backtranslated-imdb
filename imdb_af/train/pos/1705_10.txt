"Spaced Invaders" is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I don't understand why this movie got better critics, it's funny, harmless and sweet. I first looked at it when I was 11, and I really fell in love. 2 days later I put it on VHS :-P to this day I showed it to many friends and they loved it all. , but nobody knew the movie before. I think that's the problem, almost no one knows, so almost no one can like it. This movie never had a real chance, it's sad, "SI" really has the potential of a comedy like Monsters Inc. "or" Spaceballs. "Okay, enough dissatisfaction. What I really wanted to say is that, if you ever want to laugh your head, watch it! Even if you don't get angry, it's worth watching! -> Prepare to laugh, Earth down!
