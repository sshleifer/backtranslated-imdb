This movie is an absolute classic for camp. That's why it was an Elvira and MST3000 classic. Everyone knows the story. Scientist keeps his girl's head alive in a lasagna pan in his cellar as he crosses the village and tries to find her a corpse by investigating the local chicks. Ultimately, he finds a real hourglass body with a chat head on the head. The torn head makes friends with the failed experiment in the cupboard and the cone head comes out of the cupboard and rips off the assistant's remaining "good" arm (his other is not right of a scientist's earlier failure) and burns the whole place . <br /> <br /> The film made us so scared that kids couldn't go to my cellar for a year. As children we divided the scariest movies of all time and this one was number four. Just one of those scary movies was really good (the original "The Haunting") <br /> <br /> I had to give this movie a seven rating for the tremendous amount of entertainment value it offers. The ominous effect of the crappy production and the strange sexual angle when the scientist looks at the bodies (complete with porn soundtrack) makes hell out of innocent children, while the ridiculous aspects make it the best material to watch and talk. I can see and enjoy this movie tonight, while looking at the dentist rather than seeing "Chicago" again. <br /> <br /> Seven are the most I can give because its amusement level is merely happiness. The movie, as a cinema, is a disaster.
