"Hate a Minute" is probably one of the better movies to come from Michigan in recent years. Not to say it's a brilliant movie in any way, but it's definitely worth a watch. <br /> <br /> "Hatred" chronicles Eric Seaver's adventurous adventures (played by director Kallio), a former abused child who has now grown up, and begins listening to his evil side. <br /> <br /> "Hate" is very visual. The shots are creative, and the lighting is particularly moody and interesting to look at. This movie actually has an element of production value for it, unlike other recent Michigan issues like "Dark Tomorrow" and "Biker Zombies." Subtle dolly shots and stylized lap composition show good use of the film's $ 350,000 budget. <br /> <br /> But, "Hatred" stumbles at the same places as so many other local movies, and it's in the story and character department. . Essentially, things are just kind of happening. Eric Seaver didn't develop at all. Basically he's always crazy, it's just that people start to notice. The film only dares with very little development in its cheerful way. The end is also very sudden. <br /> <br /> But since it's a horror movie, since when did we give up plot? We just want to see people die, and "hate" definitely delivers. As the body counted, the people in the theater started screaming: "Kill here! Kill em 'all!" When people shout back on the screen, it's always fun. <br /> <br /> This is the place where "Hate" passes. It's fun. And in the end, that's all that really matters.
