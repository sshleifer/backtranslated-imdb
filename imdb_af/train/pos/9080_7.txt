maybe I should investigate my head, but I thought it was a good movie. The CG is not too bad. I saw worse. The appearance of the creatures (and by beings, I mean the good and the bad snake) was pretty cool.the action scenes the snakes were involved in were really good, I thought. There are some times in logic, and the story doesn't always make sense. But for a creature trait there is much worse. Many of the other creatures were raised from other movies, so it's not quite original. I think the essence of the story is original. There is a bit similar to Godzilla (the Great American budget) which looked very much like it. I didn't like this movie so much, but I still say it was pretty good. I also liked the music. All in all, I think Dragon Wars is about a 7/10
