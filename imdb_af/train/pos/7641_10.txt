Everyone plays their part pretty well in this "little nice movie". Belushi gets the chance to live a part of his life differently, but eventually he realizes he is as good or maybe even better. The film shows us that we must take advantage of the opportunities we have, not those we cannot or do not have. If you could get this movie on video for about $ 10, it would be an investment!
