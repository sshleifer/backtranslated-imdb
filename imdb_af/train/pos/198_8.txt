Oh, it's so cool to see a Silent Classic once in! Director Vidor is simply delightful and even comes a long way (at least for 1928) like himself. The story is about success in life and the way it changes you. Marion Davies plays a girl who leaves his friends in a small comedy studio to be part of a larger drama studio. She becomes a big star and its effects are alienated from the real world. For a moment she even denies her (poor) past! The comos are simply hilarious, certainly the scene where the main character (Marion Davies) ... sees Marion Davies in the studios and comes to the conclusion, it doesn't look that special. It has to be one of the first movie-in-movies here and for the right freaks it is great to see the cameras and material again. A must see if you ask me !!
