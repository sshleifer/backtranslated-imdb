Looking for Quo Vadis at my local video store, I found this interesting 1985 version. Wow! It was awesome! Quite a Ken Russell-type movie, fierce, stylized, very artistic, and of course "different." Nero was not presented as much as malicious, but as a miserable, unfinished emperor who had a circus career. He probably wondered why he was in the position to "lead" an empire on earth - it was not much fun, and fun he had longed for. Klause Maria Bandaur had a great time with this role and played it for everything it was worth. Yes, Nero persecutes Christians with revenge; one of many who did this. At one point one of his henchmen murmurs: "No one will ever understand that we are just protecting ourselves." He's right.
