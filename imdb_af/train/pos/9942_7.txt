A good Korean film about not only Taekwondo, but what it needs to be good, like a fighter's way of fighting, can't beat a taekwondo man in his sport, because there are rules just like there is life and school and this film has undertones this. <br /> <br /> The martial arts in the movie is not that good, but it is sensible and pleasant. Friends who continue to achieve something that would once mock them, become stronger through the mind and heart. This movie is not meant to be taken too seriously, as it has a slapstick, but it also has a message. <br /> <br /> A good movie from Korea.
