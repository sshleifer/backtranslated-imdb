Paul Greengrass has definitely saved the best Bourne for the last! I heard many people complain about how they filmed this movie, and some even compared the camera style to the Blair Witch Project. All I have to say about that makes you joke? Come on, it wasn't that bad at all. I think it helps the action scenes to feel more realistic, which I would prefer for highly stylized stunt choreography. As for the rest of the movie, I didn't even see it. <br /> <br /> You can see that Damon really got comfortable with Jason Bourne's role. Sometimes it can be a bad thing, but in this case it is a very good thing. He really gets Jason Bourne in this installment. Damon also has a major supporting role in Joan Allen, Ezra Kramer, and Julia Stiles. David Strathairn was a great addition to the cast as he added more depth to the secret CIA organization. <br /> <br /> Although the movie is filled with huge motor hunters and nonstop action, they managed to keep a fair amount. of character development in them with all that goes on. This film is far above the other two Bourne movies, and is definitely one of the best movies of the 2007 season!
