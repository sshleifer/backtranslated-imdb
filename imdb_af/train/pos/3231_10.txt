Soldier is not a good movie, and everyone who hated it has many good reasons. But I liked Soldier a lot, partly because my expectations were so low that what I saw was a surprise to me. <br /> <br /> First, the artistic direction is stiff and well executed. As far as science fiction backgrounds, Soldier was doing things with more than 90% design genre. The sets, costumes and props were all consistently and skillfully executed. I didn't love all their future military style, but I was impressed with the effort. For me it made the movie worthwhile for the time it took to watch. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I'm a Kurt Russell fan. I grew up watching this guy in some of the most memorable movies of my youth ... The Barefoot Executive and his John Carpenter movies. Soldier is essentially an action movie, and Sergeant Todd's role is an essential action hero. It's not an award-winning role, but Kurt encourages compelling emotions with a very small dialogue. <br /> <br /> Third, battle numbers and battles are well choreographed. It's not an iron rap or even the matrix, but it once again overcomes the average level of quality in the genre. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen it and you like sci-fi action movies, pick it up if you pass your rental post of your choice.
