It is an entertaining look at the Gospel presented by Johnny Cash (decorated in black, of course) that sings and tells a little. If you like Johnny Cash, this movie is very enjoyable. Also note the blonde representation of Jesus in this work ... just to have fun, try to think of five Jewish men who have blonde hair ...? Anyway, this is a fun presentation of the greatest and most important story of all.
