In a poor village in Mexico, Colonel (Fernando Luján) lives with his asthma wife Lola (Marisa Paredes) in an old house. Lola is still struggling with the death of their son Augustin. The colonel has been expecting a war against the Catholic Church for about twenty-seven years for his fighter pension. For political reasons, however, the current government wants to forget this old battle. Without any possession or money, but a valuable game, they struggle to survive with the expectation of the government's letter of acknowledgment, recognition of the law and payment of the delayed pension. This slow and touch film reflects the social and financial situation of most of the older retired people in third world countries. In Brazil, most of the retired people have to survive at around US $ 80.00 a month. The debt of the colonel in the story was made to pay for his son for a cemetery, otherwise he would be buried as a needy. Outstanding show of the cast, in a very sad story that is reality in the poor countries. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): (`Não's Escreve ao Coronel ') (do not write to the colonel) <br /> <br />
