The quiet movie, the Pride of the Clan with Mary Pickford, was supposed to be in a fictional island off the coast of Scotland. In fact, most of Marblehead Massachusett's out-of-shots were filmed at Marblehead Neck near several rocky geographical areas, including the Churn and Castle Rock. My initial interest in the movie was due to two factors: 1) the Marblehead movie spot in my home town and 2) the fact that my grandmother Lizzette M. Woodfin was hired for Mary Pickford while filming various scenes, including the "stone scene". Both women were small (5 ') and both my dad and grandmother had the fact that she was in the Chiefton filming set with her back to the camera for the crown scene. I just wanted to tell this story to future film historians and buffs. The movie itself (my DVD copy is somewhat poor) has been very well done with lots of action and expressive acting, including several scenes where Miss Pickford depicts a strong female characterization. I enjoyed it and would like to get a better copy of it, although I am not sure if one exists as I have seen in various movie websites, that the remaining copies are dark due to deterioration. A very nice movie of the silent genre with lots of action!
