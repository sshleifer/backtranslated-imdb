The Cure uses voice to create an intense mood. Although the VO is responsible for all the film's lines, it does not take away from the visual story. Using multiple film supplies adds a lot of texture to the story. Choosing the combination of b & w and color worked well to improve the jumps over time. The end will let you jump, despite expecting the result. I especially enjoyed the thrill of the movie's excitement. The close-ups for the love scene are also nice and reflect a tasteful eye. The piece is pretty short but reaches a lot. The meticulous editing really helps show what a short movie can do. Possible to watch more than once!
