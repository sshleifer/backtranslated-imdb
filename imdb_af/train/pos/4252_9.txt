this movie takes you into the early minutes and keeps you to the end. It has a very human story and very good selected music. The performance of Moritz Bleibtreu (Giancarlo Amato) and Barnaby Metschurat (Gigi Amato) is satisfactory. Recommended for people who are bored with action movies and want to watch a good movie.
