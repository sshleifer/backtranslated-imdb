After working in the city center and often eating my lunch during the summer in the park near the town hall, I would see the mayor come and go. It was great to go beyond the city hall's doors and see what it looks like in the lobby and throughout the building. Al Pacino (Mayor John Pappas), "Gigli", '03, gave an excellent performance throughout the picture, and especially when he gave a speech to an African American Church for a boy killed. John Cusack, (Deputy Mayor Kevin Calhoun), "Runaway Jury", '03, was a dedicated servant to the mayor and worshiped him in everything he tried to achieve. Bridget Fonda, (Marybeth Cogan), falls in love with Kevin Calhoun and plays a major support role. Last but not least, Danny Aiello (Frank Anselmo), "Off Key", '01, played a mobb boss who had some very difficult choices to make at the end of the photo! Great movie with great acting and fantastic photography in NYC!
