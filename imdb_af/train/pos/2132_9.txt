The movie really helps it a pleasant surprise and a cut above the usual Hollywood screw ball novels / comedy. <br /> <br /> I don't usually go for those types of movies and that tiring storyline, but this one was refreshing, fun to watch, and cute with charm. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullavan play each other well and make a very nice couple. The supporting role is excellent - from the always nice Felix Bressart to the villain Joseph Schildkraut. <br /> <br /> Frank Morgan also plays one of the most interesting characters I've ever seen him in his career. He takes the film and turns it around for a different mood for a while when something dramatic happens to him. That "turn" is another reason why this movie rises above its kind. <br /> <br /> Once again, when a movie has a good mix of categories, it usually succeeds. This is a good example of this. In this movie it is romance, comedy and drama and it is well done. I'll talk about the re-make "You Have Mail," any day. No comparison.
