I'm going to give it straight to you ... this movie is great. foreign gay movies are so quickly outdone American gay movies in production quality acting and story. While so many American Indie gay films are grainy, bad sounds, amateur plays, trite story lines and a surprising lack of nudity or eroticism, the top-quality foreign gay movies are like France's. cinematography is beautiful, thought, meaningful. The story is mature and complex (but not difficult for anyone to follow), the acting is intense and professional. both leads are fantastic as well as the whole role. the boys are more than just beautiful and there is a lot of frontal nudity. You follow these boys all year round, from their encounter to the end. All the small nuances of a relationship, the details of invasion and out of love were beautifully done there. it made me want more. look at it!
