No, it's not an Alice fairy tale my friends! This Wonderland fable is based on the true story of the gruesome bloody Wonderland murders that occurred in California in the 80s. In the middle of this massacre, none other than "Johnny Wad". Yes, John Holmes! Daddy ding-dong uses other shotguns as his infamous 13-inch machine. In addition to a legendary adult movie actor, Holmes was also a hardcore drug addict who befriended several Hollywood junkies. Val Kilmer was sometimes majesty like Holmes, but for once this Holmes character didn't mix it up completely. The film features a 'Who's Who' of supporting players: Josh Lucas & Dylan Mcdermott as Hollywood Reefs, Kate Bosworth & Lisa Kudrow as Women in Holmes Life, and Eric Bogosian as a Threatening Tinsletown Entrepreneur. These characters play directly or indirectly integral parts in the "Wonderland" murders. From this support group it was Josh Lucas who was the strongest and most impressive than the inventive Ron Launius. Lucas is gradually escalating into a big Hollywood player with such charismatic turns in "Beautiful Mind" and "Sweet Home Alabama." Director James Cox has become a bit of a coxsucker by displaying a large number of over-performing scenes, just like Holmes's well-known organ. Holmes was eventually acquitted of the "Wonderland" murders. He died of complications from the Aids virus. "Wonderland" will wonder what really happened that bloody night, and if Holmes really explained his weapon. Oops! Wrong Holmes movie! Ok! That's enough before I get penislized. I mean it. Bye Holmies! *** Average
