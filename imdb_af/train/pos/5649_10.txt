I look at the series again, because it's on DVD (yay!). It strikes me as fresh, as relevant and as intriguing as when it first broadcasted. <br /> <br /> The central performances are alluring, the scripts are layered. <br /> <br /> I'll stick my neck out and set it up with The Prisoner as a show that new fans will win and still watch, come 2035. <br /> <br /> I was asked write a few more lines (it seems like IMDb is as unfriendly and unbeatably coded as ever! Pithy and to the point is clearly not the IMDb way.) <br /> <br /> Well, unlike IMDb's Editorial editors, American Gothic, understand that simplicity is everything. <br /> <br /> In 22 episodes, the show covers more character development than many shows in seven seasons. In addition, it sets personal ethics and character power in a way that challenges the viewer every turn to ask themselves what they would choose and what they would think in a given situation. <br /> <br /> When the show First, I was still sorry for Twin Peaks and thought it would be a cheap knock. Personally, I start to evaluate it much more strongly and suspect it will be better during the year. Think it is no longer controversial!
