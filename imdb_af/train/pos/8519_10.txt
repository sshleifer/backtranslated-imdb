Surprisingly ..... It may have been a bad attempt to regain the already reconstructed Omen Movie, but I really enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> The last commenter is a fool. This movie was one of a good, and the Music Dark, Jerry Goldsmith himself, would have had this movie. <br /> <br /> Great Myself recommendations to watch or buy this movie. <br /> <br /> I am collecting horror Movies and Soundtracks, so listen to what I have to say, not that other idiot. <br /> <br /> There is only one thing that doesn't impress me, the ends. <br /> <br /> According to prophecy, this is all inaccurate, including final conflict and abandoned. <br /> <br /> But my conclusion is .... There are good movies ... and should be seen before the Great Depression falls on us, and before the Democrats also take over the presidency. <br /> <br /> So drawn .... Jacob Eder ... A farmer, with a master brain.
