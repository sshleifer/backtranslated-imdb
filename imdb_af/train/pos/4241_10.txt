I loved this movie !!! The characters were people you could feel. The young man still fell in love with the girl he left behind. Tom Drake is always perfect in the romantic head, as well as Donna Reed as the love of his life. The appearance he gave her as if he was hungry for her and her hesitation and confusion was also played very well. The rest of the quirky characters at the store were perfect because they were trying to bring them along. The most pleasant scene, however, was the young couple at his grandfather's house. I laughed in parts, cried in some, and thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie. In fact, I looked at it five times. A certain must see for total romantics.
