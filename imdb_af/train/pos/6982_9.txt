Good performance. <br /> <br /> The basic background is that humanity is at a crossroads. There is a set of moral dilemmas that are confronted. Man has made a number of technological breakthroughs, but is man mature to handle the new toys? There is a moral decadence in a virtual world. There are religious fanatics who are willing to kill to get attention. I predict (based on the SCR background) that there will be a problem with the Cylons and slavery. In addition, there are all the other problems we bring to ourselves. <br /> <br /> This show is not BSG - at least not as far as humanity is in the midst of a relentless problem that was not ultimately their own. There aren't many shooting-em-or space-based special effects - at least in the first few episodes I've seen so far. <br /> <br /> What it does have is very good stories, characters and themes. It also has good performances from the actors. They can make a culture similar to today's society, but at the same time, aliens are completely credible. Like BSG, this show is about humanity - our strengths, weaknesses, potentials and mistakes. It may seem a bit odd that human beings have necks, worlds, and chicken on another set of worlds. But these things are really more to create a semi-familiar wallpaper than anything else. Anyone who gets jammed really touches the point. Whether you are a mafia-style culture or a rich and high-tech culture, human and human nature, is not as different as 150,000 years ago in a high-tech past that we see in the world today . Wonder if the writers are trying to tell us something.
