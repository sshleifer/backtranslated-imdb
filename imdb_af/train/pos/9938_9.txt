We bought the DVD series "Es war einmal das Leben" (English) / "Once Upon a Time ... Life" (English) for our bilingual children because all of the "Es war einmal der Mensch" (German) Once upon a Time ... Man series (our parents saw it as children) and it even outperformed expectations! The series is very well made, doesn't show its age, and our kids are really different at times At the same time, they learn things our parents didn't know about the road, the series covers everything with the human body of organs, all senses, blood, infection, antibodies and more in animated 20 25 Minutes Episodes Subjects that some people can find "meaningful", such as digestion and reproduction, are tastefully, strategically, and child-friendly, and the reproduction episode begins primarily where the baby begins to grow, while still (as typical) informative is fun. <br /> <br /> Children are usually fascinated with h oh their bodies work and through the episodes understand it in the context of their environment. The format of the episodes varies between the outside world (a family of 2 children) and the inside of the body. For example, in the episode covering infections, the boy accidentally cuts him and the wound is infected and the episode covers how the body responds. Similarly, the episodes on the senses, e.g. hear, see, switch inside the body in the context of the outside world and the episode on respiration and circulation of blood in the blood covers the entire life cycle, including (briefly) where the oxygen comes from (plants). <br /> <br /> This is one of the best ever children's programs - I'll say it's a must for every family with kids!
