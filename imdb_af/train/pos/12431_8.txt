Well, I've seen the previews for this movie and thought to myself, what do the producers think? Hutton, Jolie, and DUCHOVNY? How can the monotone actor compete with Jolie's natural power on the screen? But surprisingly, the two had the kind of chemistry that has intense care without a kiss. Even David's humor adjusted Jolie's spark and fire. As far as Hutton is concerned, he played the game very well, unlike David's calm delivery of life-threatening situations. Overall, I was very impressed with the writing and character development. I gave it 8 stars.
