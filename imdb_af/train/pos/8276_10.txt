Now that's what I'm talking about. Finally, a low-budget horror excursion that uses its limitations to its advantage. WENDIGO, while sometimes deviating, is a triumph of imagination. Granted, it leans heavily on EVIL DEAD style camera moving for its mood, but it's still a damn face better than 99% of live video shooting. <br /> <br /> The story is pretty straightforward: a family takes a vacation at a remote cabin and is threatened by one particular uncivilized hunter. But director Larry Fessenden really knows how to build up tension and add low devastating creepiness using the mythical Wendigo. Is it really? Is this all in the boy's imagination? Is this an externalization of the child's emotional state? <br /> <br /> Some have complained that the movie is unsatisfactory because it's left to you to decide. Don't be abandoned by such a small nonsense. A movie that makes you think is not one to avoid. This is a shame.
