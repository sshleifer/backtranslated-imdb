Anyone who testifies to our legal system - or lack thereof, will find this film truly satisfying. There were not too many shades of gray in terms of characters or plot. Virtually every character in this movie portrayed the best and the worst about our society. The popularity of this movie is probably due to the fact that most of us at one time or another with the namby pamby, lily-learned, melee-mouthed bureaucrats put them in the name of "political correctness". <br /> <br /> The performances across the board were compelling. I sympathize with the rape victim - while it was immediately satisfactory to see that she wiped the dirty, filthy arrogance of the former attackers. In particular, I found the dive one of the ugliest characters in all the movies I saw. It was nice to see her former victim closing her mouth well. The chief rapist and psychopath were equally ugly, so it was only appropriate that Dirty Harry finally gave him a grotesque way. It was the only successor in the dirty Harry saga that ended the first.
