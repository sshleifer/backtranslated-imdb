I didn't expect the powerful movie entertainment from Girlfight. It's an Indie; low-budget, no big-name actors, freshman director. I heard it was good, but not so good. <br /> <br /> In a contemporary ethnic working class Brooklyn, Karyn Kusama has done an extraordinary job of capturing the day-to-day struggle of urban areas. Latinos. Diana, the main character, is busy with anger and eyelashes at her high school counterparts, in trouble with the school and her friends. She is raised by her only father, who looks like her and her brother, but fits his children a strict, gender-based double standard. The father's dual standard is illustrated by the fact that Tiny, the brother, sees boxers at the local gym, but Diana is practiced at the same time. At an honor at the gym to meet Tiny, Diana is enchanted by books. Tiny doesn't like boxing, so he and Diana trade places; he gets Pa's money, then gives it to Diana to take the lessons in his place. <br /> <br /> It's actually a good movie, as Diana grows and learns about herself by boxing, meeting a guy, and addressing some very serious issues. There is no giggly, "everything that can go right, resolves right" to "Bend It Like Beckham". The reality and accompanying personal issues are too big for patent decisions, but in my opinion, "Girlfight" is a better and more satisfying movie for that.
