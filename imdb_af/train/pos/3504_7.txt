This movie feels like a movie project. As if the filmmakers chose a cross-section of society with no experience and came to work. However, characters are kind of uninvolved and naive. Despite this amateur feeling, the movie is effective. It's like a cross-section of life with nearby children trying to realize or cherish their honest sexual feelings. To be resurrected by a grandparent, of course from that generation, there is shame associated with sexuality. It allows for some predictable but well-done conflict. Probably the most pleasant was the way the main character grew a bit in his romantic relationship and gained a greater depth of sexual feelings. A good look but nothing stirs.
