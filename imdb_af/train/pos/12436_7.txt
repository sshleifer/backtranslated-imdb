I've been reading Blaise for a few years, and have collected numbers from the strip. After the fiasco movie was founded many years ago on the first book "Modesty Blaise", I was surprised that the result was so good. <br /> <br /> What I got was a movie not based on action or violence. The director focused on history and psychology. How was Modesty created based on her own story and what parts of her life were influenced by her non-childhood. I think it will give a better understanding of the next (hope) movie. I simply loved the movie's old-fashioned style. <br /> <br /> But everything wasn't that good, the gambling wasn't that good. almost boring and unreal. The acting could also improve. I don't think the bad man in this movie really feels, the only reason he was there was that Modesty could have someone to tell her story. They could also have expanded the movie and told more about building the network, but I would guess it for the next movie. <br /> <br /> Please forgive me for my bad English
