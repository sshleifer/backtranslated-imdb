For some reason this movie seems to get bad criticism. Probably just by mass population. Anyway, this is actually a very interesting movie. The movie is a caption sci-fi movie that actually works because of an interesting story and well-done scenes. <br /> <br /> This movie may not be for everyone. If there are any Sci-Fi fans reading this, I really recommend this movie if you want good scientific fiction. The movie has crazy ideas. The environment includes nations in the war with gigantic machines, with which all the countries invest all their money! The world is divided into areas. Anyone can challenge someone else to a war, or rather a 'robot duel'. The method of warfare is cleaner than nuclear war, as everyone now wears the breath masks. Definitely a movie that reminds you. Intelligent, well written, and good effects for the virgin budget. <br /> <br /> I tend to have movies that have small budgets and really work.
