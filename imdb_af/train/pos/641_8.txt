This show has a few clicks and a few more, Dawson's Creek-like moments (a 16-year-old talks back when life makes sense?), But overall it looks like a decent show. Most characters look very real, and the story seems to be moving in the pilot - which ends with a good lesson. I just hope that every episode doesn't seem to change life like the first, it would be just too much drama for this vehicle. Jeremy Sumpter does a great job as a teenager with a passion for baseball. I believe many of us may be related to his awe and sometimes tunnel vision for the team he always wanted to share.
