Bill and Ted are back, just this time an evil man from the future has returned a bad Bill and Ted to destroy them, destroying 'Wyld Stallions' and the foundation of human society in the future. This time, Bill and Ted have to travel through the 'Totally Bogus' journey and humanity 'Excellent'. <br /> <br /> With much of the same zany humor and some great new characters like the grim reaper, drive and robot Bill and Ted (stations creation) Bogus Journey enjoys again and is worth looking for his soundtrack. <br /> <br /> A most triumphant sequel <br /> <br /> Party on Dudes! hehe
