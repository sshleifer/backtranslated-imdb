I love occult Horror, and the great British Hammer Studios, which delivered one of their best films with The Devil Rides Out (1968), proved more than capable in this area of ​​Horror. This occult tenth episode of Hammer's short-lived TV series "Hammer House of Horror" (1980), "Guard of the Abyss", is indeed a creepy entry to the series. Director Don Sharp, who previously enriched the Hammer oeuvre with "The Kiss of the Vampire" (1963) and "Rasputin: The Mad Monk" (1966) and also two "Fu Machu" movies with Christopher Lee, is undoubtedly one of the best-known names among the HHH directors, and he also delivers here. Antique dealer Michael (Ray Lonnen) stumbles upon a mysterious old glass. The screw glass is the object of the desire of a devil-worshiping cult who wants to use it for their satanic rites. When he hides a beautiful young girl named Allison (Rosalyn Landor), who is sacrificed by the cult, Michael comes into trouble with the cult and their sinister leader (John Carson) ... while not one of my absolute is not. favorite episodes of "Hammer House of Horror" (the best one is clearly the brilliant seventh episode, "The Silent Scream"), it is a very creepy and atmospheric one. The plot has several interesting twists, and remains exciting and rude in the film. Ray Lonnen makes a good lead, young Rosalyin Landor is convincing as the innocent beauty, and John Carson is truly creepy as the leader of the Satanists. Overall, "Guardian of the Abyss" is another interesting and creepy HHH story, and my fellow Hammer fans shouldn't miss it.
