Karloff and Lugosi - Together again! It's one of those movies that accidental fans will pass away and tend not to appreciate much. It's not an all-out horror movie like the duo's previous two hits, The Black Cat and The Raven. But it is very worthy of both talents and is a fun movie when it is visited again. <br /> <br /> The invisible Ray is by Lambert Hillyer, a director who mainly made westerners, but really in these last days of Laemmles's reign at Universal, he has half of this and Laemmles's final horror movie , Dracula's Daughter. Both are sharp, clean-cut fantasies that are very frightened, despite the fantastic elements. <br /> <br /> Just as Lugosi went wild in The Raven, much has to be said of Karloff's hamming in The Invisible Ray. The one aspect of the story that is particularly unsatisfactory is that Karloff's character, Rukh, acts so badly before being poisoned by Radium X, that there is not much of a change when he starts to glow. It's very similar to the charge people have about Jack Nicholson in The Shining. He is basically a loony from the beginning. There is no real transformation. Same here. Halfway through Karloff he has just one extra purpose for revenge in his mind. I still enjoyed his performance just as I did Lugosi's extravagant antics in The Raven. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Lugosi surprises you completely and gives a complicated and thorough turn as Rukh's rival in science. , Dr. Benet. Lugosi also has some of the best lines in the film, including an unforgettable warning to police who are trying to catch Rukh, which I am in line with horror writer John Soister. "And if he (Rukh) touches someone?" inquire the inspector. Lugosi reluctantly answers, in a way that only Lugosi could deliver, "They die". Just as Lugosi can be, he can also be more perfect than any actor. It's one of those moments. <br /> <br /> That's why Karloff and Lugosi's interactions are very good, as we condemn the crazy antiquity of Karloff against the cool logic of Lugosi. Karloff would often play similar mad scientists, but one would have gotten Lugosi to play more straight roles like this one. He just had another chance (Ninotchka). <br /> <br /> The Invisible Ray is a fun movie and a real surprise to the true Karloff and Lugosi fans. It is one of those films that are enhanced on every look, not because it is a masterpiece, but because of the starry charisma and talent and how this story darkens, complements more horrific mating. The special effects, through the always innovative John Fulton, are great and the supporting actors are all adequate. Frances Drake looks as beautiful as she did in Mad Love and plays a strong woman, rarely seen in classic horror movies. The scene in the end when Karloff stumbles and she doesn't scream is one of the most haunting moments of the movie. A great, fun movie!
