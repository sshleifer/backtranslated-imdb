First, no adaptation is ever as good as the book, especially if you're dealing with master writer like Tolkien. This adaptation synthesizes Tolkien's universe wonderfully with the psychedelia, aesthetics and liberal culture of 1970. Yes - the animation and background painting is sometimes a bit "rough" in its technical performance, but it is beautiful and yet very tempting for a unique "feel of place" for each screen to give. Besides the absolute uniqueness of imagery, the absolutely outstanding voice is acting - acting, it's VERY better than the acting in the new live action movies. And while cell animation may not be the most technically savvy animation, it captures the expressive bodily and facial gestures of the play as it is unexpectedly forgotten to be subtle and nuanced. The background paintings range from traditional "fantasy" motives to sincere abstraction, but the transition to abstract settings is always motivated by the narrative and greatly contributes to the themes of the film. If you are a person who needs to have extensive computer version in a movie so that everything is for you, then I can see how you might not like this movie, but if you enjoy superior acting, transcendental imagery and JRR Tolkien , then this movie is a must see.
