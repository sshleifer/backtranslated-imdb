I'm glad someone made a movie about how hard it is to risk your heart for a second time. Or third. This movie is exactly what it promises to be - nice, amusing and it gives you this good feeling around your heart when it ends. The plot can't be very inventive, but there are millions of ways to tell the story and they haven't all been used yet. The cast was chosen perfectly, though Scott Wolf didn't look like an eight-year-old father, even if he wore a suit. So, the sparks are in the right places, supporting role-playing is lovely supportive and although you probably predict the whole movie, you wouldn't want to switch the channel. It's just the right kind of entertainment for a Sunday night.
