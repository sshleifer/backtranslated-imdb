A good movie! Slow: YES. <br /> <br /> ... but original, deeply atmospheric, dark and terrible, perfectly SURREAL (feels like a nightmare). <br /> <br /> I will compare it to David Lynch (Eraserhead, Inland Empire, Blue Velvet) style, perhaps with a little Barton Fink and Naked Lunch (Insect!) municipality. Also a little Jodorowsky (Fando y Lis) .... Add a night on earth, Angel Heart and a little Begotten, Pi, (would it be wrong to call Tetsuo?) Jacob's Ladder, Barker's The Forbidden and Salome - this must at least form the concept of a dark night together ... NEW NOIRE. <br /> <br /> If you're out for avant-garde and / or surrealistic theater (like me) you're going like this one. If you expect something different than a movie full of action with some average plot, try your luck with something else. Final Words: The plot is very, very strange and unusual and this is probably the # 1 reason most people who do not appreciate this movie hate it.
