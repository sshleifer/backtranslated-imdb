It was a highly original decent movie, and a brave move for everyone involved. I don't care if it's not the best movie, the fact that Eddie Murphy doesn't do something, and I don't know what will happen next, makes it a favorite of mine. I wish more movies were as imaginative as this one, rather than the same old formula for entertainment.
