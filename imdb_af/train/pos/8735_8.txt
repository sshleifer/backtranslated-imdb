Such a joyous world was created for us in Pixar's A Bug's Life; We are immersed in a universe that can only be documented on this film, but precisely a universe that can only be documented by the world of animation. For those who have forgotten what an abundant and exuberant world animation offers? when it is in the right hands, is it ?? A Bug's Life is a warm memory. We walk out of the movie with an equally warm feeling, and a sense of satisfaction derived from only high caliber film productions. <br /> <br /> It's just Pixar's second animated feature. Disney's subgroup made their spectacular debut and perhaps completely inconspicuous point on the film world three years ago in 1995, featuring their distinctive movie Toy Story. It was a movie that invented convention, rediscovered and breathed new life into animation and defined a whole new level of excellence. Now they come back with their sophomore effort, which frankly sets a creepy sentence for us all before we see the movie. <br /> <br /> It's a film about ants. Well, all paths of the insect and bug world are covered in A Bug's Life, but this is the ant that is the focal point of this movie, as people are the focal point of drama, romance and so on. How can such an insignificant animal like an ant act as the lead of a movie, let alone the foreground of a feature film? Surely they shoot. However, we forgot that Toy Story could become a lot of toy-box items to become the oldest, most inspiring and lovely bunch of animated heroes and villains. The guys from Pixar manage to pull out the same thing and manage to make a lot of dirt and tiny mistakes in the most engaging and enjoyable gang of pests you will ever experience. <br /> <br /> Not only are they all completely amiable and likable ?? there is no unpleasant character in sight; even the villains are sounding characters ?? but they are colorful, they are eclectic, and they are idiosyncrasies. And the array of characters is also frightening due to a lack of a better term, but only the rich low distinction that has already been put on A Bug's Life from the beginning. We will start with our main character and our hero. His name is Flik (David Foley), and his character is rather generic to say the least. From the thousands of faithful and obedient labor ants living on the lush, beautiful Ant Island, he is the one who considers the "black sheep" of the clan, as seen in the opening hours of the movie when he sows the season. crash with his problem. <br /> <br /> The problem arises because the ant's harvest for a lot of greedy grasshoppers led by Hopper (Kevin Spacey) is eager to continue their anger and autocracy among the naughty ants ; When they arrive at their annual banquet to Ant Island and see that their offer is gone, they go insane because there is no better term. Hopper offers a proposal to save the ants from total extinction in his suit's hands; However, it is a negotiation that is simply impossible to fulfill. The cats and bells in Flik's mind are now full on his steam, despite his guilt and shame. He offers to leave Ant Island in search of a mighty bug warrior who can come to the colony's rescue and Hopper and the locusts can escape. <Br /> <br /> When you think about it, A Bug's Life has a little resemblance to the plot line of Akira Kurosawa's classic Seven Samurai, or the American remake The Magnificent Seven, which threatens a town of careless but kind people. be. by malicious and wicked enemies ?? A lonely village resident is looking for help in the big city, find it and return to the colony to drive out evil. In a Bug's Life, the help comes in the form of an occasional circus group that is mistakenly perceived by Flik as warriors in a bar-box. <br /> <br /> A lot of entertainment comes from these scenes. , and lots of entertainment comes from these circus troops bugs. Among them is an erudite stick insect (David Hyde Pierce), an obese German caterpillar named Heimlich and a quasi-femme fatal ladybug that is actually a handsome and masculine ladybug (Dennis Hopper). It is very enjoyable to watch these bugs on the screen as it looks the bugs and the insects are on display, like the whole movie collectively. <br /> <br /> As I said, a lot of entertainment and joy comes from their characters and joyful interactions with each other, making way for a bunch of hilarious lines, wonderfully exciting and sounding situations and overall a brilliant movie. What makes A Bug's Life even better is that the movie is not limited to children, as many people may think, although children will get more entertainment from this movie? The cut child-friendly situations are a little more than we want. However, it is easy to ignore this error and it is incredibly easy to enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> Although A Bug's Life does not reach the most dearest and most popular standards set by its predecessor, it is still an excellent movie and the beginning of something promising here. Pixar has proven that they are not just a one-time wonder, but rather a talented group of Hollywood movie artists. They make the bar endless and when someone always passes their standards, it is always their own. What's more about A Bug's Life other than saying: see it; It's not quite the best we've seen from Emeryville, California, but it beats the year's fate? and I will be damned if it is not the best animated feature of 1998. <br /> <br /> 8.5 / 10
