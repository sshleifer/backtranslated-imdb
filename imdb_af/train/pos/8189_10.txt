It was an excellent 2-episode, although I have never seen the parent, I never thought the doctor would act against anything paranormal, extra-terrestrial, but not paranormal. <br /> <br /> This episode brings the things we fear the most and how in a futuristic time our people will fight and defeat the real living evil when it is most likely to be impossible. <br /> <br /> Being a family movie, I am surprised that they bring things like fear and faith, especially if they are also entertaining American audiences. But what cares about what Yanks says, we rock! Doctor Who has since shown potential of episode 1 of the new series in 2005, which is only so harmless to scary, from fun to serious, from light to dark. I hope many old fans will one day say, "The old doctor who returned". <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10
