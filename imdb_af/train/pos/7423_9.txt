I recently watched the '54 version of this movie with Judy, and while I appreciated the story and music, I found that the movie couldn't keep my attention. I expected the '76 remake to be the same story, except with a Barbra twist. I was pleasantly surprised - it was a much more realistic and modern look at fame, money, love and its price. This version is so much more real than the '54 one, with probably better music, better acting, a more gripping plot line, and of course a deeper love. I don't understand why the previous movie is on the American Film Institute's top 100 list, while this gripping remake doesn't make a point on any critic's list.
