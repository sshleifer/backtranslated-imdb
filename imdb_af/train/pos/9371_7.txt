One thing I always liked from Robert Ludlum's thrillers is just when you think you've figured it out, it's going in a completely different direction. There are so many twists in this movie that I have a sore neck to watch. <br /> <br /> One thing I also like about director John Dahl (Kill Me Again, Rounders, Unforgettable) is that he was dependent on directing and writing in this case (along with his brother Rick) a good story. <br /> <br /> Now, add Nick Cage, Dennis Hopper, Lara Flynn Boyle and JT Walsh to the cast and you have a story that will interest you even if they play characters that all of them have perfected. Dahl seems to bring out the best of people, and it will interest you in the end, and guess.
