NYC model Alison Parker (Cristina Raines) rents a room in an old brown stone where she meets some bizarre neighbors and experiences annoying hallucinations. Like Adv. Her boyfriend Michael Lerman (Chris Sarandon) inquires on her behalf, she struggles to maintain her common sense (not to mention her will to live), as her experiences take a toll on her physical, mental and emotional health . /> <br /> I don't want to spoil the better moments in this psychological horror movie for those who don't know it. The story is interesting and entertaining, but the film doesn't really offer much in terms of real fear. Or, for that matter, any atmosphere. It's kind of quiet sinisters, but it's not like the traditional horror movie. It's more of a story about a troubled woman's efforts to deal with the growing unreality of her life. At that level, it works, but it's not quite powerful enough. <br /> <br /> What the Sentinel * offers * is a few striking pieces (especially the fascinating, fabulous, spectacular climax and there's a scene with Beverly D'Angelo to be seen to be believed ). There are also some gore to be seen, but not many. An ominous music score by Gil Melle adds to the threat. <br /> <br /> No review of this movie will be complete without an evaluation for the filmmakers to collect such excellent actors for his ensemble cast. Some of them can't do too much, but seeing everyone together is impressive. Eli Wallach and Burgess Meredith make the biggest impressions, respectively, as a stubborn detective and a popular neighbor. Other legendary names include Jose Ferrer, Arthur Kennedy and Ava Gardner. Future stars like D'Angelo, Christopher Walken, Tom Berenger, Jeff Goldblum make short representations, and other well-known faces include Jerry Orbach, Sylvia Miles, William Hickey and Martin Balsam. Anyone who was the deciding director of this movie deserves some prize. <br /> <br /> Written for the screen by director Michael Winner, probably known for the "Death Wish" series he did with Charles Bronson, of the novel by Jeffrey Konvitz. <br /> <br /> I won't consider it a real big horror thriller, but it has its moments and is pretty entertaining. <br /> <br /> 7/10
