I was very excited to see this movie. I thought finally Australia made a good movie. But I went wrong. <br /> <br /> It was the most pathetic attempt to ever have a slasher movie. I feel sorry that Molly Ringwald must already come to Australia to make a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> The play was terrible (especially the Australian man trying to speak in an American accent) and the plot was also very bad. <br /> <br /> When I first heard of this movie that came out, I thought the title was pathetic (because it sounds like the cheese film "Stab" in Scream 2), but I was prepared to do it. slipping when it was a good movie. <br /> <br /> WARNING! HIGHEST SPOILERS !!! <br /> <br /> Probably the worst thing about the movie was the end. I was expecting a great surprise about who the killer was. But the murderer wasn't even a man. This made this realistic slasher movie in a horrible horror movie. <br /> <br /> Don't see this movie. You will probably be disappointed!
