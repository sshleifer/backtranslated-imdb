Full House is a great show. I still grow on it today. I started watching when I was 8 and now I'm 12 and still watching it. I fell in love with all the characters, especially Stephanie. she's my favorite. She had such a sense of humor. If there are people on the eye who are scarcely watching the shows, you have to be dedicated to it. I got hooked on it after the first show I saw in 2002, which just became the first episode. It's really a good show. I really think this show after many generations should go into families. and that's good as it's a suitable show for all ages. And for all parents, it teaches children lessons on how to proceed with their lives. nothing bad happens, like violence or curse. It's just a very good sit-com. I give it 5 out of 5 stars. What do you think? OH and the best time to see it is when you are sick at school or even the old office. This will make you feel much better. Believe me I am almost not sick, but I still know it will make you feel better. And for everyone who thinks the performance is stupid, it's a pity for you, because you won't be so far alive, even if you're happy with your life. You really should see it and you will be dedicated to it. I just tell you what happened to me and everyone who started watching this fantastic show. Well, I have to have lunch. remember you should start watching full house and soon!
