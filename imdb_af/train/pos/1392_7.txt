Bizarre, trippy, forgotten-about-a-story-and-full-steam-ahead-low-budget sci-fi about the Williams family living in the California desert. They witness a series of events escalating in their level of strangeness; apparently they are trapped in a time-space warp, where past, present and future clash. <br /> <br /> This is the excuse for a parade of highly amusing special effects - a constant light and sound program, intimate, dinosaur-like creatures, a friendly and small little ET who admonishes the granddaughter, and so on. This picture shows a little imagination, but nothing else. <br /> <br /> Very nice music by Richard Band, which keeps special effects of David Allen, Randall William Cook and Peter Kuran busy. , a nice family is key assets. It generates a sense of childish surprise; It can be very good that it is more of a skirt for children (or the kids in many of us) that can shine any mistakes in the narration or presentation. <br /> <br /> I found it hard to resist; It's a short and sweet (80 minute) distraction, and a decent credit for director John "Bud" Cardos (of the Kingdom of Spiders) and executive producer Charles Band. <br /> <br /> 7/10
