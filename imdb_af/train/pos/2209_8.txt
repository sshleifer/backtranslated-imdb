In my opinion, this is a pretty good celebrity skit show. I enjoyed it as Greg Kinnear as host. There are many reasons why I said this. Although Hal Sparks was a good host, I sometimes wish Greg Kinnear was not over. If you ask me, it seems that no one is left with a TV show throughout his run. Yet I enjoyed watching the various hosts and other people watching. If you ask me, it was pretty funny. Before I upload it, I have to say I kind of miss this show. Now, finally, I recommend this show to all your dying hard-skating show fans. You will really enjoy it.
