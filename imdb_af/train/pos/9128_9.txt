I must admit that Purple Rain is one of my deepest guilty pleasures. Purple Rain has not just broken boundaries, it has a decade, the costumes, the music, the behavior and the dance! To this day my friends and I still hold onto the Purple Rain soundtrack and pretend they are Prince and the Revolution. <br /> <br /> Now the movie itself I just meant what I said in the title because for the most part, this movie itself was made by the music. The acting? Please do not let me judge as this is one of my favorite guilty pleasures, because I know it is not worthy of Oscar. But I think the duo who took this movie was Morris and Jarome. Their password talk was just outside hilarious. I just want to rate this movie on the concert series because I felt it was what made the movie. Prince is a musical genius and created beautiful music. While the movie and play is pretty bad, this movie is another fun one to watch and even dance at night. This movie defined the 80's, so just enjoy it. Prince will want it, just to party! Oh, son, it sounded. <br /> <br /> 9/10
