I watched this movie with my child's eyes, and I wasn't disappointed. The story is well known, some abandoned orphans must be brought to his parents by an unlikely trio (mamooth - sabertooth tiger and a lazy animal). And I don't want to forget to mention the incredibly small rage. his hair chicken. This one really made me laugh a lot during the whole picture. <br /> <br /> In short: it works, it's funny and it's a "must-see" with your kids (they will love it).
