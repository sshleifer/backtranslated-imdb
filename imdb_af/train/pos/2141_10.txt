Masayuki Suo, who regulates this fine movie, plays a role. After the decent "Fancy Dance" and the classical (in Japan, anyway) college sumo comedy "Shiko Funjatta", Suo followed his own big steps with a successful success. <br /> <br /> The story is tempting. We both laugh often (Naoto Takenaka is hilarious, as he is in Suo's two previous films) and really root for the characters. But for me, the big bonus is the appearance of this movie that gives the viewer in Japanese society - the real life in Japan. Suo has an attempt to show real-life activities with entertaining flair. The result is a movie that will dress you up, make you laugh, make you think and both entertain and give insight into today's Japan. <br /> <br /> See also the main 8 actors of Shiko Funjatta, as they all appear in different roles, from supporting characters (Takenaka) to short cameos (many).
