A very sweet movie that matches the 2001 hit "My Sassy Girl" but can captivate most of the time. The biggest applause must go to the two leaders. Ha-Neul Kim is both sweet and cute, Sang-woo Kwon is attractive and rebellious. The chemistry between the two is very good. <br /> <br /> Director Kyeong Hyeong Kim uses some CG inserts to pepper the visual arts and also offers impressive combat scenes in which Sang woo Kwon can shine. I liked him much better here than in the highly overstated "Volcano High". And that boy has a future - it looks, those fighting techniques, and a romantic lead. Not bad. <br /> <br /> Well, I can make it short: nice movie. My rating: 7/10
