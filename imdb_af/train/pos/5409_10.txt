I love this movie so much! The animation is wonderful (for a pokemon film), the CGI looks so great. I love the music in the movie. So big they kept Japanese music. <br /> <br /> As for the story: it's good. It has a good sense of friendship. Celebi is a very cute and powerful pokemon. Ash is really great in this movie, and I love his friendship with Sam. The only thing I didn't like was Suicune's appearance, he just came up suddenly, Ash & Co helped a bit and left. They could have made his role in the movie a little bigger. <br /> <br /> But overall wonderful movie! Can't wait to own the US version on DVD!
