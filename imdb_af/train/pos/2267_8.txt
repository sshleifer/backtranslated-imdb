I didn't read the novel, or anything else by Kurt Vonnegut, but I plan to start. It handles you from the very first frame and doesn't let go until the end credits start rolling. If you take places you don't expect, the plot is interesting all the time. The pacing is spot-on, nothing expensive for too long, and it's a perfect job to balance between unexpected twists and the viewer to process what we've seen. This is well known and well thought out. I've never watched a movie I feel I can compare it to. It is intense and exciting, as well as funny and sad. The acting is excellent, Nolte absolutely shines, Goodman proves he doesn't have to laugh, and Lee and Arkin are spellbinding. I can go on, really ... no role is dealt with on less than star performance. The editing and cinematography is great, and all the footage is great, with some unforgettable and amazing. I'm going to go to other movies directed by Keith Gordon, as well as the other two apparently related to it, by the author of the books. There is one scene of sexuality, and a very disturbing and disturbing content. I recommend it to anyone who can appreciate it; It's not nice. 8/10
