I thought this movie is beautiful, with overall outstanding performances by Valentina Cervi (Artemisia Gentileschi). <br /> <br /> Cervi depicts Artemisia as beautiful, with preliminary but trusting ways, her hands depicting an idea before moving her models into place. The passion that Artemisia gives her art is just spectacular to look at. <br /> <br /> Although not every character was openly beautiful, it made the movie more realistic as the facial hair and clothes were perfect for that time. <br /> <br /> Overall, I thought this movie was fantastic.
