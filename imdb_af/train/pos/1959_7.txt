Let me be in front, I like pulp. But it's like one of these "easier dives" you see at the Olympics. It has to be a little marked as it is easier to give a cheap excitement than to drag yourself into the world of a late medieval painter. <br /> <br /> It's just a two-hour haunt train ride and while it's often (or more accurate, most of the time!) ridiculous and unlikely, it's always going on and always entertaining. If it's not always the right way. Have a look at the memorable quote section for a visit. <br /> <br /> (But why was it given a "Worst Movie"? Razzie is baffling - I'm sure there were a thousand worse movies made in 2006, but this movie was given the treatment because it as a fashion victim.) Major and popular novelist Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone) has now written a novel in London, but death and destruction follow her like flies Follow a horse during a hot weather. God heaven, she can't even go to the toilet without hitting at least two bodies and I'm sure she opened the closet in her big penthouse apartment. One will climb in great Hollywood style. <br /> <br /> Yes, obviously a very dangerous lady to circle around (if you want your pulse to be above zero), but is she personally responsible? I mean why would someone put two and two together and start thinking she could be a killer? Similarly, her response to such accusations seems very comfortable. But is it just a personality disorder (some form of b / s risk addiction) or further evidence of her debt? <br /> <br /> For reasons I cannot fully understand or explain. Stone was assigned to psychologist Michael Glass (David Morrissey) for evaluation rather than killing the cells after another "lover's death in mysterious circumstances". Fortunately (for Stone), he is more traitor than any of his patients and he has an uncomfortable life. In the eye of the eye, the ratio of doctor to patient changes and then it is difficult to tell, as it is all about a twisting fade. <br /> <br /> In this hot mix comes Roy Washburn (a strange Welsh sounds David Thewlis) who says that love has hit the doctor in his capacity as a policeman of many years - that the lady in question can be dangerous. I mean, keep the cover. However, glass is too glassy to realize or care about. Like a dizzying boxer in front of a former Mike Tyson, he rips for the big decline, but not before he finds that Washburn can have a secret or two. <br /> <br /> Now comes Millena Gardosh (Charlotte Rampling) a fellow psychiatrist and a rare example (in this movie) of someone who doesn't bark, or otherwise murdered. Assuming she actually watched the final movie, she had to look back with nostalgia when her underwear came with Stone's ease - thankful (at least) for those days. Strangely, she doesn't think Stone is as dangerous as everyone else - otherwise she doesn't think the writing is good enough or her check is big enough to do any proper play. <br /> <br /> After several laps of the track described above, a climax that turns provincial rep with a wreath pendant turns, which is becoming increasingly difficult as the rest of the movie has enough elbow for the Basic Institute 3. It is highly unlikely to be at this point. on time.
