Streetfight (aka Coonskin) is a very unique movie directed by the animated pioneer Ralph Bakshi. This is a strange thing about the theater, and is worth seeing. It's animated live action, apparently influenced by Disney's legendary Song of the South, almost as if it were a reaction to that movie. Philip Michael Thomas, later Don Johnson's sidekick at Miami Vice, and Scatman Crothers, best known for his role in Kubrick's The Shining, are prison refugees. Charles Gordone and Barry White (yes, Barry White) are Thomas's friends and plan to help him escape the jail. They stuck to a police roadblock, and Crothers tells Thomas a story about a black rabbit, a bear and a fox that moves from the South to Harlem to find a peaceful existence. The story is animated and offers many wonderful things to see. Like all the movies of Bakshi, most will be irritated and animated. True animation lovers will forgive its clunkiness and fall in love with its ingenuity. The movie is very violent, very sexual, and it is mostly about races between races. For a long time I thought I had looked at something extremely important, but after a while, especially after watching it, it started to look like a landmark flash, like Superfly. It is very sloppy and doesn't really say anything. Besides, isn't Bakshi white? Whatever the answer, Coonskin / Streetfight is still worth watching for animated aficionados as well as cult movie fans. 10/07.
