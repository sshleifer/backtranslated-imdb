From the real life exploitation of Chuck Connors and Steve Brodie in the 1890s New York, "The Bowery" is high energy and good nature. <br /> <br /> But be warned: Casual racial epithets flow out of Wallace Beery's tongue and little Jackie Cooper. The very first shot can be frightening. This applies to the time it was set and the time it was made. And it also addresses the diversity of the population in that neck of the forest. It definitely adds to the eager taste of the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Beating as Connors is the quick thunder in the middle of the action, a loudspeaker with its own fire department. And he has a soft spot for ornery orphan Cooper. Raft as Brodie is Connors' slicker, better relatives in almost every effort. Brodie could never turn a fool off and received attention, which led to a leap from the Brooklyn Bridge (it is still discussed whether he actually jumped or used it). <br /> <br /> Beery is as bombastic as ever with a custom Irish-American accent. He's just the gruff kind of character to draw kids, cats and ladies in need. It may be the most captivating character Raft ever played, and he even gets a bit of dance (as well as a show of the leg). And again he misses the leading lady (lovely Fay Wray) for a prostitute. Cooper is as difficult as any of them, although he gets the chance to turn the tears. <br /> <br /> The highlight is not the jumping of the bridge, but a non-hidden fist battle between Connors and Brodie in the close-up looks like a real noise between the principals. It is certain that someone has been bruised more than an ego.
