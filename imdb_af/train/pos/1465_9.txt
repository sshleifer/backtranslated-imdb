His choice of films, the basic "conception" of the production (which puts him or the simulacra of the films he comments on) and his delivery is brilliant! But if you want Freud, be aware that you get Zizek's version of Lacan, which should not be confused with Lacan. As usual, Zizek offers complex ideas with pride and conviction. The rub is he is also very mercurial and therefore there can be more in his gusto than in the real content. Kinaties is a jewel. Psychologically, it will have people of all beliefs (Freudians, Lacanians and Jungians) to scratch their heads, but to reach the same popcorn. Zizek is a phenomenon and pop icon for himself.
