Home room really surprised me. Compared to other movies written about Columbine High School, this one is the best. Living room does not show the school shooting, but rather the aftermath and the consequences of the community and the village. The film focuses on two opposite characters, Alecia (Besig Phillips) and Deanna (Erika Christensen). Alecia is an outcast who has seen the whole shoot. She looks like there's no emotion about it. Deanna is a popular girl and the only surviving victim. Alecia is obliged to visit Deanna at the hospital to graduate. Meanwhile, police are investigating Alecia because she may have known the shooting is going to happen. Alecia and Deanna are very different and don't even get together. Eventually, they develop mutual understanding and become friends. (much in the style of the breakfast club). Home Room Beautifully shows the power of closeness and unrest to a school shoot. I would recommend this movie to everyone and everyone.
