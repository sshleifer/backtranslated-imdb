It is a very moving picture of about forty-three best friends in a small England town. One finds passionate love and a new beginning with a younger piano instructor. When tragedy ceases and hearts change forever. Definitely a movie to have a box of tissue! A powerful piece of work. It's definitely one of my favorite movies of all time. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER !!! WASTE WARNING !! SPOILER !! * <br /> <br /> The main character is taken by her young, beautiful piano instructor and a passionate romance blossom. Her two jealous "friends" play an immature prank that quickly leads to a tragedy. She lost her love and swam her friends in one dirt. In the end, an unexpected surprise draws them back together. (In my opinion, her forgiveness is not justified)
