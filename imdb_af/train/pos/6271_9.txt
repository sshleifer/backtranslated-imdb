I like this movie. It was pretty cool. It has everything: cars, gun shooting, fighting, and even a drawing girl. It cannot excel in any of these things, except the cars. A little shooting, a bit of fighting, a bit of chase, and a few cars, with a good chase near the end. The jump may be impractical, but according to our good friends here at IMDB, it is possible, so the movie is not as bad as people paint it. It has some quality and I wanted to see it. In fact, I loved the movie. And I didn't need my brain to see it. I didn't always think "Is it possible?" or stamp it. 9 in 10.
