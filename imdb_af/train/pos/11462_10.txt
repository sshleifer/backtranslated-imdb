WASTE WARNING! This film, Zero Day, gives a bit to the lives of two students, Andr√© and Calvin. Who feels resentment and hatred for anyone and anything involved. <br /> <br /> They go on a series of self-thoughts "Missions" that all lead to the Great Mission, which is Zero Day. Zero days content is not specified until the middle to the end of the movie. The viewer knows it is serious and filled with hatred, but is never quite sure until the end. Now we all know, if the film is based on the Columbine massacre, the ending is exactly clear. And the end is no different from any other film about the attack, they will kill many of their fellow students in the end. <br /> <br /> I saw a lot of movies on this attack, and this movie by Verre is my favorite, and most respected. It gives the viewer and look at the lives of these two teens who hate life and honestly give it the viewer some of an understanding and a close on the horrible event. Only 7 when The events that were played I never knew the seriousness of the shooting, until my English class was assigned an essay or story at a particular moment in our generation. Well, I knew everyone would fetch the twin towers, but I wanted to be different. Because of the twins, the twin towers were tragic and very defined, but I didn't think it was the right choice for me because there really was no way. had no idea what this all means. But the shooting had leave and followed. I remember the interviews, the air's views of the school and the hurt and evil in the eyes of thousands of people. <br /> <br /> This movie is compelling, down to earth and a terrible masterpiece, and I would reaffirm it to anyone.
