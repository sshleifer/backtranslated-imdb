Personally, I really enjoyed it. It was the first time I saw an Australian slasher movie. A genre normally limited to mainstream Hollywood movies. <br /> <br /> With all the usual cookie comedies and plays coming from Australia, I loved watching a homemade horror movie that was not a ripe of anything. I didn't even think it was really a spoof of other movies. It was a supernatural theme horror like Nightmare on Elm Street, not shouting if I know what you did last Saturday and therefore there was more of a suspension of unbelief. I think it's time that Australian movies try to get more into mainstream genres. <br /> <br /> Cutting was original, scary enough and finally just a little fun. I'll give it seven out of ten and won't treat it as something serious. It did what I expected to do, entertain me and scare it to be satisfactory. I enjoyed it.
