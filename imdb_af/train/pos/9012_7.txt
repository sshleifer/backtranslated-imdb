Imagine the fate of Richard, a painter, whose true passion is flying. Once we meet him, he is seen on a London building carrying his home-made wings. He tore his canvases and other works, up to his despair, and fashions a flying device for his leap. When he falls into the protective police's presence, he does not suffer a scramble, but he lands him in front of a judge who orders him to do community service. Richard, whose relationship with Anne apparently ended badly, decides to move to a rural area where he finds a place in the country with a large barn he plans to use to build his own aircraft. <br /> <br /> Richard ends up trying to help Jane Harchard unwillingly. She is a young woman suffering from A.L.S. or Lou Gehrig's disease and is limited to a motorized wheelchair. Jane is extremely intelligent, but has a dark side and a salt vocabulary. She uses a handset to talk sometimes, as her speech is not clear. What Jane likes to do is to lose her virginity at any cost. Jane and Richard clash as they meet each other, but a mutual tolerance quickly makes them comfortable. <br /> <br /> Jane, who watches porn on her computer, has an idea to find someone like Richard Gere in "American Gigolo", who will have a sex fee with her. If they do not have any money, Richard decides to rob a big bank, but things are not going according to plan if Jane realizes she is not. Can go on with what she wanted, in the end, Richard takes Jane a ride in his rugged built plane for the excitement of her life, something that brings them closer, as they find an affinity with each other. > <br /> Peter Greengrass has this peculiar movie that presents an unusual situation, Jane is clearly not the romantic heroine of mainstream movies, and yet she has such a sweet aura about her that is hard to feel for her and what she is trying to achieve, Greengrass shows an affinity Richar Hawkins's material he wrote for the film has. The movie doesn't look cute or gives a rosy picture of a young woman suffering from an incurable disease. <br /> <br /> Helena Bonham Carter is the main reason for the movie. She makes a wonderful Jane. On the other hand, Kenneth Branagh doesn't look too good for this kind of comedy. Somehow he has problems with his own in the way he interprets Richard. Gemma Jones has a few good moments as Anne, Richard's former love. <br /> <br /> "The Theory of Flight" shows a good director. No doubt Peter Greengrass will go to bigger and better things.
