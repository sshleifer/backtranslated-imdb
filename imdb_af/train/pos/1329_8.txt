I grew up in Brazil and I was visiting and marveling at the beautiful coast where the film was filmed. The area is called "Parati" and is part of the "Groenkus" of Rio de Janeiro State. It is about 150 miles from the city of Rio de Janeiro. <br /> <br /> This movie brings back the world of 16th-century Brazil, where Europeans began to explore the coastline, which was still in pristine condition and sparsely populated by various indigenous tribes. French and Portuguese fought each other for territory and for the upper part of the Brazil wood trade. They have already negotiated with the Natives, who also fought for some reason. <br /> <br /> One French misfit ("a mercenary") is left to die by his own compatriots but manages to escape and is imprisoned by a naked nation tribe. Being a "slave" of the tribe, he is allowed to live in relative comfort for months until the time is right for him to be killed and eaten in a ritual of revenge. <Br /> <br /> What I love about this movie is that it recreates the villages and lifestyles of the residents in the loving details (they ran naked and cannibals) and asked us to acknowledge life in those times and to accept. It was: in a beautiful garden of life, life was messy, violent, full of pathetic superstitions and bizarre practices. The Europeans come and bring their own problems, including more violence with better weapons and greed. There are no romantic "noble wilderness" or "heroic explorers" here; they are just people who are trying to survive in a difficult world. <br /> <br /> The movie is not unnecessarily sympathetic or dismissal of the natives. From what I know about the subject, the depiction is pretty accurate, adding a unique air to the project: how many movies have you seen regarding the lives of Brazilian residents and their early affairs with Europeans?
