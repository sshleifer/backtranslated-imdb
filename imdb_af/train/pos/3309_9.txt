It's a good movie. If it is any indication, Hong Sang-Soo is really "Asian cinema's best kept secret". It is very similar in style to Tsai Ming-Liang and Hou Hsiao-hsien, and covers much the same ground as their thematic, but I think I enjoy it more than any of their movies. The open-minded minimalism is slightly less pronounced here than in their work, although it still perfectly fits the style (the camera never moves once) and somehow I found the movie less self-consciously "slow" than Tsai Ming- Liang or Hou Hsiao -hsien, what I think is part of the reason I enjoyed it more. Plus, it doesn't keep its subjects as loose as it does. I felt that the movie was somehow more "complete" and less open (just scarce) than some of their work, although it wouldn't say it was much like something like a prosperous plot. I will find it hard to believe that Sophia Coppola was not directly influenced by this "Lost Translation" film (scenes from a young woman wandering around herself and in her hotel room wearing punk underpants can't help ).
