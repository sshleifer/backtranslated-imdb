I realize this review will leave me alone by the expert film critics who patrol this site, but I will defend this film. <br /> <br /> The Dentist is actually a very good movie. The acting is not always top, but the excitement is good and the story is good. Plus you see Linda Hoffman's boobies. Not that I'm an expert in this field, but the direction looks good and the plot makes sense. Corbin makes a wonderful dentist. It does to dentists doing Jaws to sharks ... ish. This apparently had a fairly limited budget, but it did well with what they could and the characters developed well (those who counted it). <br /> <br /> The end.
