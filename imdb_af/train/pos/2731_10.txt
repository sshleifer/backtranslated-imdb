Sorry, I don't have much time to write. I'm not a psychologist, but knew one for 25 years. She said Scott Wilson portrayed a sociopath (no conscience) extremely well. I agree! She also said that Robert Blake expressed a person with anger and impulse control who had a conscience but couldn't control himself perfectly. I agree! What a cold and awesome movie. I watched over 2000 movies and will rank it in the top 100. My lifelong friend deals with clients like this regularly. My only criticism was the prehistoric narrative at the end of the film. Many people grow in less than ideal circumstances, but only one in a million will act as these 2 losers did.
