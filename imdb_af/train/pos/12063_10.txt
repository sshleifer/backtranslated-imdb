The woman in black (1989) is a TV adaptation of Susan Hill's modern classic ghost story, published just a few years earlier than the movie was made. Unfortunately, this movie is not released on DVD, and as far as I know it is deleted on VHS. The availability is in direct contrast to the popularity of those who know about horror movies. The story revolves around events in a marine community in the early 20th century where a young lawyer was sent by his firm to close the affairs of a newly-died widow who died on her isolated marshland. What he thought would be a routine and probably boring task would be in a nightmare as he discovered that the old woman had been pursued after her death and that the spirits of her past were not resting. The story is told in a subtle but concise way, never self-sufficient, flashy or over-exponential. The obviously tight budget can have contributed to the no-nonsense approach, but that's just what the story needs, and why it works so well. That's what you don't see that scares. In addition, there is a particularly frightening scene that relies on the visuals and it works perfectly. I watched the movie during the day, and it gave me nightmares about a week later. If you like to be scared, do what you need to get a copy of The Woman In Black.
