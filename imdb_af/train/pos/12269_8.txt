Four macho indifferent guys and three sexy gals venture into a remote forest to hunt for a bear. The motley coed group walks off the crazy Vietnam veteran Jesse (an effective creepy depiction by Alberto Mejia Baron), who does not surprisingly take any kind of strangers to his terrain. Director / co-author Pedro Galindo III adapts the gripping story to a steady pace, creates a whole lot of exciting tensions and delivers a fair amount of graphic gore with the brutal murders (a nasty throat cut and a hand blown with a shotgun pace as the definite gruesome explosion highlights). The award-winning film gives solid performances, with especially laudable works by Pedro Fernandez as the beautiful human Nacho, Edith Gonzalez as the festive Alejandra, Charly Valentino as the friendly Charly, and Tono Mauri as antagonistic joke Mauricio. Better yet, both lovely blonde Marisol Santacruz and beautiful brunette Adriana Vega provide a nice eyecatcher by wearing sleek bathing suits. Antonio de Anda's sleek, cold cinematography, breathtaking silk scenery, Pedro Plascencia's robust, moving, agile score, the well-developed characters, and the pleasantly sleek 76 minute walk increase the overall sound quality of this bang-up horror / action hybrid winner.
