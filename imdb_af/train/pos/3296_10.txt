Mina Kumari displays more style and grace that only moves from standing to sitting on the floor than you can in most other movies. The director made more memorable scenes of beauty than it might seem. The music and dance are of the highest quality possible. You may see in the first scene that the director has all sorts of things in the background: other girl dancing, a drunken fall down, lots of activity, but he knew we'd watch Mina dance and I'll bet if you didn't see Many times, you didn't notice. All in all, perfection.JQ
