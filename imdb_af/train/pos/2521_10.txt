I have to admit - the only reason I bought this movie was because I am a big fan of Gackt and a * big * fan of Hyde. I expected a good movie with lots of shots that we would say, enjoyable for the female eye, but a slightly cheesy story. I mean, the synopsis sounds really out there. And now that I've just finished it, I feel the need to tell the world of its glory! Hyde and Gackt both have heartbreaking appearances, and my eyes are still hot from the crying last half of the movie. You get sucked into the story, and you really feel the characters at the end. The element of vampirism - which I love very much, but it is very easy to overdo or destroy a movie - is subtly mixed in the storyline to make it just exotic, normal for this setting, rather than a random unnecessary addition to the story. . I first ranked it at a 9 out of 10 ... and then I went back and tried to think why I didn't give it the last point. Come on with nothing. That's ten out of ten. After all - I'm not much of a critic - the fact that I find it difficult to write a review also means that I really hate the movie or really love it. You can see which side I am with Moon Child.
