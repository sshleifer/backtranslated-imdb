The movie was very moving. It was soft and funny at the same time. The scenery was absolutely beautiful! Peter Faulk and Paul Reiser delivered award-winning performances. Olympia Dukakis was wonderful. I understand because of the story line, her part had to be short, but I wanted me to have seen more of her. She is a real pro. You will be able to recall experiences of your own life, hopefully in a positive way to see this movie. We were lucky to see Paul Reiser following a Q and A after the show. He is a wonderful man, smart, eloquent and a "real person". It was a really nice edition. This is a movie to watch. You will be so grateful that you went.
