Ching Siu Tung and Tsui Hark is a Chinese Spirit Story, apart from one of the greatest wuxia piano films ever made. It is a beautiful and romantic love story, as well as an impressive choreographed martial arts movie that belongs to every collection of movie lovers. The amazing Hong Kong superstar Leslie Cheung plays a travel tax collector who spends the night in a haunted house. Staying at the temple, he meets a colorful character who plays the swordman Yin (Wu Ma) and Hsiao Hou, the Tree Devil, and the beautiful Ghost Lit Sin Seen, played by the lovely Joey Wong. <br /> <To free her from the clutches of the evil devil, he must reincarnate her body and travel to the underworld to defeat an even stronger devil. <br /> <br /> Enough good things can't be said about this movie. The pacing is perfect, with a great combination of romance, action, fantasy and humor, and the feverish final should give you little chance to breathe. The chemistry between the wonderfully tragic Joey Wong and Leslie Cheung (whose legendary career ended early) allows the viewer to feel for both. Indeed, the play as a whole is so lively and full of life, I would say it is one of the most fun viewing experiences I have ever had. Much of the credit goes to Wu Ma in his portrayal of the mysterious Swordman Yin. His over-the-top persona of a disillusioned sword fighter, the hell bent on doing evil, leads to some good moments of humor and traditional HK drama. A wonderful score, sumptuous cinematography with eye-popping colors, and frenetic action pieces courtesy of Ching Siu Tung around this wonderful movie. Find a copy wherever you can. 10/10
