Gender Bender the Limerick: <br /> <br /> A man or a woman? Who knows? <br /> <br /> It seems that "it's" both. <br /> <br /> Sleep in clay <br /> Then they all went away <br /> In one of their UFOs. <br /> <br /> Gender Bender is another great Season 1 episode. I enjoy this one, because the story is the kind you never really know what will happen next. It's totally original. The teaser is fun with a view and the reflection of the disco lights. I really have to learn that the male is doing the gender bender. I really like the atmosphere at the Kindred's small town and Mulder and Scully sneak around in the middle of the night. It's very exciting. This is one of my favorite Season 1 episodes. I think the thing I like about it is how it ultimately becomes strangers and left crop circles behind. Many people regard it as a non-mythology-related alien episode such as "The Unnatural" or "Space," but I think this can easily be seen as mythology-related. Perhaps the gender bender was just like the alien bounty hunter and could look like anyone. Huh? Anyway, I give the episode a 9 out of 10.
