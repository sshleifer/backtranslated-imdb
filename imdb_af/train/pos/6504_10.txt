My wife and I watched this whole series at least three times. I can't imagine how better it can be. This is not the "complete" history of World War II? No library can hold such a history, but it is the best summary of that history. Very detail, many personal stories, and still face the general picture. <br /> <br /> Olivier's narrative was excellently written and of course excellently presented. The interviews are on all sides except the Russian, because the producers are not allowed to speak to many Russians. It is very worthwhile to own this full program on DVD. We estimate our copy. <br /> <br /> The producer does an excellent job of providing photos and action where almost nothing in any archive exists. There are almost no movies of convoys and submarines, but still, the episode on this subject has been very well done.
