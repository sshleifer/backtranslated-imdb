ERROL FLYNN had one of his favorite roles as a clash of a versatile Irish family who became the world's heavyweight champion when John L. Sullivan (WARD BOND) cares that he "could beat anyone alive." Both Flynn and Ward Bond give what is probably one of the best performances they have ever shown on the screen. <br /> <br /> Raoul Walsh has set the colorful story with robust style management and family life with scenes that are warm-hearted and full of humor. All the Warner contractors make the finest players - including the ever-reliable ALAN HALE as Flynn's rambunious father, proud of his son's fighting abilities, and ALEXIS SMITH who enjoys most of her role as a versatile societal woman who sway Flynn off pen with bad one-liners dealing with its ingenious ways. <br /> <br /> All of the 1880's atmosphere is trapped in glorious B&W, though it's too bad. Warners had no more faith in Flynn to do the movie color. He was involved in a rock phase of his film career at the time. He was busy with a widespread rape trial that all the tabloids were sorting out. <br /> <br /> The fighting tones are one of the best ever choreographed for the screen, with Flynn of course in fine shape and making very little use of doubles for most of the action. And the scene where Bond switches to Flynn's award ceremony at a social event is one of Ward's best moments in a long career as a character character. Summary: Maintain interest throughout, whether you are a sports fan or not.
