In my opinion, this should be one of Barbara Stanwyck's best achievements. She was one of only a handful of actors, then and now, who can say more with a single look than a whole page of dialogue. And I was fortunate to see the original and uncensored movie, with the extra 4 minutes of extra footage. Sorry, the movie is so short. Lily is a young woman who almost holds it together for her father in his illegal speakeasy. Her only link to anything is her good friend, Chico, who was played terrifically by Theresa Harris. Although Chico is African American (and with a white woman, best friends with a black woman in the 30's are as controversial as the subject of this movie), and Lily is not, they have a special band. And it's not sexual. Only 2 women were trapped, or pushed, in a situation beyond their control. After Lily's father died and she didn't know what to do, she was told she had the power to get out and get what she wanted. Yes, it's immoral, but that's the whole point of this movie. Then they had to destroy the last few minutes. So, until the last few minutes of the movie, it's a great movie and worth watching. The "lesson" of the movie is as valid today as it was, and I'm sure it will be 100 years from now. Women, it's awful that Lily does to get what she wants, but it works. Men, beware.
