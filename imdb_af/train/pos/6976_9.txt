I didn't see SCR, I watched it once in the middle of the show, but couldn't succeed. However, I saw Caprica Rebirth yesterday, I got a little lost, so I decided to watch the Pilot today and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. I think this is a promising performance and the only side effect it has on me is that I want to watch BSG now. <br /> <br /> But what I really wanted is that I'm not a hardcore SCR fan to understand what's going on in Caprica. From what I read in the net, they tried to reach the female population, as BSG reached many more men, and at least in my case it worked. <br /> <br /> But I suggest if you try to watch the show, do it from the beginning, start with the Pilot.
