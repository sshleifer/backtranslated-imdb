I loved this movie! It was all I could do to not tear down when I saw it, but it was very exciting. I was struck by Ray Liotta's show, but especially Tom Hulce's talent depicting Ray's twin brother, who is spiritually sluggish because of a tragic and terrible childhood. But Tom's character, though heartbreaking, does not know sorry and is so full of hope and life. It's a good movie, don't miss it !!
