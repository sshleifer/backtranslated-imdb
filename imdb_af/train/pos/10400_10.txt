Probably the best fantasy film ever made. Beautiful color, spectacular sets, amazing cartoon Miklos Rosza musical score that is perfect for every scene and mood. It is also wonderful that it was tight and pretentious in smaller hands, but here the poetic dialogue is spoken well (the humor is also subtle and delightful). <br /> <br /> Doubtless Spielberg and Lucas were encouraged by this one. Along with "The Four Feathers" (1939), one of the two best films released by Alexander Korda and London Films --- and one of the best films ever made. <br /> <br /> A true, compelling classic!
