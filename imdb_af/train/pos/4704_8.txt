This movie is just a lot of fun. I saw it a few times, but it always has something funny that I remember. The car scene "Duckies and Bunnies" is one of my favorites, and I still mention Morone's versions of certain words! <br /> <br /> There are so many running jokes that it's great. But I'm in any case Michael Keaton!
