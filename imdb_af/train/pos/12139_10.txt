This movie, though more than 70 years old, is still a very moving, strong film. Bette Davis, as the messy, bitter Cockney waitress Mildred, is absolutely credible. To watch her performance is still spell binding. She utterly despises the viewer and at the same time forgives her. Leslie Howard's performance as the poor, obsessed Phillip Carey is not that strong, but I don't see how an actor can hold their own against me. Davis's performance. She visits the landscape in every scene she is in, and steals the show completely. This is the movie that sealed her star and she deserved to win the Oscar but lost. It was shocking for the day with themes of unwanted pregnancy, multiple sex partners and Mildred's evil language, so it's somewhat dated but still an excellent movie. Just to see the scene where Mildred tells Phillip what she really thinks of him ("You, cad, dirty piglets ....") is still one of the biggest plays I've ever seen on film.
