I just watched it for the first time in a long time - I both forgot how imaginative the images were and how funny the movie was. However, I did not forget the opening styles filmed (with the scene at the Christmas Lights Club in Waterloo Bridge) among the most romantic ever. <br /> <br /> Anyone interested in politics or history will love the film's off-hand references. Anyone interested in romance will be moved by Hunter-Niven, and anyone who loves visuals will enjoy the portrayal of the night world. <br /> <br /> My favorite movie continues to be "Odd Man Out" near the same time - but this one is great. <br /> <br />
