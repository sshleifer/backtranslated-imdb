Ossession <br /> <br /> The debut film of Luchino Visconti, this Italian noir, is generally credited with the Neo-realistic movement, which is at the top of the box. It is a sometimes intrusive, sometimes airy, portrait of lonely individuals in moral flood. Set in Fascist Italy, a variety of supportive characters - including an inventive commander who gives communist virtues - illuminate the remote despair of a country seeking its identity, without drifting soul that longs for soul. Although Visconti's compassion for the upset and his ability to express their distressed conditions is already well-developed, the spider's web of fraud is ominous - though a staple of noir is a protagonist manipulated by fate and the femme fatale , Gino is here so unholy to start with what you fear he can earn - the cosmic irony to didactically, the illegal relationship tense with bados. The same, it's sharp and essential, though its real impact on film history is definitely debatable.
