Hmmm, yes, this episode is extremely underestimated. <br /> <br /> Although there is a lot of bad writing and action on parts. I think the good ear wins the bad. <br /> <br /> I like the origami parts and the big 'twist' at the end. I'm absolutely out of that scene when Michelle confronts Tony. This is actually one of my favorite scenes of Season 1. <br /> For some reason people have always hated the Reincarnation episodes, but I've always loved them. They are not the best in terms of writing. but the theme really matters me, <br /> <br /> I'm going to give it a THREE star, but if the script was a bit more consistent, I give it four.
