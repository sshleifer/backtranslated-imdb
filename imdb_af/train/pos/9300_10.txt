I don't know much about the Rat Pack, and Frank Sinatra was always a bit too self-conscious of myself. So when I call this one of my all-time faves, it's nothing to do with a tribute mentality. As another reviewer says, Mad Dog Time is about symbolism, not realism. It's kapkaesk (Kyle MacLachlan is probably the worst of a very strong crowd when he was as good as Joseph K), it's stylish, know, sardine and smooth. Jeff Goldblum navigates his way around a variety of characters, trying not to shoot and act, rather than dorkily, to keep abreast of what he knows and others, who he can emit and who he can't. Gabriel Byrne and Richard Dreyfuss (his best performance) have a ball, and the supporting guitar looks spot-on. The symbolism, the institutions (the one extra-mural movement shot with Jeff Goldblum laying the stairs, looks very strange to so much delicacy), the dialogue (style, not practical, is the order of the day). It's about characters who interact, not really gangsterism. Fun to watch, must be fun to do. What the critics were, is really a mystery ...
