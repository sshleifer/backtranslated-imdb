One of the best movies I've ever seen was an Irish movie titled Philadelphia, Lord I Come. I read the play before I saw the movie and loved both of them. This is the story of a young man preparing to leave Ireland to go to America because he cannot earn in Ireland. It is recommended from the perspective of the young man (who can see the other characters in the film) and another young man who represents his uncensored thoughts and feelings. But that can't be seen by the other characters in the movie. It's a very sad movie, but touches deeply, and I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to consider something. I love an Irish movie, or almost any film about Ireland, and any movie that Irish late actor Donal McCann has in it gets my voice. I'll chew that guy cold for 2 hours on the screen, and unfortunately I did. Shame lost him so young.
