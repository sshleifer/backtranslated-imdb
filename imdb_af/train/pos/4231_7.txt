Returning from a Christmas shopping center, a battered suburban housewife (Basinger) finds herself in a struggle for survival, after a disagreement with a group of criminal youths has a violent turn. <br /> <br /> The indignation of a straight to DVD release here in the UK may not receive Susan Montford's director's debut the award it deserves. It's a pity, because the standard of writing, directing and acting is very good and surpasses the quality of your average straight to DVD movie. <br /> <br /> Kim Basinger gives her the best performance over time. as the apostate wife of an abused man (Craig Sheffer). While Sheffer is not really given more than being a threatening presence, it is in their short plays that Basinger is bound - with painful vulnerability, but still the rage that will eventually boil in her confrontation with the youth. It's a really big, underestimated performance, her transformation from victim to aggressor played seamlessly. <br /> <br /> Lukas Haas I initially thought it was a disaster, as he (along with the other three youths) just didn't have much of a threat. However, if all four of the youths were more physically minded, the later scenes in which Basinger turned the tables against them would not work. The fact that it is four men, though slightly indifferent, is the key to why the film works so well. <br /> <br /> Apart from some pacing issues during the last half of the movie and a few cute lines here and there, what we have here is a great excitement that the viewer actually has consider when the movie is over. Some can be adjusted by the slow burning of the opening scenes, or the sudden end. Others through sometimes brutal violence. I say give it a chance, it's definitely more worthy of your time than Saw V.
