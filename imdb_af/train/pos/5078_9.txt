This one stood out for his originality. I'm seriously tired of seeing Hindi movies that are a lot of Hollywood and British movies. Some errors were inevitable, but this movie is a must-see. Surya's portrayal of the clean, unscrupulous policeman (as opposed to the chopped, money-hungry people we normally see) was wonderful. He came far from his work in Nerukku Ner. I like the movie so much that I had to own it. I'm not usually in the unthinkable violence type movies, in one way or another, I actually felt for every character and therefore I can't really call it 'bad' violence. I don't appreciate the excessive melodrama and sentimental scenes that go hand in hand with most Hindi and Tamil movies. I absolutely loved this movie because it's not the same. ACS Anbuselvan's reaction to losing his wife is not overdoing, is heartbreaking and makes my eyes shut. There are times when I watch a movie when I want to hit the FF button. Quite a few times I wanted to do this at a cinema. Never do this when you watch this movie. I really hope Ghajini will soon release.
