The story is told fluently. There are no interruptions. The flash rugs are seamlessly woven into the present. Casting was excellent. Young Ya'ara looked very much like Ya'ara would have looked at that age. Her portrayal of a blind person has been convincingly done. Director Daniel Syrkin did an excellent job of working with the various actors in this story. The cinematography is very good. You feel like you are with Ya'ara and Talia walking to the ocean to the edge of the cliff. The English captions follow the Hebrew script very carefully. It is interesting to note that even if "out of sight" is not a direct translation of "Lemarit Ayin". Both names are very suitable for the story.
