No one would argue that this 1945 war film was a masterpiece. (How can any 1945 war film be a masterpiece?) And yet it is an extremely effective narrative of a true story, that of Al Schmidt, who has been blinded to Guadalcanal, as played by John Garfield, who spent days for capture the nuances of a blind person's actions. Robert Leckie, in "Helm for My Pillow", denies Schmidt's popularity in favor of his foxgat, who was murdered and writes that "the country needs living heroes." <br /> <br /> Well, I suppose the country did. And they had one here. There is a single battle scene in the movie, tied to the studio pot, which lasts only ten minutes or longer and takes less than halfway through the film, rather than being saved for the climax, but it is the scariest and most realistic portrayal of men. under fire I can remember seeing on the screen, including those in "Saving Private Ryan". People scream with fear, shout at each other and against the enemy, and bloom and die without the help of color, stereophonic sound, squibs or gore. <br /> <br /> From a technological point of view, the movie is outstanding. It is not only that we learn how complicated a mechanism is a .30 caliber, water-cooled Browning machine gun, or that it should only be shaken in a few laps or that it does not fly like a fire, as in so many other war films. The technical accuracy adds to the sound of the scene. The need to stick to short bursts is frightening when dozens of screaming enemies throw over a pitcher over fifty feet, with the sole purpose of restricting you and your two isolated comrades to a small rifle placement. <br /> <br /> The performances are solid, if not bravura, including those of the ubiquitous support of the 1940s, John Ridgeley, and a radiant, youthful Eleanor Parker. The frame of love story is saving, but it works, and ultimately it is very moving. A striking dream sequence is included. It's not Bunuel, but for a routine 1945 movie it looks original and effective. <br /> <br /> Albert Maltz can overwrite the script, or it can be changed by someone else. It could have used the kind of pruning that might have a great need for ambiguity. Yet there are strange verbal punctuation that has a surprising impact on the viewer: "Why doesn't God kill me?" And, "In the eyes, Lee. Get them in the eye!" Depth of anxiety in some cricket words. And a surprising amount of bitterness expressed by wounded veterans in a 1945 war film. <br /> <br /> Notes that may be fake for a contemporary viewer, but maybe it should: the dated national language that makes it difficult is to believe that many of today's children can think, is actually ever spoken - private gab, dope "," dripping, "" Give, "" you dumb, "" Lady, "a sword," and "sorry for yourself. "Let's look at the historical context and be friendly in our judgments. Right now some of these goofy lingo were at the forefront. <br /> <br /> Real weaknesses The wounded veterans come together and argue with each other how much of a collective future they have, and the argument is overlooked with a conclusion in the sense of: "Just because you have a silver plate in your head does not mean that people will think you are a bad person. 'Sometimes there are voices and silent prayers that are unnecessary and straightforward. "Please, God, let him come back to me," and that kind of thing. <br /> <br /> Well, the filmmakers were within the limits of their time. Perhaps that is why the final fades into a shot of Independence Hall and the inspiring tribes of America's beautiful swell in the back. <br /> <br /> None of these can extract the film's virtues, which is considerable, especially the impact of the terrible battle scene. It's not often on television. If you have a chance, go through it.
