To see "Moonstruck" after so many years is a reminder of how sweet and sensationally funny this movie was when it first appeared. Who knew Cher could act? Who ever heard of Olympia Dukakis? Nicholas Cage was the start of his career, and Vincent Gardenia and Danny Aiello were not known for their comic talents, and Norman Jewison was not the director either. <br /> <br /> The only very flat note in this beautiful work is "When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie, it's amore, a song that is sung too many times in the movie (once is too much) and it had a long afterlife in popular music. <br /> <br /> Cher is - forgive me - sensationally like Loretta Castorini, a widow who wants to get married and doesn't have to fall in love with the groom, Aielo (Johny Cammareri) obliged to suggest that she present her little ring as a replacement for an engagement ring and then storm out to Sicily to be with his dying mother, asking Loretta to see her estranged brother , Ronny, attending the wedding Loretta confronts Ronny and soon falls in love with him, while her father (Vincent Gardenia) is surprised at her mother (Olympia Dukakis), who accidentally discovers Loretta when Ronny invites her to the Metropolitan Opera. > <br /> Everything finally works out, as it inevitably does in films of this genre yd frees up all the actors themselves and enjoys the audience themselves. By the way, "Moonstruck" is how Hollywood worked at its best: movie entertainment with no social meaning whatsoever. If they just lost "It's Amore", it would have been perfect.
