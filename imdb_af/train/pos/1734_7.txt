I just saw this movie for the first time and I enjoyed it. Her dance was very entertaining. I read somewhere that she got the role in this movie because she knew how to dance. The scenery was also good. Yvonne is such a talented woman and beautiful. We laughed at the silly sentones, but it's great about old movies! I grew up with her at The Munsters and I enjoy watching her in her previous movies. They may not all be the best out there, but are still worth watching to see her actions and singing. I slowly buy all her movies and watch me receive them. I have a large collection of her memorabilia.
