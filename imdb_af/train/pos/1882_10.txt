<br /> <br /> What can I say? It is one of the most perfect movies ever made. It is a setback to the glittering, sterling romantic comedies of the 1940s. But with a modern touch. The screenplay bursts with white, charm, humor and tenderness, the cinematograpy is breathtaking (NYC never looked so beautiful) and of course there is the cast! Dudley Moore turns into performing his career as Loveable, drunk Arthur Bach. He is also capricious and actually. One of the movie's best lines is his finger. Not everyone who drinks is a poet. Some of us drink because we are not poets. Great Sir John Gielgud won a well-deserved Oscar for his beautiful show as Hobson, Arthur's fall and overseer. Although he regards it as a "take the money and run", he brings all the talent, experience and bravura of a knowledgeable tragidian and a clever comedian. The supporting film is also from this world, from Geraldine Fitzgerald's sick grandmother Bach to Stephen Elliott's bombastic Mafioso. <br /> <br /> The score is also extremely memorable and complements the movie perfectly. The only real problem with the movie is the sickly-beaten successor who has sustained it.
