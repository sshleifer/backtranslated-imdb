I probably only saw this movie in about 1995. Since then, I have returned there many times. It's great! I especially like the first and second tracks, "Creation" and "Civilization Rising." Wow! It was so cool back in the glory days of CG animation. CG is much older than me because I know the movie "Tron" was made 7 years before my time. But this film was a landmark in the early 90's. This was probably the first collaboration of various music-based CG experiments. I like it a lot, I think I'm going to watch it now. bye
