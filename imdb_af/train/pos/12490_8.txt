Allen and Julie were walking in the mountains in a cabin after their daughter was murdered one night. No one knows who killed the girl, but that's why they went to the mountains. So the couple move in this cabin and it is played by people who killed themselves there and nobody in the nearby town wants to talk about it. <br /> <br /> This movie has a lot of creepiness on it and it has a lot of parts that made me jump. Some of the parts are predictable, but once there is a part I didn't expect. It was a nice movie that wasn't the scariest movie in the world, but it was quite frightening to make it good. <br /> <br /> I also stopped because it left the viewer to decide how it ended. It's also kind of a sad movie, but also a well done horror movie.
