I must say, I was surprised at the quality of the movie. It was much better than I expected. Scenario and acting are pretty good. The director also did a good job. Although some scenes look a bit clumsy, it's a decent movie overall. The idea was definitely brilliant and the truth didn't expose to the end. The mental hospital atmosphere is fairly well-given. The plot was clear, consistent and well thought out. Some people may find it a bit boring, as the story line is very focused and takes time for character and story development. Moral of the story, it's a decent movie for his genre and it's amazingly good.
