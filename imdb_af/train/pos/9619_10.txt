OK, such a 10 for a 2 1/2 star movie you ask? ... Well, see this one and maybe it will make more sense. Hitchcock never merged more scenes. The film weaves screens apart flawlessly and yet you don't develop the scattering you sometimes get as a movie through the many characters trying to develop it. You feel that the characters will show you something unusual about themselves and then they will not disappoint you if they do. Author / Products Phil Hay's surreal life story, blended with an absolutely superb soundtrack, makes you think more about the 6-degree separation in life than the movie with the same title. I will look for more good things from this producer in the future.
