When I saw the extensive DVD box for this and the terrible Red Queen figurine, I felt I was in a great disappointment, but surprised, surprise, I loved it. Consolidated nonsense, of course, and unforgivable that such a complicated denomination must be rushed to scarcely read the captions, let alone the ridiculous explanation. These quibbles apart, but the movie is a dream. Beautiful ladies in fabulous outfits in wonderful settings and the whole thing is constantly going on and accompanied by a wonderful Bruno Nicolai score. He may not be Morricone, but in these lighter pieces he can be so good. Really enjoyable with lots of color, lots of sex, killing some gory and minimal police interference. Super.
