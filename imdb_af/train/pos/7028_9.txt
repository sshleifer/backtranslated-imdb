Seen it as a previous viewer by accident, I watched it now twice. I thoroughly enjoyed it, no simple thinking messages, just good fun entertainment, good songs, good characters and just a good movie. It is highly recommended for those of us who just want to enjoy movies and not dissect. Many fun for the whole family. here. I didn't realize that Rosie Alvarez was played by Vanessa Williams, she was excellent and very sultry. The songs like One Boy and One Last Kiss are really nice to listen to and tap your feet to Jason Alexander. The complete contrast with his character in Pretty Woman ans is very good. Tyne Daley is still in my mind from Cagney and Lacey and her voice and accent still have the memory in it. Generally, I just loved it and would look for it if it was available
