I like the movie, especially because it has told an interesting story, but the story as told in the movie felt that it was condensed from a much longer story. Since the book is over 400 pages, it makes sense. It spans a period from the 1920s to the 1970s, in a fictitious South American country, also much to fit in with the time available. I think it would have been much better than a half-hour mini-series than it turned out to be a 140-minute movie. <br /> <br /> Although rushed, the story doesn't get so much that it gets confusing. What is being said is fairly well said. One mistake is that Clara's supernatural powers appear inconsistent; or they should have appeared more evenly over the course of the movie, or they should be left out. Two more mistakes (which could be spoilers): Esteban's eventual return to goodness is somewhat too sudden, and Ferula's curse appears to be carrying, although the tone of the story suggests that it must endure forever. <br /> <br /> The acting is excellent. Glenn Close, as the tormented spider Ferula, is outstanding. Jeremy Irons, as the cruel self-made rich man, is also excellent. Meryl Streep, as the main character Clara, is wonderful, though she is often even better than she was in this movie. There were also very well-educated smaller roles. The biggest mistake is that the film lacks a dialectic fighter; every actor was in a different kind of accent.
