Here's a weird jewel for those who haven't seen or probably haven't even heard of this. During the 80's Dennis Quaid was a hot commodity, but in the early 90's Dennis Quaid disappeared from the scene. In 1993 he burst with three movies on the big screen, all of which were unfortunately bombarded. Two of those movies I really loved and let me work out on one of them. <br /> <br /> "Wilder Napalm" is a crazy movie about two brothers, Wallace (Quaid) and Wilder (Arliss Howard) ... waves: yes, they have the power of pyrokinetics. <br /> <br /> Wilder decided not to use his power anymore (for anything that wasn't usable) after a fatal incident during his youth, where he and his brother blew up a deserted home. a man who was unknown was murdering them. Currently, Wilder is a firefighter and is married to the vigilant Vida (Debra Winger), who is under house arrest, guess what, arson (see the movie to understand it better). Wilder also did not speak to Wallace in 5 years, because Wallace set his hair on fire during his bachelor's party. <br /> <br /> Wallace loves his pipe power and uses it for entertainment. He also manages a carnival and is the main gorge. When the carnival arrives at the Wilder City, Wallace decides to reunite with his brother and also see Vida, who Wallace is in love with! Vida's house arrest sees its end, but Wilder is busy. So, Wallace enters and begins the fun. Brother against brother ... fight fire with fire! <br /> <br /> Some big fireballs throw in this movie ... eat your heart, Drew Barrymore! <br /> <br /> The movie also features some weird, yet funny elements, such as Wilder's fire unit singing songs acapella during firefighting and after wards. Jim Varney (known worldwide as 'Ernest') appears as Wallace's redneck carnival partner. "Wilder Napalm" was brilliantly shot ... and cleverly composed ... much of the wall and avant-guard. <br /> <br /> Take this one a look ...
