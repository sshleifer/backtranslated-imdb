20 out of 10 This is a wonderful story about a warrior evacuee and a cricket maker Tom Oakley. The boy (William Beech) is contracted with Tom and it is immediately clear that he has serious problems knowing the first night on his bed. William is illiterate and scared, but one is somehow comforting each other's loneliness. It seems that William has a talent as an artist and we see Tom's talent as a choirmaster in an amusing performance of Jerusalem. William is befriended by Zacharias Wrench, a young Jewish boy, also from London, and with Tom and Zacharias, he finally learns to read and write and feel part of this small, close community. Just as he was settling in, William was returned by his mother to London and this is where we see why he was screwed. His mother is clearly mentally ill and when Tom doesn't hear of William, he travels to London to look for him. He finally finds him holding his dead baby sister where he is tied in a basement. After a while in hospital, Tom realized he had to kidnap him and take him home with him. The climax is a bittersweet end when William is told he must be adopted by Tom while at the same time his best friend, Zacharias, was murdered in an air raid in London. For me, one of the most moving scenes was when Tom spoke to a home office official. <br /> <br /> I love 'Im, an' for what it's worth, I think he loves me too. '<br /> <br /> It just doesn't get any better than that?
