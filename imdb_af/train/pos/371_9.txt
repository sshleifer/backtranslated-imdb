I remember when this film was for the Academy Awards and didn't win in any category. For my life, I can't remember what it's all about, but one thing I can say is one of the best movies I've ever seen. And the fact that Steven Spielberg directed the movie didn't even persuade me. <br /> <br /> Essentially, it's about a black woman's trials and tribulations as she grows up from a girl to a woman. There are many insinuations that are disturbing and terrible, but everyone is needed to see how much this woman has contracted with her. Along the way we see other women who have to suffer their hardship and have to deliver with them. Whoopi Goldberg gives her best performance ever in this movie. Danny Glover also had to be nominated at least for his role in this film. <br /> <br /> And the best part of this movie is that it deals with its subjects humanly, and not like some hassles like the more recent "Beloved". I encourage someone of any breed to watch this movie. 9/10
