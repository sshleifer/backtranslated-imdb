Once a year comes a movie like that and makes it easy for you. You don't have an attempt to think it's good, it's just. You enjoy it while you see it, and you take it with you. I can't say it's completely flawless, but it's close. Acting - great, story-interesting and with elements of tension. It's a small family story, very predictable, but it's not the secret itself that matters. This is the way it needs the blind girl to reach it. I was impressed with the way the director portrayed their deep relationship (the blind girl and her cousin). The only thing I didn't like so much was the actress the mother played, she was too hard and unnecessary. turn
