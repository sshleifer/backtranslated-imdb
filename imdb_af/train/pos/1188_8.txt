I was initially questionable about this movie (simply because of the subject), but the richly drawn characters, the fantastic scenes of the buffalo hunt, and the dramatic conclusion make it good to watch. Initially, I had problems distinguishing between the two buffalo hunters, but as the movie progressed, they increasingly distinguished themselves. I'm still chased by the final scene.
