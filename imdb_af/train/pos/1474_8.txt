I watched this movie at the Toronto International Film Festival. Not as boring as it sounds, it's a three-part documentary (every episode is 50 minutes) with Slovenian superstar philosopher / psychoanalyst Slavoj Zizek. Zizek travels us through numerous classic films that investigate themes of sexuality, fantasy, morality and death. It is directed by Sophie Fiennes, of the versatile Fiennes group (she is sister to actors Ralph and Joseph). <br /> <br /> I enjoyed it quite a lot, although I think it will be even more enjoyable on DVD, as there are such a few ideas to digest. Freudian and Lacanic analysis can be quite heavy and the whole series is immediately disillusioned at the end of two and a half hours. It didn't help that a badly advised coffee and possession of a bladder brought me uncomfortable for the last hour. <br /> <br /> My only real problem with this is that of course, Zizek stuffed movies that were quite picked with Freudian themes. He spent quite a bit of time on the films of Hitchcock and David Lynch, not exactly masters of subtlety. I would like to see him try to support his theories by using a wider range of movies, although I really just want to see four and five and six. <br /> <br /> Zizek is very funny, and part of the humor kept him going, bringing himself into the real scenes of some of the movies he discusses. . For example, we see him in a motor boat en route to Bodega Bay (from Hitchcock's The Birds) or in the basement of the Bates Motel (of Psycho). It is not to say that his theories are not challenging. Even when I had my disagreement with him, it definitely made me think a little more deeply about the movies. That's exactly what he's trying to achieve.
