I must confess that I did not read the original M R James story, although I read many of his other supernatural stories. I also saw most of the previous BBC Christmas ghost stories and this one, in my opinion, surpasses most of them, just equal to The Signalman. <br /> <br /> I can't really make a mistake. A View From a Hill - The direction and 'mood' are perfect, like the acting, lighting and of course the story and writing. I really enjoyed it and can only hope for more of this quality from the same director and production team. I understand that the BBC is planning to make more (not necessarily based on M R James stories) so it's promising. <br /> <br /> 10/10
