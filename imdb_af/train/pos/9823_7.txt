I really thought it wasn't that bad. Not a good work of art, but Dermot M was by far the stronger artist. Patricia Arquette was far too much. He actually plays selo which was very impressive, and his lines were never forced. Besides, he's an incredibly beautiful man. Really sexy. Add it to the talent, and most of the time he is, is much more acceptable. He always gives all of them even if some of the projects he was involved in were not the highest point. Not the actor's fault in most cases. He's unlucky in some strange movies that just didn't argue at the cashier's office. Always with A-list actors, but not always a "hit". But he is "worth every penny" of any DVD that is rented or bought. See the wedding date with Debra Messing - one of his best overall movies. BE EVERY PENNY! ; ) (if you haven't seen it yet, then you will understand the quotation!)
