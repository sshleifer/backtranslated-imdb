I loved this movie. Not only because I am a big fan of Moritz Bleib train, though he is in almost all German movies that count. But also because he is NOT the main actor. The lead is taken over by Barnaby Metschurat, the only reason to see Julietta in 2001, and who really wears this film on his shoulders. <br /> <br /> A family moves from Italy to Germany and seeks 'the German dream' (that is my own invention and ironic ...) of cheap labor in steel and coal industries. However, they end up opening a restaurant and the journey that takes the movie to this point alone is so poetic and at the same time funny and charming. From here, the story is mainly told of the two brothers of this family, Giancarlo (Bleibtreu) and Gigi (Metschurat). Gigi's dream of becoming a filmmaker is being threatened by competition with his brother and his mother's determination to return to Italy. What follows is a wonderful - and totally neutral - look at life that can be shaped by the choices you make. <br /> <br /> In the end, this movie doesn't say what life (Gigi's or Giancarlo's) was anymore. successful or fuller or more interesting. It just gives us a rewarding look at what it should be like to look for identity when two countries and minds are involved. and this appearance is not driven by bitterness or contempt to any country, making it such a good film for any country that is dealing with the tension of immigration. The fact that director Fatih Akin moved to Germany from Turkey in the 70's also gives this film a great deal of credibility and emotional accuracy. The icing on the cake is fantastic performances throughout the role, especially Metschurat and that, which I really must emphasize, is the little boy who plays young Gigi. The child's performance will be a hard act to just follow someone! Great movie, will see it.
