Simon Pegg plays the role of Sidney Young, a young entertainment writer who started out with a career driver for a pedestrian magazine specializing in the discomfort and superficiality of the rich and famous. He makes a career out of lampooning celebrities, though he desperately wants to be a celebrity himself. The film is based on the bitter career of Toby Young, who also named a small magazine in Britain called the Modern Review, which made a rogue critique of just about anything conceivable until he hailed the magazine in oral specks with she co-closed. editor, and then had a spectacular failed career as a writer for Vanity Fair, who is almost the part of his life in this movie. <br /> <br /> He is excited about working for a major publication (Sharp's Magazine in the film), and despite active nerves, he is positive on his first day. He meets editor-in-chief, Clayton Harding (played by Jeff Bridges), who is difficult as nails, but who is also exactly the kind of editor he needs to be a goof-off like Young to keep his work at the magazine . He offers little in the form of Young's immediate acceptance, but he also has what can only be described as a liberal tolerance to Young's insignificant ancient and inappropriate behavior. <br /> <br /> Much of the comedy in the movie is derived from Young's misunderstanding or indifference to the generally acceptable code of public behavior and the peculiar label involved in dealing with the rich and famous. But Sidney's reasons for acting in such a strange way and giving excessive interviews are because he believes he despises the well-known culture and he seems to believe in that age-old saying ?? "If you can't beat, you have to be with them and then beat." <br /> <br /> Complicating issues are two very different women. There is a beautiful, regular girl at Alison Olsen magazine (Kirsten Dunst) who was initially confronted by Sidney's obvious arrogance and ways, and a beautiful model called Sophie (Megan Fox), representing the well-known culture . Needless to say, Sidney's endless attack on superficiality and stars is a superficial desire Sophie, the one with the appearance of a star. <br /> <br /> Sophie is beautifully beautiful, it's true, but also as if she didn't have a single thought in her head. Alison is a regular girl, not very interesting or attractive, but Dunst's performance makes her a real person. A relationship with her would have the reality of a Britney Spears marriage. However, the film retains some credibility because, despite the obviousness, we also feel Sidney's pain not to follow her (I felt it). <br /> <br /> H Losing friends and alienation People have a pretty interesting idea and are full of honest, satisfying performances, and although it is a bit of your standard romantic comedy by the third act, it has' a variety of well-developed and interesting characters. For example, Danny Huston gives us a great performance as Alison's other love interest, which pays tribute to The Big Lebowski (also Bridges lead) with his ever-white White Russian, one of my personal favorite drinks. The purchase of Absolute and Kahlua here in China costs the equivalent of about $ 350, but my kitchen is never without them. <br /> <br /> I look forward to the day when Simon Pegg took a little bit off, because I love his movies, but I'm completely uncertain about his series. He played a serious character in Hot Fuzz, but only seriously with regard to the lunacy around him and eventually returned to himself. He was pretty much in Shaun of the Dead, Run, Fat Boy, Run, and now How to Lose Friends. He is a rising star, it will be interesting to see what he can do.
