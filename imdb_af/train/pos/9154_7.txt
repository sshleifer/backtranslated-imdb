Very good except for the end which was a great disappointment. <br /> <br /> The writing was very good like the acting. The footage was often very granular, but it added in a way to the movie, as the snow features were in good places that helped create a mood for the movie. This influence is ruined by the extremely incredible end. <br /> <br /> I would give this movie an 8 out of 10, but the end pushed it to a point to 7 because it looks like it has radically turned away from the first 75 minutes of the movie and at It ends up smart to make the filmmakers. <br /> <br /> However, this movie was much better than movies with rather larger budgets and looked like it was a home movie with some extra equipment. Not much in the way of special effects as it goes, but for tension it was very good.
