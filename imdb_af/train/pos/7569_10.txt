At a time in our culture where reality is exposed as a narrative, the overwhelming fiction as we know it on the small and large screen is 'Apart From That' a film that exposes real-world moments that are more honest, fresh and innovative feel in the presentation as I have ever seen. The usual spoon nutrition conventions do not exist in this movie, and allow a content parent to sit and watch these real moments drop one after the other on the screen. While watching the movie, and even after considering posts, it's hard to believe that these amazing performances are where they are. Every moment with the big role players felt the truth exposed in their daily routine. Yet, "Apart Van Dat" does not feel like a documentary or reality television, but transcends into a category of its own, with its unique cinematography and direction. I look forward to further looking at this new category storytelling with other films by directors Jennifer Shainin and Randy Walker. <br /> <br /> This movie should be seen.
