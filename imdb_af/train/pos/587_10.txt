One of the things about the movie that warms my heartbeats was that dry fly fishing was a big part of the scene. I have already done my times of dry fly fishing, tied my own flies and accompanied my brother and my dad, we spent a day on one river or another trying to get up the unnecessary stormy brown trout to take the plane. what was offered to them. <br /> <br /> When we had such opportunities, any differences between us disappeared and any of the pressures of the world melted away to be replaced by the glory of being absorbed into the activity and the environment of the place we were in. <br /> <br /> It was one of the wonderful things portrayed for me in the film, such as the minister and his two sons, Norman and Pauly, performed the ritual. Because there is something ritualistic about fly fishing, because there is something ritualistic about so many pastimes. You can't just start throwing your fishing line and hope for the best. You have to point yourself to the place you are in, you have to scan the surface of the water considering how it flows and where the best point is to fly and depending on your skill level you can even fly there for a long time enough to catch and fish for a fish. The 'Art of Fly Fishing' is aimed and represents so well that they can be classified as artists themselves. <br /> <br /> The title for the movie can no longer be appropriately chosen, because the river actually ran through the life of father and two sons. However, this film spreads him broader than the family and community in Montana, along the Blackfoot River, where the film is being played. It has the ability to engage you to captivate you, as the history of the family, community and era unfolds. The story tells is not just a family history, but a history of life. What can be classified as a 'River of Life'
