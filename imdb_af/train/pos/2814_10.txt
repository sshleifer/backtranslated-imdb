This is the best film ever made to deal with the subject of Aids. It is a documentary about two men who live and die with this disease. The film is beautiful, heartbreaking, funny and incredibly moving. Above all, this is an incredibly true love story. Make sure you have a few punches before watching this movie. You will need it. Extraordinary.
