I saw this pilot when it was first shown, and I'm sure many "Spirit" fans hate it, because like the Batman, the Green Hornet, etc., it took the character toward "camp". But I apparently never got enough of Batman, because I thought it was entertaining, somehow it shows. There are two parts that stay with me. First, when Denny's mate was fatally wounded, he made a dramatic speech about how he always stood for the law and obeyed the exact letter of it. Then he says something like, "Boy, I was stupid!" What is his way of telling Denny instead to become a vigilante, what he does (though the TV Batman type). Then there is the scene where he tries to seduce the villain to let him go by kissing her, but she is not deceived because he is too honest to kiss her convincingly! It was a good example of "camp", which was also "underplay" by the actor and actress.
