Answer: Despite the fact that this film is written and directed by a woman, your ex is creeper, nastier and more irrational than any zombie that has ever hidden the earth. <br /> <br /> The play in this independent film is actually pretty good, despite the less than wonderful writing. It takes a pretty good actor to deliver an excessively clich√© line and sounds vaguely promising. Young Anthony de Marco, like Jake, performs a particularly good performance. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the plot of this movie is much better than the dialogue. Try it, especially if you're not a monster fan. It's not a horror flick. Although all the adult women are very beautiful, and although all the adult males act as if their brains were eaten in an earlier zombie film, "Jake's Closet" is suitable for adult adults. <br /> <br /> The whole, this time it is much better than the sum of its parts.
