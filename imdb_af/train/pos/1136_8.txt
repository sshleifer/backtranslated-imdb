I'm not sure these comments contain a real spoiler, but I'm playing it safe, so don't read it if you haven't seen the movie. <br /> <br /> I adore this movie, and so do everyone I work with - and that's the point. I did a lot of my work life in the movie, without being an actor. Such people are the so-called heroes of this movie: the gaffers, the tractors, the directors of the air, the lighters and writers, the costumes, and so forth, and the whole thing is told from their point of view, at least a good measure. Most actors are nuts and self-absorbed to the point of absurdity. This is what made this movie so good, but you have to work with actors to admit that this movie is real drama! Possible spoiler warning: in one big scene, the two leaders, both actors, lead on how to understand something personal, something completely out-of-script, with another actor, and set up rules, practice, and criticize each other 's performance. <br /> <br /> Since this movie appeared, how was it, '91, it's fashionable to do this, especially on TV. But almost someone did it so well.
