It put together some characters that would not normally be seen together (not mentioned, try to save one's baby and bring it back to his father). They start as enemies and end up as best friend. If it sounds like a Disney movie, it's (made only by the 20th century Fox). The trailer on the movie was one of the best I've ever seen, but the movie doesn't live up to the expectation of the trailer. The problem lies under the circumstances that the film's creators did not make up who was the target audience of the film. Yes, there are some jokes in the movie that only adults will understand, but the movie is mostly aimed at children. The parents will enjoy that 90 min. their children's attention is focused on something other than them. The wallpaper is excellent and the voice is good, but it's nothing more like the nice movie. Kids will love this movie, adults will just love it.
