There were many things that looked at this movie before I watched it. <br /> <br /> First, I was a typical high school parent, in a Shakespeare class I didn't really even like, much less understood half of it! Shakespeare would not be more than UNBELIEVABLE, without throwing my ALL concentration in his almost encrypted plays ... encrypted with his extremely difficult language to understand .... and I still don't get it. <br /> Second, it was 4 hours long! I never thought it could be a good thing. <br /> <br /> Let me tell you something. This movie was so masterful, so beautiful, I actually understood all the language it performed. Now, the script was followed by the letter in this movie, the same script that was incomprehensible to me in the Shakespeare class. And here I opened my mind and I understood it. I doubted myself watching the movie almost! But look and see ... when it's done, and only then, Shakespeare comes to life. So this version of Hamlet showed me that Shakespeare is indeed a master who wrote good stories. When I saw it on the big screen, especially in the high-budget large movie style (with beautiful cinematography and photography), and Brannagh acted surprisingly and somehow thrown. I understood what was going on. What was said. The language is wonderful and passionate. It allows for more raw emotion ... when words can't describe something, maybe Shakespeare's words. <br /> <br /> I still like to this day that Fist of The North Star (animated, English dub) is the biggest movie ever made. No movie offers more pure entertainment. But for a movie to get close to the debilitating Fist of that position (which Hamlet did - it came close) is truly incredible. Awe inspire. It wasn't a movie. It was an event. <br /> <br /> Even more surprisingly, it appreciated Shakespeare's appreciation. Wow. Powerful. Powerful is the word. One of the rare, VERY powerful movies out there. <br /> <br /> It gets 2 hundred billion stars from infinite stars. Yes yes. <br /> <br /> By the way, all your kids out there in a Shakespeare class ... forget about it. You're wasting your time. You should see the plays played. Only then will they be done right.
