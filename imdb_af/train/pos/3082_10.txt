What is really sad, shows like Six Degree's and Brothers & Sisters is the real reality TV, not that garbage that is nothing more than glorified game shows. I think the basis of dissatisfaction over the past few years has been with very premature cancellation of many performances with a cult that follows. But with the more vocal setback the supporters of Jericho (which I also enjoy) and other programs, networks can reverse this trend. I'm like others, I will NOT support any new programs until they are given a second season. I might then decide to watch and catch up with DVDs and online viewing. Until then, you lost me as a viewer for any new show.
