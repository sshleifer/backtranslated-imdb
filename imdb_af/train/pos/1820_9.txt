I can remember this movie when I was a little kid, I loved it then and I still do it. I managed to get it on DVD for my 18th birthday and was delighted to find it so hard to find it before and it was just a rental when I was younger. My favorite character is Charlie because he learns to be a good dog. The movie is full of fun songs and music. The animation is brilliant and the character voices are perfect. This movie has always been a tearjerker for me, but I think if I didn't see the movie when I was little, I wouldn't find it so brilliant and fascinating, although I still believe I still will. enjoy because I'm really into animated movies.
