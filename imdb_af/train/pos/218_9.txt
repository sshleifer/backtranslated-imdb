Participate in roles played by Jack Albertson and Sam Levene on Broadway, Walter Matthau and George Burns, a few old vaudeville cartoons, a team in the tradition of Joe Smith and Charles Dale, who have a different outlook on life has. /> <br /> Walter Matthau can't stop working, the man has never learned to relax, take time and smell the roses. He is a crotchety old cuss whose best days are behind him and his cousin and agent Richard Benjamin finds less and less work for him. <br /> <br /> What hurt him was that his brother George Burns decided to retire some 15 years ago and spend time with his family. A Workaholic like Matthau cannot understand it and personally takes Burns's decision. <br /> <br /> Benjamin hits a brain storm, reunites the guys and does it on a national television specialist. What is happening here is quite hilaries. <br /> <br /> The Sunshine Boys is also a sad, bittersweet story, about age. Matthau is on the screen for most of the movies, but Burns had the kudos in the form of an Oscar at the age of 79. <br /> <br /> Burns brought a little of the personal into this movie as well. As we all know, he was the straight man of the wonderful comedy team of Burns & Allen, who borrowed the Monty Python troop a lot. In 1958 due to health reasons, Gracie Allen retired and George traveled for up to 100 years. Or at least pretty close to an active artist. <br /> <br /> The Sunshine Boys are based on the Smith and Dale team and if you like The Sunshine Boys, I strongly recommend you see two tickets to Broadway for a look at some guys who entertained the American public during the turn of the last century. The doctor sketch that Matthau and Burns are doing is directly out of their material. <br /> <br /> And I think you'll love The Sunshine Boys.
