In contrast to the opinions of the other review, this movie was actually surprisingly good! I was reluctant to see it and expect to get bored with clich√©s, obvious jokes and overworking. All the trailer promised. <br /> <br /> But after 5 minutes I really laughed and enjoyed the refreshing acting. With just one 'toilet humor' gag, controlling her dead body really realistically funny scenarios and without spoiling anything, some of the moments involving animals are hilarious. <br /> <br /> The staple ingredients of a good movie are all there; script, director and actors and compare other recent efforts to romantic comedy. This movie is long. <br /> <br /> Certainly, you're not going to learn anything or have a spiritual awakening, but if you are open minded you will probably have a good time!
