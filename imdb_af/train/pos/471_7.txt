These movie stars Emily Watson, of Breaking the Waves boast. This movie about one man's obsession takes place at a resort where a chess tournament is held. A chess master arrives and soon afterwards a woman falls in love (on the first face) with a woman, played by Emily Watson. She falls for this strange ball of a man who is obsessed with chess. It's all for the sake of her mother, who is more interested in seeing her with another young man. a good gentleman. Her mother feels that it is just a passing fancy to the young woman, as she tends to take in foreign animals and such. As a result, mostly a man's psyche trip. It tells the story of how his past is tied up with his present. Emily Watson is incredible in it, as well as the actor who plays the main character. It's definitely slow, but it's worth watching. The end was even satisfactory. :)
