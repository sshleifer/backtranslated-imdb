This movie is beautifully designed! There are no mistakes. Not in the design of the set, the lighting, the sounds, the plot. The script is an invitation to a complex game where participants are on a simple mission. <br /> <br /> Paxton is at its best at its best. His ways, the infections used in the tone of his voice, are without a fuss. Every shot done carefully! Surprises appear one after another when the movie is past its first hour. This may not be the best photo of the year, but it is a very well polished gem. This is not for the simple thought.
