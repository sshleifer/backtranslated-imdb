Never seen this movie, based on the entertaining novel by Nicholas Katzenbach, and considering the first rate compiled for the production, we decided to take a look. "Just Because", while not a horrible movie, takes too many freedoms with the original material Jeb Stuart did not properly handle. Arne Glimcher aimed. <br /> <br /> The first thing we think of when a young black man is packed into the local area for investigation is police brutality. At the same time, sheriff Tanny Brown and police officer Wilcox show no mercy to beat Bobby Earl. He is accused of killing a young white girl. We feel terrible about what the officers do to the prisoner. <br /> <br /> Then the scene changes. Evangeline, Bobby Earl's grandmother was sent north to ask a prominent Harvard professor, a retired lawyer, the young man wants to defend Paul Armstrong. His old wife is convincing enough for Armstrong to investigate the case. He is also convinced of the innocence of the young man. <br /> <br /> Things aren't exactly what we thought they were. When Blair Sullivan, a man serving at the same time as Bobby Earl, arrives to tell how he is tied to the girl's murder and change the dynamics of the case. The way it plays in the movie means confusing the viewer and distracting Armstrong to reach the truth. <br /> <br /> This thriller is made fun by Sean Connery, who plays Armstrong. Laurence Fishburne, an intense actor, makes a good impression as the Sheriff, as far as we can see, is guilty of abusing his prisoner. Ed Harris has a great opportunity to show why he is one of our best actors. Blair Underwood, Kate Capshaw, Ruby Dee and the young Scarlett Johansson are seen in supporting roles. <br /> <br /> Even with its flaws, the movie won't disappoint.
