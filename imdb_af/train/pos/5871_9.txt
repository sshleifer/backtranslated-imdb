I cherish every frame of this beautiful film. It's about regular people, people we all know, who suffer a bit in their lives and have some luggage to carry around. Just like us all. Robert DeNiro, Ed Harris and Kathy Baker breathe their life into their portrayals and are all excellent, but Harris is particularly heartbreaking and therefore very real. You will swear he is really a trucker who drinks that way, he doesn't have to feel anything. Baker as his pleasant sister also has some delicate moments. When DeNiro gives her flowers in one scene, it looks like she never got flowers before and probably not. Well worth it.
