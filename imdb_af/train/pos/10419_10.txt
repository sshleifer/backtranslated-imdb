I have to agree with MR. Caruso Jr. Lanza was the best voice God had to offer if he just had the courage to leave, left Hollywood and sat for the opera. He could have been the American Caruso. Everyone says he could have been, but anyway he is a fantastic introduction to the art form that has no bones on it and if so, it will be so. see the movie you will see why Mr Lanza is still in conversation, even in my home. Someone says Pavarotti, I say MARIO LANZA. As for the movie itself, when it is on DVD, they have to repair it and VHS is not good enough, but it should also be the only Lanza movie on DVD, the other is right and boring right.
