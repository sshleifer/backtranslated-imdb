About 1986 I accidentally watched this movie once on TV. I was 6 years old. It was similar to my accidental show of the terrifying end of Do not Look Now in 1987. I went on holiday in quiet silence in Venice the next year, and hope for God that my parents would not find out I was watching it! <br /> <br /> Would I have thought if my parents knew I was watching Les Valseuses when I was a child? Even today, I will avoid the topic with my dad, and my mother will probably disapprove in the afterlife. I don't know if they want to see it anyway. From stalking and catching a woman in the apartment block in the first scene to sliding the mountain roads with glazed eyes, it is never certain whether this film is an insensitive piece of waste that ignores the sexual revolution or if it is a sexy liberating movie to watch as it comes to you, that you can never be so offensive. <br /> <br /> It's definitely violent. It has a violent view of sex, virtually no recognition of love. Even infant young baby turns into a greedy sexual act of exploitation. But the scenario is very erotic and (god I'm so British) awake! Do they suck her breasts for her own good? This is exploitation. So why do I get a woody? <br /> <br /> Are the fellows looking for an experienced older woman, find an ex-con, mother figure? I do not know. It ends in a truly horrifying suicide. I described it to my friend, JB Nelson, who has Cannibal Holocaust intestines, and he has gone hurray! No maternal love for this movie, rather the opposite. Mutilation of where the boys started. Why are they shooting the girl in the leg? Why does she come back to them? Should women be punished so they can learn what is right for men? <br /> <br /> I think of two movies, of which I wish I had never seen, the other made me wish it wasn't. It's not such a hard world. Wipe away / Madonna who does not calculate a bunch of madness was never so offensive that a woman is being punished for being a slave to man, and that may be Madonna, everyone says respect. Ritchie I'm so furious that I can't use punctuation! Once upon a time In America / Leone god, does it do Noodles? Destroy the path to joy we followed in his life. So close to finally getting love with Deborah. Now they both destroyed. Why Sergio? Why? <br /> <br /> There is no rape in Les Valseuses, but plenty of sex and nudity in abundance from both sexes. Very honest, no titillation. No fantasy slopes, no perfect Hollywood smooth movements. Jokes, yes. But there is too much darkness and jealousy and trickery here to call it a sex comedy. Forget about wearing a naked hairdresser in the leg Cos She will come back & you will climb her with your ex-con Minnaar's Vengeant Son and she'll learn how to get away from him. <br /> <br /> Two things I can't stand are rape movies and jail movies. Les Valseuses is not a rape movie! God, no one is going to see it now! It's a brilliant movie!
