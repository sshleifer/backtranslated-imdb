Hilarious, alluring, confusing, brilliant movie. Remind me of Bunuel's L'Age D'Or or Jodorowsky's Holy Mountain - many strange characters looking around and looking ... what's that? I almost laughed all the way, long held a peripheral eye on the hidden and occasionally horrible reactions of the audience that surrounded me in the theater. Entertain through and through, from the beginning to the intestines and poisoned intestines all the way to the end, if it was an end. I just wish I could remember every detail. It sometimes haunts me. <br /> <br /> Honestly, though, I have only the most positive memories of this movie. As it doesn't seem to be available to go home and watch, I assume I have to wait a few years until Crispin Glover returns with his Big Slide Show (and the next "What is it? ... I saw this film in Atlanta almost immediately after getting involved in a rather devastating car accident, at the time I was slightly dazed, perhaps a very good state of mind to see the prophetic arthropods and the delays in superhero costumes and divine Glover in his appropriate burly-Q environment, rickety dressed girlies flowing from the floor like a wonderful DADAist wet dream. <br /> <br /> Is this a statement about life as we know it? All just art, I rather think the truth is more visible in the absence and in the negative space, what you do not tell is what we have to deduce, but is much more valid than the lies that others tell us day and night Rather one, "What is it?" than 5000 movies like "Tita." nic "or" sleepless in Seattle ". (Shudder, gag, groan). <br /> <br /> Thank you, Mr Glover (also a fun man to watch on the screen or on his big slideshow - smart, funny, peculiar and shamefully hot). Make more movies, write more books, keep the nightmare alive.
