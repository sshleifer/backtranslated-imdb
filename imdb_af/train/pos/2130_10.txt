A wonderful movie, filled with a great underlined display and sharp, intelligent dialogue. What really sets the film apart, however, is the downfall of sadness throughout. The story is underlined by affairs, loneliness, suicide, disappointment, the fear of losing their jobs in a world where it has disastrous consequences. Most of it was cut off in a world that no longer existed at the beginning of World War II. In fact, the movie is hardly a comedy if you compare the percentage of serious scenes with the comics. Still, it's funny - listen to Margaret Sullivan's hard-run Jimmy Stewart dismissal and look at his painful expression as he replied that her commentary was a remarkable blend of poetry and meanness. It's funny, wise and sad. A remarkable achievement and one of the ten largest screen comics ever made.
