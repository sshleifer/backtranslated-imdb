"It's not a love song" is a brilliant example of the chase genre, which many people think has an underlying meaning. The love between the two main characters may be more than brother. I believe Heaton is in love with Spike, but Spike is too naive to see it. <br /> <br /> I really feel it is portrayed with such scenes as the backlash and writing letters. Heaton shows great intimacy towards Spike. With intense facial expressions and how he approves the best Spike's name on top of his letters. <br /> <br /> One thing I noticed when I looked at external reviews is that when the movie was eliminated, the judge didn't fully understand the movie because they didn't even have the possibility of Heaton's sexual feelings for Spike. I also get the feeling that some of the judges didn't recognize it when they used phrases like: "Who is Heaton? What does he do with a retard like Spike?" However, this person may have hit the nail on the head with their comment. Spike shows noticeable signs of having A.D.D, although I don't think this person has realized it, as he uses the word "retard" as a deviant term. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed this movie. Although not for the weak heart. The film is extremely character-based, after the shootings to the end there is not much, but the dialogue between the two anti-heroes. Unless you're used to watching such deep, eager movies, stay away well.
