Doghi is a wonderful movie and Renuka Daftardar is excellent. So is Uttara Baokar which is usually excellent in most of her roles. Along with Kairee, this is an example of Marathi's cinema at its best. There are certain parts in both movies that the didactic tends to. It would probably have improved the movie not to have the few scenes where the social message is hammered. These scenes probably come from the filmmaker's political concern, but the film is realistic. and move enough to not need it. But apart from such minor concerns, it's a movie that is earned to see more and one that I highly recommend. Sumitra Bhave's concern and humanism shines through.
