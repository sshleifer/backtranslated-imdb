It's a very funny movie - and it's NOT a bad thing. It's a combination of a neo-realistic film about the homeless AND a fairy tale. I'm sure some might find this movie a little too strange, but I love it. Once again, this director brings a wonderful role-play of everyday people (not actors) and gets a good ensemble-type performance. Although not as sad as Umberto D, both movies have a very similar point to make - this one does it in a very absurd way. Ignore the exaggerated special effects - it is made in the early 1950s and special effects are not very important anyway (or at least it should not be in movies). Instead, just sit back and enjoy the very strange and stupid ride. Unless you are a total curmudgeon, you will have a ball. <br /> <br /> Incidentally, since I first reviewed this movie, I have seen another DeSica-directed movie that is an absolute must-see and this is THE CHILDREN KNOW US. While it is not a fantasy or light in the spirit like MIRACLE IN MILAN, it is a good movie.
