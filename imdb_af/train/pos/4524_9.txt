This is a very rare example of a movie about transvestitism (of heterosexuals). The film deals with the taboo theme so that even a general audience who does not know transvestitism will feel strongly with its main character. Adrian Pasdar is very credible like Gerald / Geraldine and will not be forgotten for this brilliant act. The direction of Christopher Monger is very sensitive and deals with such a difficult issue quite well, packed in a good story. Not a big movie, not a movie, but a bit of a movie!
