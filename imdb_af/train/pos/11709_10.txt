Now, for all the cinematographic buffers out there, this movie can't see high on your list of things. But if you had something of plot development, profound truth and the intentions of this movie (the series), you would understand my pov. <br /> <br /> Permitted, the details of the movie are writers' versions. , which cannot be expected to know what will eventually happen. But the movie is Bibles accurate and just "frightens" viewers to think about what it may be. I am a Christian, not because of this movie, but because of my personal decision to accept Jesus as my Savior. The film and the potential that something similar to the circumstances portrayed in it can make someone remarkably scared to think about their actions and decisions. It is not a cheap effort to scare people into believing in God, but rather a way to get your attention. <br /> <br /> As a Christian, I know I will not be left behind, and thanks to movies like This, I can explore beyond the superficial performances of entertainment, acting and film budget to appreciate the depth of the film. It is a movie that you must not only see but feel with your heart and soul.
