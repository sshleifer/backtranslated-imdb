Just watched this early Bugs Bunny (the first time he is mentioned here) and Elmer Fudd's cartoon on the ThadBlog as linked from YouTube. It was Chuck Jones' first time the "wascally wabbit" and consequently Bugs has another voice that Mel Blanc offers than the Brooklyn / Bronx one we are more familiar with. In fact, he channeled Jimmy Stewart (his "shy son" type personality of that time). Anyway, after Elmer buys his pet, Bugs all go unpleasant on him by making the radio completely halt and pretend to die after his master throws him repeatedly from his shower and says, "Turn off the lights!" when Elmer gets him in his bed. Even with the different voices, Bugs is definitely his ominous self and I have been laughing blue all the time! According to Thad, there was an additional scene at the end of Elmer, who only gave the house to Bugs after the hell he went through, but it was probably too sad, as he had a mental break at that time, so it's just as good that the scene is cut. is lost. Anyway, I recommend Elmer's Pet Rabbit.
