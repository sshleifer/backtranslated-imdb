Terry Gilliam gives a beautiful movie, which I thoroughly enjoyed. Bruce Willis, Madeline Stowe, Brad Pitt and even the small look of Christover Plummer make the movie absolutely brilliant! This is the only Terry Gilliam movie I've seen, and Twelve Monkeys is definitely in my top 10. I think it's one of the four best Bruce Willis movies; and Brad Pitt's best. Brad Pitt delivers a perfect performance. Perhaps one of the top ten actors' shows I've ever seen. He played his role (Geoffrey) very convincingly. Bruce Willis's role (James Cole) was also very convincing. Both Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt did extremely well. With the brilliant story to give back the great performances; And restrained, Terry Gilliam's wonderful direction.
