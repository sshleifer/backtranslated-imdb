We can still use Black Adder today. Imagine Rowan Atkinson resuming the role of assistant to the prime minister, played by great Hugh Laurie. Hugh is sensational as the drunken Prince George and Edmund as his brilliant assistant. I love the episode that Kenneth Connor guest stars as a British Thespian. Every time Edmund says Macbeth. The two thespians do a stupid little thing to ward off evil spirits. These are the funniest things you'll see. Of course, nothing of this brilliance and comic genius can be without Ben Elton and Richard Curtis, also behind the films such as Love Actually, The Thin Blue Line, Four Weddings and A Funeral. Black Adder is funny and almost too good for television. Humor can be smart, sexy and funny. Last night I hoped on Saturday Night Live that Hugh Laurie would pay him back in British humor. If the gang at SNL did some research, they would know what a treasure was to get Hugh Laurie's favor.
