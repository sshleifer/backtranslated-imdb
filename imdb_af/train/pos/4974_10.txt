It was a wonderful presentation. Hemo (blood) as a Greek god was so well played by animation with vanity, arrogance, snobbish superiority and innocent wonder. The quote (or scene) I see is when Hemo tapes of "all this plumber ... you have not taught my secrets" and threaten to storm out, the scientist answers him in one word "Thalassa" salt water that scares the fiction writer, but eases and talks to Hemo in the chemical aspects of blood. <br /> <br /> Such a wonderful blend of entertainment and information makes it a classic as fresh and exciting today as the day it was released. To stimulate interest and imagination is essential to teach children to love learning.
