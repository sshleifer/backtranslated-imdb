Artisticly speaking, it is a beautiful film - cinematography, music and costumes are beautiful. In fact, this movie is nicer than those that Akira Kurasawa himself regulates. In this case, he just wrote the movie, as it was several years after his death. <br /> <br /> As far as the writing goes, the dialogue was well written and the story was sometimes interesting. However, the story was also quite depressed in some respects, yet it is unfinished. This is the story of a group of women working in a brothel. Interestingly, while prostitution was considered a much more acceptable business in Japan, women were longing for a better life. It reminds me a lot of the movie Streets Of Shame, although Streets Of Shame's characters are much less fun and more one-dimensional. <br /> <br /> So, generally, it gets a 7 - mostly because of everything BUT's writing. It's too bad that the worst link in this movie is the story of the great Kurasawa.
