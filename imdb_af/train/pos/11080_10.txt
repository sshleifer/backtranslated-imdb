First, when people hear 'GUY RITCHIE', they immediately think of SNATCH. Yes, Snatch was a good movie, but the problem is that everyone associates Guy Ritchie with Snatch. They do not expect him to investigate new boundaries. This movie REVOLVER is different from snatch; it is much darker and is very complex. The reason I gave a score of 10 is because I had to watch Revolver 3 times to understand everything. So this movie toy with your head. It is very cleverly written. <br /> <br /> This movie is different from Snatch. It's done wonderfully, cinematography is beautiful, and you can recognize Guy Ritchie's personal touch (style of directing) in it. <br /> <br /> What won me was the complexity of the protagonist and how we left more questions than answers.
