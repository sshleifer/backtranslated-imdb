Be careful with this one. Once you get it on, it will change the way you look at kung-fu flicks. You will now desire a plot of all the kung-fu movies, you will want character depth and development, you will be mysterious and unpredictable, you will demand dynamic camera work and incredible backgrounds. Unfortunately, you won't get all these things together in one kung-fu movie, except for Five Deadly Venoms! <br /> <br /> Easily the best kung-fu movie of all time, Venoms mixes a rich plot, full of twists and turns, with colorful (and developed) characters, along with some of the best camera work from the 70's come. The success of someone holding the movie depends on the viewer's ability to decipher what character, and who specializes in which poison. One is the Centipede, two are the Snake, three are the Scorpio, four are the Lizard, and five are the Path. Each character has different characteristics, characteristics, strengths and weaknesses. In it lies the hook, we learn with the student character, to find out who these different men seem to be. We are in his shoes (so to speak), and we have to choose who we trust and who we do not, just like him. We learn with him. <br /> <br /> Not only is the plot, the characters and the camera work good, but it is also fun to see what makes my book more valuable than almost any other movie of its kind. It's worth taking quite a few clocks on everything that goes on. Venoms is a lesson about what kung-fu really can do ... don't expect many other kung-fu movies to live on it.
