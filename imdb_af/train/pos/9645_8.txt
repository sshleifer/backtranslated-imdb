'Presque rien' is a story of two young boys who fall in love during the summer at sea. I don't want to tell the plot because it's not the most important of this movie (but you can be sure it's interesting and original). The best part of this movie is the movies. The visual side of 'Presque rien' is so amazing, it deserves the highest note. It leaves your charm with its beauty. <br /> <br /> Regarding the plot, it is shown in an uneven, complicated way. There is no simple chronology, and there are no answers to all the questions the movie brings. But it makes 'Presque rien' even more interesting. I recommend this movie to all the people for whom the artistic side of movies is very important and they will not be disappointed.
