It is not a criticism of the film, but rather a comment on how blind we are in our own past. <br /> <br /> I recently watched Winter Soldier, and the ground truth was like watching a remake or prosecution - except it was about Iraq rather than Vietnam. Similar to Winter Soldier because of his one-sided message, both films illustrate how joyfully we are in a hurry to get involved in conflicts based on false pretenses, and let us young and brave (and often naive) bear the brunt of this greedy war benefit. Both films effectively show that the mindset in the minds of the young and willing is forced to make their effective killers, but the training falls short of the diplomatic and police skills needed to keep the hearts and minds of the people they are supposed to. , to win effectively. fight for. It is ultimately what has lost the war in Vietnam and will probably also lose the war in Iraq. <br /> <br /> My only negative comment is that the movie is so one-sided, it can easily be conveyed as left-wing propaganda. Not by me, but only for those who aim to discredit the film and the message. A more balanced view will speak to a larger audience.
