I never watched the 'Next Action Hero' show, and until I read the other comments here, I didn't know that this movie was the 'prize' of that competition. I just swung channels and looked at this, and I looked at myself, dared to end. <br /> <br /> Yes, the plot was done (The most dangerous game, etc.), but I was hoping for, and almost receiving, the 'gotcha' - how the protagonist would eventually hit the hunter. I think the high technology was exaggerated (GPS's) and gave my cold sweat flashbacks from Night Rider, but it was not overdoing it. <br /> <br /> The basic problem I had with this movie was the degree of SOD required by the viewer. Do we really think that someone flying in a helicopter can turn on countless fuel troughs on a public bridge and show NO COPS to investigate? Can a limousine do countless donuts in a Las Vegas crossing and NO COPIES? Pleeease. Too much of that kind of thing - fun to watch, but at least keep it, thank you. <br /> <br /> The final solution was good, but the end was disappointing, with the aftertaste of a bad Star Trek episode. At least now I understand why the acting was so cheesy - except for Zane, who didn't get as much work as he earned IMHO. They were winners of a reality program. <br /> <br /> Beat me out.
