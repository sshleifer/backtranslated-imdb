In the early 1970s, many of us who accepted hippie / acid / alternative culture realized that mainstream society would not change as we thought it was. For me, this movie has the tension of "now what?" Defined. that many of the people I knew at the time felt. Do we weep for the congregation and create our own vision of utopia or do we radicalize and push for change? <br /> <br /> From the futile gestures to the police, the radical rhetoric, the music of Pink Floyd, to love and the explosive images in the desert - so much is there. It catches an important moment in time.
