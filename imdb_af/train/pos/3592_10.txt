Another powerful chick fly. This time it turns to Diana Gusman, who is always up for grabs. Instead of being expelled, she takes her anger elsewhere to the boxing ring. She practices to be a boxer and meets his featherweight Adrian and begins to fall in love with him. This movie has a powerful message to take your dreams and go with them, even if someone doesn't believe in you. In this case, her father does not believe in her. That alone makes the movie worth the price. enjoy
