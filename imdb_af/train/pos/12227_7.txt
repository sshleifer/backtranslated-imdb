I searched this one after seeing the hilarious and linguistically challenging "Clueless" (1995), perhaps Alicia Silverstone's best-known attempt of early in her film career. "True Crime" has Kevin Dillon, who would help improve most movie projects. In fact, everyone in the throw does a good job. The only disappointment I think the movie has for me is an uncomfortable feeling for some of the scenes. It comes from the need to perform a fairly compromised, mature theme as part of what begins in the scene as a schoolgirl adventure. /> Alicia Silverstone is pretty good at this one. She does well the na√Øve enthusiasm and growing discomfort affecting Maria Giordano while maneuvering to the truth behind serial killings. I think her characterization of MG also has a few kilometers in it. The conclusion of the story line is that she has a career in law enforcement. It can be really interesting for an older Silverstone to visit Giordano in a crisis later in the official's life. Just a thought! <br /> <br /> "True Crime" shows his director in a good light. Pat Verducci also has the writing credit. I don't know of any other film work done by PV. I can only wonder what happened after so many promising beginnings. <br /> <br /> Like most productions, this one has a largely unknown supporting role, although Detective Jerry Guinn (Bill Nunn) is hardly so. Over the past decade, he has apparently ensured an impressive number of display displays. I remember him recently in "Carriers" (1998), a military-themed TV show. Bill Nunn played "Captain Arends". Fans of the classic American TV comedy show "Who's the Boss" may also have an interest in "Carriers" because the leading player is Judith Light, remembered by much love by many because of her long involvement in the show. <br /> <br /> "True crime" can't easily work, but it does. I think it's an entertaining story worth seeing.
