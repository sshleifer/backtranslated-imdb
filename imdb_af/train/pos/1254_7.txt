Ed Harris's work in this film is to his usual standard of excellence, that is, he steals the screen away from anyone with whom he shares it, and includes the formidable Sean Connery. The film, which is more than a little sacred, only appears when Harris is questioned by another lawyer for another offender. It's awesome, a master class in artistic control. <br /> <br /> The other role-players are all skilled and Connery is trustworthy, just like Fishbourne, but the story itself doesn't bother. The plot largely depends on the assumption that a black prisoner will always be abused and pursued by white law enforcement officers. This is the engine that manages the story right or wrong, and lets one be at the end of the story. <br /> <br /> Worth seeing Harris in action.
