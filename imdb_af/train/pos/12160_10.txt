A great understated black comedy, best in a series of Grand Guignol movies to follow 'Baby Jane'. Reynolds and Winters are mothers of young guilty murderers (a nod to 'Compulsion') running away in Hollywood. They run a school for a movie-toss, a bunch of hilariously untalented children attended by horrible stage mothers. Debbie, in her blonde wig ('I'm a Harlow, you're more of a Marion Davies says she tells Winters) leads the tots at their concert and wins a rich dad, Weaver. She also does a nice funny tango and above all gives an excellent performance, unlike what she did before. The atmosphere is a delicate mix of comic and ominous. It looks great with good time details (30's). A lot of beautiful swaps at Hollywood and the scary movie. Micheal MacLiammoir has a ball as the drama coach: "Hamilton Starr", he boasts, "two rs but prophetically nonetheless". See it and love it.
