I think this is a good example of the differences between two cultures. It would be a good movie to show in a sociology class. I thought it was pretty funny and I have to say that I'm a sucker for "letting band work and getting the job done" plot device. It seems most people do not realize that this movie is not just a comedy. It also has some dramatic elements in me and I think they blend nicely together. Overall, I give it a solid 8.
