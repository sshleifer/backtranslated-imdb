"Bruce Almighty" looks and sounds incredibly stupid, especially from the trailers. Nevertheless, I found a deeper message in it that actually made me more like this movie. Bruce (Jim Carrey) is angry with God and is given to him to be divine powers for a week to see if he can do a better job. Morgan Freeman plays a man who is symbolized here as God, and although it is not his usual kind of movie or one of his best roles, he does great with what he is given to work with. Although it is sometimes rough, the film has quite a few laughs, from Bruce shedding his soup in half as the Red Sea and the client's reaction to him, as well as Freeman's seemingly retracted and wasteful image of God. It's too exaggerated, and there's a bit of rude humor, but overall it's a bit funny. There is a decent supportive role, such as Jennifer Aniston, Lisa Ann Walter, and Steve Carrell, who always help. The end of the movie seems to be very romantic and tearful, and the message is clear, that we must do what God has called us to do and "be the miracle". The film is far from perfect but still enjoyable, and much better than I and many people would have expected, especially if we see the deeper message of the movie. <br /> <br /> *** ** **
