This is a "B Series" Film Noir, and my voice reflects his membership in that genre. I watched this movie last night at a left bank theater in Paris, where it opened a two-week movie noir. The movie has some flaws, yes, but too much fun to ignore. <br /> <br /> As the previous reviewer noted, the drumming scene is amazing! (B-movies can trap where A-movies were forbidden to enter!) And that plot is intriguing. However, as far as Franchot Tone is concerned, I ask to disagree: for me, he is properly secretive; just the right shade of creepy. One should keep in mind that there is a kind of German expressionism (the director, Robert Siodmark, was a German who came in Hollywood in the war) and such an air of exaggeration fits the whole film. At least it's for me. <br /> <br /> However, it is the beautiful Ella Raines who enchanted this viewer throughout her film in her third credited performance. A "Girl Friday" type with a strong resemblance to Gene Tierney is a wonder she has not become a household name. But she is so good here that I just ordered another movie from her ('Impact') from the internet, and I can't wait to see it too.
