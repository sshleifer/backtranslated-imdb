Zero Day is a film that few people have seen and what is a shame. <br /> <br /> When I saw the end, where the two main characters descended into the room and killing people ruthlessly, they committed suicide, and that grabbed me by my stomach. I shook, that's how strong this movie is. <br /> <br /> The movie is great. It's not amazing to get a perfect ten. It is sad that so few people understand the true beauty of this movie. It's not a budget that makes a movie good, it's the amount of feeling the makers put into it that makes it good. <br /> <br /> It makes a permanent impression in your mind that you simply can't get out. It makes you realize the real horror of shooting, especially if you know that person, and this movie makes you feel like you know these people. <br /> <br /> I recommend Zero Hour to those who feel they are mature enough to see it. I'm fourteen, and I feel this movie is just too wonderful to come into words. It feels like you're watching something that actually happened.
