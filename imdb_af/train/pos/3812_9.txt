This is a real eyecup. A world of waving islands and old cities. Big monsters whose preferred method of attack dropping the cathedrals on their opponents ... Who can resist it? An ancient prophecy, a bunch of heroines and a cute princess looking for her hero ... sound familiar ...? Yes, we heard that song before. But you will forget about it while watching the spectacular scenery. <br /> <br /> This movie is fun to watch while it lasts. But after you leave the movie, you'll long for a little more story. <br /> <br /> What's behind the 30-year-old circle? What did the knight get? Who built all these wonderful monuments, castles and cities ... and why did they fall apart? And besides those one bunch of farmers, where are the people? Really, this picture looks so intriguing, but it's not Lord of the Rings.
