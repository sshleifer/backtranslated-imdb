I thought this movie was very well composed. The voices were also wonderful. I liked how they all conquered their conflicts and achieved their goals. I would recommend this movie to anyone. It was definitely worth seeing the time and money. Atlantis has some comic scenes that made me laugh. Other scenes made me sad. And others made me happy. It's a movie that can enjoy any age. From the moment Milo is the crazy "prophet" or until he gathers the crew for the fantastic journey under the sea. After watching the movie, I read the book. It was also good, but the movie is better in your mind. It's just like the book. But go ahead and watch this movie!
