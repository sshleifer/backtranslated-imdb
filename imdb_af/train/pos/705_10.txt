I got an Insomniac's Nightmare while looking for unpaid independent movies, and glad to say it didn't disappoint. This crazy half-hour ride has made me wonder all the way through, and the end was excellent - one of those NOOOOO moments that really stays with you. I showed it to a number of people and everyone looks like hands. The little ghost girl was very talented and I think her performance stole the show. She crawled the shit out of me, I can say so much. Nanavati did a good job of compiling this brief. All the pieces just fell and you can say that she is a good writer of what she did with this script. Well written. This is undoubtedly the strongest part of the movie. The directing was great and the acting was nice, but the key factor here is the strength of the script. Good work for this girl, I can't wait to see more!
