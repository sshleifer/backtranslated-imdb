I love playing soccer and I thought this movie was good because it contains a lot of football in it. It was a good Hollywood / Bollywood movie and I'm glad it won 17 awards. Parminder Nagra and Kiera Knightley were good and it was also Archie Punjabi. Jonathon Rheyes Meyers was great at playing the coach. Jazz (Parminder Nagra) likes to play football, but her parents want her to learn how to cook and want her to marry. When Jazz secretly plays for a soccer team, she meets Juliet (Kiera Knightlety) and Joe (Jonathon Rhyes Meyers) who is her coach. When her parents find out there are problems, her father can play the big game at her sister Pinky (Archie Punjabi's) wedding. In the end, her parents realize how much they like football and let her go abroad to play.
