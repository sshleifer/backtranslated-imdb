MULHOLLAND DRIVE made me the definitive fan of David Lynch. He's a modern genius, because he's not just a movie maker. His stories and style have a game that crosses the screen. So the direct story was a surprise to me, with its story and sunny sets. Still, Lynch is there, and while it's far from its best, it's a must-have movie. Let Richard Farnsworth's performance be one of the reasons. <br /> <br /> 8/10
