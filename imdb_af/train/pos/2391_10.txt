My husband and I enjoy the DoodleBops as much as our 8 month old baby does. We bought him DVDs and CDs, just so we can watch for ourselves and listen to them. They are fun, energetic and very entertaining. They encourage children to be active, sharing and caring. They always have a positive message with fun entertainment. Every time our son hears the theme song, he quickly turns his head to the television and starts excitement. Dee Dee is a wonderful singer, she has a good voice. Tired is a good dancer. I would recommend the DoodleBops to everyone with children. Our favorite song is The Bird Song. You just can't help but smile and want to dance when you hear it.
