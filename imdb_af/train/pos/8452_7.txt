Over-powered mobile packs that can erase entire armies - See! Weapons that should not necessarily be aimed at and still destroy everything - Look! Angels mobile packages - Look! <br /> <br /> OK - it's a Gundam series. This one, Gundam Wing, has good character development, real-world complexity, interesting ideas and some beautiful eye-candy. <br /> <br /> With characters, the initially poor Relena Dorlan (later Peacecraft, then back to Dorlan) gets stronger and more independent (though still quite busy with Heero Yuy, the main character series). The aforementioned Heero, initially a cold, hard butcher, is becoming more and more human, while still remaining in character. And to see the lost Millardo Peacecraft (whose numbers are the guerre, Zechs Marquise) who moves between OZ, freelance and White Fang's command shows how some people can really lose themselves in their own creations. <br /> <br /> The complexity of the political and military situation is also quite good. It reflects how the real world works. In 49 half-hour episodes, however, it becomes a bit of a liability as this complexity is not used to its full potential. <br /> <br /> The core ideas - the necessity of fighting, the desire for peace, etc. - are those who even resonate today. In retrospect, the series was ahead of his time, with the "War on Terrorism" and all. But exploring these ideas, the monologues, especially those of Treize Kushrenada, is an incredibly dramatic piece that forms some of the best writing in the series. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, however, good writing is sometimes extremely poor. , which causes it to lose dramatically from its edge. <br /> <br /> In terms of eye candy, what is the one in bucketloads, everything from the phone fits the battleship Libra (No, not the tampons not your idiot!) are pits designed, and explode in big orange orange balls (which is bad, because better animation would have had better explosions). But who cares ?! Stuff explodes, and that's all that matters. <br /> <br /> In short, the mere complexity of the series means that if you miss a few episodes, you have missed a lot. The poor writing can make you ring, and sometimes the animation makes you 'WTF?!?!' But it is made up of its classic animation style, its scale, sparks of incredible dialogue, and its more mature exploration expected from such Japanese animations.
