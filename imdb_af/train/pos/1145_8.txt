It's a romantic comedy with the emphasis on comedy for a change. As usual, the lovers - Sally Field as almost over-the-mountain soap opera queen, Celeste Talbert; and Kevin Kline as abused and marginal talented actor, Jeffrey Anderson - works in cross-purposes, seemingly unaware that they are in love, etc. Because of Bette Davis' Margo Channing in About Eva (1950) and a whole lot of the slapstick theatrical tradition, Sally Field goes over to the hilarity because she malaprops her way to love and happiness. Kevin Kline, one of the more disadvantaged leading men of the past year, is also very good and much won because at the same time he is attractive, vulnerable, selfish and loving. <br /> <br /> The misadventure center About Celeste's fear of losing her hearing as she entered her forties and reaching the crisis, with the arrival of her cousin, aspiring actress Cori Craven (Elisabeth Shue) who seems to be NOT a cousin, with consequent complications. Cori succeeds in getting a small role in the soap opera as a deaf-deaf dumb before she discovers her true relationship with Celeste (and also Jeffrey Anderson) - but never cares. <br /> <br /> As a romantic counterpoint or foil leading Robert Downey Jr. (soap opera director, David Barnes) and Cathy Moriarty (Montana and Nurse Nan). David Barnes is so hot for her, but she only gives one thing: to get rid of Celeste so she can shine more clearly on the set. For this reason, she gets Barnes to do all sorts of things to destroy Celeste's career, but by chance and / or perverse logic all his efforts go wrong, to the pleasure of the viewer. <br /> <br /> Whoopie Goldberg plays Rose Schwartz, the show's lead writer and Celeste's alter ego and confidant, while Carrie Fisher plays a modest role as the stubborn manufacturer of the show. <br /> <br /> I thought it was nicer than the Another Spoof of the Soap Operator World I saw (Young Doctors in Love 1982, who delivered the TV hospital's general hospital and that was relatively good). Soapdish is more fun with a daffy script and lots of laugh-out loud one-liners and fantastic performances by Field, Kline and Downy, Jr. But see this for Sally Field which is outstanding.
