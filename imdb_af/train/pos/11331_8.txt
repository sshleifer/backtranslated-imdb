I'm not normally obliged to write a review for a movie, but the only comment for this movie so far is rather unfair. I need to share my point of view. <br /> <br /> "Krisana" (or as it was at the theater, I saw it, "Fallen"), follows Matiss, a lonely Lets archivist, while trying to learn about a woman he didn't try to stop from a bridge. its reasons for this. This is the plot in a nutshell, but this movie is not worried about the story, but the guilt of a man who failed to act. As a detective examines the incident, he tells us that we usually don't care about the anonymous faces we pass each day until they die. <br /> <br /> Equations with Michaelango Antonioni and his "Blowup" will be the most. probably abound in any review you read about "Krisana." The influence of Antonioni's philosophical and rigorous style and the story of "Blowup" is clear and in fact, writer / director Fred Kelemen makes a clear reference to the film in scenes in which Matiss tries to push the woman who jumped from the jumps get to know. bridge or at least who he thought. <br /> <br /> The only other person sharing his or her views on the film contradicts the film and the sound of the film college. He or she fails to consider the budget constraints faced by an existential Latvian film, but the atmospheric black and white cinematography and surrounding sound succeed at artistic level to portray the loneliness of Matiss. The background sound of wind and street sounds lends an ominous aura and reminds one of a Fellini movie whether it was Kelemen's intention or not. The filmmakers undoubtedly had little money, but this limitation is used for the film's benefit. <br /> <br /> "Krisana" succeeds as a character study with enough humor being thrown in to make it not too serious. It could easily have fallen into the bumps of a mystery story, but it avoids it and becomes an intelligent movie about loneliness and guilt. If you are more concerned with plot, this movie and its end can frustrate you. Otherwise, take the time to get involved. It's good to find out.
