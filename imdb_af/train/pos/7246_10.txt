This movie is completely ridiculous. Not only is the plot terrifying, but the play is terrible. The special effects are asinine and the whole movie is in a post-apocalyptic desert. Yet it is by far the most entertaining movie ever given permission to be produced. It is 101 minutes of laughing because we all know there will be no fuel in the year 3000 or any El Camino's. There are also other aspects that I will not spoil, just because it makes the movies so wonderful. I recommend this movie just because of its total idiot. I have no idea who will see it if it expects a high quality feature, but as a good laugh you need, see Exterminators of the Year 3000!
