"A Bug's Life" is like a favorite treat. It is full of small pieces that make something tasty. <br /> <br /> The story couldn't have been better; It's smart, has "heart" (emotion), and every character has a nice "bow" (a growth or change). For comparison, the only characters in "Toy Story" to have a "bow" are Buzz, who learns to love being a toy, and Woody, who overcomes Buzz's resentment. There are many laughs and cute moments in "A Bug's Life". All the actors turn in great voice, and the animation, both movement and detail, is wonderful. <br /> <br /> This serious movie buffer doesn't throw a "10" s, but this movie definitely deserves the "10" I gave.
