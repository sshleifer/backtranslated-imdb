It is indeed a funny show done in a creepy way, much like a Tim Burton movie. It is worth a look, as it is much more creative than most of the shows this season. Best of all, it's not a "reality" show. I wonder why the viewing public is so ready to ignore such shows (which lack creativity) and ignore wonderful programs like this that have actually been creative. <br /> <br /> While some deny the premise, I think it's very unusual. Much more enjoyable than "Ghost Whisperer" and "Medium". I think it's the funniest thing on the tube, since "My Name is Earl". <br /> <br /> Oh, and the narration and music is wonderful. If you enjoy shows that are a little out of the way, I would recommend it. It's not as strange as Twin Peaks, but it has a serious twist on it.
