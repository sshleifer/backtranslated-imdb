What a perfect example of "Less Is More ..." Kurt Russell (Sgt. Todd) has just 72 lines, and something like 104 words. What a challenge! Like a black and white photo, when your mind needs to fill the spaces, the facial expressions, the physical drama, the emotional gesture combine to make a stronger impact. It's one of those top 5 movies I can't live with right there with the classic Road Warrior. If you like this, check out Mad Max 2, The Road Warrior and Braveheart, who have both Mel Gibson's lead roles. Also "Gladiator" with Russell Crowe and Connie Nielsen who were also in Soldier. The "Thirteenth Warrior" with Antonio Banderas and Blade Runner with Harrison Ford.
