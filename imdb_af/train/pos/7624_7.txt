A little memorable movie of the variety of animal murderers, specifically similar to "Willard", because it is an aging character actor (in this case a bit to the level of Les Tremayne, which only distinguishes performance I saw him in a role as a man whose life is unbalanced and who then decides to use his animal friends to give revenge to those who have wronged him. Yes, this is one of those movies where everyone is very despicable, so you will get courage when they die, and really the choice of actors, places, etc. Can't do better to give the film an atmosphere of loose decadence. <br /> <br /> Tremayne's character is "Snakey Bender" and he is definitely the most interesting thing about the movie: an older snake collector who is occupied with John Philip Souza's music. When the local minister gathers his practice of gathering small animals from local schoolchildren as bait for his snakes, and his friend is married to a stripper (who disrupts his ritual Wednesday evening concert), he is in the process of "Creating" an unforgettable accumulation of clunkers under the cliff where he sheds the wreck after throwing away their unfortunate owners. An entertaining game that you can play while watching "snakes" is to place bets on which cars will place the furthest in the cliff. <br /> <br /> Overall, very inexpensive and exploitative, but will really be a lot of fun for fans of this kind of movies.
