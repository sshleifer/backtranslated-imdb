Anyone who loves the music of Rostostatika will enjoy this movie. I have a few small complaints, especially about pacing and the casting of some actors (not Maury) who aren't really convincing in their roles, but I don't have time to write a detailed review. I just want to warn someone who saw this movie or plans to see this movie as the CBC television in Canada is offering. The version offered by the CBC is like the Reader's Digest version of WHALE MUSIC --- look. It cuts out entire scenes and subplots (if you can) from the movie. The CBC, which left most of the films untouched, took half of the guts from WHALE MUSIC. I do not know why. It's terrible what they did to the movie. Rent the video or watch it in a theater, but don't watch it on CBC television.
