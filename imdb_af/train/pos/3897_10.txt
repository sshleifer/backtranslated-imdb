This video was my first exposure to Eddie Izzard. We had several friends for more than one night and worked through the channel for some reason during the night for HBO. Someone named "Eddie Izzard" was on. I tried not to laugh too hard at the first few jokes. I didn't want to be held responsible for the rest of the group's enjoyment of something that killed me naturally. After I was laughing at myself for more than healthy, I let go - just like the rest of us (we weren't stoned, by the way, either from insurance or pensions). We were smothered afterwards. The story lines, the plot, the bizarre but ingenious connections throughout the sketches, are nothing short of. I've been addicted to every Eddie-Izzard piece of comedy I can get. His work is pure genius. His comedy seems effortless. He looks more like that hysterically-funny friend hanging around your house and walking around this or that thing ... It's convulsively funny. He gives you the impression that the joke is between you. And himself, the only true aficionados of humor. If you are disappointed in this video, you have no sense of the penultimate in humor or humor, as they say in the UK.
