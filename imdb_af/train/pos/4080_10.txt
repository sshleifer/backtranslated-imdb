It is one of the best animated family movies of all time. In addition, almost all the serious competitors for this title came from the same creative mind of Hiyao Miyazaki and his Studio Ghibli. Specifically, other major films include "My Neighbor Totoro" and "Kikki's Delivery Service." Spirited Away is pretty good, but a bit too creepy for typical family fees - better for teenagers and adults. The one thing "Laputa: Castle in the Sky" sets apart from other films by Miyazaki is that it's much more of a thrilling adventure ride. <br /> <br /> Why is this movie so good? Because it's a complete package: the animation is very well done, and the story is truly engaging and compelling. <br /> <br /> Most Japanese anime is imaginative, but definitely dark or cynical or violent; and the animation itself is often jerky, stylized and youthful. None of these problems plague Castle in the air. It has imagination to burn, and the characters are well-drawn, as well as slightly exaggerated versions of realistic people. (None of those trenches are wearing bags). There is a lot of adventure, but not blood and gore. The animation is composed of smooth, detailed, and cinematic ally - not very flat shots. The background is wonderful. <br /> <br /> The voice that appears in the printed English version is the first time, especially the two leaders, Pazo (James Van der Beek) and Sheeta (Anna Paquin). Sound engineering is also good. Use your studio sound if you have it. <br /> <br /> One thing I particularly liked was that many of the back stories were left inexplicable. Laputa was once inhabited, and is now deserted. Why? We never know. We know as much as we need to know, and then we just have to accept the rest, which is easy to do because the invented world is so well-realized. Indeed, it is fair to say that the world is more fully realized than most small characters, which are mostly one-dimensional stock characters (eg, Gruff general, silly sidekick, kooky old miner, etc.) Recommended for people between the ages of 6 and 60 !
