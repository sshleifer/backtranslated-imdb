The movie gets me stamp of approval. The scene in the museum requires it to act without dialogue. It is one of the most interesting and unique scenes in the history of the film. Dickinson's character Kate is very well developed and her performance is felt throughout the film. The best work, Angie Dickinson, has done since Point Blank!
