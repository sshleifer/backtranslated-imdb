I enjoyed this movie. Never seen Andy Griffith and felt he was perfectly fit for this role. I associated him with comedy, but I am happy to see that he is versatile. <br /> <br /> I wasn't worried that Dotty's "anxiety disorder" might not have been verbatim of a psychiatric handbook. There are zillions of what-phobias and neuroses, and this can take on a wide variety of quantitative and qualitative forms. She is clearly sensitive with extra sensory powers as understood by the local Indians, but not by any Anglos. It is not surprising that this character is vulnerable and nominally eccentric. <br /> <br /> Although considered a light "family movie", it is more sophisticated than it seems. Also, Hiram's turn at the end pointed me to a pleasant surprise and tied up all the preceding action together. It is nice to consider the possibility of such spiritual guidance.
