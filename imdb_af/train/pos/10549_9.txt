I just saw it at the Toronto Film Festival, and I hope it gets wide release because I want to see it again! It's a character-driven movie, and Andrew and David are more than the task. Any discussion of the plot can be considered <br /> <br /> as spoilers, so I'll just say the storyline is clever, the play is great and the effects are great. Well filmed and also good-natured. One of the best movies I've seen in the ages, and very refreshing in this summer of sad <br /> <br /> movies. It laughed the audience all the time. See it if you can. (I especially liked the "Candy bar! Candy bar!" Scene.)
