I think Dark Angel is wonderful! First season was excellent and had a good plot. With Max (Jessica Alba) as an escaped X-5, manticore creation, trying to adapt to a normal life but still saving the world. And it is chased by manticore throughout the season, giving the range of extra extra spices. <br /> <br /> However, the second season suddenly became a bit strange compared to the first. The plot has disappeared, and the series has lost some of its charm, mostly due to all the strange "creatures" that occur. Don't get me wrong, the second season is good, but with a bit too much of the "manticores". However, they managed to come back to a new promising plot in the closing episodes of season 2, in which I had a lot of hope to see more. <br /> <br /> So I really wish they could start making new episodes. And with James Cameron behind it can't go wrong. So, as a conclusion, I would say it's a good series, but I still hope for a third season!
