With all of the "Adult" in today's family flies, it's great to see one you don't need to worry about and just sit back and enjoy a family with your kids. Yes, this movie may have some swear words (there is that time when Knox swears, but they don't let you hear the full words), but the movie is mostly as clean as they come (and includes movies from back in that day). Not only that, it's very enjoyable, one of my favorites, and just a great clean and fun movie to watch with the family. <br /> <br /> The only thing I have against this movie is that it is too short and I wish there would be more of some of the unforgettable parts in it, I wouldn't call them not because I don't want a spoil here. <br /> <br /> All in all well done and a great movie to watch; So go out and get the kids, make some cookies, and watch this movie!
