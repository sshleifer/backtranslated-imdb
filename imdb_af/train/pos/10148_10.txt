I would have given this movie a few stars, simply because it was a "lifelong" presentation that was actually filmed in the place featured in the story. Here, New York City. Most on this channel, whether there is a "set" there in rural Iowa, Oregon, Virginia, LA, etc., is filmed in Vancouver, Ottawa, Toronto or another Canadian region. <br /> <br /> But if ever one earns the highest rating - 10 * on this site, this is this movie. Certainly not for originality, because this story is many times, in many variations, with many very similar to this particular one. It's also done fairly frequently on the big screen, with mega stars, past and present, from Cary Grant, James Garner, Harrison Ford, Tom Hanks, et al - and Deborah Kerr, Doris Day, Meg Ryan, and more . I can think at least 10-12 more, just as prominently, past, from the top of my head, which can now be added, and there are probably many others that can be kept in mind. <br /> <br /> Not to be drunk, but my point is that I think it's by far one of the best of this genre. I caught it on a half day on a Friday when I just had the TV because I took a few hours to a particularly hectic week. I will never run over this movie in the 8 years since it was made. And while the two leaders did enough to be best known, they were completely unknown to me. The only two actors I knew were Phyllis Newman (Anna's mother) who I saw from her younger days in some things, and Michael Rispoli (Henry, Charlie's best friend) who was outstanding as Gramma, the threatening juice loan. , streetman of "Rounders." <br /> <br /> The casual encounter and link between both leads' best friends, as a sub-story romance, correlating them so that Anna and Charlie are only revealed later, is often done Plot contrivance within the genre, but no matter the pleasure here (it actually increases it). <br /> <br /> To see other comments, I totally agree with those who are the most positive. The primary word this movie describes is INSERTED, in caps. This adjective describes the artists; the characters; the chemistry between and among all the characters, in whatever combination, and all the supporting and even less important roles. <br /> <br /> I love movies with a "louder edge" "Rounders;" the escapist Schwarzenegger / Stallone fare; "Goodfellows;" even the classic like "Casablanca", "Gone With the Wind," "Citizen Kane." But for pure, uncomplicated enjoyment, this one was outstanding. With a mere break from their budgets, it was similar to the results achieved by "You've Got Mail" and "Sleepless in Seattle." And Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan couldn't have done better than Natasha Henstridge and Michael Vartan here; The co-stars and support staff here were similar to those in these mega films.
