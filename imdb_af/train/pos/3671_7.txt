"Hollywood North" is a euphemism of the film industry, as they went to Canada to make films due to taxes and cheaper costs in a civilized city like Toronto, in this case, later in Vancouver. Peter O'Brian, the director, probably saw many of California's invaders that this movie is the right way to deal with the upcoming personalities who are trying to capitalize on the economy offered by Canada. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, "Moon Lantern", the successful novel written by a Canadian writer, is featured in "Flight to Bogota", which has nothing to do with the original movie. A major selfish, Michael Baytes, who is obsessed with what is happening in Iran, is being given the lead, which is a disaster. <br /> <br /> The movie seems to say too much. Cooks spoiled the broth, apparently the ultimate product, which is saved by its manufacturer, Bobby Myers. With the help of Sandy Ryan, who is about to make a documentary film shot in Toronto, parts of the film are eventually transformed into a coherent film. <br /> <br /> The filming process is hilarious, and the acting is generally good.
