A neat 'race against time' premise - A murdered John Doe has a pneumonic plague, so while the health authority and NOPD are all fighting and trying to find their waterfront contacts, the murderers believe the heat is because the victim Infected cousin is out of them. <br /> <br /> This movie is freely available from the Internet Archive and it's worth loading.

There is also a lot of background noise, which is slightly distracting - car horns in the love scene, somebody? There are many non-professional supportive artists in crowd scenes, and this may explain why the pacing of the movie is a bit soft to start - not much chance of retrieval or review, although the last chase is worth the effort. love. There is not much wrong with the main actors: Jack Palance is really scary as a charismatic, intelligent psychopath. The later scene that he alternately comforts and threatens is the sick cousin's tremendous, while Widmark, as he often does, is the righteous rage of The man on a mission on a credible level - most of the time. <br /> <br /> Someone needs repeating it - no supernatural, no mysticism, no special FX, just a good yarn full of character conflict and a topical theme. Another reviewer mentioned the author John Kennedy O'Toole, and it is striking with the number of weird balls. New Orleans kisses this dark, messy, anti-click drama. There is even a midget newspaper salesman. <br /> <br /> "Community? What community? You think you're living in the Middle Ages?"
