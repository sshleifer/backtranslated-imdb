It's hard to think that this movie is based on a true story, and how Christy managed to accomplish the miracle is so sad. Daniel Day-Lewis is a chameleon, very hard to imagine how much effort he has made to create this handicapped character. Watching him on the screen is a shocking and breathtaking experience. <br /> <br /> The movie is not as pessimistic as I thought before, the story is so bright and intriguing. Christy is not despised by normal, his life is also colorful and beautiful, although we may be aware of the loneliness and painful fat of his eyes. <br /> <br /> One important factor in Christy's success is his mother's support. more touching, and the unknown actress, Brenda Fricker, also earns her Oscar award for this role. This fat, small, middle-aged woman uses her all to make Christy's dream come true. So happy for Christy! And Hugh O'Conor is also excellent as young Christy, a performance for a child! Christy's love story is very well done, trustworthy. Christy wants love and nothing can love him right, his beloved on the beautiful dr. Eileen Cole doesn't get (surprisingly played by Fiona Shaw.) I'm deeply impressed with her role in the Harry Potter series, the horrible aunt Petunia, so her appearance in this role is really beyond my mind, but anyway, any woman has her own youth ...) is paranoid and offensive, I have sympathy for him, love is a two-edged sword, happiness and anxiety are just next to each other. <br /> <br /> VAT, Jim Sheridan's works are all good (IN America, THE BOXER, etc.) except GET RICH OR THE DEATH Try, God knows why he decided to direct that crap! Actually, an occupation for him, sorry!
