I can't really condemn the movie because it works. There are plenty of movie noir elements to watch this noir movie, but I think it's just in the category. <br /> <br /> There is nothing sinister in this piece, and that's where the noir elements fail. Sure, the disease can be regarded as sinister, but I find it difficult to see it. The movie shows a darker side: Blackie can make people difficult, the New Orleans police are just too willing to arrest a reporter, the plague of the pest hangs over all the people in the movie ... but that is actually just tips. <br /> <br /> There has been no attempt to question Reed's motivation, such as one with Marlowe or Spade, and there is also no attempt to bring one's side to Blackie, which makes him even less contemptuous when human trafficking is actually played out. <br /> <br /> The lack of depth is what the movie eventually fails. <br /> <br /> The story is decent, the acting is good, the writing and direction is well done ... but there is nothing to make it a movie you have to return over and over. Possible to watch once, maybe twice if you don't remember it from years ago, and then throw away.
