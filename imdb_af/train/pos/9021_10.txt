myself and 2 sisters have watched 3 series Tenko and it agrees. This is by far one of the BBC's better ranges. The whole role play was very convincing in the parts they portrayed and although the 3rd series was slightly slower, it was compelling to watch and my evenings wont be the same without it. No doubt we will look at it again, because it is a series I will never get sick to watch. Excellent performance and full marks for the BBC for such a brilliant series and castings. First rate in all sections and will recommend this series to everyone, although some age limits should be considered due to some adult material. So grateful to the BBC for releasing this series on DVD and Video.
