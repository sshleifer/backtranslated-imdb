A FROGIC OF YOUNG short topic. <br /> <br /> A teenager, ashamed of his fear of dogs, walks away from home. The abandoned spaniel he finds helps to change his mind. <br /> <br /> PARDON MY PUPS is a fun little movie, with Shirley Temple stealing all her screens as the hero's lively kid. The intoxication stop is in poor taste but is soon forgotten. Highlights: The climaxes that look impressive are realistic. <br /> <br /> Often overlooked or neglected, the one- and two-line short subjects were useful for studios as major training grounds for new or emerging talents, both in front and behind the camera. The dynamics of creating a successful short topic was quite different from that of a film of a characteristic length, something similar to writing a short note short story rather than a novel. Economical to produce in terms of both budget and schedule and able to portray a wide variety of materials, short subjects were the perfect complement to the studio's feature films.
