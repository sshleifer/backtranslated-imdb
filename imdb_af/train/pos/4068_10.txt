Amazingly, this is without a doubt the best anime cartoon ever made. In the late 80's I saw a castle in the air as a child and it left a lasting impression. years passed and I forgot the title of the movie, and just by chance browsing the internet I found this masterpiece again. After reading other people's reviews and analysis, I'm not surprised. It touched such praise and so much because it doesn't leave an impression. a true fantasy adventure, a must for all children and adults. its best not to give away the story, so i'll see how this movie will be a clear and open mind. if you have treated children, I will promise. There is not much to say about this artwork, but if you haven't seen it, watch it and enjoy it.
