I can honestly say I never expected this movie to be good. I don't like family movies. I'm far from a fan of Shahid Kapoor. The director's last film (MPKDH was perfectly stupid.) And the music was very boring and soft. But there was Amrita Rao who became my favorite after Main Hoon Na. There were also Seema Biswas, Alok Nath and Anupam Kher who are many. talented, some pluses. <br /> <br /> I finally saw the movie and I was very impressed. He brings us the young MPK lovers with a pinch of the HAHK wedding, and we have a winner. story outline is similar to HAHK, light hearts in the beginning to serious mode at the end. The director also made character that you can link to. The thing I didn't like about HAHK was that the characters were too eccentric. His perfection. Shahid Kapoor surprised me with a good performance. This is a big improvement, and above all, he fits in the role. The best is easily Amrita Rao. In fact, it's her best performance. Her screen presence is so electrifying, you are bound to love her performance. Sameer Soni, Amrutha Prakash, An Upam Kher, Alok Nath and Seema Biswas are tremendously cast. Not one actor feels out of place. <br /> <br /> The songs were pretty disappointing, but they would sound better after watching it. Mujhe Haq Hai and Do Anjaane Ajnabi are beautiful ballads. Milan Abhi Aada Adhura Hai is also nice to watch. The songs are not colorful and dance-like, and they are more like ballads. The exception is Hamari Shaadi Mein who reminds you of HSSH and HAHK. So what was the mistake in the movie? The movie gets pretty slow, and the end is quite stretched. But the movie is still going well, making it a perfect family movie.
