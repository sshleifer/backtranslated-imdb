I waited a while to post a review of this documentary document. Because when I first saw it 10 years ago, I wanted to think carefully about what I wanted to write. <br /> <br /> From a documentary standpoint, I found it to be a good documentary. It did what I wanted to do, showing me something I had no idea of ​​and interested me in this world that explored it. I didn't know anything about the Drag world and found out about them and the "Balls" were just spectacular to me. These people were just as talented with what they do and how they do it, for competition. The crackers, the complainants (even I was angry when someone told the judge that the drag queen's wear was not a man's dress!), The jealous, it's all like every other competition. Like every other competition like that. What I felt was a point. <br /> <br /> You had the older draw queen talking about how the balls being used are compared to the newer bear queens that changed the balls and made more categories of competition. even those who were looking to know that the future of Balls would change even more if they were ready to run the runway. It was interesting to hear that some of the contestants were on the street two minutes before the ball, but came to compete, it was so important to them! Then there were sad stories, stories whose "home" and "house mother" brought out the best and the brightest in the competition. It was interesting. <br /> <br /> Now to see after 10 years of this movie, I lived through the so-called Madonna craze. I saw some well-known faces from this documentary that ended with Madonna in her "Vogue" phase and so lawfully. If not for those individuals, Madonna would not have a Vogue phase, I know now. Credit must be given where credit is DUE. Make me wonder if anyone else from mainstream America will watch this documentary, they will learn they are not as "mainstream" as they think.
