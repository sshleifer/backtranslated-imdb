For those who think of Dame May Witty as the friendly, slightly naughty, old lady of Hitchcock's The Lady Vanishes, this movie requires an adaptation. Here she is all but friendly or bitter. Instead, her son, George Macready, is the rewarding one. Don't just give him a knife, otherwise lift his eyes and no furniture cushion in the house is safe. Now we know what he has in mind for the trapped Nina Foch if he can just come out under Mother's dominant hand. <br /> <br /> Really a little female movie in danger that keeps the tension up to date. The script never rejects Foch's dilemma. She was caught in a large, old Gothic house on the edge of a harsh sea. They're going to kill her, but why. Her trouble doesn't make sense. The tension bumps while trying to escape one after the other, but even strangers look at her. We begin to feel her helplessness and increasing paranoia as the world disappears from her. <br /> <br /> Director Joseph H. Lewis has taken a big step toward cult status with this film and understandably so. Then watch Foch run subtly through a spectrum of emotions without going over the top once. Sharp also shines as a very intimidating matriarch who knows what she wants and how to get it if she can only keep her wacko boy in line. My one discussion is the climax that seems to emerge taking into account the timing of the events. Nonetheless, it's a good, nerve-wracking way to spend a little over an hour with friendly Columbia studios.
