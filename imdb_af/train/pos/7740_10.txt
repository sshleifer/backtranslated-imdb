It is rare that such a film becomes so flawless. It is truly one of the best activated, toughest structured movies I've ever seen. Each line of dialogue can be interpreted in various ways, with respect to each of the three main characters differently. The film weaves an intrinsic web of motivations and double crosses that refuse your bow and let go. Add to that the slow-aged romance between Kevin and Faye moves so much as anything ever dedicated to celluloid and you have the ingredients for a perfect movie. It exposes the romance of movies like "Titanic" as the trite cliches they are. If you are looking for a movie to watch while folding laundry, this is not the case. You have to commit yourself to this movie. You can't talk while walking in and out of the room. This movie requires your attention. Treat it with the respect you deserve and you'll get a lot of it. Unless you think "Titanic" is the biggest movie ever.
