I just want to say that no matter how low the film's budget, it should be the point of this movie throughout this world. We don't read much more, but people want to watch movies. Having this series on DVD has made me read the whole series and want more. PLEASE MAKE ALL 8 MOVIES. Please do not change any of the characters, it will disturb the effect. Because I grew to love the actors who played the characters. PLEASE MAKE ALL 8 MOVIES. I want to see the message, and look at the message that these books and now movies are here to portray. We don't get it enough anymore. AWESOME JOB !!!
