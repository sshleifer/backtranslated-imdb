This movie should not be compared to "The Sting" or other caper / heist / con feature films. What makes it such a great movie experience is to say it about relationships, fraud and trust. It is also a fairly critical criticism of psychiatry, as the female protagonist is a shrink that is so easily deceived and then acts in such a primitive way in the final. Did Mr Mamet have an unfortunate experience in therapy? Highly recommended!
