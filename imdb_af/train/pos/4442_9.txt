The Ogre is a film made for TV in Italy and was not intended to be a sequel to Demons, as Lamberto Bava even mentioned it on the interview at Sheirk Show DVD, but it is called Demons III to be part of the Demons series. The music in Demone and Demons 2 was 80's rock music, while it was the first time harsh music and the first two were gory horror Demons III: The Ogre is an architectural horror, so that's how Demone III does a proper prosecution for Demons is not, but I'm still like this movie. <br /> <br /> The music is creepy and it adds a tone to the castle set in the movie. The Ogre is also another thing I like the movie. There are two other films that are classified as Demone III and this is Black Demons (Demoni 3) and The Church (Demons 3). Demone III: The Ogre is a great movie as long as you don't compare it to Demone and Demons 2.
