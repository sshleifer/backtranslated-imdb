Although not a horror movie in the traditional sense, this creepy little movie delivers the goods. It seems a vampire is lost in a small German town that drains its victims from their blood. Police inspector Karl Brettschneider, Melvyn Douglas in one of his early roles, is skeptical about believing a mad killer, not a vampire running amok. The only one who believes him is Ruth Inspirant (Faye Wray), the inspector's girlfriend and lab assistant to Dr. Otto von Niemann (Lionel Atwill), but apparently a leading scientist goes along with the vampire theory. The townspeople suspect the weirdo Herman Gleib, with Dwight Frye, with his usual madness, which has a lot of fun with his role. The film contains quite a bit of humor that helps relieve some of the intensity involved in all the murders that are committed. One funny part is Gussie Schnappmann (Maude Eburne), Ruth Bertin's aunt, thinking strange Herman didn't change in a bat, but in a dog. Maude Eburne and Dwight Frye make a great comedy team. <br /> <br /> This budget film brings together elements of "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" with Dr Niemann, with the power of proposing a somnambulist. orders from "Frankenstein" using human blood to help create life in the laboratory, and "Dracula" since the murders are believed by everyone except the inspector and his girlfriend to be the work of a blood sugar . Thses elements are well-blended by director Frank R. Strayer with a bit of comedy that is well thrown in. The composition works. The restored version I watched used tinting to enhance the ghostly atmosphere. Try to see the version as possible.
