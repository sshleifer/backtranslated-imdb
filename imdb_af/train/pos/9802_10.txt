For the beginning I have always been a fan of the Batman cartoons, because the theme is so universal, "that everyone in life has an alter-ego". This is true in Batwoman's secrets. While the overall story is good, I'm disappointed they didn't really do much for the franchise. <br /> <br /> During the movie you try to find out who is Batwoman's identity, unfortunately. You can find out by simply looking at the issue of credits posted on this site (so if you haven't seen it, don't go there). I was kind of disappointed that they didn't make the movie any longer. 75 minutes is too short for any movie. The batwoman's secret identity also comes too early in the film, like halfway, and then becomes anti-climate because you know the good guys will always win and that the new character known as Batwoman will disappear after the movie is over. br /> <br /> I'm not too sure about the new animation style used in this movie. I love the sleek new characters, but there has to be a bit more detail where detail is required. Some parts of the animation seem so uncomfortable and stiff that it takes your attention straight away and distracts your attention from the storyline. I also don't really like the shiny atmosphere used in most scenes, it loses its dark and gothic feel to Batman. Likewise, we need to know more about Batwoman's personality, so that we can build the same compassionate feeling we can with Bruce Wayne. I also think the battle with Bane had to be done better. In the typical children's fashion, the bad man meets his downfall too easily, either by stumbling, falling, touching electricity or doing something dumb at work. Think about it, there wasn't even one drop of blood that was also played in this movie. <br /> <br /> Bottom line, it's a good entertaining movie and I recommend someone who is a Batman fan to see it. It has a good storyline, universal appeal and even good acting to solve it. I just wish they could make more permanent change to the story by letting Batwoman stay interesting. Don't just imagine her and then kick her off when she's finished. I also want to see someone else finally find out the riddle for a change. To have someone other than Batman, solve the puzzle and fill it in later with the details. <br /> <br /> I hope there are more animated movies to watch out for when we will actually be able to break through Bruce Wayne and Barbra Gordan. He tied her forever and doesn't even like her and I can't believe she's stupid enough to fall in love with someone who is 20 years old. I also want to see the time when Tim Drake leaves because he gets sick from the old man. In short, I want to see all the things that led the characters to be in Batman Beyond. Otherwise, the same repeated formula will only end it faster than when they just decided to continue with the story. <br /> <br />
