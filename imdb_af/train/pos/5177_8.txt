I watched last night after I didn't see it for a few years. It's really a fun movie, with a lot of faces you didn't know was in it. Arkin shines as always. Look at it; You won't be disappointed. By the way, it's just released on DVD and unlike the packaging, it's widescreen. The transfer is pretty poor, but the whole movie is at least visible. ;-)
