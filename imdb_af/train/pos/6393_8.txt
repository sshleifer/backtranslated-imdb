It is a must have for independent film lovers, but it also does well against the mainstream movies. I think we have the following from Woody Allen or <br /> <br /> Trentin Tarrentino here. <br /> <br /> The budget is painfully low. No special effects whatsoever, and they apparently use ambient lighting (shot in digital video.) And yet this movie is grabbing you and never going. The script is a bit bizarre, but the actors and directors pull it off with complete realism. It has humor, it has intrigue, and it has pathos, and it all works together. <br /> <br /> No point to describe the details. If you want to see an independent <br /> <br /> masterpiece, a virtual lesson on how to make a low budget that really works, see this one. <br /> <br /> -Oh yes, it's also VERY entertaining. <br /> <br />
