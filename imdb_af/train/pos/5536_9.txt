I really enjoyed this show. Even as a youngster, I was interested in all sports and this includes horse racing. It will always be difficult to make a series based on racing races and at the same time get permission from the races to record filming on this controversial subject. One episode I particularly remember has centered around a horse, which is expected to win a big race that looks a bit like color. A syringe was found on the stable floor, and everyone thought it was stupid, but nothing came up in the blood tests. All too late they realized the horse was not doped, but removed its knee cartilage. As a car without oil and the engine seized, the horse broke down with tragic consequences.
