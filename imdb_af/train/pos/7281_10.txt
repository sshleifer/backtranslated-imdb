I first saw the movie on a local station on the Sunday afternoon horror show around 1969 or 1970. Uncut. At that time I was just a little kid, but I loved it and wasn't really scared of it. I thought it had such a cool and highly original story. When I think back, I am still surprised that during the day at T.V. uncut in those years. I've been looking for this movie ever since. I've seen it over and over and have always loved it. One would think John Waters would have abhorred this film. It should not just be a scary movie, but one of the most beautiful, trashiest movies ever made. And surprisingly, you don't hear of this one who follows the cult that has a movie like "Blood Feast" or "The Hills Have Eyes" over the years. It has a cult that follows, but it really had to become a cult classic, in my opinion. As far as I know, it came a little before Blood Feast came out, which probably makes it one of the first real "gore" movies. In fact, this movie has elements of Hershell Gordon Lewis AND a bit of Russ Meyer threw in a good measure. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I recommend it to anyone who's trashy, messy, black and white horror movies from the early '60s (I think the date at the end of this 1960's reading).
