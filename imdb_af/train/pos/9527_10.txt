This is the best mob movie ever made. It earned more than it got at the Oscars. Nominate for things like his score, art direction, supporting role (Newman), this movie can easily be named and won for Best Picture, Director (Mendes), Actor (Hanks), Supporting Actor (Newman and Law) !! Hanks performs one of his best performances, and the child named Michel Jr. played so well that I was surprised that I didn't see him in more movies today. Critics themselves did not give this film enough credit. Besides the amazing performances, another real star of this movie is the incredible music. It was by far the best score of the year. It was nominated but did not win. It's a good movie to be seen by everyone. My Grade A +
