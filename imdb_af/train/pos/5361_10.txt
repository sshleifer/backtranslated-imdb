If you are educated on a diet of game shows, you will understand that you need a bigger and better solution gradually. Well, in the world of Running Man, your needs will be set. Because in this show, prisoners compete for freedom and the ultimate prize - their life. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie. It was such a parody of the thoughts we see daily. It's not one of Schwarzenegger's best achievements, but overall it's a very good movie. The underlying idea that television corporations will one day be the "real" rulers of the planet is very credible and is well portrayed in this film. Of course, there are the usual Arnie one-liners, my favorite being when he is catapulted into the game zone, the game show hosts "Any last words?" Arnie says, "Yes, I'll be back", but the host bumps "Only in a repeat" and presses the eject button. I give this movie a 10 for pure originality. I had to watch it 30 or more times. The only movie apart from the Die Hard series I watched it often! <br /> <br /> In short, do not think for a moment that you own the T.V. It owns you .....
