This movie I loved since I was young! This is excellent. Although it may be a bit for the average movie keeper if you can't interpret some subtleties in the movie (for example, our hero's name is Achilles, and in the last battle between him and Alexander he is shot in the heel with a rocket, just as Achilles was shot in mythology in his heel). It's just a little thing that is fun! Anyway, a good movie, good story, it will be neat to see it with today's special effects! Curiously, Gary Graham has an average success, starring in the Alien Nation T.V. This movie is a fun watch and needs to be appreciated!
