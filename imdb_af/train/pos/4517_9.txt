With this subject it is so easy to take cheap shots. You know, the man with hairy legs that looks like Marilyn Monroe. Not here - Adrian Pasdar does a great job of making Gerald a real person, someone you care about, and as a result, you feel that his fate is going to live as well as Gerald and Geraldine. Not only that, but like Geraldine he looks warm! And the chemistry between him and Julie Walters is electric. These are two characters who feel love for each other, and it comes through even when they just look at the breakfast table. Even the possible cute sub-story line of corporate takeovers is credible, and you find yourself in the end sorry! At least I did it!
