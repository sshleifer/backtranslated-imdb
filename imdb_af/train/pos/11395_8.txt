I dug some old musicals from my garage and this is one of my favorites. It was written by Jay Alan Lerner and led by Vincent Minelli. It won two Best Picture Awards of 1951 and Best Scratch. The story of an American painter in Paris trying to raise it. Nina Foch is a sophisticated lady of substance and is very interested in helping him, but soon finds love for the man. Meanwhile, Gen Kelly falls for lovely girl, Leslie Caron. His main dance partner, and I have to say they are great on the floor and otherwise. The well-known French singer Georges Guietary also sings. So if you like good, smooth dance and fun-filled scenes filled with Oscar Levant's stingy piano finger, George Gershwyn's songs will live forever in this colorful gem. 8/10
