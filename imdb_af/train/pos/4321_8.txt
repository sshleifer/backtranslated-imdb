I'll keep this one very short. I believe this is an extraordinary film. I see other reviewers who commented that it was badly written, shot badly, had a terrible soundtrack and, worse, is not really in the portrayal of life. OK, so it can't be quite credible for its full length, but this movie carries a message of hope that some other people have missed. Hope it's not too late to save people from the terrible things going on in so many lives. Gangland violence is really, right? Is it right, no! This film carries an important social message that the cynics may not like, but which should be praised, rather than denied. I watched this movie at least eight times, every time with equal enjoyment and every time with the feeling that maybe the world could be made better and no longer saving (until 2008 anyway). 9 out of 10 of me for this one. It's almost perfect in my view. JMV
