It was very heartwarming. As a strange French, I especially enjoyed this TV movie, which I think is widening. The acting was good, and the ties between every member of this rural French family were so strong and so natural. This is undoubtedly a good film about the concept of family and inclusion in the face of homosexuality and Aids. One of the strongest aspects of the movie is this privileged relationship between the oldest son (Leo) who contracted HIV, and the youngest son (Marcel), to whom the rest of the family is trying to hide the situation. The two characters <br /> <br /> gradually explore each other as time comes out for Leo, who is not prepared to survive the rest of his life through drugs.
