Wow what an episode! After last week, Mellisa constantly saw Annie and Brandi's friendship, I almost puked. But it was nothing before he saw Mellisa's tirade after being fired. As her hobble was thrown around her, we were unsettling and screaming for someone to get her purse, was absolutely the hilarious thing ever on the reality TV. She shouted to people to get her clothes "all of them", as someone else would wear one of her spectacular outfits. Mellisa you are like 40 years old and you're still throwing humor? Then Joan Annie and Brandie start calling every name in the book, and get up and stop the show! Both rivers have been spoiled for abandonment for just as long. Mellisa cries and refuses to do an exit interview, just prove America that everyone thought, you are a spoiled baby. WAH WAH, I can't get my way! I love how Annie told the cameras that she can manipulate Mellisa to think of her, and then it did exactly that. Mellisa is by far the smartest participant and deserves to win the whole game.
