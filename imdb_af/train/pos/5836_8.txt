Yes, as the other reviewers have already said, it may not be vintage L&H, but it is far from their worst job than in the 20th century. I mean Fox. This movie definitely has all the basic ingredients for things that go wrong for the boys. But this is their serious approach and determination that makes them funny. They do not play it for laughter like other comedians, but they take their work and situation very seriously and that is the essence of their eternal humor. In this film, they are faced with some basic issues that are really experienced by any of us today, namely work-related stress. First we will be checked by a doctor and he will prescribe a much needed rest and may stay with the sea. This is where surrealism comes from. L & H always takes the most plausible set of circumstances and never exaggerates it to the point of being incredible, except perhaps once in a while. It makes us laugh because we can relate to their self-related preaching and extinction efforts. This makes Stan and Ollie universal in their appeal. In this film, all the ingredients are presented in a beautiful, artistic and graceful way. Not their best compared to their previous work probably because it was the real last movie they did for Roach, because he wanted to reflect the "big" studios and make exclusive features and also wanted to suspend their contractual obligation. GREAT ERROR! They all had to stay together and continue for maybe five years. What the world may have lacked in them not to consider it as an option. Look, laugh, and enjoy it as their last big show.
