"Stanley and Iris" show the triumph of human spirit. For Stanley, this is the battle to become literate and realize its potential. For Iris, it is the courage to love again after becoming a widow. The beauty of the movie is the dance that Robert DeNiro and Jane Fonda are doing, starting and stopping, before everyone has the skills and courage to trust each other and continue. In this respect, it gives us a good picture of how life is often, therefore credible. Unlike some other reviewers, I have found the characters that each made the whole picture consistent. The supporting role is also carefully selected and they add a depth of character to the main characters adding meaning to the supporting actions. All in all an excellent movie. The best thing I take from it is Hope.
