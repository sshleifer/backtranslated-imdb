Like most other reviewers, I saw this movie for the first time (on TV, never on the big screen), when I was a teenager. My dad has always considered and recommended this movie, and I have to say he was not just right, but this movie has been with me for more than two decades since I first saw it. I've seen it two or three times (just a few days ago I gave it another watch) and it didn't lose any of its impact with time. It's still a great movie to watch! Man looks at Peckinpah's RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY as one of the first and best westerners to have a realistic look at life in the old west, but the barely famous LAST HUNT is definitely the better movie and was even half a dozen years ago . Actually, it was probably 3 decades before his time, or maybe it's still ... <br /> <br /> Although I think hard and certainly have seen 100s from the west (I like this genre), I can't do any Western as dark and depressed as this one. Two men are partly connected by hatred, partly by not having other choices, surrounded by beautiful men. Padget, a crippled old man and a young Inian who lead the life of buffalo killers to the fate of one of them. <br /> <br /> No one who ever saw this movie can forget his end and the last frames of this gem. When the camera on and off of Mr. Taylor moves, comes a white buffalo skin (on a tree) and echoes of the past, when all the hatred began, are present again. Mr. Taylor had his buffalo, but in the end the buffalo got him. <br /> <br /> In addition to the top performances of everyone involved, the intelligent writing and the great dialogue, it should also be mentioned that THE LAST HUNT was excellently photographed. I rarely shot a western good of those directed by Anthony Mann, who was also extremely photographed), that all the places are cleverly chosen and even the soundtrack fits the picture well. <br /> <br /> And director BROOKS is really a great storyteller. Master workmanship! He made quite a few very good movies and was successful in almost every imaginable genre, but even in such an inventive career like this, the LAST HUNT still seems to be one of his best if not his best. br /> <br /> Definitely would get a higher rating compared to the 7-something RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY enjoys.
