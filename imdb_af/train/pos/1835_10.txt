What an excellent movie it is, I don't have words to describe. i don't know how the rating of the movie is 7.3 it should be 9.3, but anyway no one else can make this movie and Akshay's acting is just outstanding the second half of the movie makes you cry and the movie has really good unexpected end that makes the movie perfect. You have to see this movie once, I think twice, it's up to you. Anyway, I love this movie and it's not just sad and funny, but it also gives you great meanings and what you need to do, I think it's one of the best movies in Bollywood history. but I know people have delayed choosing so yes. The only thing I don't like about this movie is the music and the background music is good, but the songs aren't good enough. I think the music would be better if AR Rahman would be the music director, but we can't do anything. So, yes.
