I saw this movie for the first time at the Sundance Film Festival this year, and I was a teenager myself. I saw the movie as pretty attractive. These kids are out of the habit and very unexpected to be in a movie of this stature, but with the right dialogue and junk they have made the movie a complete success. I enjoyed this movie more than others, but I recommend to release and watch this movie. it is a mixture of witty commentary and hilarious reality. capture the essence of high school, high school record put my favorite list and hopefully a chance to be released in the theaters. I thank all the kids who did the hard work to make this movie, it helped me cry in the laugh.
