As far as I can remember, Balanchine's changes to Tchaikovsky's score are as follows: <br /> 1) The final section of the Grossvatertanz (a traditional song played at the end of a party) is repeated repeatedly. the children are a last dance before their scene is over. <br /> <br /> 2) A violin solo, written for but eliminated from Tchaikovsky's score for The Sleeping Beauty, is between the end of the party tone and the beginning of the transformation scene. Balanchine chose this music because of his melodic relationship with the music for the growing Christmas tree that takes place shortly thereafter. <br /> <br /> 3) The solo for the Sugar Plum Fairy's cavalier is eliminated. <br /> <br /> It seems to me the accusation that Balanchine has somehow desecrated Tchaikovsky's huge score.
