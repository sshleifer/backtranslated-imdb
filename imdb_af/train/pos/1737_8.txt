I like old Burt Reynolds movies. They are funny and better combined than any other movie. They may also have stopped making movies after "Cannonball Run 2", but I think how can they know there will be no more stuff? Man this movie is good. Burt Reynolds must dress like a chicken and run in a racing car, and the sumptuous Loni Anderson is on hand. He looks very hot in eighty years. Burt and Loni, these were the days! I used to have this magazine that Loni Anderson had to advertise for a vacuum cleaner. I certainly loved that ad! Plus, this one part in the movie where the race track is upset about something Stroker Ace (Burty R.) is doing, and it shows that one man in the audience is bowing and his finger on his butt stands for his disappointment to picture! I laughed so hard, I almost died at night! If you can get this movie, rent it! And never look at another movie again, because I'm telling you now: there's no point.
