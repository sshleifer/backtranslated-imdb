This is my second time for a perfect spy. I watched it 2 or 3 years ago and liked it. I still like it. Of course, this is compared to the other great Le Carre series, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. Tinker Tailor focuses on the "game" spies playing; Perfect Spy gives us the other - what kind of person is a spy. There are a number of themes that share these movies with others in the genre. <br /> <br /> Bisexual - moral, sexual, interpersonal - which is a multi-dimensional space of true counterfeit, vs. create outside, love towards responsibility. In a way, these characters are the happiest when they are most talked about by those who love and respect them - "backstabbed" in its different nuances. <br /> <br /> The theme of fathers and father figures is also important. One of the most intriguing characters in A Perfect Spy is Rick, the lead character Magnus's perhaps replacement father. Through the story he betrays and is betrayed. A villain who is always able to climb back to climb the ladder when he is overturned, who seems impervious to what others think of him, asks Magnus every time they meet, "Do you love your old man?" and never, "do you love me?" Maybe it's somewhere else here, but a perfect spy is a love story. <br /> <br /> Another theme is malignancy. The nature of the business is to turn others - they turn against their government, against their friends and associates, turning them against their values ​​and beliefs. In each of the Le Carre movies I have seen, the Spy in the Cold, Spinal War, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, Smiley's People, and a Perfect Spy, are turning, turning around and turning around, the basis of the tragedy. <br /> <br /> Finally, not so much a theme as an artistic touch - in each of these movies there is usually only a single shot, or perhaps two shots that discuss the story. Violence, torture, cruelty are always just below the surface. We don't see their results as streams of blood or jail prison cells, but in the objects that Le Carre's characters cling to, as they are sucked into the morass unconditionally. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen the movies above and you enjoy a perfect spy, you're in for a surprise. I would also recommend the Sandbagger series (Yorkshire TV). The 2nd and 3rd seasons start to reach this level of complexity. The IPCRESS file and funeral in Berlin is nice, though lightweight. For political plot, try a lot of British coup, House of Cards and Yes, Minister / Yes, Prime Minister. <br /> <br /> If only a Briton would put his hand to make the Three Kingdoms - there would be a movie of intrigue and complexity.
