I watched this movie by accident, touching the TV through the trailer on the scene. I like when I discover movies like these, small, soft stories about ordinary people. Even if the end is tragic, the man in the moon has a few funny moments, especially in the first characterization of Dani, with her innocent and pure love affair with the court. It is really a beautiful, moving love story with 3 high points: the show of Reese Witherspoon, who has kept her promises in the world of cinema, the beautiful cinematography by "Old Lion" Freddie Francis and the fantastic score of James Newton Howard , what really is the soul of the movie. His themes (which earned an Oscar nomination) are so intimate and lyrical that they seem to have changed the script into music.
