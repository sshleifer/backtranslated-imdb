Another small piece of the big picture puzzle of the Holocaust is turned over in this docudrama about the Rosen Strasse Protest in Berlin, an event I didn't know, which began in February 1943. The details are given in an addendum that follows this review. <br /> <br /> The film story tells the story of this protest in another, contemporary story that begins in New York City today. Here is a well-absent, unobtrusive Jewish woman whose husband is only dead, insulting her children and others by an orthodox raw ritual. She goes even further and demands that her daughter's non-Jewish fiancee leave the house. <br /> <br /> The distressed daughter, Hannah (Maria Schrader) then learns for the first time from an older cousin during World War II in Berlin, her mother, then 8 years old, by an Aryan woman in and protected. Hannah drops everything, goes to Berlin, and finds this woman, Lena Fischer, now 90. Hannah easily persuades the woman to tell her story. It seems to be pat rather. <br /> <br /> The film then improves, through long flashbacks mainly on the events of 1943 surrounding the protest, in which the fictional central character is the same Mrs. Fischer is 33 (played beautifully by Katja Riemann), a Baroness and completed pianist who is married to Fabian (Martin Feifel), a Jewish concert violinist, one of the men detained at the Rosenstrasse site. <br /> <br /> The narrative weaves briefly Back to the present from time to time and ends again in New York. While scenes in the present are color saturated, the 1943 scenes are washed out, showing strong blue-gray. <br /> <br /> The quality of acting is generally pretty good, what we can expect, given the deep reservoir of talent In Germany and in the direction of Margarethe von Trotta, the most prominent female movie maker of New German Cinema , she is a former actress. <br /> <br /> The story of the protest is simply told. Only one feature missing would have helped: notes that are still given to those arrested in Rosenstrasse, an outcome that, as the appendix below is clear, is very positive. <br /> <br /> "Rosenstrasse" did not perform well in the opinion of most film critics. Too long, unnecessarily layered, caregiver of gender stereotypes, manipulative with music: so is the ordinary rape. It's too long. But I found in this movie a stern, powerful, spontaneous and completely convincing voice of the women who kept the night watch out of place on Rosenstrasse where their Jewish family and others were detained. I didn't find anything in this portrayal. This is the fact that I have the utmost violence (no one is shot or otherwise physically broken). I strengthened my tension, which was increasing as the film progressed. You are waiting for an evil attack to start any moment. The gloom of the movie then stayed with me. I often woke up later that night when I watched the movie, my thoughts were full of pale, melancholy, chaotic images and feelings witnessed by the film. It seldom happens to me.

Adolf Eichmann hoped it would separate them from other prisoners. They would convince relatives that their loved ones were being sent to labor camps, rather than to more ominous destinations in occupied Poland. <br /> <br /> Those arrested were usually held in detention for only two days before being bound to the East for trains. But before the prisoners could be deported, women and other relatives got the wind of what was going on and appeared at the Rosenstrasse address, first in one and two, and then in increasing numbers. <br /> <br /> Perhaps as many as six thousand took part in the protests, although not all at the same time. Women demanded their husbands every day for a week. Unarmed, unorganized and leaderless, they faced the most brutal forces for the sake of the Third Reich. <br /> <br /> Joseph Goebbels, the Gauleiter (governor or district leader) of Berlin, was anxious to have that city racial. Cleansed was also in charge of the country's public morale. On both points he was worried about the possible consequences of the ladies' actions. Instead of inviting more open dissent by shooting the women in the streets and being afraid of endangering the secrecy of the "Final Solution", Goebbels released Hitler's assent to the Rosenstrasse prisoners and even the returning from twenty-five of those already sent to Auschwitz! <br /> <br /> For both Hitler and Goebbels, the decision was simply the postponement of the inevitable. But they were wrong. Almost everyone released from Rosenstrasse survived the war. The women won an astonishing victory over the forces of destruction.
