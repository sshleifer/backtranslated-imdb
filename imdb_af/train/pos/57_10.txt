I must say that this is one of the best movies I've ever seen! I was bored and watched by t.v. and got "Home Room" and it was in about 5 minutes. But I was addicted. It was so interesting and moving. It shows what can happen in someone's life. I give it a 10, more than possible. The director / writer and actors did a wonderful job. I think teenagers should see this movie and learn from it. It was wonderful, drama, mystery and more. I shouted for hours! I think the director / writer should write more movies like this one. I love it! I didn't even know about this movie, it's sad because it was so good. I wish it could go into the movies for more people to watch.
