just watched the sky. TV missed the first half an hour. I wondered if it was a real story, so it looked to the end. There was no end to the end to say what happened to everyone. It reminded me of speed, but at the end of the day I didn't think it was released at the theater, as we saw the following mistake. The roof we saw was that they removed the bonnet and later there were two shots of the car, with the police car in front, trying to delay it when the bonnet is back. It had me on the edge of my seat, especially when I thought the baby would hit the bridge and of course when the bridge would not be lowered and then it was. I'm afraid I burst into tears, so it wasn't that bad !!
