I really enjoyed this movie. Tobey Maguire gives a tremendous performance as Jake. He must be one of the best actors I've seen. And I was surprised there were so many humorous lines throughout the film. He was also very good with it, although I have never seen him a cartoon before. The film is involved with the characters and really makes you wonder what to do about them all. I didn't know what to expect from Jewel's performance, but I think she did pretty well. Very exciting scenes. A good ride. I'm absolutely a Maguire's fan. Look at the Cider House Rules. One of the best best ever.
