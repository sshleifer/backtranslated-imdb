This series may well be the best Britcom, and it says a lot, considering the competitors (Fawlty Towers, Good Neighbors, to name just two). <br /> <br /> What made Butterflies so superior, even to the very best, is that it not only portrays great, classic, classic and intelligent comedy, but it has also expanded horizons, which are flawless, soft and on every detail the great social change that occurs in Britain at the time. <br /> <br /> Remember to watch this show as a teenager and get rid of it all. The lifestyle depicted was remarkable in itself. It was the first time I saw real people with cordless phones. And the wardrobe of all the characters was far from the solid seventies clothes that were seen in North America at that time. Then there were the decors, shop fronts, cars. These people - even the sweet boys, with their philosophical approach to life and epigrammatic humor - were sophisticated. These were examples of the "New Europeans" who will have an impact on life and style in the world over the coming decade (1980s). <br /> <br /> Of course, the premise was strange and fantastic. The idea that someone living in the suburban dream could be so dissatisfied and restless was revolutionary, especially for North Americans, for whom happiness was always defined as money and things (sure the situation was portrayed in American movies and TV, but not with the intensity not of butterflies or the movie Montenegro). And if the point of departure was not surprising enough, the way it was expressed went to the limit. A potential issue that didn't really have sex or even romance? Butterflies have blundered a lot, but it had to have a few people who left their forehead in disbelief ... at the moment. <br /> <br /> Butterflies seem to be - in so many ways - prophetic. It is documented, before its time - postmodern ennui, all-encompassing lifestyle, the idea of ​​emotional infidelity, and generation disengagement and male dissatisfaction (perfectly portrayed by tense father-son relationships). It's too bad, this series hasn't been rediscovered in a big way, and all those involved have given credit to create and provide a meaningful snapshot of a certain time and place with all the fluency and fear that comes.
