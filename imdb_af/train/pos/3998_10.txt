I somehow missed this movie when it came out and discovered it as late as last week, thanks to a friend's recommendation. I can honestly say that I can't remember another intimate dramatic movie that does so many things so well. The writing is sharp, realistic, nuanced and even limited. The cinematography and editing is underestimated, but inspired, so that the visual storytelling can be dominated by wonderful close-ups and frameworks of images, capturing only alienation in most memorable ways. The acting is also great, with all the characters really painful and vulnerable in the most compelling ways a movie can offer. They reveal their inner weaknesses with unprotected, raw vulnerability. A real triumph for Roger Michell and Hanif Kureishi, and the rest of the team. A must have for serious movie lovers.
