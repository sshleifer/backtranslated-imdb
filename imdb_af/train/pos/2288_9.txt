It is so scarce to find a literary work that is adequately translated on the screen that I have made this film higher than it deserved, but not much As a long time student of Vonnegut's works, I have no hesitation in film recommend its readers, at least to those who love him like me. The casting is inspired: Nolte is underestimated in triumph, confused in defeat, decisive in judgment. Sheryl Lee is nice, but her handling of the treacherous Resi and her tragic crescendo lets you forget her beauty. Alan Arkin delivers a very sweet, but equally deceptive, Soviet spy. <br /> <br /> Don't feel like reading Mother's Night to appreciate the movie; though, if you haven't read Mother Night, you'll probably want to read the movie. <br /> <br /> Notice the shifts of color to black and white and back and don't miss the final symbolism of Campbell's nose. Also watch Kurt Vonnegut's cameo near the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Bing Crosby's "White Christmas" will never sound the same (I'm writing in mid-December, when the song plays heavy radio, and it drives me nuts).
