I'm a big fan of Stephen King's work, and this movie made me a bigger fan of King. Pet Sematary is about the Creed family. They just moved into a new home, and they look happy. But there is a pet cemetery behind their house. Creed's new neighbor Jud (played by Fred Gwyne) explains the cemetery behind the pet cemetery. That cemetery is pure evil. Jud tells Louis Creed that when you bury one (or any kind of pet) in the cemetery, they will come back. The only problem is that when they return, they are not the same person, they are angry. Shortly after Jud explains everything about the Pet Sematary, everything goes to hell. I will not explain anymore because I do not want to give away the chapters in the film. Pet Sematary's play was pretty good, but needed some work. The story was one of the most important parts of this movie, mainly because it was so original and gripping. This movie has many make-up effects that make the movie more frightening and frightening. One of the most basic reasons why this movie gave cold chills to my back was actually the make-up effects. There is one character in this movie that is really freaky. This character is "Zelda." This particular character appears about three times in the movie to be precise. Zelda is Rachel Creed's sister who died many years ago, but Rachel is still haunted by her. The first time Zelda appears in the movie is not scary, because she doesn't speak anything, but the second time is the worst, and to be honest, the second time is scared of me the second time. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this movie, it's almost perfect. Pet Sematary delivers great scarce, some pretty good acting, first class plot, and fascinating makeup. It is truly one of the favorite horror movies of all time. 10 out of 10.
