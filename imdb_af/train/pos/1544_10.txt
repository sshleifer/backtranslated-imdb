This is an excellent but difficult trippy World War I to find spying in the Italian style of the inimitable 60. From the psychedelic graphics of the introductory credits and the great score by Ennio Morricone to the lesbian love scene with Capucine and the extremely proclaimed apocalyptic nose poison gas and German cavalry battle scenes in full gas-tight storm trooper gear, this is a movie not to be missed. It is a film that captures the horrors and cruelty of the war and the ruthlessness of the players on and off the battlefield. Apart from the battle scenes, some of the production and special effects are primitive, apparently because most of the budget for this movie is saved for the battle tones, but for lovers of the 60-year-old cinema this shouldn't be a problem no. I saw this movie a lot on television this past year and had the prospect of putting it on VHS. I still have the tape and enjoy watching from time to time.
