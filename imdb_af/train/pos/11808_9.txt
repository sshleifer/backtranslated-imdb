At the end of the Eighties, Beatty created and stared in the literary epic Reds about the founding of the Soviet Union in the eyes of the iconoclast radical John Reed. It was an in-depth movie, both entertaining and with an all-star cast message. By the end of the decade, Warren Beatty had created another kind of epic in Dick Tracy that made nothing but entertainment with a lot of the best actors, just to have a good time to make it under tons to pick up. br /> <br /> That both Reds and Dick Tracy can come from the same individual, speaks volumes about the extent this man has as a player. In this movie Beatty managed to get all the famous cartoon characters out of the strip and put them in one original script. <br /> <br /> The city's big boy Caprice makes a move to really eliminate the competition. The film opens with him rubbing Lips Manlis's henchmen in a Valentine Massacre style, and then Lips himself is fitted with a cement overcoat. But Caprice's movements make him a target for Tracy. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, a third mysterious and faceless individual is looking for Caprice himself. Will our hero hand out this crime? <br /> <br /> The spirit of the fun this movie has is really contagious. When people like Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, Paul Sorvino, William Forsythe, R.G. Armstrong gets himself upset to look like the cartoon art of strip writer Chester Gould and then cut out an exercise of the biggest cut ham, you must love this movie. <br /> <br /> Al Pacino received a best supporting actor nomination, but any of these guys may have, it's just that Pacino as Big Boy Caprice gets the most screen time. Just Beatty plays it completely straight, the other looks like he's playing from him. Dick Tracy won Oscars for best art and set design, best song written by Stephen Sondheim and introduced by Madonna, Sooner Later. The fact that he could even get someone like Sondheim to write a score for this film just shows that Sondheim wants to go into the fun. As for Madonna, the material girl does more than her own with all of these acting heavyweights as club torch singer Breathless Mahoney. <br /> <br /> Before this movie, Dick Tracy movies were broadcast to the B photos and worse than Saturday afternoon. The only thing that compares this overall exception is a radio broadcast done during World War II for armed forces. Can you believe a movie like Bing Crosby, Bob Hope, Frank Sinatra, Dinah Shore, Jimmy Durante, Judy Garland, Frank Morgan and Andrews Sisters? Try a recording of that jewel. <br /> <br /> Until then, Warren Beatty's classic big-screen cartoon will do well.
