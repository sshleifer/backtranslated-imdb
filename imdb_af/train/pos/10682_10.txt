A few years ago, the satellite channel, U.K. Gold, repeating "poorly married men" with the hype: "Here's the original flat-sharing sitcom!". It was actually false. 'Man over the house' was also a flat-sharing sitcom and ran from 1973 to 1976. <br /> <br /> It was the brainchild of Johnnie Mortimer and Brian Cooke, creators of the popular sitcom, Father Dear Father. When it ended, they decided they wanted to do something more in tune with the times. <br /> <br /> In the first episode, Chrissy (Paula Wilcox) and Jo (Sally Thomsett) clean their Myddleton Terrace shelf after a wild feast when they get a man in their bath. He is Robin Tripp (Richard O'Sullivan), a South American cooking student of no permanent residence. While his clothes are drying out, he puts on a women's gown and prepares them for a meal. They are so impressed with their culinary skills that they invite him to stay. But there should be no mischievous business. So Robin has to pretend he's gay. <br /> <br /> On Bb. C.-2's "Love 1973", shown in 2000, said Julie Burchill claimed that "House" showed her a way of life she envied. She wasn't alone. One of the most iconic (for me, anyway) images of 70-year-old British television was Sally Thomsett coming from the London Underground and wearing a parasol, and a "blind" man made a double attempt as she kept passing under the swing. <br /> <br /> A man living with two girls was a great subject for the time, but Mrs. Mary Whitehouse didn't need to get warm under the collar, it was innocent, cheerful fun. Mortimer and Cooke's scripts were as close as they could, without crossing them. <br /> <br /> Richard O'Sullivan still plays "Bingham" in I.T.V. say 'Doctor in Charge' when it started. In fact, the second race of 'In Charge' overlaps with the first of 'House'. He was born to play the shocked Robin. Paula Wilcox's 'Chrissy' was more street-wise than 'Beryl', her character she played in 'The Lovers', while Sally Thomsett's 'Jo' was a lovely dizzy blonde. As time went on, he almost became like an older brother to them. <br /> <br /> For many viewers, Brian Murphy and Yootha Joyce stole the show as the warring Ropers. George lost interest in sex, but Mildred didn't. They went to their own show - the appropriate title 'George & Mildred'. The late Doug Fisher was a great value as Robin's female friend, Larry. He worked so well that he was made regularly. <br /> <br /> Within a year of his debut there was the inevitable movie exchange. I'm not a big fan of the movie 'Man About The House' because I think it's stretched to fit the big screen. Most of his characters have never appeared in the series. <br /> <br /> The format was sold to America, where it became the long-term 'Three's Company' with former John Ritter and Suzanne Somers. It was much more suggestive than the British original, with Somers often in sexy clothes. <br /> <br /> After six seasons, 'House' ended with Chrissy marrying Robin's older brother Norman (Normandie Eshley). Fans were devastated to see that Robin did not find the girl he loved, but there was some consolation in the fact that he also landed his own show - "Robin's Nest".
