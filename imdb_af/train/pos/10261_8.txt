First, it's not supposed to be a brilliant and thought-provoking movie, as so many other reviewers seem to be comparing. The first review says something according to the lines of anyone who likes it, knows nothing about horror cinema, apparently it is the other way around. Looking back at the movie, it really wasn't convincing, it was a low budget ipecac. But really that's all it was, it was meant to blow the viewers away with the incline value (and all the errors it had were much less visible in the original VHS versions). <br /> <br /> I gave this one a high score because it has reached its goal and although it wasn't really horrible, it made me slightly sick and thoroughly paranoid / pessimistic (I didn't "I trust no one for about a week because I didn't want to wake up and tortured)
