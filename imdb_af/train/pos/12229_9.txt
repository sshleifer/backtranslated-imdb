For me, there is something so tempting and nostalgic about low-budget sci-fi. As a child in the 50's, that's all there. In 1957 I saw the "The First Man Into Space" in a movie with my dad. It had Marshall Thompson's lead role and a few other poor who had the title role. It's also about a space mission that has gone bad where the astronaut becomes a grizzly killer. Scare the good and straight out of me. The memory of these hay-jeebies still lives in me. The Incredible Melting Man is almost a repetition, just in full glorious color. This is where the screens are well lit. Just love it for what it is ... a little over an hour of darkly lit scenes, disgusting sounds, and that awful music. Bravo!
