Let's cut a long story short. I loved it every minute. An exuberant fantasy in true Arabic nights style. There is an evil wizard, a beautiful princess, a jinn and everyone happily ever lives. Modern Hollywoningen probably has one or two things to learn from these classics. Just a problem: the special effects are pretty dated (love Sabu with the jinn's foot though!)
