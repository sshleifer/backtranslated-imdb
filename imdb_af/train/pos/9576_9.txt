One of the most nihilistic and brutal movies I've ever seen, but also one of the most tragic and moving children. It's an action melodrama like the world has never seen it before. Sometimes the plot got me close to tears, while delivering shocking revelations like a bottling blow to the gut in the next moment. Chilling performance by Edison Chen. The story of a HK Cop and a Cambodian killer hunting each other while losing their humanity is a strong one. With a very small dialogue in favor of the spectacular image display and keen camera work, "Dog Bite Dog" is pure HK-Bloodshed without the heroism.
