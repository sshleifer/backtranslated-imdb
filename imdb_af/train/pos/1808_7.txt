All Dog's Go to Heaven is an animated child's movie like no other. Gambling, drinking, death, guns and hell are all prominent in the plot. Although children will get very little of it, adults will scratch their minds why this movie is made to feel like some kind of gun movie. Charlie Barkin (Burt Reynolds) is a player dog who owns half a casino with his partner. The movie is not explicit. It's just a strange combination to make a kid's movie. <br /> <br /> Charlie Barkin Carface (Vic Tayback). Getting drunk (a dog .... getting drunk ... in a kid's movie. It just sounds strange.) Charlie is deceived and killed by Carfax. When he is in heaven, he finds a way to return to earth, but he will no longer be allowed into heaven. He still goes back to Earth and meets his old friend Itchy (Dom Deluise) and plans repayment on Carfax. Meanwhile, Carfax has imprisoned an orphan girl, Anne Marie, for her tremendous ability to talk to all species of animals, predicting races. Charlie and Itchy liberate her and try to help her find a family while learning a lot about themselves. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the few non-Disneys that will appeal to both kids and adults. Kids will enjoy the funny characters and lively animation, while adults will enjoy the nice, sweet plot and the more than normally developed characters. One thing it likes is that it is a musical. Usually this is a good thing, but the music here is frankly horrible. They tend to jump around, almost sounding ad libbed, with no instrumental background. In fact, it's probably the worst songs I've ever heard in an animated movie, but fortunately the rest of the movie is strong enough not to fall apart because of some bad notes. <br /> <br /> The end of this movie works, but I honestly hate it. It's sad, but happy, but more sad than happy, and makes the movie feel it needs a successor. Considering how bad the successor made this, I wish that the end would not justify a successor and it would have wrapped up in a nice, super happy end. This is one of the few movies I feel about this, but I do. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a nice family movie, with strange themes being thrown in, but good fun. <br /> <br /> My rating: *** from ****. 85 min.
