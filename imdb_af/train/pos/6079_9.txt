Shakespeare's plays have a way of exceeding time. The language breaks the time limit somehow. but maybe it's the actors who really do it. <br /> <br /> After the disappointment in Romeo and Juliet (the version with Claire Danes and Leonardo DiCaprio), another modern version of Shakespeare was reluctant. To my surprise Othello was great! <br /> <br /> Iago's character is so well-played by Kenneth fellows! Even if Iago is really angry and despicable, the character is so well played that what Shakespeare intended to be for the charater is a pleasure for the audience to hate. I must say that Fishburne's performance here was really good too. <br /> <br /> I recommend it to Shakespeare scholars and lazy students (who refuse to read the book).
