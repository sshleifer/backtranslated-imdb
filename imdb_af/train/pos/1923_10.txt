8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter Had a Favorable Start. The highly talented Tom Shadyac was involved in the project. That means the comedy would be nothing less spectacular, and that's exactly what happened: the show remains one of the newest, funniest, wittiest shows ever made in a very long time. Every line, facial expression, decisive choice, scene, all became perfect. There wasn't one episode I thought, "Man who wasn't as good as the rest." Each was an outcome. Again, this is the kind of perfectionism we expected from Tom. For those who don't know, Tom Shadyac is the director of Ace Ventura (first film), The Nutty Professor (first one) and Liar Liar. Totally a summary. He is a producer, not a director, but his magical touch is felt in every episode. The family consists of: <br /> <br /> The Father: Paul Hennessy (John Ritter): Nice, slightly neurotic from time to time as a sports writer. Unfortunately, John passed away in 2003 and left a good reminder and almost canceled cancellation contemplation. <br /> <br /> The Mother: Cate (Katey Sagal): Come on, who did not fall in love with Katey when she played Peg on Married To Children? Al Bundy was our hero. Our viewers have the respect and love he never had. But without Peg's nonchalant, parasitic, lazy lifestyle, Al would probably have been just another Chicago dad instead of the mess Peg (life had) caused him. Katey was again a MILF and is still: a brown nude (instead of a redhead) and just as buxom as ever. Cate is the conservative mother and loving woman. I know it sounds boring, but she's perfect for comedies. <br /> <br /> The Ditzy Blonde Daughter: Bridget (played to perfection by Kaley Cuoco): Almost never an idiot played so well. Aside from Gob on Arrested Development, Bridget can be a shoe for any awards given to this archetype. Bridget is level, self-centered, not very bright and a tad in its appearance. She plays the stupid blonde role better than absolutely any IMO. Perfection. One of the highlights of the show. <br /> <br /> The Forgetful Geeky Daughter: Kerry (Amy Davidson): a colored and a geek, she doesn't get any love from life or circumstances. Feel most of the time overlooked, undervalued and neglected. She is Bridget's younger sister (in fact she is older than her) and the two's extremely opposite personalities and brain cause endless clashes, to much of our entertainment. <br /> <br /> The son: Rory (Martin Spanjers): was the second funniest character IMO before passing Ritter, then John passed, new characters came and Rory was not the sensible cracker he used. It mostly went to David Spade's character. <br /> <br /> The characters were most important in the time of John Ritter. Unfortunately, the bad hilarious Larry Miller (one of my favorites) didn't have much screen time. He played Paul's co-worker / rival. After an aortic dissection, Ritter cost his life in September (September 11), the show was for a while. No one thought it could come back, but it did later with some new additions. It started the second phase of the show, and the new characters were: <br /> <br /> The strict, confident principal: Ed (Adam Arkin): I saw Adam here and there on talk shows. It was the first time I saw him. Impressed, is the word I use. His performance was very impressive. Sadly he wasn't brought in earlier. He also plays Cate's potential love interest after Paul is over. The gradual progress in this direction (which was crazy at first) deserves much praise for the creators. Grandpa Jim Egan's (James Garner) attitude: a surprising welcome addition to the series, he was canon for endless 'old' jokes, mainly by ... The 35-year-old unemployed, sensible half-brother of the mother: CJ (played at spooky heights by David Spade): I knew Spade was funny, I just didn't know he was this funny. Somehow, Spade's well-known presence in his character (as opposed to a separable character), which is understandable, is seen as being a comic and a comedy show. This ominous feeling is a bit that someone can borrow a lot of material from David Spade's performances in films, talk shows and features (awards, etc.) and deliver an excellent version of Spade's voice and comedy style, except that it is SPADE. By that I mean you realize he's not trying to play someone else or a whole new character: he's the goofy, funny spade we've come to know and he takes this pleasing, humorous formula to the top. Every line he pronounced, every sarcasm he had, became literal. Spade was CRAZY-funny; So, so funny. <br /> <br /> The show's humor and drama were both up and running after the show was back, but audiences thought, "John has passed, it's no longer the same." This is understandable as we are talking about a group of people (American viewers) who gave 'Yes Dear' a free ride, but have Andy Richter Controls cancel the universe. As the quality of the display increased, its ratings declined. Soon it was unfortunately no longer. <br /> <br /> And I best saved for the last: fans of Married With Children is a surprise. And boy, what a spoil it was. I still shake just to remember it. It is a surprise so good that it will be fun for me to spoil it, even though I justify it under the "spoiler" excuse. Don't say it's something you will never forget. I know I won't :-)
