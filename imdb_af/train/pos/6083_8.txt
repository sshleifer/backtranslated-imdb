Brian Dennehy, Bill Paxton, Joe Pantalino and best of all, Jeff Fahey, all in one movie. Wow is all I can think of. These are four of the most underrated actors in the Biz and they work beautifully together. It's like poetry the way they play each other and make the natural ability stick out as if they were the best friends for eons to even shoot the movie. <br /> <br /> The movie itself is good and one that can be quite intense to see for the first time, and the four stars help the re-watch ability to a great extent. I can't describe how good it was to see Bill Paxton and Jeff Fahey on the screen together. The biggest moment is when they look a few from a distance and fill the chorus themselves, it almost brought a tear to my eyes. <br /> <br /> A good movie, good role, will look. Why? Four words, Fahey, Dennehy, Paxton, Pantalino.
