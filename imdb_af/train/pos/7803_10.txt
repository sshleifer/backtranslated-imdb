I just watched this movie in my GCSE history class. It was exciting and was a brilliant insight into what actually happened to Steve Biko at the time of the apartheid law. How anyone can say that this movie was the most boring or dull 2 ​​and a half hours of their lives, I don't know, because it chopped me from start to finish. It was wonderful how Denzel Washington portrayed him and showed how he was fighting against the Apartheid law and getting equal rights for black people. In one part, Steve Biko says to a policeman we are just as weak and human as you are, that is to show them that he and all the other black people in South Africa were no different from the whites. Donald Woods inspired me because he fortified what he believed and didn't believe in apartheid. He and Steve Biko formed a very strong friendship that shook South Africa and woke up the world. I really enjoyed this movie and highly recommended it to people. It helped me see that racism is not right and that everyone is equal, their fate should not be determined by the color of someone's skin. n
