Spielberg's first dramatic movie is not over. It is a beautifully crafted film without any mistakes about the life of an African American woman. It also proves that not all films have African American ethnicity, as the center of the story should be shrouded by an African American director. <br /> <br /> What I like about this movie is Spielberg's ability to make it very realistic despite being based on a book. Furthermore, Danny Glover was excellent as Mr. And usually he is just most of his movies. But from this he breaks out completely and is someone else for once. But the performance of the entire film comes from Whoopi Goldberg. She's great like Celie. You will never forget these characters once you have seen this movie. <br /> <br /> Now I hear that its musical version is also going to be a movie, and all I can say is: I hope it's about as good as this one, because this one is a movie which should not be missed.
