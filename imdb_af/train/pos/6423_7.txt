This movie is an incredible, incessant laugh-riot in which all the common ingredients of a David Dhawan comedy are included. Bumbling heroes, buffoonish supporting characters, heroine made dolls, nasty villains, wisecracks, rocking soundtrack + choreography and a small dose action. <br /> <br /> Both Amitabh Bachchan and Govinda are in dual roles of policemen and cones. Amitabh's heroine the policeman is Ramya Krishnan and Raveena is the policeman opposite Govinda. Heroines are like usual rooibos infections. The cones have no heroines. Paresh Rawal carries on his scandalous act in DAUD (he also played a similar Don in KHOOBSURAT). Asrani shines in a brief role. He is reviving on his famous "Angrezon ke Zamaan ke Jailer" activity in SHOLAY. <br /> <br /> Govinda is impeccable as usual - as a wisecracking, good-tempered policeman Pyaare Mohan and as a wife Chhote Miyaan. He mimics Hindi's Bihari style which speaks with hilarious results. Amitabh Bachchan, believes it or not, lights up with him. But still AB is good. Madhuri Dixit does a comedy like herself in the song "Makhna". She dances like wind. <br /> <br /> Viju Shah's music is wonderful. Watch out "Kisi Disco Mein Jaayen", "Makhna" and the title track. <br /> <br /> Don't be looking for any LOGIC because it's a comedy and the script is quite comfortable. Just enjoy yourself.
