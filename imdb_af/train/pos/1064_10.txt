I was just surprised why damn FOX canceled the season 3, although season 2 was not as good as season 1, it is indeed excellent !!! I really enjoy thinking about buying DVD on Amazon. (Fail !: _ (I'm a Chinese student and it's uncomfortable for me to get an international credit card and $.) I just hope FOX can bring DA back daily!
