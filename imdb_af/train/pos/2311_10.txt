Reese Witherspooon's first movie. Was crazy about it. In addition, the plot and the play were. You are emotionally involved with the characters. In my opinion one should see. <br /> <br /> After watching this movie, you will see why Reese Witherspoon's scene was so successful. <br /> <br /> The other cast members also do a good job. <br /> <br /> The movie flows very well. There is not a boring moment in the whole picture. The man in the moon's length is just right. <br /> <br /> As I said earlier, I think this movie was excellent. I've seen it several times and enjoy each one of the views.
