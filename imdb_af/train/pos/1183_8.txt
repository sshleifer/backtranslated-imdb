A man lives after 45 years of marriage. He must also solve the problem of the family cow, Tulip, who refuses to milk himself. So far he visualizes his wife who was the one Tulip mixed. <br /> <br /> Tulip is based on a true story told in Griffith's family, of her grandparents' gender. The film is a nostalgic look back on a vanishing way of life, one where people still had responsibility for each other, in the lush green Victorian (Australian state, not the era) countryside. <br /> <br /> Author and director Griffiths apparently has further ambitions in both areas, and this multiple award-winning 15 minute short is a fine start to her rule.
