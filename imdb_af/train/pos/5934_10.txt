Sorry to say I have no idea what Hollywood is doing. Sure gives us movies like Batman Begins. Oh, then, Hollywood, I think they may cover the story line in the movie Batman, but don't entertain us what we want, we want to see Batman and Superman together. I really hated this trailer because it wanted me more. I looked around to see when it came out. It was like a terrible practical joke. The graphics where the story line looks solid and it has all the bumps of a big movie. Unfortunately, this will not happen now. Good work to the producers, directors and all the actors, but I hate you to do it for me. You made me want more.
