"Party Girl" capitalizes on the awesome charm of Parker Posey. In fact, the movie sometimes seems to be a vehicle in which Mrs. Posey can play herself, as usual in real life. <br /> <br /> The movie, led by Daisy Von Scherler Mayer, is a surprise to me. Posey's fans. Mrs. Von Scherler Mayer takes us on a wild trip to Lower Manhattan to show us this aimless soul whose life is dedicated to having fun in the various clubs she regularly visits. This is an era that was still naive than that area and the adjacent Meat Market districts. There are at least no pretensions in the movies and we see people on the earth going normally to their lives if we can call it that way. <br /> <br /> Parker Posey makes a wonderful Maria. This is because of Parker Posey we enjoy the movie more than any other actress Mary played. She is the whole picture. The rest of the roll is good.
