Most 70's (and 80's) Kong Kong art films hardly play like movies; usually there are some well-planned battle sequences, but the plot is slightly thinly screwed to fill in the gaps between nodes - such as porn movies. Really, but this one does very well. Most openly, there is the direction and choreography, which limits each warrior to a 'style' - it is really based on the Chinese circus acrobatic and comedic theater, but the effect works. <br /> <br /> Secondly, there is the language of the camera, which uses impressive techniques (even according to today's standard), changing real-time projection rates to slow motion, and from unfiltered to filtered views for story direction portray the past or the future. <br /> <br /> The construction is at least open but most powerful and unexpected. The winner of this game is determined by who unfolds the story. The master (the author) sets up a game where the main character does not know who he is looking for, which is the same situation as our viewers. One by one, he figures who is who at the same pace we find out who is who. It all follows a tragedy / noir bow. The end tends to irony, a la "The Sting". Much more clever things than we usually get from this genre. <br /> <br /> The "five friend" idea is the template for Tarantino's deadly assassins from "Kill Bill" volumes.
