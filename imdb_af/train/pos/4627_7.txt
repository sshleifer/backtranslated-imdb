If you're going to play a play in prison walls, isn't it for the best playwright William Shakespeare? And if you choose your role from a lot of criminals who serve long sentences for the most horrific crimes, you can be sure there will be enough time for rehearsals. In a Kentucky correctional prison, a courageous project like this was undertaken with great results. This film shows how it's all done. The casting. The rehearsals. The set and costumes and the final presentation of Shakespeare's play The Tempest. It hasn't happened to me before, but there is an analogy between the establishment of the play and the correctional prison. In the play, the shipwrecked characters are limited to an island with no contact with the outside world. The prison life is also so much. <br /> <br /> With a simple, retracted drop of a surrounding sea cape, the characters in a pleasant variety of costumes can close their lines to an approving audience, not quite be sure Shakespeare intended, but with good heart and true sincerity. <br /> <br /> More interesting than the game itself was the little cameos of every man behind his character. One resident saw the play as a lesson in forgiveness as a salvation of his sins. It was quite mobile to see the men wiping a tear as they spoke of murder, shooting and strangulation. One has the feeling that they all want to get the clock back and reconsider their brutal actions. But (as someone said) the past was over, and the present was the beginning of a new future. At least the play temporarily relieved the depressive thoughts of the past. <br /> <br /> The prison authorities must be welcomed to make the play happen. Such an event will put Kentucky on the map and hopefully other prisons can follow their example. It seems to me that everyone will not only benefit the Kentucky prison, but also the prisoners themselves who need new confidence and confidence and be prepared for the day when they go on parole.
