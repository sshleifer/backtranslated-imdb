For persons of a certain age, W.W. II was the deciding time of their lives, and whatever followed could never be compared. As the film opens, a recent widow but still vibrant woman (Judi Dench) hears a street musician trying to play the classic song, Stardust. <br /> <br /> It reminds her memories when she is in an almost all-girl band who entertained during the war between bombings. Fortunately, the drummer, Patrick (Ian Holm), avoided the concept and enjoyed the ladies. <br /> <br /> Meet Patrick and Dench's character and decide to re-unite the band, taking them on a series of mini-adventures. Despite ups and downs, the band reunites and makes it a successful repeat. <br /> <br /> The movie is beautifully written and underestimated, with excellent performances by everyone involved. The characters are well developed and all the people who have not ceased, despite their years. And there's all that glorious old swing music! <br /> <br /> It's not Steven Spielberg's pacification, but a serious movie. The war has all affected and the lesson has not been forgotten in a movie that is not afraid to entertain as it teaches.
