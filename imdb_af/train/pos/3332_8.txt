Yes, commitment. Let's say "Fever Pitch" can trick you into believing it's a baseball movie. <br /> <br /> But no, you don't have to be a baseball fan to really enjoy this picture of the Farrelly Brothers. But of course, if you're one, you'll enjoy it even more. with all the references (fairly accurate, I want to say) to the Boston Red Sox and its bittersweet history; from the curse of the Bambino and all that is attributed to it, including the two words you cannot point out to Boston's fan: Bill Buckner. <br /> <br /> Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon portray two people who are usually second thoughts to enter into a relationship: the successful workaholic who is also wealthy to meet a school teacher? Thing is, Fallon's character wins Barrymore's heart by funny, caring, sweet and straight perfect. But her friends ask her a logical question: if he is such a custodian, why is he still on the market? Enter the Boston Red Sox. He has been so dedicated to his team since his uncle that he has transferred his Sox season tickets to him; He hasn't missed a Red Sox home match at Fenway Park for a long time yet. <br /> <br /> And that delicate balance, how much is the workaholic willing to give up for his husband's obsession; and how much is the baseball mad teacher willing to compromise to keep the OTHER love of his life that this movie is about. <br /> <br /> Initially, you might think the sporting session is exaggerated by comedy relief. Well, I'm sad to admit they're not. Myself, as a strong Houston Astros fan, can say they are all true. I will try to see every Stros game in every way possible; listen to them on the radio or follow them on the internet. I read the Chronicles' sports department every day. And yes, my room looks like The Shed, Minute Maid Park's gift shop; With a box full of Astros gear, including 5 jerseys, 20 t-shirts and you know the rest. Fallon's character even features the Red Sox MBNA MasterCard. <br /> <br /> Fallon was credible enough as the fanatical Red Sox lover, though he could do it without being a cartoon. (Thank you Adam Sandler wasn't in it.); and the plot reversed how this couple tried to manage each other's passions. <br /> <br /> I'll say it will be a classic romantic comedy. Not enough to be among the best films in history; but definitely breaks into the genre and is attractive enough for men and women.
