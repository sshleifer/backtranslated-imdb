This is a very funny Ealing comedy about a community in London, which, through unusual circumstances, discovers that they are not English, but is an appendix of the French province of Burgundy. <br /> <br /> The movie comic actor Stanley Holloway (known as Alfred Doolittle in MY FAIR LADY), as well as an army of other classic comic actors of the period. <br /> <br /> The story was apparently based on a news article at the time, when the Canadian government "officially" gave a hotel room to a visiting European royal member. The idea actually reminded me of the real case of the Hutt River province in Western Australia, where a landowner of the Australian government separated because of a woolly quota dispute. (It's never been recognized by Western Australian or Australian governments). <br /> <br /> It's a good writing that plays a lot of political and economic issues, rather than the TV program "Yes Minister". as well as a great little eccentric character as well.
