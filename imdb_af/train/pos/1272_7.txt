Enjoyable movie, although I think it has the potential to be even better if it had more depth. It's a mystery halfway through the movie to know why Elly is such an incident. Then, if we finally get an explanation that goes back to her childhood, there's not much detail yet. Maybe they showed flashbacks or something. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's still a good movie I will watch again. 7/10 <br /> <br />
