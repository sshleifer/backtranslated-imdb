My Tasks: A funny start to the lion king, positioning as a successor. Surprisingly amusing. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, "Lion King 1 1/2" is actually another funny straight-to-video, it's worth having a theater treatment. I don't see why Disney released it straight to video, and released free movies like "Chicken Little" and "Theater to Return to Neverland". These movies are better seen in the video stores (in the "new releases" area) rather than seeing their theater posters outside the theaters. <br /> <br /> This one is just a spoof of the first movie (although events in "Simba's Pride" have not yet taken place), on Timon (pronounced by Nathan Lane) and Pumbaa's (pronounced by Ernie Sabella ) position. We see them making fun of the events in the first movie. Original voices of the first film, such as Matthew Broderick, Woopie Goldberg, Cheeche Martin and Robert Guillaume, return to their first film cast, while Julie Kavner and Jerry Stiller give spectacular comedy relief like Timon's mom and uncle. /> <br /> So it doesn't sound fun. Maybe not now, but look for yourself. The fact that it is not as serious in its plot makes it more enjoyable. It's similar to MST3000 with Timon and Pumbaa. <br /> <br /> Video movie rating: *** 1/2 out of 5.
