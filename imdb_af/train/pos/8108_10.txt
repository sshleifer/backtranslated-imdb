I have, "Things to come," on D.V.D. and this is very clear compared to my VHS version. The sound is fair, but can sometimes be difficult to understand. <br /> <br /> I loved the movie so much that I searched and found a copy of the book. It gave details of why some things happened. The best thing about the movie is the little things I didn't even notice. For example, John Cabal plays with a toy plane at a Christmass party, as if it were a dive bomber, with the exception of sea force by calling a "Dinosuar" battleship. Ships are sunk by air force, an unexplained hostile attack by aircraft. Fly flying planes. Strong roles for the women throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> There's more, see the movie to enjoy it.
