Brazilian films often get more positive values ​​than they actually deserve. On the contrary, Contra Todos (Teen All) (original title, which the producers threw away: God Against All) has a very low GPA (grade average) in this site. It seems to be undoubtedly rejected by female spectators in general. Actually, it's not that cruel. I mean graphic violence. His cruelty is intrinsic, as it portrays, is lumpens, I mean underprivileged civilians who actually have high-tech equipment, which exchange feverish murder orders in exchange for "grana goddess". Is this postmodern man? Is his / her alone worried about a quick, almost impersonal, ultra-permissive leak, amid saturating meals? The picture is probably the best Brazilian movie of 2004. Its brilliant editing style, à la Godard, its curious soundtrack contrast, its more than effective overall cast and especially its original narrative, with subtle, non-chronological hidden points first in the epilogue come, earn at least 8 mark.
