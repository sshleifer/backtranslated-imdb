Look at this movie for the beautiful images of Andy Goldsworthy's sculptures and treat yourself to a thorough eye-opening and relaxing experience. The music complements the footage perfectly, but never draws attention to itself. Some commentators have called the maintenance buttons with the artist a weak spot, but consider it: why would you expand it into a movie, if you can read Andy's muscles in his books for long, or attend one of his excellent lectures? This medium is much more suited to show the ephemeral nature of the artist's works and is expertly used in this regard.
