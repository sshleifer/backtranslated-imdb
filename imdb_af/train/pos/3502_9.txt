Wow! I loved this movie and love Judy Marte !! This girl is not only a beautifully beautiful face, she is funny and really talented !! She made me laugh many times, just because she was very rough with Victor who made her desperate! We'll see her a lot in the coming years ... and probably also director Peter Sollett and co-star Victor Rasuk! <br /> <br /> Raising Victor Vargas is one of the best movies I've seen. a long time! Very refreshing! It is true, nice, funny, well-filmed, it has everything: good story, good actors, good filming! <br /> <br /> If you like simple, slow pace, real life, urban movies, like Jersey Smith's Kevin Smith, you'll love Victor Vargas! It's better!
