Saw it on SBS TV here in Australia the other week, where it was titled "Laputa: Castle in the sky". I activated subtitles, and I think SBS provided their own for it, which was usually of very good quality. <br /> <br /> Just look at "Laputa" on Wikipedia and confirm what I suspect ... The swinging island of this story is taken from the classic Jonathan Swift novel "Gulliver's travels", which is early in the mid-1700s. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is an engaging Japanese fairy tale, which contains an English version. Speaks voice-cast. It is suitable for young children, I think, but it only lasts for two hours, so it may be too long for some, but not for an adult like me. <br /> <br /> The story is about two children trying to find a legendary floating island that has a castle on it. The children are not the only ones looking for this island. They have beaten pirates, the army and the spies looking for the island and the children (Sheeta, the girl, captured by Anna Paquin and Pazu, the boy, spoken by James Van Der Beek), to help find them it. <br /> <br /> The graphics are wonderful ... kind of photo-realistic at times, especially the plays of brickwork illuminated by torchlight, or the beautiful scenes of bright, sunny days, with white clouds, or mist. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
