My first exposure to "Whale Music" was the Rheostatics album of the same name, which I bought about 1993. I read the line notes and the group said the album, which remains prominent in my collection, was inspired by Canadian writer Paul Quarrington's book. <br /> <br /> I picked up the book a few months later and devoured it! A wonderful read! I have read the book ever since, a new element every time for Desmond and his desire to complete Whale Music. <br /> <br /> I found the movie in 1996 on video. I didn't have very good experiences with Canadian film, but this one worked for me. The role of Claire could have been different, but overall I think Paul Quarrington's vision was beautifully conveyed from the book to the screen. <br /> <br /> Maury Chaykin gives a moving display as the isolated genius. The movie deals with family relationships, love and finding someone who understands. I would highly recommend "Whale Music" to not just music fans, but anyone who has ever lost something or someone and tried to come back to the world.
