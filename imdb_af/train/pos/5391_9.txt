Life begins and ends - in a typical 1930s maternity / recovery ward, where we play 48 hours in the lives of several high-risk pregnant women, played by Loretta Young, Glenda Farrell, Clara Blandick (Aunty Em ???), Vivienne Osborne, Dorothy Tree, and Gloria Shea, as they wait to give birth. While the film features eye-catching devices that are far-reaching today when maternity wards are much more controlled and restricted, it gives us a little back in time to see what birth in a typical city hospital was in 1932 as for our grandmothers and grand - grandmothers. I find the film fascinating and exceptional. <br /> <br /> Oddly, the most outstanding show in this movie comes from a male actor, young Eric Linden as Jed Sutton, Grace's (Loretta Young) man. What an actor! As the first father, Jed is grieved and uncomfortable with hospital staff who brush his worries about his wife because they can brush crumbs from a cafeteria table. I felt his concern very sharp. I'd like to see more of this actor's work. He had a very emotional voice, which was used in Gone With The Wind for unforgettable effects. In that movie, Eric played the young soldier whose leg was amused without anesthesia, shouting, "Don't cut! Don't cut!" as Scarlett fled the hospital. Cold! Another big show is from Aline MacMahon, the girl, Bowers, play. Her character is a salt of the earth, the kind of nurse we all hope to get for our hospital stay, which constantly breaks the hospital rules to show a more human side of the medical profession. <br /> <br /> Here, too, Loretta Young did an excellent working job, a very genuine and deep feel to Grace. Me, she's wonderful in these preschools. I really grew to appreciate her more than actress over the past few months. <br /> <br /> Glenda Farrell played her part in a shrill, unusual mother, a little over for My taste (nobody in 1932 knew that the burning brandy from a hot water bottle was dangerous to the unborn babies' health?) but her character eventually loses herself. <br /> <br /> Also in the film was an unknown Gilbert Roland, silent movie star, as a sad Italian man. His screen time was short, but significant. <br /> <br /> Living Beginning is a preview code, sometimes trying to capture it on TCM, but remember to take a few hints to cry out. 9 out of 10.
