When I was little, my parents got this movie for me to watch. I really liked it, and I watched it over and over. Even when I was in the 3rd grade, I watched it from time to time. Recently I watched it again, just for the sake of nostalgia, and although the show wasn't aimed at my age group (I'm in my late teens), I still found it entertaining and educational. This show teaches good lessons about imagination and comes along well with others. Some parts have found me quite entertaining. Also, this display has no bad content, so you can leave children alone with this view and not worry about those who pick up or do any bad language. I would recommend it.
