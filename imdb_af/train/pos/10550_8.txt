I saw it as part of my course at Aberystwyth University and it makes me a baffle about how it does not have a UK distributor. Well, actually, it doesn't, because this movie is all a Hollywood movie isn't - original, creative, eye-catching and humorous. Nobody really wants to see these movies today, as in the simplest terms, they do not meet the generic conventions that most young viewers see in a movie. <br /> <br /> I wrote I wrote a review for the IMDb for centuries, but tended to make this movie a special mention, even though it was during my 30 minute break between classes! In essence, this is about nothing, since the two main characters are immersed by a hatred of the world in their own world. The brilliance here is how the director retains most of the running time with only two characters, and as the only mise-and-play scene is half a house and a large white empty space. This is mainly due to the star performances of the actors, who both offer good laughter while at the same time adding significant emotional depth. <br /> <br /> I'd like to write a few more, but are on a reasonable time limit. However, I encourage anyone and everyone to try this movie. A very unique concept is brought to the screen in a coherent and well-executed way, combining good performances, a strong writing, good sound design and (reasonably) impressive visual art that creates a very entertaining movie. <br /> <br /> It's just a shame so few people know anything.
