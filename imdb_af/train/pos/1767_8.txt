Steve Carell worked out a career to portray the slightly strange straight man, first on 'The Daily Show' and then in various supporting roles. In Virgin, Carell found a clever and hilarious writing that capitalizes perfectly on his strengths. Carell plays Andy Stitzer, a middle-aged man who lives a quiet, lonely life. Andy is a bit strange, but in an awkward nice old kind. One evening, while socializing with his co-workers for the first time, Andy accidentally revealed that he was a virgin. His co-workers, David (Paul Rudd), Jay (Romany Malco) and Cal (Seth Rogen) initially tease Andy about his situation. But it is clear that all three have a certain respect for the decent man Andy is, and they decide to help him by helping him end his virginity. And so Andy's quest for adulthood begins. Andy is actually innocent, and most of the humor comes from his naive to the situations in which he finds himself throughout the film. Some of the humor is indescribable, but most of it is just well done, intelligent comedy. In addition, I found that some parts of the movie are actually getting nice, as Andy finds himself developing both romantic relationships and friendships for the first time in his life. I'm not trying to portray the movie as a love story or drama; It's a role in your seating comedy. Yet, every good comedy I've ever seen contains enough heart for you to care about the characters. A good comparison will be the 'Wedding Crashers' earlier this summer. Virgin has a similar humor, but may be more vulgar in some of his jokes. I especially liked the end of the movie, which I thought was a perfect way to end the movie. Without giving away anything, it reminded me of "Something about Mary." Very light and fun; It makes you laugh and smile. This is exactly how you should feel when you finish a comedy. I would highly recommend it.
