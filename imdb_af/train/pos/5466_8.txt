Excellent pre-code amoral story with Barbara Stanwyck as the newly inspired (by Nietzsche's writings!) To expel her sensitivity and exploit herself, men use it to their advantage. Not really fair to the German philosopher, but interesting that it came to power Hitler's year. Stanwyck, even in this young version, doesn't do much for me, but she definitely plays well here, and drives herself and the movie forward. There is not so much meat to see here as one might have expected, but many situations and exciting quips and innuendo. Great fun, if not a particularly attractive representation of men and I honestly don't think of a very attractive view of the gold miners. Yet it is life!
