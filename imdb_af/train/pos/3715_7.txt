Well, it was quite a sensitive little number, but I can't help thinking I have seen it before. Remind me of another VCA movie I saw at Poitier called "THE OTHER DAYS OF RUBY RAE". There were also specks of "Welcome to the Dollhouse" and "Ratcatcher" and Lynne Ramsay in its execution. What is to say is that they are not tasteful references ... just that they feel very modern and very fashionable ... which makes me feel that it is closer to advertising (as an approach in style and story) than the work from an original and authentic author to come. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is just ... perfect for my taste. To coral filter (or charcoal) for my taste ... to poorer framed 12mm. That is why the whole impression left me a little far away - beware of art that preaches too easily! The French (they are a conservative bunch) have bought it as the jury has already done ... but Cannes short film selection is notoriously conservative compared to the feature selection, although I wonder what happened in recent years.
