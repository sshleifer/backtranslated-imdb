I think most of the people who commented on this movie do not understand how to watch a movie and / or have little sense of elegance. First, to assess a movie, you need to understand the extent to which everything in the film works. Modern sensitivity requires great drama. No, I don't mean a great setting of characters and plots, but they claim emotional trajectories that are very tragic or very comical. This is a subtle movie. The beauty lies in its subtlety (not to be confused with simplicity). Not the story or the characters are simply in this movie. It's a beautifully filmed film that combines most of sensual, political, human weakness, friendliness ... you call it. The world in which it is set up will be strange and not understood today ... a world where you now and then have to flaunt it, even if you just think you have it. Many people today do not understand that Victorian society was not really Victorian, as people today understand the term. <br /> <br /> This movie helps the record straight.
