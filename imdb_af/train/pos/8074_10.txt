Gypo Nolan (Victor McLaglen) is as poor as anyone on earth. Life in the 1920s Ireland, Gypo and his fellow Irish are part of an underground uprising against the oppressive British. One particular rebel, who wanted to be the English murder, comes back to town secretly. He thinks he can trust his friend Gypo, but the Â£ 20 reward seems tempting. Gypo gets his friend killed and sinks into a pit of despair and drunkenness. Meanwhile, the other Irish rebels are looking for the informant. Gypo, with money burning a hole in his pocket, is immediately their main suspect, but they, who are his friends, do not want to believe it. The story of The Informer is simply in its plot, but complex in its moral and emotional issues. It's easily one of John Ford's most emotional films. What Gypo did was wrong, but we can certainly understand his motives. We also understand his sorry character, and there is a lot of sympathy for him. The writing is also very exciting. That's the kind of tension we are pretty sure we know how everything will end, so we have to tart and go with it. The acting is remarkable. Victor McLaglen, who performed in many of Ford's films, probably has his best performance here (and won an Oscar for that). Every other performer in the movie deserves his or her kudos. In addition to a wonderful screenplay and acting, The Informer is one of John Ford's most expressionist films. I like the darker side of Ford. In his mind, as well as in his themes, the Informer reminds me of two of my other favorite Ford movies, The Long Voyage Home (1940) and The Fugitive (1948); It is also somewhat similar to The Grapes of Wrath (1940) in this regard. 10/10.
