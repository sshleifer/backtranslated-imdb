A wonderful and compelling drama about the hunt for the infamous Russian serial killer Andrea Chikatilo. Stunning performance by Stephen Rea as the forensic scientist in charge of the investigation, which is the main obstacle to his progress, is the Russian government, especially the old communist party members who want to maintain a closed society. <br /> <br /> The film has an underlying theme on the decline of communist society, and progress in the hunt for the murderer is reflected by advances in social and political change in Russia, which are subtly crossed. There is a conflict of old ways and new ways, and this is represented by the two views of Rea's superior (played by Donald Sutherland) and Rea himself. It is first polarized, with Sutherland 'high' in the system looking down, and Rea 'low' on the ground, looking up. But they have a common reason ?? <br /> <br /> The film develops the relationship between these two and gradually relieves tension until the end of the film Rea and Sutherland and Rea and Sutherland have mutual respect for each other, The killer is caught, and Glasnost comes symbolic for. Excellent writing. <br /> <br /> Further credits go to Sutherland's performance, which is wonderful and sympathetic, Jeffrey DeMunn as the murderer we despise but cannot hate, and Max Von Sydow, who is thoroughly convincing as the humble psychologist who dares to help his reputation.
