This is a story of the Winchester Rifle Model 1873 "The Gun That Won The West". For the cowman, banned, peace officer or soldier, Winchester 73 was a particular possession. An Indian will sell his soul to own one. <br /> <br /> Winchester 73 is the first collaboration between director Anthony Mann and actor James Stewart, a duo who will be adding a series of superior Westerners from now on. a new, psychological depth of the genre. Stewart tells the story of Lin McAdam to the man who killed his father. He drives in Dodge City with his trusted friend, Johnny Williams (Millard Mitchell), Lin in Afrikaans Henry Brown (Stephen McNally), the man he wants. But with Wyatt Earp (Will Geer) all the guns of those entering the town, both men cannot get the shootings they are ready for. Rather, the men won a competition to win a Winchester 73 rifle, a competition that Lin finally won. But before he can leave the town with the wonderful prize, the Dutch beat him down, steal the gun and quickly skip the village. As Lin puts in a hate-filled exercise of both the man and the gun, the gun will change several times, with a different dimension each time than the day of reckoning for all approaches. <br /> <br /> Very little Benchmark for what has become known as the so-called "psychological Western", Winchester 73 is basically a story of a decent man who is on the verge of an event in his past. madness driven. The shot in black and white (the only one of the duo Western which was the landscapes) is still spectacular feasts for the eyes. The toes are horse-drawn with the opening scene like Lin and Johnny, and in silhouette, amble over a hill as they make their way to Dodge City. It is just the starting point that would see Mann use his display as a way to interact with his characters with emotional states. <br /> <br /> Stewart gives one of his best and most intense performances as McAdam, who once and for all proves he was one of America's best and most versatile actors. The support throw is also not bad. Shelley Winters is excellent as the only woman in the machismo, while Mitchell, McNally, Geer and the exquisite Dan Duryea add further class to proceedings. There are even some parts for Tony Curtis and Rock Hudson here, the latter playing an Indian brave is a bit too far. <br /> <br /> Originally, the film was a project for Fritz Lang, who even had the writing ready. to run. But Lang turned away from it, something that was a blessing to Western fans. For as big a director as Lang was, Mann (and with a new screenplay from Borden Chase & Robert Richards in hand) moved the wheels to change the course of the genre. Not only with the further efforts Mann & Stewart produced, but also in who they influenced. Like Boett Boetticher, Nicholas Ray and Sam Fuller, everyone made notes, and they were saddened by Western purists. They followed and continued the psychological torch. <br /> <br /> A big hit at the box back On release, Winchester 73 is a beautiful movie that still packs a punch in modern times. 9.5 / 10
