A French film, Ester Williams, will love. But the synchronized swim was just a hook for the story of three girls in a Paris exurbia who found themselves. No matter where Sciamma's sympathy lies, since all the boys are portrayed as "animaux", in fact, only the 3 girls are in focus, and all the time, with the few adults and other adolescents mostly in the background. Marie is a girl's stick, unattractive, but determined. She wants to be a swimmer and complicates herself at Floriane (a beauty quality by one reviewer) and she is also a friend of convenience to Anna: not unattractive, but for her the time of her body's perfection was short and now she is an adolescent in a female body. The result is a journey to self-realization without a road map, but there is a glamor of the three that are natural: where are the joy and careless talks of the youth? While the conservation was breathtaking, beautifully portrayed with Floriane's self-absorption, as well as the equally beautiful union of Marie and Anne, it all looked like Sciamma's dolls.
