Tess of the Storm Country was a Mary Pickford vehicle I was planning to get some time. I finally got a VHS copy for a reasonable price and enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> Maria gives her typical, mocking, innocent sexy portrayal of a wrong-to-the-girl who wins the heart of a rich heir. Only this time is the interest higher: a false murder charge, an illegal child (and consequently wrong motherhood) and suicide. <br /> <br /> One can see why Pickford wants to repeat this one. The story is a true morality story, the kind she wanted to die for. The controversial issues are not always clearly spelled out; a viewer should pay attention and pick up tips to capture everything that is implied during the first viewing? although everything is ultimately explained more or less. <br /> <br /> About the only negative comment I can make, it would be about Jean Hersholt and the dog. Hersholt, whose character, Ben Letts, looks about 6-2, 200 pounds (bigger next to Mary of course!), Fled in the panic when a 60-pound chocolate laboratory came to him! Then, to justify it (or perhaps its confusing fear of the dog), he manages to pinch him on the ground and somehow hurt him so much that he is still struggling for much later. to stand, as a bad storm test! It's the same lovely lab that sleeps with Frederick (Lloyd Hughes) and hugs Mary! Still, Maria pours boiling water into Ben's face, which hardly slows him down! OK, I got rid of Ben and the chocolate lab! Other than that, the movie was quite touching and I definitely kept my attention. Pickford's supportive role was strong and credible. It's probably among her better movies.
