An interesting look at Japan before opening to the West. John Wayne as America's first consul in Japan is in line with agreements arising from Perry's arms diplomacy. He is not welcome. Wayne eventually wins his meeting with the Shogun after being brought under control of a US-launched cholera epidemic. There is a colorful march to the major gifts for the Shogun, including a bottle of Old Tanglefoot. The encounter with the Shogun, the debates among Japanese nobles and an assassination during an archery exhibition offer an interesting look at the politics of the era. Quite a nice movie and besides how often you see the Duke, a battle loses half its size.
