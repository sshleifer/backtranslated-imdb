It was an absolute spell binding series and was sorry I could only get a few shows back when it was in the UK late night. Its style was so different from others of its kind and the whole thing had an unpleasant air of stylish fear for it. All you have to do is read all the positive comments (not a single negative I can see) to realize what was a very innovative series and how it captured the imagination. I understand now from reading the comments it canceled, it's just as incredible. What a lot of "headless overpaid turkeys" had to be (or might still be) to walk around to do it.
