There were too few mainstream films in postcolonial Africa, and those who have it are a mixed group. This one, with its altruistic predictions to expose slavery in the 1970s, shows Africa's best and worst values, which seems to be not too different from the values ​​of humanity as a whole. It also has shortcomings, given the unnecessary influence of western prime concepts of blacks and especially Arabs. <br /> <br /> Dr Anansa Linderby, the beautiful African-American wife of English physician David Linderby, is captured by Arab slave traders, along with a teenage Sanufu girl and a young boy. The main slave trader, Suleiman, is the Arab every stage, with its floral and sometimes humorous rhetoric, and gestures that match - which will not be the place that goes on "Carry On That Camel" but is not the standard . deserve film. Of course, Peter Ustinov had more than enough skills to address some of the shortcomings of the script, and he saved what would otherwise be a turbulent one-dimensional character. <br /> <br /> The stereotypical theme continues, all three of Suleiman's Arab employees are foolish and one has pedophile tendencies towards the boy, fortunately not portrayed on the screen. <br /> <br /> One of David's first ports is the local police officer, a stereotypical pompous and incompetent African. bureaucrat. David meets two stereotypical white ex-pats, an Englishman (Walker, played by Rex Harrison) and an American (Sandell, played by William Holden). Sandell is a mercenary with "conventional" views on mixed-race relationships, who initially refuse to help unless David pays in advance. Conquered by David's love for Anansa, and aware of his own inability to find love, he agrees to pick up David in his helicopter to help find Anansa. They find Suleiman and his prisoners crossing the border and cannot lead them to the neighboring area. Due to Sandell's hesitation and David's lack of experience with firearms, his helicopter is being shot down, but David survives. <br /> <br /> We then see that David was introduced to Malik (Kabir Bedi), an Afrikaner who lost his family to Suleiman and is now only driven by revenge. They find the Sanufu girl with a group of Tuareg and know they are on the right track to find Suleiman. <br /> <br /> In one of the heartbreaking scenes, they murder a party of slave traders just to find it. It was not Suleiman's group and had no choice but to send their prisoners to the Tuaregs they met earlier. <br /> <br /> Later we discover that the young boy raped is a witch doctor and in an excellent scene with supernatural overtones, he uses his knowledge to kill one of Suleiman's henchmen . Anansa from her side - and despite the boy's skepticism - manages the death of Suleiman's two other employees. <br /> <br /> By this time, Suleiman and his slaves were reaching the slave market within days. <Br /> <br /> Suleiman, now no doubt that Anansa is "trouble", attempts to sell her to an obsessive rich Arab prince (Omar Sharif) who is corrupt but intelligent. To discover that Anansa is a US work for the United Nations, the prince decides rather unaware to continue the bargain without considering the consequences. The scene where the two men are in the film is one of the best in the film. <br /> <br /> At the slave market, the young boy is sold to a middle-aged German pedophile, and we still have to guess whether the son will still be considered "miraculous" as his owner at the end of his Witch doctoral skills are. <br /> <br /> Eventually, David and Malik confront Suleiman and there's a bittersweet end of Malik's position. . <br /> <br /> Eventually, David and Anansa are reunited, and Malik, whose life is in ruins, can comfort himself with the task he has completed himself. <br /> <br /> The overall plot of the movie is excellent, but it loses points for its stereotypical depiction of almost all the leading characters. Credit must go to all the leading actors to address many of the shortcomings of the dissertation.
