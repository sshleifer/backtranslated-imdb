Moonwalker is a Fantasy Music movie staring Michael Jackson with different segments. I will judge each segment individually. <br /> <br /> Segment 1 opens the movie with a music video. The music video is a concert by Michael Jackson performing the song "Man in the Mirror". The music video also shows the montage of historical figures such as Gandhi, Martin Luther King JR, John Lennon and more. The first segment was a good choice to open the movie, I liked the song and also loved the montage of the historical figures. I even loved the message in the song. I give the first segment a 9/10. <br /> <br /> Segment 2 shows a fitting of Michael Jackson's start of the Jackson Five to his solo career. The montage I thought was well made, I liked the animation they put in it and I also loved their song choices like "I want you back, Beat it, Thriller, you can feel it and the way you make me feel. " The only thing I wish they could have done a bit better in one of the songs in the montage is: "We are the world". The reason why is everything you see is rainfall and in those drops are images of Michael Jackson and the choir of celebrities, but it's a bit difficult to see the choir. Otherwise, the segment is still good. I give it a 9/10 <br /> <br /> Segment 3 is the song Bad. You probably think it's Michael Jackson's bad music video, yes and no. This segment is the music video, but it is reviewed by Kids. The segment was cute, but it wasn't as good as the other segments. I give it a 6/10 <br /> <br /> Segment 4 is a short Claymation Music movie that takes place after the kid's version of the bad "Speed ​​Demon" called. The shortest point is that Michael Jackson is hunted by his beloved supporters and the press, and he disguises himself as a rabbit and drives a motorcycle to get away from them. The clay in the pursuit was huge, but some parts of the film saw the Claymation characters a bit fake when interacting with real people. Also at the end of the clip out of nowhere comes Michael Jackson rabbit costume alive and he is dancing with it. I like the dance, but it was like nowhere. I give it an 8/10 <br /> <br /> Segment 5 is Michael Jackson's Grammy Win Music Video "Leave Me Alone." The music video is about the media that put their nose on Michael Jackson's personal life and Michael Jackson feels they won't leave him alone, no matter how much he proves innocent. The music video really speaks out (but remember it happened before child molestation it is all about the rumors of him in the 80's.) But I didn't feel that this video should be in this movie because it is a child. Movie and I don't think child's will understand what he's singing. I give this music video 8/10 <br /> <br /> Segment 6 leads us to the main story of the whole movie called "Smooth Criminal." Michael Jackson plays a gangster who uses his power of desire as a crime figure for children (including John Lennon's son Sean Lennon) of an Evil Mobster, Bigg (played by Joe Pesci) to protect. The segment I was thinking about was the movie, especially when he sang the song "Smooth Criminal" and sang with a lot of criminals. I also thought the special effects were good. The strange thing about the Segment is why children go out with a grown man and it never explained why. Joe Pesci's character also talks about drugs and what he plans to do with them. I mean why would you talk about drugs in a children's movie. Otherwise it was good. My rating for this segment is an 8/10 <br /> <br /> Segment 7 is the final segment of the entire movie. The movie ends with Michael Jackson singing a cover version of the Beatle's Song "Come Together" and then during the credit we see Michael Jackson singing with Ladysmith Black Mambazo. Michael has a good cover of "Come Together" and I think it was a good idea to include a good singer with a talented musician like him. My rating is 9/10 <br /> <br /> This movie is a good Michael Jackson movie. I think it really brings children's imagination. The movie is almost as impressive as the Beatles animated movie "Yellow Submarine" if you love Michael Jackson and you're in a movie with a lot of creativity, that's the movie. My overall rating for this movie is 8/10
