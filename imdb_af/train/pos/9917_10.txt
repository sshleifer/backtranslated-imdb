This is the most confrontational documentary I have ever seen. It was a simple and breathtaking view of a beautiful idea. Based on photos of the hidden industrial provinces based on China's modern industrial growth, Edward Burtynsky is facing life that we have so easily chosen to ignore. <br /> <br /> No political parties, this movie is a neutral moving picture of realities that our Western societies prefer not to educate us - the by-products of economic growth, the externalities of the citizens of the less developed communities are paid, the source of our convenience and the waste of our consumer life. /> <br /> Wonderful, heartbreaking, impossible to ignore. It's a challenging journey, but it's worth taking. Please stop being steady and at least see these pictures of the truth without putting any pressure on these issues. 10/10 definitely!
