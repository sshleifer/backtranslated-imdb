This is the movie I've seen more than any other (I believe I've seen it once a year on average since it's released). And every time I see it, it's equally fantastic and always reveals something new to me. The role-play was probably a combination of the best ever in ex-Yu cinematography. This movie is an absolute must for any self-respecting movie lover. In the same league: Maratonci trce pocasni krug, Balkanski spijun and Otac na sluzbenom putu. It's a poker movie that everyone should have in their private video collection.
