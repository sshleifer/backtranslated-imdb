Of course if you read my review, you've seen this movie already. 'Raja Babu' is one of my favorite characters. I just love the concept of a spoiled brat with a 24 * 7 servant on his motorcycle. Look at movies and characters characters etc. Etc. I love the scene when a stone cracks in Kader Khan's mouth while eating. Also, where Shakti Kapoor presents a critical story of Raja Babu's affairs on a table and Govinda wears 'dharam-feather' uniform makes sentimental remarks. It's my favorite scene of the movie. 'Achcha Pitaji To Main Chalta Hoon' scene is just chemistry between two great Indian actors doing a comic scene without dialogue. Its brilliant. This is a cat mouse movie. Just look at these actors who help each other and take the scene away from each other. The total entertainment. If you like Govinda and Kader Khan chemistry then it's a must. I think RB is 6th in my list by David Dhawan. 'Deewana Mastana', 'Ankhein', 'Shola or Shabnam', 'Swarg', Coolie no 1 'precede this jewel of a movie. 10/07.
