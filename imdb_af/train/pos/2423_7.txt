Once in a lifetime, it once means a hoodlum, always a hoodlum, and no one gets in or out of The Life for free. New York neighbors sell drugs and run scams because they can't make it into the legal world, perhaps because they have a criminal record, or a drug habit, or because they're just lazy. This simple storyline, with a few twists on mostly despicable characters, manages to leave the audience compassion for its main players because of their loyalty and compassion for one another. The film was written, produced and directed by Laurence Fishburne, who also died as 20/20 Mike (all nicknames hoodlums), and is based on his play Riff Raff. It feels like a play from beginning to end, especially during the longest scene where the three main players decide to trust in square. Often the dialogue comes very quickly, much faster than it would be on stage, and I think it's the biggest mistake of the movie. Movie flashes in the movie are poems from the street, a kind of iambian pentameter rap, it's violent and tempting for the world to make this movie known. The poetry makes it difficult to dismiss these men, deceive and betray these hoodlums, which are abusive to each other, or unworthy of our attention or contempt. The disturbing thing about this movie is that its realism not only shows us how these people live, but how they suffer for the same reasons as us all. The one is too stupid, another a junkie, and the last one suffers from the conscience while the audience wonders or even laughs at the irony of gangsters who long for him to hang in the gallows to joke in the middle of his tell ruin.
