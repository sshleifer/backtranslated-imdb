The start of this movie is a bit clunky and confusing, but stuck, because you're in for the ride of your life. The concept is compelling, with interesting devices used to tell the overall story. There are good performances everywhere, with Phillip Seymour Hoffman's the best of the cast-no surprise there. Ethan Hawke also earns credit for a very strong performance. The direction of Mr. Lumet is outstanding. The movie felt like a seventies in the sense that there were risks in the story of this story, but unlike most trite films that populate the landscape today, it is a thrill that is genuinely based on relationships rather than special effects or product plugs. . You will be highly rewarded for the time invested in this movie.
