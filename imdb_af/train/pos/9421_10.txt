Contains * spoilers * - also my quotes may not be exact. <br /> <br /> Everyone always mentions the satire in social commentary and economic parallels - how true. But for me, I see this movie so much more than that. I love the symbolism of this man in a glowing white suit. There is so much confusion and filth in the world around him, but it won't stick. Alec Guiness was the perfect guy to play it - his boyish grin and eternal curiosity are so appropriate: <br /> <br /> "It's inventive - can you tell me what's the ratio of ink to gasoline?" <Br /> <br /> The only moment of defeat is when he realizes that his invention has not worked at all - standing almost naked. Still, more than shame is the simple disappointment that "it didn't work." He is never really intimidated by people. Remember, <br /> <br /> "But Sidney, we also want to stop it." <br /> <br /> Just hesitate for a moment before trying to get away. Does he show any signs of the pain that such a betrayal should have caused? No. <br /> <br /> Also worth mentioning is Dapne's role. She is sick and tired of money and strength. She thought she had finally found love outside her father's company. Initially she no longer gave Sidney more than anyone else. But that moment when he dropped off her car, she went back to see if she had killed him - and yet he still thought of the beauty of his invention. She eventually found something she thought was worth living. The funny thing is that it's not even romance. It is friendship, but of such an ephemeral nature that the title hardly fits. It is more admiration and perhaps even inspiration. <br /> <br /> Upon discovering that Michael has no true love for her and that her father is totally incapable of caring for her, she gives cynicism and tries to tempt Sidney. Fortunately, she finds that people in this world really live for more than power, money and lust. What a refreshment: <br /> <br /> "Thank you Sidney. If you had said" yes, "I think I would have strangled you." <br /> <br /> I like the end, when all these crazy things seem to have come to nothing. But then the bustling, sneaky beating starts and Sidney goes off, his stride fits the song: relentlessly. Where's Daphne? We don't really know - but they weren't really in love and she wasn't really a scientist. He escaped help and she had a shot in the arms of hope. "(Pollyanna) A past relationship would have been nice, but as Billy Joel says" it's more than I hoped ... "<br /> <br />
