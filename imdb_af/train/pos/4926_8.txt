Elia Kazan, one of the best theater directors this country has ever had, has shown that he is equally at home with movies. With 'Panic in the Streets', Mr. Kazan gives us an early version of what would come later, with perhaps his masterpiece "On the Waterfront", although both movies share only the water setting, because they are different visions of different subjects. <br /> <br /> Mr. Kazan shot in place in New Orleans. The adaptation by Daniel Fuchs of the Edna and Edward Anhalt stories, which is the basis of the film, is remarkable because it visits us to places that do not dare to see when they visit "The Big Easy". One of the great assets of this film is the wonderful black and white film art by Joseph MacDonald showing New Orleans at its best. Also the music of Alfred Newman and the song by Billie Holiday gives the proceedings a nice touch. <br /> <br /> This movie can be shot in New York or another Northern big city, because it offers our characters what is more like "brocline" than maybe a southern accent you have in that part of the country can hear. <br /> <br /> One thing comes clear in the movie, Jack Palance, making his screen debut, smoldering the screen every time one sees him. He was so intense! At the same time, this difficult man shows a gentle side of him when he sees that his infamous, unknown, is afflicted with a fatal disease. Blackie, comforts this man who adorns his sweat face and leaves his hands through the dying man's greasy hair. Also striking was that Mr. Palance and Mr. Most of them were doing their own stunts, something so refreshing because both actors really looked like it. <br /> <br /> The film also offers a normal start with the introduction of the Reed family at the beginning of the movie. We see a family man painting paints with his young son. Later, he and the woman talk about how they don't seem to end up with his salary, something that many families have to deal with daily. Richard Widmark, playing a normal person is not as effective as when this actor plays more cunning and intense people. Barbara Bel Geddes, like the woman, sounds like she's a suburban woman from Connecticut. <br /> <br /> The movie is nice thanks to Mr. Kazan's direction and the excellent role in the film.
