This movie truly takes the feeling of freedom ... and what the freedom of your own integrity is worth .... in the most beautiful, lighter way. Not a serious but hilarious adventure. <br /> <br /> The story reflects life. We don't always get what we want right now, but we find out we need what we need to understand why we didn't get what we wanted ... which leads us to get more than we thought we would get it! You will get it as soon as you see the movie. <br /> <br /> And this movie is really about finding love and knowing that one has found it and that it has completely changed man's life. <br /> <br /> It's one of my all-time favorites .... .. not easy to find, but worth the hunt ......... I guarantee you more see once!
