Love Rosario Dawson, she thinks is one of the best actresses of the modern era. <br /> <br /> Descent seems to be more about self-empowerment than anything else. It's the consistent undertone in everything in the movie. The dialogue is flat, the characters seemingly deliberately soft and one-sided. The only consistency is the representation of self-empowerment in the characters and Rosario's journey from self-empowerment to loss of empowerment and back. <br /> <br /> It's not appropriate to place it as a rape class, and that's probably why so many people don't enjoy the movie. The standard 'rape' hearing won't be like this movie, and maybe it's the point? The film asks more questions than it answers, and it confronts its target audience, whether they like it or not. There is a compelling relationship between the characters and the target audience, and while the film does not hit the face of the face with self-righteous pride, it involves the viewer for what may or may not be the wrong reasons. <Br /> <br /> Descent is a good movie that is seriously underestimated by IMHO.
