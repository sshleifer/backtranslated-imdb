A very unique Sci-Fi animated movie, and frankly I like uniqueness, no matter what it is, better or worse. This French film is very interesting to watch, the technique part is innovative, like "Waking Life" I recently watched. <br /> <br /> It took me quite a while to get used to the black and white style, but eventually I like it, the sketches are really fancy! The contracted future world is a symbol of the ultimate destination of the human race, of which I love it. <br /> <br /> The whole plot is fine for a scientific bike, not so intriguing, but it's like some Hollywood products, a huge conspiracy about man's eternity, a little clich√© and the distorted end is not so convincing, a little bit of development is just too simple and unbiased and the whole movie is too long. So I think I'm "I'm just in love with the style this movie shows, others aren't that good. <br /> <br /> For eternity of life, I think most people came to unanimity that we don't want eternity because it destroys The meaning of life, our treasures our lives because they limit and meaningful, if everyone can live forever, so the world will be a disaster and chaos. Saving someone you love is hard and sad, but it is also a way to show our lives are real and all emotions fulfill your life and make the world colorful and vibrant.
