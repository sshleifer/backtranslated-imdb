The subsequent two seasons of this original series were less than slim. The latter seasons contributed disastrous reform to the three lifespan of the season. Perhaps if the plug was pulled after the first season, it would follow a cult. <br /> <br /> In addition, the first season was actually hilarious! Sharp, smart with beautiful writing, it was promising. The first season's excellent brewing had the right ingredients - characters / actors, storyline and so on. Plus a comedy about a paparazzi reporter was originally to begin. Nora and her fellow photographers, night after night, day to day for the exclusive. <br /> <br /> Many things don't make me sense. As it shows, and another fav of mine, Gross Pointe never made it. If only the first seasons of the Nude Truth and Grosse Pointe were released on DVD, can you get someone out there?
