I have never seen many online movies in most of my life, but if I choose any of them, I will choose Spatula Madness. A clever reference to most movies like star robber (etc.), using a camera, and Jason Steele made art to make a normal picture in a painting, and then everything with frame-by-frame create animation to occupy a world by getting spatulas. The story starts in the middle, how is it going to delight directors? then the waist at the beginning, and so on, when I first looked at it, I expected a bad pixely look, but Jason, like me, Looks, so every detail has taken to the maximum. Although I do not recommend it to children, or would anyone like it next to me, but just looking for it on the net (it's a short movie, watching movie cows), my style reminds me of the South Park, but less violent . 10 for the look, 6 for the laugh and 6 for the story, it all comes on a 10/10, good job. <br /> <br /> Jason Steele, I'm eager to see the movie.
