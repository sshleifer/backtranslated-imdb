OK, I don't really think Trailer Park Boys has bad story lines because they kick ass. They only have conflict with each other. <br /> <br /> For example: At the end of the movie, Ricky and Julian show "Patrick Lewis" to walk and walk the dog. Then at the end, it shows Ricky and Julian say they were in jail for 2 years. In the TV series pilot, the first clip they show is the same clip by Ricky and Julian screaming at "Patrick Lewis". But in the TV series they are probably only 18 months in prison. <br /> <br /> They also give us the impression that the story line of the movie and the story line of the TV series is connected (because of the screaming between the guys). But some actors depict totally different characters. Of course, Patrick Roach plays "Patrick Lewis" in the film, but in the series he plays Randy. Sam Tarasco plays one of the guys Ricky pays out for an extinction, and then plays Sam Losco in the series. <br /> <br /> Also (again ... I know, I have a lot to say), in The movie, the guys sneak coke instead of smoking hash. The thing is, they never actually confirm that the two story lines are anyway different from the screaming scene. <br /> <br /> Sorry to keep blabbing.
