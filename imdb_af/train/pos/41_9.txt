"Who did this?" contains lots of surefire laughs and gags. Not only is it one of the best Stooges movies with Shemp, it's one of the best short comedies Columbia produced. Director Bernds originally wrote the script for the Stooges in 1946, but when Curly Howard had a professional outcome, it was adapted to the Columbia comedy team from Schilling and Lane (their version was released as "Pardon My Terror.") Of course it was too good for the Stooges to succeed, and it was eventually filmed by the Stooges at the end of 1947. Old Man Goodrich calls ace detectives Shemp, Larry and Moe fearing he will be killed. When they arrive at his home, Goodrich disappears, and his cousin and assorted goons try to get rid of the Stooges. Will they find Goodrich and bring the cousin and goons to justice? <br /> <br /> Shemp is especially funny in this movie. His reactions after giving a mickey by Christine McIntyre are wonderful; he gives his trademark sound (eeeb-eeeb-eeeb) and me. McIntyre is not trying to laugh! Other funny scenes: The proximity of Moe's cup looks through the camera lens; and the in-the-dark battle with all involved members. <br /> <br /> Nikko the goon (played by Duke York) is one of the most unusual search characters ever portrayed in a Stooges movie. With his hair cut, he could almost go for a Stooge, if he didn't tower over everyone! "Who did this?" is a gem among the Stooges movies with Shemp. Even the tough curly fans will enjoy this one! A true Stooge classic. 9 out of 10.
