A nice little game opened with Trevor Howard in his hunt-convertible and ending at a quay in Liverpool. This is all the excitement and dumping, as the ex-spy has to restart his career just as he does some serious R&R catalog butterflies (how British is that?). <br /> <br /> Trevor Howard and Jean Simmons from London to Newcastle by Tyne to Liverpool (via Ullswater) - he's just thrown out of MI5 or something, and she guesses, is up and running, wrongly accused of murder. There are seedy docks, rolling Lake District hills, sheep, country pubs, hairdressers lost, waterfalls, a bunch of amateur cyclists, rooftop hunting, and lots of Chinamen (don't ask), and that's all Hitchcocky and Hannayesque ... <br /> <br /> .. and a great example of British Noir ...
