You know, this movie is not that good, but I mean, that's, it's about angels helping a baseball team. I find the plot line scary anyway. This child's father says he'll take him back if the angels win the winners (because he knows they won't). The child prays to his false god to help the angels win. God helps all the time (via angel Christopher Lloyd, RIP) And in the end his father doesn't take him back and ride his motorcycle right in the kids. It's hilarious until Danny Glover accepts it and it's a friend. <br /> <br /> I think the front is that the old woman is left alone to die with her stitchin projects and her stories.

As a movie about the mysteries of blind, stupid faith and the nature of God, "it gets a 10.
