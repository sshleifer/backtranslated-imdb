Movie "comedies" these days are generally 100 minutes of toiletry, dirty language, and lee cups. Modern comedies appeal to the lowest common denominator, the relentless and slow brain. Certainly, an occasional good comedy will come together, but they are becoming less and less rare. <br /> <br /> "Mr Mixings shows his Dream House" that 1940's Hollywood was capable of, and it's just screaming funny. Jim and Muriel Mixtures (Cary Grant and Myrna Loy) decide to build a house in the Connecticut suburbs. The film follows their story, starting with house hunting trips, the house's turbulent construction, up to the finished house - with its "zuzz-zuzz water mixer". <br /> <br /> Grant and Loy is ideal for their roles, of course (Grant is particularly funny as he looks at home-run costs). However, the film is stolen by the Blandings wise attorney, played perfectly by Melvyn Douglas. Douglas is the steward of stealing every scene he is in, and is shockingly spectacular as he crosses the mixes from crisis to crisis. Reginald Denny as the Blandings, also architect and Harry Shannon as the crusty, old water drill, also wonderful. <br /> <br /> I've watched this movie many times and it always makes me laugh. I think it's a good movie to watch when you need a lift, whether you're building a house or not.
