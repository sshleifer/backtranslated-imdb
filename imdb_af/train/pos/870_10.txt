"Read my lips (Sur mes l√®vres)" (which probably has different idiomatic resonance in its French title) is a fine, winding contemporary story of office politics that is unexpectedly a crime hijacker, as the unusual characters have an ethical and sensual slant . <br /> <br /> The two clues are magnetic, Emmanuelle Devos (which I have never seen, despite her long resume in French movies) and an even more amazing than usual Vincent Cassel (who is a sexy and / or threatening look and vote for some American movies. <br /> <br /> The first half of the movie is on her grass in a competitive real estate office and he is the neophyte. ex-con and her frantic adaptation to the environment. <br /> <br /> Writer / director Jacques Audiard uses the woman's insulating hearing disabilities as a privilege for us in her perceptions, turning the sound on and off So we can hear as she does (so it's even more annoying than usual when hearing members speak), using footage as sensory reactors. <br /> <br /> None of the characters act as expected (she is not like that conscientious victim of "In the Company of Men" not in individual i no action, not in scenes, and not in the overall arc of the unpredictable story line (well to the last shot, but the audience was completely waiting for that fulfillment) as we moved from a hectic modern office to a busy disco for romantic and criminal outbreaks. <br /> <br /> There is a theme story that is theme-redundant and unnecessary, but it only gives us a few minutes to breathe. <br /> <br /> This is one of my favorites this year! <br /> <br /> (originally written 7/28/2002)
