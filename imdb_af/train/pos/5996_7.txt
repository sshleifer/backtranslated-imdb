Occasionally I said that if people do not want remakes or persecutors, they should stop seeing them and venture into the world of independent films. I said this, the last time I saw an independent movie, I had to have been easy six months ago. So here's an overview for an indie I got my attention on Youtube; the Cure. <br /> <br /> Immediately you can see that the movie is for an avant-garde movie approach that is telegraphed in the use of extreme close ups, scopophilia and quick editing. It's proud of the way it looks - and it's right to be. For the most part, it is a very well-crafted small piece, except for one unforgettable disregard of the 180 degree rule and a comic bad shooting effect that is a phenomenon that looks like the calling card for self-funded projects. <br /> <br /> Yet, despite these amateurist mistakes, the majority of shots are actually a pleasure to watch. We are presented with a good use of props and places, good visual acting and some very atmospheric, fluid editing, which is made more commendable as it is definitely something you will not see much of a Youtube presentation at all no. The plot is fragmented and although the basic premise is fairly simple, some may find it difficult to follow exactly what is going on, but what we see here is avant-garde storytelling at work; You can't really expect a three-action structure and if you're not ready for this kind of movie. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, when the movie is dropped, the sound is. Whatever you hear is a twisted voice ear that often sounds incessantly and worse is the continuous background music, which goes through minimal changes and doesn't add much to anything. So much attention is given to the footage that the sound is being listened to honestly, and it becomes really clear when you realize you have missed just about four sentences of the narrative and have to track back to catch up on what has come to your attention. <Br /> <br /> So give it a watch, but do it with the sound. <br /> <br /> Last thought; Was anyone else reminded of the cover for Doug Naylor's Red Dwarf novel "Last Human" early in the film? If you have the book, you know what I mean.
