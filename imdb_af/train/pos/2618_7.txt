Possible SPOILERS: Don't Know <br /> <br /> While watching The Lion King 1 1/2, I can't help but have mixed feelings throughout the movie. It's definitely a great way to spend about an hour and a half. But there is nothing that will give you the same feeling that The Lion King has. The story, for those who haven't read the other reviews, is about how Timon and Pumbaa meet, and how their events affect the original Lion King. <br /> <br /> There are really funny jokes in the movie. My favorite part is when they show the pair that Simba shows. But for me, the worst parts should be when they show Timon and Pumbaa directly interfere with the events of the original. I can never convey the "Circle of Life" or "Can you feel the love tonight" in the same way (I'm okay with the "I just can't wait to be king"). <br /> <br /> The voice talents are excellent. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella do a wonderful job, such as Matthew Broderick, the man Rafiki does, and the hyenas. Even the actor who sounds young Simba sounds like Jonathon Taylor Thomas to me. But why did they even include a voting factor for Zazu? He literally had only 2 lines, and not much needed. The additions of Julie Kavner and Jerry Stiller only add to the talent, although you still can't hear Timon's mother's voice and don't think of Marge Simpson. <br /> <br /> There are some scenes that seem to fit in with the original, the one that comes to mind is when they are proud of the end. How did they have time to fit into the initial battle with the hyenas? <br /> <br /> As far as the DVD is concerned, you can't help it, but for a 2-disc set, the special features are especially lacking. They can easily customize a comment, or other aspect ratio on the 1st disk. I did enjoy the "Who wants king of the jungle" game, even though it is the most shameful example of cross-promotion I have ever seen. Some of the questions are really difficult. <br /> <br /> Overall, a good movie, though not as good as TLK or even TLK2.
