This movie took the Jerry Springer approach to superhuman strength. "Wilder Napalm" is the kind of theme-based movie I love, and speaks to the idea that wonder children in America are defined by their gifts, or by their efforts to hide them. At the same time, the movie shows that every miracle is only human, and no longer feared or worshiped by any other person. It was a great comedy, fun and person with that little satirical edge.
