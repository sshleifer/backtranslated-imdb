in a not so conventional sense of the word. <br /> <br /> This movie was one of my favorites as a young child, and I recently remembered and thought of looking for it. Although many of the details are no longer in my mind, the overall feeling given to me by the movie has been stuck with me over the years. <br /> <br /> If parents feel that their children can handle adult and sometimes violent themes, then I recommend this movie. It taught me a lot about life and death and brought me a lot of emotion. To date, it remains one of my favorite movies.
