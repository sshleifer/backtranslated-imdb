I admit that I'm a beautiful film, and enough inventive camera movements and angles can be enough to keep my interest in a fairly long film. Not one of Gojoe's lengths, although of the most remarkable cinematography I have seen since the Korean MUSA period. Gojoe, however, offers far more than just beautiful images (such as MUSA ... don't express a contrast) - it's the second greatest power, is wonderfully acting and a fascinating story with a very dark philosophy. I have to admit it is unclear what the point was to make it eventually, but it certainly makes a few thoughts along the way. Vague kids, but definitely thoughts: p <br /> One section in which the movie could have been better is the action. There is a large amount of blood loss in the film, but the action is all filmed with hyper-kinetic close-ups and is often obscured by objects in the foreground. It creates a lot of intense and impressive visual arts, but it would be nice to see more real movements, something more credible that the villains could only blow through all the armies. <br /> <br /> Still, the movie is definitely one of the most interesting and beautiful films I've seen for some time. Recommended!
