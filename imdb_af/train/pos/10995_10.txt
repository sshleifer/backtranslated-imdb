I saw this movie at the theater when it only came out a few years ago and liked it a lot. But I wanted to see it again this year to see if it's still good compared to movies that are coming out now, and I want to say it's one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life !!!!!!! !! !!!! <br /> <br /> What you need to know is that you shouldn't miss a minute of this movie if you don't pursue the action completely and you won't understand the end. <br /> <br /> The end is what makes this movie so good, you can't expect it. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to the producer!
