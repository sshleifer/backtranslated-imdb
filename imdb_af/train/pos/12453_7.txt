Unfortunately, many consumers writing reviews for IMDb require low budget with not good. Whatever this movie may need, more budget is not really part of it. Big sets and very special effects would have changed it into another Lara Croft movie. What we have here is a step or two better than that. <br /> <br /> The almost unknown Alexandra Staden is fascinating as the enigmatic modesty, and it is essential for this movie to work. Her smart smile and knowing looks are formidable and you find yourself the camera will not digest her face. It makes it workable for Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau to have an unusual cerebral interest in her, which Modesty can exploit. She could divert her with just a move and spit out "waste my time!" then storms between his heavily armed but suddenly diffident henchmen. Making such a probable scene doesn't happen by accident. <br /> <br /> Probably the biggest problem I've encountered with Staden is that it's not very credible to go hand in hand with an athletic and muscular man like Coaster-Waldau and beat him. She's just not a Peta Wilson or a pumped Hilary Swank-type actress who can throw a convincing punch. Coaster-Waldau lets himself be overpowered by Staden, looks as though he is just rough with his little sister. <br /> <br /> Since it's not really an action movie, it's not a big mistake. I just hope they do better than and when they prosecute.
