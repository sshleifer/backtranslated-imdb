Wasn't sure what to expect from this movie. I like to watch Brosnan in any movie, he's always good, but it was completely different. He's a mess, and plays a mess very well. In fact, he reminds me of myself a few times in uni :) So yes, there is not much violence, there is not much action, but the dialogue is cracked, the play is wonderful and very refreshing, and that's reasonable funny. also :) I don't think you will go out of the theater, "Wow! I was blown away" but you will come out to smile if you enjoy a good movie. Can't ask for it anymore. <br /> <br /> Oh, and if you're lucky, a few morons will turn the ads in the wrong direction and you will be inverted, upside down (with reverse audio) ads !! Brilliant. Nothing like watching a Jack Daniels ad where the drink comes back into the bottle with an abomination American Twin Peaks comment :)
