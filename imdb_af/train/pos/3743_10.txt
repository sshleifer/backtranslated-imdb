Sturdy writing, good direction, excellent performance, strong role play, effective use of places. <br /> <br /> Paul McGann gives a detailed, subtle performance as the man in the midst of a new murder investigation that may have just been a similar murder before. <br /> <br /> There is an interesting moral and emotional journey that happens with his character (Ben Turner), and it cuts through the journey that Amanda Burton undertook. Inevitably they are crossing over ... Who did what? <br /> <br /> The investigation of WHY, rather than in the present, rather than WHO, might be able to deliver a more interesting Dostoyevsk story, but hey, who complains? <br /> <br />
