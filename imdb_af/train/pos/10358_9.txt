I remember showing this movie a few years ago on the Lifetime TV network and thought it was an interesting story. A few years later I saw it again and fell head over in love for this movie. The story behind the movie is fascinating and self-explanatory. Throwing makes it just as much more attractive. Meryl Streep is definitely at the top of her game in this photo. His nails Mrs. Chamberlain's ways, the accent, and even look. She shows the pain, hurt, surprise and anger that Lindy had to endure, and in the process it's hard to remember it's not Lindy. In my opinion, this show of Meryl's was better than her Oscar-winning in Sophie's Choice, and had to get her third Oscar. Sam Neill is perfect like Michael Chamberlain, and for some surprising reasons, the Academy is not at least recognized by a nomination. Overall, this movie receives only one Oscar note (Streep's for Best Actress.) However, it received several Australian Oscars and nominations. <br /> <br /> Definitely a top movie: it tells a great story and you get good performances from the entire cast.
