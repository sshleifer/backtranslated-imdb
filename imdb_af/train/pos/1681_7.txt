The Scorpion's Tail case has all the elements needed to make an effective Giallo movie. The story is standard giallo. When a man dies in a plane crash, his wife (Ida Galli) collects a $ 1 million life insurance policy. The widow goes to Greece for the payout, but a series of horrific murders follow her. There are many suspects, including a stubborn investigator (George Hilton) of the insurance agency and the widow's lover. Director Martino keeps the story at a fast pace while the viewer tries to guess the killer's identity. Anita Strindberg (also unforgettable in "Your Fish is a Closed Room and Just I Have the Key" and "Who Seen Her?") Is a beautiful heroine. This is one of Martino's best films.
