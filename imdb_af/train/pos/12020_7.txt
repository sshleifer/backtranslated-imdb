The Last Hard Men find James Coburn an outdoor outfit to make a long sense that is free of a chain leg. He and his friends go to the Mexican border from prison and security. No, they do not because Coburn has a mission of revenge. To kill the peace officer who brought him in and killed in the process. <br /> <br /> The peace officer is Charlton Heston who has now retired and knows what Coburn is. As he explained to his daughter, Barbara Hershey, Coburn was thrown into a cage and was involved in a Waco as a turnoff. His Indian wife died in the hail of bullets fired. It's not something he's proud of, she was a collateral accident in a man's hunt. <br /> <br /> Let us feel sorry for Coburn, he knows us well what an evil man he really is. Heston is his usual stalwart hero, but acting honors in The Last Hard Men go to James Coburn. He blows everyone else off the screen when he is on. <br /> <br /> Coburn gets the bright idea to make sure Heston walks him through Hershey kidnapping and takes her to an Indian discussion where the white authorities can't touch him. He knows that Heston should then make it personal. <br /> <br /> Coburn's gang includes: Morgan Paull, Thalmus Rasulala, John Quade, Larry Wilcox and Jorge Rivero. Heston has Chris Mitchum next to whom his son-in-law is. <br /> <br /> The Last Hard Men are a nasty and brutal western. Andrew McLaglen managed it and I think it was a project originally meant for Sam Peckinpaugh. It certainly shows much of its influence with the liberal use of slow motion to emphasize violence. There are many. <br /> <br /> For a little Peckinpaugh lite, The Last Hard Men is your movie.
