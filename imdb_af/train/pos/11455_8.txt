This German documentary, in English, is about a Scottish environmental sculptor named Andy Goldsworthy. He makes art from objects he finds in nature. For example, early in the film we see that he takes parts of icicles and "glued" them with a little moisture in a snake-like shape that apparently goes through a vertical rock repeatedly. <br /> <br /> Of course, the icicles are melting, but that transition is part of most of Goldsworthy's work. He goes to a site and gets a feel for it, and intuitively decides how to make that day. He speaks of a "dialogue" with the rocks and other materials with which he works, and tries to work with * rather than against them. It may be stones, flowers or leaves or sticks. The sculpture may last for minutes or years, or perhaps not even long enough to be completed and photographed. The job seems to be more of a process than a goal. <br /> <br /> The film, and the work, is beautiful, inspiring and thought-provoking. It moves pretty slowly, which is suitable for the material, but be sure to go when you have a good night's sleep. But go if you have the opportunity. <br /> <br /> Find the web for other pages about Andy Goldsworthy or read about his local sculpture at Stanford University. There are also several books available with pictures of his sculptures. <br /> <br /> My thoughts: Keep reading this section if you want to find what this movie means to you completely independent. I remember a few ideas that happened to me while watching the movie I thought I'd share for those who still read. First, the transition from much of Andy Goldsworthy's work reminded me of the natural ebb and flow of human life. We were born, we live, and eventually we die. Of course, this is also part of Goldsworthy's art. <br /> <br /> The other thought was to be mad about the way Goldsworthy succeeded in integrating his passion and work into his life as well. Most of us have work that is best tolerated, a life we ​​barely notice, and passions that we really need to spend more time even remembering what they are. Andy Goldsworthy has managed to create a merger of all these aspects of his life, which seems to work very well and feeds him and those around him. Wow. <br /> <br /> See on 8/28/2002.
