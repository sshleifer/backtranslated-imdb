Unfortunately, this film has long been unavailable (as other posters have noticed), but it is one of the essential dramas of the Great Depression, a lyrical and touching love of love located in a shanty village. It features performances by Spencer Tracy and Loretta Young who only deal with the best of their careers. It is an exceptional example of how director, Frank Borzage, could create an almost fairytale aura around elements of poverty, crime and terrible social inequality, which just proved how truly romantic and spiritually his talents were. This film shows how love survives amidst scary and desperate need, and it's totally life-satisfying. It is a true masterpiece of the era, and is a movie that deserves to be known.
