"GI Samurai" sees Sonny Chiba and some other guys are not traced back to civil war-ravaged feudal Japan, and many massacres occur. It's a bit over the top set of sword versus machine gun that ultimately produces interesting results. <br /> <br /> The plot runs mainly along the tracks you expect from the title. initial fish-out-the-water antics ("what is this flying metal case?", etc.), "we are no better off here" and ultimately a great battle. The latter is proof that the film does not take him seriously. The assassin picks up most of the second half while the samurai army collides with Chiba's platoon. a face of one would fully expect the title, but it can still be overwhelmed with its ingenuity and opulence. It is definitely one of the most unique ranges of its time and does not wear despite its extended length. <br /> <br /> Chiba gives a gruff performance as Iba, initially a good leader, but someone who eventually questioned his own morals as the situation has an effect on him. It's definitely one of his better vehicles of his awesome resume. At the final act, the two worlds had such an effect on each other, you have to wonder if it was a bit nihilism from the writers, because they seem to be asking, "Weren't we better off?" . But it may read a lot, and it can generally be described as a very entertaining two-hour (almost) non-stop action.
