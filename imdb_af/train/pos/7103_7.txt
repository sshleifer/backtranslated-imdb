I was pretty surprised with this movie. Although their budgets are apparently missing, you should be impressed that this movie has taken 7 years to make and still perform well. The acting was pretty impressive and the story really enchanted me. My only complaint would be that the end was really a little too sudden for my taste. But hey if your audience wants more then this movie is passed. <br /> <br /> I'd like to recommend someone in Hollywood to find Antonella Ríos who is an excellent Spanish talent (something difficult to find now with everyone the bad novel about the play). Antonella Ríos is really a star of the rise.
