I watch movies for a life, choose from which one is good enough to distribute ... To throw away those who don't make the cut. I'm not saying I know more than anyone else, but I'm just guessing how I came to watch the "Gospel of Lou" ... Anyway ... So many bad movies land on my desk and I actually all sit through. I don't really look at everything, usually I just look at the TV occasionally as I work the scan for production value, performance and how well the story is presented. If something catches my eye, I'll take the time to see it. "Lou" tuned me in the first few minutes where I closed my laptop and drove my chair over to the TV so I could fit completely. Needless to say I was captivated by the whole movie. The story is well told, the characters are intrusive or repulsive (depending on the actor and director's intent for the character) and it is very well played. Sometimes I caught amateur errors in the camera's work and editing, but the emotional nature of the story makes these errors easy to dismiss. I heard of other people's remarks saying that the movie sometimes brought the tears into their eyes. Another time I listened very much. I laughed one minute and cried the following and was incredibly touched by this movie. Unfortunately, I couldn't get it, because I was - as the saying goes - a week late and a dollar short. That's how it sometimes goes ... but at least I had the pleasure of seeing this one and I can't wait to see what kind of response it gets. Good luck and good luck to your Bret Carr (if you read it), you are without a doubt a talent to watch.
