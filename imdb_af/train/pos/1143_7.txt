I don't see soap. My grandmother is still watching one with the hourglass. I enjoyed them when I was ten (it was so easy). <br /> <br /> But this movie takes parody and spells it a new way. I found the story pretty funny. The 80's fashions - shoulder pads, sequins, and polyester - just on top. The big hair, the high heels and the histrionics - which combine. <br /> <br /> And all the actors just go to town, visit their parts and spit them out into a large, well-written stack. Sally, Kevin, Elisabeth - wonderful! Whoopi - fantastic! Robert Downey - refreshing to see him back when he had such potential, in front of tabloids. And Garry: why did we have to wait so long to watch him? Leesa Gibbons - didn't miss her, but nice to include her as a real entertainment rep (and where do you go anyway?). <br /> <br /> Although I could have done without Sally climbing the drainage pipe. Lucy Ricardo did it, how many times? Like every comedian from Carol Burnett, I don't know who and I'm so done with it, I can spit peanuts if I had it. Apparently, this is what you do if you're funny in a tall building in New York. I'm just grateful they didn't pull out the flagpole bolt. <br /> <br /> But it was cute, it was funny, it had sudden changes, it had a marking credit before it was common. Clothing worthy of a second glance, it played a good role and it has personal memories for me. Really, what more do you need?
