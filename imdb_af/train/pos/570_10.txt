Disgracefully, I just watched this movie for the first time, 13 years after its release. This is a story that any father or brother can relate to ... one brother is a little "wild", the other brother is the typical older child. Craig Sheffer is a bit too unemotional as the oldest brother, but Pitt is wonderful, and Skerritt is perfectly cast as the father. The fishing scenes filmed in Montana are absolutely breathtaking. I had no idea that fly fishing would be so attractive. The film now follows the book, with only a few modifications to make it more suitable for a movie format. Unlike most book after movie stories, this one measures. It's a perfect movie for anyone who wants a quiet night with a powerful and somewhat emotional movie.
