Pecker is a hilarious but twisted movie about a small town in Baltimore whose daily humdrum routine is broken by Pecker, a young photographer who takes photos of 'real things'. No beautiful models, no beautiful men, just a hard life. This wonderful movie mocks the plastic of the urban art chain. There is one particular scene when a homeless woman who buys at Pecker's mother's savings store, the same exact dress as one of the Whitney art junkies for just 25 cents instead of five hundred dollars. It's just about showing you that you don't always taste, no matter what kind of money you have. Again, John Waters sends you back into an endless spiral of laughter and raw reality. You can have your mainstream Hollywood movies with special hits and celebrities, but give me a "Pecker" or "Hairspray" (another excellent John Waters movie) about a "Titanic" or a "Godzilla" anyday !!
