I can't say this movie is a disappointment because I've read a few reviews before I look and it didn't do as well as I thought. The bar wasn't that high, so the fact that my expectations were met doesn't say much. <br /> <br /> The Good: The City of New York. If you live in the city like me, you will recognize some places and understand that the city is supposed to be more than just an environment rather than one of the main characters. There are really shining moments, humorous conversations and plots left and right, all of which keep things interesting. <br /> <br /> The Bad: The first thing I thought after leaving the theater was that I wanted more, but not in the positive "let's get more" fashion. Certainly, the good sketches / scenes outweigh the bad ones, but there are many sketches that fall within the "in-between" category, too much, eventually dropping the movie. Also, New York City's diversity, although shown at all the distant pans of the city and mentioned in conversation by the film, is never really realized or analyzed to the point of doing city law. For example, much of the sketch involves doing middle-aged whites well. I mean I know the city is home to much of the mentioned demographic, but come on, Paris Je'taime's plot and character variety make the city of New York like Lancaster, PA or something really white. It's just disappointing to see the city so briefly on its heritage. <br /> <br /> Even after I said this, I'd recommend New York, I like you. Who knows, maybe you won't agree with my opinion and maybe you won't. You will never know until you see it yourself. This review is not meant to stop anyone from watching this movie, as everyone's opinion on art differs. I just give you a very vague head on what to expect.
