I thought the movie was pretty well done for a TV movie, and it has lots of action and humor. I found that the entertainment value is worth watching, and I will see it again or a similar show. I'm disappointed that Sean wasn't credited on IMDb here. <br /> <br /> I can see a chance for an action series based on this concept or a sequel to Sean playing again for higher "cash" interests, since his life anyway will be at stake again. <br /> <br /> I felt that Sean played the role very well, and reminded me of an actor named Matthew Ashford who plays Jack Deveraux on Days of Our Life - the soap operation
