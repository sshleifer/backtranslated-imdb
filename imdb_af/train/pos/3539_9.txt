Good: English movies, great presentation, vehicles are actually fun to drive, pretty attractive multiplayer, true to the movie, and the list goes on. <br /> <br /> Bad: Main missions are a bit short. /> <br /> This game defines what a "good" third person shooter (not necessarily a spy game). Big fire camps carry the story and make you every single mission, and unlock all the right bonuses the game offers. The hype of this game has resulted, and I personally think you should buy it, and fetch some friends and play this one. Great fun. <br /> <br /> The sound in this game is a ripe performance of some previous bundle games, and a weapon shoot, really feels like you're kicking off a weapon. This is related to the fact that you are a deadly and ruthless spy. <br /> <br /> All in all, this game makes you excited and satisfied after you have gone through it, and some multiplayer that can compete with the standards of the smart James Bond "Nightfire" gamecube game.
