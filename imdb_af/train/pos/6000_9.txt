Kristine Watts (Molie Weeks) is torn apart, misses her lover; she cannot overcome her love for him who has been lost in the past. She hires a stranger (Douglas Davis) and lists her mistakes to him with things to fix. But time is irreversible and sometimes the cure for pain is a tragic end. <br /> <br /> The first point impressed in "The Cure" is the stylish cinematography that replaces black and white with color. The concise and sharp script is capable of developing a tragic and scary story of love with an unexpected end point in less than eight minutes. The soundtrack is beautiful, but the volume is a bit loud and associated with the fact that English is not my mother tongue. In some moments I had to repeat a few words whispered by the narrator. The unknown main actress has great performance and is very beautiful. I hope a chance to see her again on the screen. Last but not least, the debut of director and writer Ryan Jafri couldn't be any better. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Not available
