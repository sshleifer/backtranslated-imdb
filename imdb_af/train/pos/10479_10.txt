It's a movie that my dentist actually recommended and I'm glad he did! The mixture of British humor (should I say Humor?) And the reality of a lost middle-aged widow trying to maintain her lifestyle is a hoot. Add the reality of what is really needed to grow pot (the plants under the bushes don't add it without the TLC they received), and it's a really hilarious but touching movie. I laugh every time I put the vision of all the barmakers in their grass chairs with sunglasses as they subtract the light! Maybe it's just my Mendocino County blood, but the British have this one right! 10/10
