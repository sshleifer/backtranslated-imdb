I was 5 years old when I saw this music movie on holiday with my family in St Thomas in 1977 and immediately fell in love. 27 years later it is still an original inspiration for achieving my goals that I have achieved since that time! <br /> <br /> This tragic story of a hard core behind the scenes of the entertainment industry During the late 50s, "Sparkle" successfully portrayed the battle of three young sisters seeking their place in the sun. This story can simply become the biographical story of many young aspiring artists about what can happen if things look too fast and role models are not available to give a helping hand. <br /> <br /> The phenomenal music written and composed by Aretha Franklin and Curtis Mayfield, the soundtrack carries the plot with every song. The fact that it is subject to situations that have little choice for strong long-term decision making, to make the ultimate sacrifice to continue, represents all three young girls, Sparkle, Sister and Delores, the different routes one can take when you ideal opportunity as your contribution to society. <br /> <br /> This movie might have created the ideas to create Dreamgirls on Broadway and Mariah Carey's Glitter, 25 years later. As an original audience of both productions, I have seen many similarities in both stories as "Sparkle", as well as in "Saturday Night Fever", "Fame", "Flashdance" and the off-Broadway smash hit "Mama, I Want To sing.
