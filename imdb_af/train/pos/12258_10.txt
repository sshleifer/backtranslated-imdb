Jane Austen's Emma has been a very pleasant story in the worst times and this production of the story is the best I've ever seen. Kake Beckinsale's Emma is impeccable. Gwyneth Paltrow (with the help of a good screenplay and excellent cinematography) can bring out the comedy effectively, failing to make Emma likeable. Paltrow is not helped by the fact that her hairstyles are simply "wrong" for the part (and I believe the era) and she looks positively ill in the rich style dresses. Kate Beckinsale, on the other hand, manages the comedy effortlessly and can still show what Mr. Knightly (the most romantic of Jane Austen's heroes) actually sees in her. Mark Strong is a wonderful gentleman of Knightly with the right mix of attractive appearance, appropriate age, knighthood, compassion and gentleman behavior. Emma and Mr Knightly are supported by a cast of good actors and the production as a whole is quite enjoyable.
