I saw the Big Bad Swim at the 2006 Temecula Film Festival, and was totally taken away by how much I was dragged through it. <br /> <br /> The movie centers around the lives of a group of people who take an adult. swimming class for various reasons. A humorous idea in its own right, serves as a catalyst for greater changes in student life. <br /> <br /> What surprised me about the movie was how really it felt. Rarely in ensemble pieces, characters are treated so well. I really enjoyed the scenes in the class, and the drama that took place outside was very gripping. Nothing was out of place or character, and at last it left a very strong feeling, such as attending school or summer camp - where you find quick friends, form strong ties, and make inventions about yourself, but too soon must leave. <br /> <br /> My only complaint was that the character of Paula had a very strong and unusual introduction, telling you that she knows a little more about her than it is eventually revealed. I suppose you won't meet everyone in class, though ... <br /> <br /> In addition, I found the film very well-rounded and very enjoyable. See it if you get the opportunity.
