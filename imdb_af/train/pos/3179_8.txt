Who made this movie? I love this movie? Someone has a funny sense of humor. <br /> <br /> This Zany, Surrealistic filmmaking style is tempting, but it's hard to create that substance - or easy to forget - and characters who actually have souls. , which gives such a film depth. Without it, a comedy is just a lot of ideas. Who cares. It may be laughing, but it goes through you like half a good hamburger ... next ... <br /> <br /> Crosseyed can't change someone's life, but I appreciate the depth and substance. They sneak over you. I started thinking this movie: "Oh, I get it - in comedy - off the wall - gonzo ... yup." And this is it - but if you pay attention, there are sub-text and character moments to fill it out. In this sense, the film breathes. It makes suggestions that give a break - if you are available to see it - and then of course it goes in its bad cheerful way. <br /> <br /> You will miss the point if you do not sign the sign Contract to suspend belief in moments in the movie. Stepping between reality and surreality is one of the points of this movie. <br /> <br /> Crosseyed isn't perfect, but smart people have made it. I want more. <br /> <br /> The dining room tiles are an absolute HOT. <br /> <br /> Attach your belt.
