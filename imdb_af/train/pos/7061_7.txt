Of course, the original is better, but it's not as bad as everyone says! Yes, it's been made in 3 stories, but hey, so what? I thought it was pretty good to be honest. I really liked how Anastasia changed a little when she fell in love, showing what love can do. The stories were not so bad either. <br /> <br /> I also had a better voice in Cinderella's voice. I have nothing against her voice in the original, but I just think it sounds better here, nicer. I also had her personality in it, she had more of a spine, but she was still so kind. <br /> <br /> So, I'll give Cinderella II: Dreams come where a 7/10.
