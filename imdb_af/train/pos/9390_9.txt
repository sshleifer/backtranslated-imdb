This movie started me on a Nick Cage kick. It is a story full of twists and turns - a movie of motives and moves. Of course Dennis Hopper was a ham, but J.T. Walsh and Laura Flyyn Boyle are the perfect pair to catch the unsuspecting man in their web. Everything about this movie is good - cinematography, story tempo and most of all. Cage excels at what he does best - it's not an action hero, but to be an allman in the strings of life.
