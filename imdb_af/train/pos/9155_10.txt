Who ever acted with story is a sick person. I rented it for our sleep-sleep and all six of us freaked out, because we're all in a acting class, and we know some of the class actors. Besides everyone screaming the whole freaky night, I had freaky nightmares. I kept thinking oh my God, if I get up to go to the bathroom, I'll wipe in the middle or something. I couldn't even go to the bathroom because we watched this horrible horror movie. I also thought why were all the girls topless in this movie, but we didn't do any of the boys? You have to make a horror movie where the killer is a girl and chop down units. I'll see it over and over again. Call it loud or soft or so stupid. I only give this movie a 9 because you have missing my mistakes.
