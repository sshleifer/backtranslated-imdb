The cat and the mouse are involved in the usual deviations when Jerry dives into a bottle of invisible ink and discovers that it disappears. Instead of using the opportunity to change spying on a girl's locker room, he uses his new-found invisibility to torment Tom. And it's pretty funny and fairly inventive, though it's a somewhat funny cartoon. And the action never leaves the inside of the house, which is usually the property of below average T&J shorts. Still worth a 7/10. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure how an invisible mouse can throw a shadow on the wall, it makes physics and the nature of invisible visible.
