This movie has one of the greatest comedic dialogue and memorable quotes ever made in one movie! The plot is somewhat lacking, but the delicious trinkets are enough to make the difference. It's a timeless movie for all ages that will surely be. As a cinematic art form, it is highly entertaining; and with big stars like Cary Grant, Myrna Loy, and Melvyn Douglas ... how can you go wrong? <br /> <br /> Comedy dialogue and timing like this has long been undervalued and is very difficult to follow. A good example of this has been seen in the 1986 knockoff of this movie: The Money Pit, featuring Tom Hanks and Shelley Long. Despite the talent and physical comedy of these stars, the film was dragged and received poor reviews and viewer-like comments. Achieving a true comedian dialogue is an art.
