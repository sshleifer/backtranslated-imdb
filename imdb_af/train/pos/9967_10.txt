There are a few things I will never understand; why underwear in packs of three, when it is clear that this is not enough, is an example. Similarly, I will never understand this movie, and it is brilliant. If you are closer to this movie that expects a real movie, you might as well expect Satan and a hug. although it will be possible to greet this movie's satanic figures. Take Pitch, for example; The most ineffective camp, unfortunate depiction of a devil since Freddy Mercury and Wayne Sleep has used forces to create a 10-foot Satan costume of red body paints and horns covered with condoms. However, it does make the most hilarious moments of any movie ever. Seriously, this is not an understatement. The same can be applied to any other character, the infant who is so ill-behaved innocently, that she is probably overestimated for serious crime she is part of. Then again, if Santa's inter-space record station is actually, there's no chance she could have avoided him for so long. If you haven't seen this movie, you can't see yourself as a serious buffalo. The painful funny characterization, acting, concept and almost-under-radar racism make it a must see so far any movie (if you are pure laugh).
