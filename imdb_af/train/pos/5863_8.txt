Even 15 years after the end of the Vietnam War, Jacknife did not come late or even needless. This is one of the few trying to deal with the second sad side of the war: The time after. Unlike films like "Taxi Driver" or "Rambo" offering their main characters as a broken heroes in a bad post-war environment, this movie offers the public a different view of the Vietnam veterinarians. Their development is clearly shown before and especially after the war. The problems are obvious, but in all these tragics there is always the feeling of hope based on love and friendship. "Jacknife" may be the quietest Vietnam movie ever, but after almost 15 years it's really credible and therefore justified. Furthermore, it can make us believe that the war is not over yet; at least for some of us. <br /> <br /> The three main characters are wonderful. De Niro did one of his best work, but Ed Harris is the star of this movie. Maybe it was his best performance ever.
