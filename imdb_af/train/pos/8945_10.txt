It's an honest effort to make a surprisingly sweet love story. The obvious inspiration behind the successful TV series "Bewitched", this beautiful sweet rom-com is a timeless treasure. the equations are obvious. Jimmy Stewart plays an unfortunate but solid "straight". Kim Novac plays a turbulent blonde witch who catches him by using a love game. But when the game is broken by a stronger witch, she keeps herself in charge of managing her own shop and comforts her beloved aunt, her beloved paewacket. You will recognize the aunt of "Murder by Death." This movie is fun and appealing sweet, with a spectacular white and a nice witchy feel. worth a look.
