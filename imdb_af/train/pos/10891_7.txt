You can survive Surviving Christmas. I thought the television version was a bit edited. I love Ben Afleck. He plays Drew Johnson, a family-free adult, who is willing to pay full strangers. The Valcos starring James Gandolfini and Catherine O'Hara as the parents and Christina Applegate as Lisa Valco, the daughter. Drew is lonely on vacation because he does not have a family of his own, so he leases a family in the Chicago suburbs for a quarter of a million dollars. Bill Macy, whom I remember best to play Maude's husband, was hired by Arthur to play Duda, the grandfather. When the whole situation falls, the truth can be painful. The Valcos household is set apart from the Drew situation. Drew's rich girl and her parents make a surprising visit. You can't buy what you want! The acting and writer is mediocre, but the first course throws it to the final scene.
