It's one of those movies - such as Dave, American Dreamer and Local Hero - who keep a viewer's interest again and again. Lightweight movies rarely earn Oscars, but anyone who has the cake for Soapdish deserves one. Even after watching the movie and knowing what's coming up, it's still nice to watch the different plot facets evolve. True, all the drama is melodrama; but it is quite appropriate for a movie with a soap opera background. My favorite line comes from Whoopi Goldberg: "Why can't I write it like that?" I find it unfortunate that the TV and website sensors insist on all this unnecessary sanitation.
