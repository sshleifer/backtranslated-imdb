Yes, the cameras were in the right place at the right time. It is so interesting to see how a world leader (such as Chavez) supporting the poor people in his country can be held in such a low regard in the US. In my opinion, his worst "sin" cares for those at the bottom of the barrel. What can be so bad about it? I've always been fascinated by the US government + media response to Fidel Castro. Initially, Castro was a good man (about 1959) when he replaced Batista. Soon, however, Castro has begun to change the corporations in Cuba to the needs of the poor rather than the fat cats. We are a decent country, but why do our media and government have such a problem sharing with the poor? If these guys are "dictators" then we can use more "dictatorships", especially where the poorest of the poor live in the world.
