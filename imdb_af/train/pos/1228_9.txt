This 1991 NBC TV movie broadcast six months before John Goodman's big-screen version of Babe Ruth's life. For my money there is no comparison between the two. The TV production is not perfect, but offers the Babe's story with more depth and complexity than Goodman's one-dimensional narrative. In particular, I have always characterized the film's portrayal of the complex love hate affair that Ruth had with Yankee driver Miller Huggins. He also tried to show why Ruth's own character mistakes will never lead him to a manager or leader of players. The TV movie rightly points out how Ruth never had his dream of driving the Yankees because of his failures, while the terrible Goodman version tried to push the lies that Ruth was denying what he needed to take. <br /> <br /> Since the story began with Ruth's arrival in New York in 1920, one year after the Black Sox Scandal, and when his home is running, this film makes a good companion for "Eight Men". literally saved from trumpet. Indeed, the continuity between the two films is even emphasized by John Anderson who portrays his "Eight Men Out" role as Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis.
