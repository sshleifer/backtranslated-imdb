Bonanza had a wonderful movie of great actors. Lorne Greene, Pernell Whitaker, Michael Landon, Dan Blocker, and even Guy Williams (as the cousin who introduced several episodes in 1964 to replace Adam when he left the series). The throw had chemistry, and they looked the same. This has made many of their worst stories work much better than they should have. It also made many of their best stories in western drama. <br /> <br /> Like any show that shot over 30 episodes every season, there are some weak ones. But most of the time, every episode has an interesting story, a kind of conflict and a resolution that usually doesn't include violence. While Bonanza was western, gun control was never considered the main attraction. While I'm a fan of The Rifleman and Wanted: Dead or Alive; those shows usually end with a gunshot. Gunfights was how western each conflict resolved, and Bonanza was very different to trying peaceful resolutions and harmony instead of death. <br /> <br /> In the early years of Bonanza there are some interesting episodes that feature a lot of gunfights. These episodes contrast with the rest of the series, but they are pretty good in and of themselves. In 1964, when Pernell Whitaker wanted to leave the show, Guy Williams was brought in to replace him. Williams was the role of a lost cousin. Unfortunately, Whitaker decided to stay another year, and so Williams was written from the series when he left to marry Adam's old girlfriend. If Williams stayed for Bonanza, one can only wonder how much better the series would be in the years after 1965, when Pernell Whitaker left the show. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, once Pernell Whitaker was left alone. The series, the stories have focused more on comedy and country cocktails. Whitaker often played hard in many episodes, and his absence put a gap in the role. Little Joe always wanted to play the beautiful kid, and Hoss always wanted to play the good old boy with a heart of gold. Since Ben was the kind and wise patriarch of the family, it didn't leave too much space for any gunfire. <br /> <br /> At one stage they rented a ranch hand called Candy (David Canary) who became their fourth member. from the cast, but Candy was never in any gunfight, and he was barely more than an older version of Little Joe. For a year or two, they have also taken Ben into another, lost cousin (Jamie, played by the forgotten Mitch Bird), who was a teenager who usually gets in trouble with someone. <br /> <br /> Apparently By adding the teenager, the studio wanted to attract younger viewers. It also gave the authors the opportunity to write episodes about teenage problems, alcohol, delinquency, and so on. These kind of preaching episodes were popular in the 1960s as a reaction of the established media to the anti-culture movement. Dragnet was probably the most popular law and order TV source, although Hawaii 5-0, The F.B.I. and many other shows have also tried to jump on the bandwagon by making television programs offensive to irresponsible teens that cause mischief, chaos and crime. <br /> <br /> Adding a teenager to the cart gave the Cartwrights more chances to show up and solve problems, but the episodes feel very adapted and not very good in general . After Dan Blocker died, the series climbed for another year or so before it was canceled. The previous season was pretty bad, as it traced Little Joe to find his wife's murderers and most episodes were somewhat depressed because Little Joe usually drank or otherwise remembers how much he loved his wife and how unfair she was. . <br /> <br /> I don't think I've ever seen the last episode of the series, and I wonder if they had somehow officially wrapped it up. By the last year, only Ben (Lorne Greene) was actually living on the Ponderosa, as Adam had moved away (and never returned as a guest) and Hoss died and Little Joe was behind his wife (in the series ) were killed by drifters. <br /> <br /> Overall, the era of 1959-1965 is the best of this series. As soon as Adam left, it slowed down. Most of the performances before 1970 are also pretty good. By 1970, the range was difficult to be hip and active, and it lost much of its western flavor. The addition of Candy and the teenage boy also diluted the overall quality of the show, and Hoss's death (Dan Blocker) was the final nail. Bonanza is probably the best western series ever made, and out of the 465 episodes produced, at least one hundred of them are an excellent Western drama! It's a good record. Even the worst of Bonanza is better than many other TV shows.
