Arthur Bach has to grow up, but unfortunately this is not the only thing he has to do. According to his extremely wealthy father, Arthur has to marry a certain rich Susan Johnson or he is cut off from the family money (worth $ 750 million). The problem is that Arthur doesn't love Susan (although I hear she makes a good chicken meat) and has just fallen over for the waitress and part-time shopkeeper Linda Marolla. Arthur is an interesting fellow. He is just a big kid, born in wealth with at least one person who cares for him every second of every day. Just work rubbing Arthur in the wrong way. He likes to have fun, to wife and of course to drink. Drinking gives Arthur a kind of Jekyll and Hyde complex; And while it gets in all sorts of trouble, it's absolutely hilaries to look at the screen. <br /> <br /> Dudley Moore is great in this film as Arthur, who earns an Oscar nomination and wins Golden Globe for his performance. Moore is fantastic with the comic aspects of the film, which changes the already funny lines into memorable comic gold, but he is also great at bringing Arthur to a related level and making the character good. Moore has some help in the co-star department - Liza Minnelli is great as Lina, the enthusiastic nobody Arthur can get enough of, and John Gielgud is fantastic as Arthur's butler Hobson. Gielgud won the best supporting actor Oscar for his performance in this film, and there is no doubt why. Hobson has a sturdy, dry, white and healthy attitude, but he always looks at Arthur - and Gielgud is perfect in the role. Steve Gordon's 1981 film Arthur is short and simple but delivers a lot of laughter.
