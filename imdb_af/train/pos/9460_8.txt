I loved the story. Somewhere, a poster said there were no families like the one depicted in this movie. Well, maybe there should be. I thought everyone really looked human and credible. Throwing an upper slope. What good music on the soundtrack. What is nice, and what a nice thing, but above all, I will say two words to recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> Steve Carell. <br /> <br /> He really had a nice feeling, subtle depth that touched me. He was really commanded as a widower who might have devoted himself a little too much to being a good father at the expense of his own needs. <br /> <br /> Did he act like a petulant ass? Why, yes, he did. <br /> <br /> And you see, that's what was perfect about this movie. The actor who played this character believed me that he was feeling something and not just adjusting as if he were feeling something, and he was perfectly conveying to me what he felt and what he felt was denied. . <br /> <br /> Leave happiness. <br /> <br /> Deny fulfillment. <br /> <br /> Leave love. <br /> <br /> The loss of your love is painful, and many who do it will never feel that way again. <br /> <br /> Beautiful movie. <br /> <br /> I gave it eight out of ten.
