James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan play co-workers in a Budapest gift shop that do not really like each other, because they do not know they are really darling pins that have yet to meet. <br /> <br /> A very beautiful romantic comedy, played very well by it's two great stars and a very keen to support. The story is well written and the movie has that romantic innocence (don't really know how to explain it) that movies just don't have today. This can of course be compared to the recent You've Got Mail, and the original win in every way. <br /> <br /> It is mandatory to watch every Christmas, I can't think of a better way to jump a Christmas like this jeweler.
