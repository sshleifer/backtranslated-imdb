Kubrick again proved his brilliance, now in a suspense-horror movie based on Stephen King's book, titled in the same way. Jack Torrance is a man in his forties, married, with one child, and having past trouble and alcoholism. The Overlook Hotel in Colorado suspends service during the winter due to its extreme weather, and there is a well-paid job for the person who takes care of the facilities during the five months; and Torrance, who was looking to become a writer, found it perfectly. But the manager advised Torrance about the loneliness in this place during the winter, probably dangerous, and told him that some caretakers had become crazy in the past and killed his family. Even before they got there, his son Danny, who has a kind of imaginary friend, who shinning the future, knew the place was not good and didn't want to go. Once they installed themselves in the hotel, things went right, but within a month Jack acted, weird, irritated and depressed. At this point we know something is going to happen, but don't know when and how. Scary things happen like the appearance of two twin girls talking to Danny, and someone who attacked him violently. They are not alone in this place. Later Jack saw other people and immediately felt good to them, as if they were his family. including the famous psychotic caretaker, Delbert Grady. Grady tells Torrance that he must kill his family because they are "intruders" in the hotel. To obey this command, Jack has gone the goal and many of the frightening things I've ever seen happen here. The end is spectacular and the viewers remain interested and shocked until the last moment.
