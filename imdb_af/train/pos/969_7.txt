Miike is making a children's entertainment movie, not The Neverending Story. This is actually one of my favorite favorites from the directors. Even the worst Miike is better than a whole bunch of movies, and the Great Yokai War has a lot in it, it's worth recommending. It's at least as hard and unpleasant as most American kiddie movies. Perhaps I think children will find a lot of them themselves (the DVD includes an English dub), but like all Miike's films, it can move very slowly. This means that you have a strange inequality, where sometimes there is a hard action and the next scene will drag forever when characters enter into conversation. The story itself is not very good either, and Miike's constant lack of incoherence gives his ugly head. Most of what I liked came from the technical side of things. It must be Miike's most expensive movie, and it looks fantastic. "Yokai" are Japanese spirits, and they come in all different, fantastic forms, and the costume designers, special effect staff, and everyone involved in the designs have done just an excellent job. I saw the 1968 movie which one of these is supposedly based on (Yokai Monsters: Ghost Warfare), and the cute rubber suits you can find are transformed into more credible entities using state-of-the-art make-up up and special effects. I especially looked at the appearance of one of the bad guys (or girls, in this case), Agi, who has a dark eye shadow, a stiff white outfit, a white beehive and a whip. She is also played by Chiaki Kuriyama, who you may remember as Lucy Liu's teen henchgirl in Kill Bill: Vol. 1. The hero of the movie is played by Ryunosuke Kamiki, who casts voices for Miyazaki's Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle.
