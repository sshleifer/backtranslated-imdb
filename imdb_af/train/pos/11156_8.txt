I usually don't like reality shows, especially those that benefit from the success of 'American Idol'. But this one with which I can live. <br /> <br /> Comedians from around the world perform a short routine for celebrity talent scouts, and if they like them, the guys will be sent out to perform a routine for an actual audience. . Then ten or twelve comics are chosen to live together in a home and make survivor style competitions using comic tactics. Then one will be set as "Last Comic Standing." I like to stand up for comedy, so it is the one reality show must insist on my interest. There are usually some pretty funny comics that are chosen. It started with the careers of such talents as Alonzo Bodden, Ralphie May and Josh Blue. <br /> <br /> My negative criticism is the fact that many of these cartoons have been selected for their contribution to reality show drama. Initially, they were intertwined in a home like 'Big Brother', but now they've done away with it. Thank you. <br /> <br /> And there are a lot of comedians I feel are just selected, not because they are funny but because of race, ethnicity, attitude, gender, etc. when other comics should clear them clearly. But overall, it's a well-made reality show, which has been two terms so far, I thought as an oxymoron.
