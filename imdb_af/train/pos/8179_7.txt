It would have been so much fun to see in a theater, back in 1996. There is a guilty pleasure corner of my movie taste that really appreciates shock movies. <br /> <br /> The Dentist is getting dressed Sometimes it is likely that people have strong dental feelings. Perhaps the ADA has launched a campaign, as dentists report having to apologize for this movie and for "The Marathon Man" (which has only one scene comparable to the many in "The Tandarts"). <br /> <br /> It is amazing to note that the movie was shot in 21 days according to the trivia page. Of course, post-production can take longer than movie shooting sometimes and editing for "The Dentist" is picture perfect. The quick cuts increase the tension so much that in the scene where the dentist is "caring" of his wife, there are only two quick cuts that show what happens. The rest is left to our fertile imagination! Corbin Bernsen was a good choice for the role, as he has a lot of experience playing psychologically "off" characters and he sold the obsessive compulsive aspects of the dentist completely. <br /> <br /> For me, the rhythm of the movie was just right. The filmmakers reveal the woman's negligence in the right way. All the characters in the dental office look like their real people work in a real office. There is a lot of tension as they deal with impatient people in anticipation of the dentist's arrival. Meanwhile, the dentist is aware of a great psychotic breakdown! Unlike so many movies of this genre, the script is very strict. All the victims fall into the dentist's fall in many calculated ways. Two law enforcement types even get involved in a small subplot that eventually creates a shock of a revelation near the end. Definitely not for the dull heart or dental phobia, but a true rollercoaster ride and highly recommended for fans of intelligent gorefests.
