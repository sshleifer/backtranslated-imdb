Man, I really love the new DVD that Universal has put out. I have never seen THE SENTINEL look so good, as I had to sit with crazy, grainy VHS tires for years. Unfortunately, there are no extras outside a trailer that looks worse for the wearer. And avoid the Goodtimes DVD at all costs. It sucks. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the upset model Alison Parker (Cristina Raines) moves in the ghost-NYC tan, but it's more than just ghost. It is also a gateway to hell and the Vatican holds an old blind priest (John Carradine) to watch over and make sure the devils and arch angels do not escape. <br /> <br /> It features an all-star film full of old-fashioned actors such as Ava Gardner, Arthur Kennedy, Jose Ferrer, etc. as well as the upcoming 80s stars like Christopher Walken, Jeff Goldblum (whose voice was mysteriously overblown) and Tom Berenger. And you won't even recognize Jerry Orbach from LAW & ORDER. I had to do a double when I didn't quite sit where I had seen him before. <br /> <br /> Beautiful gore scenes from Alison cut the eye and nose of her dead father's rotting body owned by the devil. And there is a neat ending where malformed, deformed people try to haunt Alison to commit suicide so she won't be the next to protect the portal. Alison's turbulent past seems to be making her a leading candidate to become the next official by the Vatican. <br /> <br /> An excellent, spectacular 70-year-old classic by director Michael Winner who may not be missed. I also recommended it to those who want something that is a little more imaginative than the ordinary, stupid, teen-slashers and horror comedy. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 <br /> <br /> -
