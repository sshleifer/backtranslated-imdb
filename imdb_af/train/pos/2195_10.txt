I love it! Fred MacMurray is wonderful like Skid Johnson, a somewhat excited, proud but at the same time very vulnerable saxophone player in love with Maggie (Carole Lombard), who is always there. They meet in Panama after Maggie comes off a ship and ends in a bar with Anthony Quinn. Tony was hit in the nose by her insults, Maggie, by thinking of her a loose wife - even though she'd pulled her hat off in public. Big noise and Maggie ending up in Panama. Romance. Carole and Arthur are good together. Maggie is always there for him when he needs her. She urged him to go to NY where to look (look at the movie and find out). They have these wonderful scenes together where she sings in his arms while playing the saxophone. I definitely recommend it.
