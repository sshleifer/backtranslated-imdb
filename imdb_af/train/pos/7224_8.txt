When DEATHTRAP was released for the first time, the poster featured on the cover of this DVD presented a graphic version of a Rubik's Cube. This is a suitable image: originally written for the stage by Ira Levin, who wrote such memorable works as ROSEMARY'S BABY and THE STEPFORD WIVES. The play was one of Broadway's most famous twisters, and under Sidney Lumet's direction it translates the screen very well. <br /> <br /> DEATHTRAP is one of those movies that is very difficult to discuss, because doing so gives in some detail the plot for which it is known. But the opening premium is extremely clever: Sidney Bruhl (Michael Caine) is the well-known author of mysterious plays, but he apparently lost his touch today. After a particularly brutal opening night, an old student, Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve), sends a script for a play he wrote. It's called Deathtrap, and Sidney recognizes it as a surefire hit. Just the kind of hit that would revive his career ... indeed, a hit to die. And when Clifford discusses the play, the events suddenly start turning in the most unexpected way. <br /> <br /> Like Anthony Shaffer's equally winding SLEUTH, DEATHTRAP is really a story more at home on stage than the screen. To achieve the full power, it needs the immediacy that provides a lively performance. Yet, under the expert guidance of director Sidney Lumet, it makes a more than respectful display on the screen. Much of this is because of the cast, which is remarkable. Michael Caine gives a truly brilliant performance, Dyan Cannon is funny and endearing to Sidney's relentless anxious woman. Give Christopher Reeve the best performance in his unlucky short-term career. If you can't see it in a first-class theater production, it will happen more than once. <br /> <br /> Gary F.
