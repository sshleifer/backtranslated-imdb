As a child, I remember nine or ten and liked this movie. It was the everyday Hollywood action / comedy movie. This is an imitation of Bad Boys of course! The whole swap identities, but the arrival of two other twins throws everything out of the window and then the arrival of colorful villains dancing and singing! The action scenes in the film are not revolutionary, but still wonderful scenes. The movie is really very funny and was the great return Amitabh Bachan needed. Govinda is a jewel as always and it's probably his best work to date, he shines as the sidebar and delivers the best comedy scenes available in the Indian theater. <br /> <br /> The songs .... The songs are both funny and catchy .............. which laughs when you least expect it ... Amitabh Bachan is surprising very funny and will make you laugh like 'Bathing Miah' .... his accent ... body language ..... Brilliant ... <br /> <br /> "Assi chutki naab re dropping" is the best song .............. Hilarious.
