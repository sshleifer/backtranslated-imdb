This movie is not about entertainment or even a movie you want to see to pass the time. This movie is a real show of true love that comes only from God. One cannot help but is deeply touched by watching this movie. We have several dimensions of love that contribute to the value of this movie. There is the divine love of God depicted beautifully. God's love surpasses heart and mind and remains and is eternal. There is love in marriage. While the main character struggles with his wife's illness, he realizes through God's love that he loves his wife more than he ever could. He knows that he and his wife are one and can never be separated. Eventually you have the love of child and parent. The children in the family come together and realize that nothing matters, except that love overcomes the fear. Dear friends, love is not love unless it comes from God, because God is love and love comes from God. Talk to someone and let them know you love them. Love does nothing good when given to someone else. I pray this movie can inspire and change the lives of all who see it. Amen !!
