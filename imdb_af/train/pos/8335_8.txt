While the sparkling chemistry between Ryan and Robbins alone is a reason to see this movie, the supporting role (Matthau, Fry, Shalub, Durning and the hilarious trio of Jacobi, Saks and Maher) is also an added plus. Matthau shines as Einstein, Fry is perfect as Ryan's clinical fiancee, and Shalub's line about Einstein's gonads is, as noted, one of the highlights of the film. The speech Robbins gives at his first appearance in public is pure poetry. Kudos to the authors for handling this foam with white and levity. I also thought that Keene Curtis was wonderful like Eisenhower. This can be seen as something of a chick movie, but I think everyone will get a kick out of it. Eight many solid points.
