For example, of all British imperial films such as Four Feathers, Charge of the Light Brigade, this movie is like the cream of the crop. It reflects a time when "the sun never set on the British Empire." Come on over. I will not, because so many others have expressed many reasons that make this movie good. I visited the hills of Alabama and marketed the pass by the British and it remains as it was, unchanged by time and intrusion by man and vandal. And although I know it comes, Din sees dead on a portable and when these lines read. <br /> <br /> "Yes, Din! Din! Din! <br /> <br /> You Lasarushian Leather Gunga Din! <br /> <br /> Although I called you and flew you, <br /> <br /> Through life Gawd who made you <br /> <br /> You are a better person than I am, Gunga Din "<br /> <br /> I still get 54 -year-old age, and a foggy eye is not, and anyone who says they are not a liar. The extent of emotions within it is the sign of a great movie. Like the end of another great movie, Van Muise and Mans.
