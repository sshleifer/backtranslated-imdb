This 1986 Italian-French remake of the 1946 movie of the same name raises the heat early and does not let us rise to the air. The story is about a high school student (Federico Pitzalis), who can't see the mysteriously beautiful young woman (played by Dutch phenomena Maruschka Detmers) who lives next to the school. One day, he followed her, and paid her perseverance. There is only one problem: she is engaged to a sketchy character (Riccardo De Torrebruna) who may or may not have committed an abusive crime, and if he repeats, he will probably be knocked off the wrist. Also, the young woman is a bit "funny in the head", and this is confirmed when we discover she saw the boy's father, who is a psychiatrist. Giulia's emotional instability is only characterized by her wonderful sexual desires. Hot, hot, hot, out of the word, with nice clues and a bomb jump from Detmers, which we play like a yo-yo as from the scene to the scene, with enough tension to make us guess. until - and even after - the end. Available in R and X (!) Rated versions.
