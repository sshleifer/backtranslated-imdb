"Written on the Wind" is an irresistible, wonderful kinky movie, as only director Sirk could do it. The movie is immersed in a bucket full of Freudian symbols, strange melodramatics and colorful contrasts. The relationship between financial success and moral decline is the main theme of the film. Sirk suggests that sexual dysfunction is one of the side effects of capitalism. However, I prefer to see the movie as an excellent example of what Sirk could do with kitschy material. The color palette is particularly impressive. The acting in the movie is also good. Rock Hudson and Lauren Bacall are terribly glamorous and give the film an aura of elegance, but the film belongs to Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone (she has won the best supporting actress Oscar), who keeps the film at a boiling point. Kudos to Frank Skinner's pulsating count, Russell Metty's brilliant camera work (every shot is a masterpiece in itself) and the production design department. The title tune is also a beauty. It's a memorable movie.
