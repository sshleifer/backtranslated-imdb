A female executioner (played by sexy Jennifer Thomas II) has the fun job of fulfilling all the fantasies of all the men on death before meeting their creator. And what a way to go. Lucky this movie is not really, or we will have many more people in this world on the dead. <br /> <br /> It really starts slowly. Low light and bad acting, like most (B) movies. It gets better when it moves. And ending with a bang. <br /> <br /> I will evaluate it very high on the low cost, very sexy movies of the 90s. It's a must see when the kids are away or in bed.
