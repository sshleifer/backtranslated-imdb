The title is onomatopoeism, the sound of a train clinging to the tracks. It is metaphorical for everything that the people living in the dump cannot have. The misery of the people is illustrated by the passing car which represents the relatively inaccessible rich life of the middle class. The pathos of the little boy and his beloved, but unhappy, path are very pleasant. It was Kurosawa's first film in color and he uses beautiful shimmering colors, colors only seen in dreams. The film is surreal and surpassed in beauty. The compassion for mankind is the undermining power, but as always, Kurosawa is focused on capturing the beauty of the film. This is a masterpiece by a genius of the theater.
