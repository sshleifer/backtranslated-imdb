This show has a great story! It is very credible! A man's wife dies and he can not only take care of his children, and he calls his father-in-law to his best friend and many others come later in the show. Like Rebeecca Donaldson, the beloved, yet strong dog Comet, Nikki and Alex, you can find out for yourself (I don't want to spoil it) and Kimmy Gibler! (The sidekick of DJ), but the kids are great too. This is Mary Kate and Ashley first went down! And you can also know Candace Cameron Bure's shows like St.Elsewere Punky Brewster and it's so raven! Jodie Sweetin plays Steph the loving middle child who feels left out. Actually, this is a very good show!
