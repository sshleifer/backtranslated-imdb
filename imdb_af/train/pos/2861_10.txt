I love this show and my 11 year old daughter and I love watching it together. It teaches good old-fashioned values ​​in a fun, adventurous and entertaining way (though most of the time it is with a somewhat predictable story). It's also fun to have fun ... you know, rewind and put your own dialogue, instead of the actors. <br /> <br /> I set my DVR to record all the episodes and I happened to catch the end of an episode (just before the next one starts ... so I don't know what episode it was ) but there was an absolutely terrible sequence error! Adam gave Sheriff Coffee a small piece of "leather" which was torn from a chosen dress when he tried to leave. Answer Roy. put it on his desk and placed the slip where it was torn. The swatch was actually rectangular ... which I think would be almost impossible to tear off a piece of leather (Naugahyde after 1950? Yes. Learn? I don't think so). Well, the swatch lay perfectly and the secret has been solved. <br /> <br /> Not ten seconds later in the scene we see the dress again, still lying on Roy's desk. But this time the swatch is more like the shape of North Carolina and is now in a COMPLETE OTHER place on the jacket (but still perfectly aligned with the hole in the jacket) and the seam (which was in the middle of the blow-dab swatch) is now gone ... just like the seam in the coat. My daughter had a good laugh when we played the short scene over and over! It's fine for youtube, I tell you! <br /> <br /> We still love the show and the sequel errors make it fun!
