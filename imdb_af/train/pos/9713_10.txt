This series has been placed on cable TV station "Comedy Central" in the United States. It was killed and sequenced. It was sad for the audience who had to lure it, it didn't and did not fall off the road. Fortunately, my cable company has digital at the same time and I got the BBC. Thank you for watching the "League of Gentlemen", okay, complete and unmoved. <br /> <br /> The "League of Gentlemen" group is right there with England's "Monty Python's Flying Circus" and Canada's "The Kids in the Hall". But .. a warning. <br /> <br /> "The League of Men" is one step further. It's not just about towing in and tackling the cultural ailments, it goes deeper and much, much darker. I can tell many of you now - it will insult certain groups of people, it will address others. But remember, his only comedy. Dark, dark comedy. If it's not your thing, don't look. If you think you know a dark comedy, watch it - if you get angry and upset, you don't know much about DARK KOMEDY. <br /> <br /> These guys are right, and right on the button. They are brilliant, they are excellent and I have enjoyed every character creation. There is a COMPLETE story being told here from episode one to the end. You can't see this one episode at a time, it's one of the charms of this series. Look it all right. See how creative and stylish and deeply disturbed these guys are. Nobody and nothing is unlimited. This, my dough, is "dark humor". Bravo!
