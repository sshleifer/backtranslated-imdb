I was really amazed at how much a movie, more than 60 years old, can impress me. It's almost two hours long, there's absolutely no stars in it, but there are subtitles, but it's interesting and exciting to watch. What impressed me mostly was the realism of the movie. You can almost feel the cold of the ice, because you can see that the storms are real. It is a relief in a CGI world like our days. I wondered how much work it should have been for Van Dyke. I read somewhere that it took 17 months to film it. Now who wants to talk more about 'Titanic'? This is a good movie with a good message and I recommend it to future directors to see how big and realistic movies can be if they are directed only with realism rather than visual effects.
