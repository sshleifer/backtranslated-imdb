More like psychological analysis of movies, but Psycho sounds better than a head. The man in charge of the movie (the narrator if you like) makes movies out there in his own way. Most of them are classic, but everyone is here at IMDb and I strongly advise you to see them (especially the Hitchcock movies, Solyaris, Conversation & Lynch movies), because Slavoj Zizek will refer them! <br /> <br /> In other words, he may spoil them for you. I don't remember being more spoiled than those I listed (I also think the Chaplin movies), but as I have written, it would be best to look at them before! In the IMDb listing there is a missing movie, which I reported to them, so it may soon be there. It's a Meg Ryan movie, but it's just a short piece that's not that big. <br /> <br /> Zizek views and opinions are fun and fun to listen to, if you are open to seeing things Another perspective (even if it destroys your favorite movie a bit for you ... it does not mean it will, but it can!
