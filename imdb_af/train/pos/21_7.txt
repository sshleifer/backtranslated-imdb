It may not be an unforgettable classic, but it is a pleasant romance with an important theme that emphasizes the importance of literacy in modern society and the devastating career and life consequences for any unhappy person who lacks this important skill. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around Iris, a widow who meets a co-worker at her factory work, an illiterate cafeteria named Stanley. Iris discovers Stanley can't read, and after losing his job, she gives him home reading in her kitchen. Of course, as you predict, the two, although initially cautious of engagement, can develop feelings for one another ... <br /> <br /> Jane Fonda plays competitive Iris, a woman with her own problems, who is missing a job prospects, two teenage children (one pregnant), an unemployed sister and her abused husband. But Robert DeNiro is, of course, brilliant in his engaging portrayal of the intelligent and resourceful but illiterate Stanley, which brings dignity to the role of respect. They are not your typical, lovely young yuppie couple, as usually portrayed in the scenic romance, but an ordinary working class, middle-aged couple with a bit of ground struggle. <br /> <br /> I won't give up, but it's a beautiful, heart-warming romance and a personal look at the disturbing issue of adult illiteracy, albeit from the perspective of a fictional character .
