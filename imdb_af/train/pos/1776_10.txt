I hated the first episode of this performance ('Protesting Hippies') so much in 1999 that I avoided the rest. However, when it came to the Paramount Comedy Channel, I fully watched it and to my surprise it was absolutely hilarious (Motto: Never judge a comedy series in its first week)! <br /> <br /> In 1969, "Hippies" stars Simon Pegg as "Ray Purbbs", editor of an "Oz" underground underground magazine called "Mouth". His friends are the feminist Jill, Alex, and the half-white Hugo. Back in the late 60's, there was a sense of incredible optimism among the youths, that they could change the world through the printing of magazines that nobody reads. Rather than sniffing at the hippies' naivety, 'Hippies' is loving. Arthur Mathews's essay parodies a number of icons of that era - 'Hair', 'Woodstock', 'The Graduate', even the notorious Oz obsession of the early 70's. Excellent performances from the film; Julian Rhind-Tutt's 'Alex' kept me in mind of the Richard O'Sullivan character of 'Man About The House'. It is a pity that there was never a second series, possibly because of people like me. If you missed "Hippies", try it. If you pass the pass, you are making a surprise!
