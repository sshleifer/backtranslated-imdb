I went to a small preview of this movie on July 19, and I didn't know more than the names of some of the actors and that it was a kind of fantasy / adventure quest. <br /> <br /> The plot line I'm really nothing like I saw, and a unique story is definitely appreciated with everything currently in or soon coming to theaters. Despite what may give first impressions, it is not cheesy, stubborn, tough or ridiculous, and is actually very entertaining and funny. The flow was fairly well done, nothing looked rushed or released. The soundtrack, for lack of better words, is magical and adds a lot to the movie, unlike the silence that often happens in movies or TV. And although I may have known what comes to the point, I still couldn't stop looking at the screen; to my knowledge no one left the theater throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> My one gripe is that there is hardly any marketing for this movie and as brilliant as it is, I can't figure out why.
