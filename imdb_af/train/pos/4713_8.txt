All in all, this movie is not perfect. It doesn't fit well, as the story line is basically a lot of hooks to hang jokes. <br /> <br /> Some of these jokes are a bit 'too 80s' and tend to date the photo. <br /> But some of these jokes are classic. <br /> <br /> You know a movie has something special when you and your friends refer to dull quotes about two decades later. <br /> <br /> Plus, there are a lot of familiar faces; Michael Keaton, Danny Devito, Joe Piscapo, Peter Boyle, Marilu Henner, Maureen Stapleton, Bob Eubanks, Griffin Dunne and one of the last roles of Alan Hale Jr., the skipper of Gilligan's Island. <br /> <br /> There are also some great absurd moments, such as when Johnny pays a prize money puppy, or the pope who looks like Johnny's environment. Also the scene where the false priest makes up many words in Latin is excellent. ("Summa cum laude, magna cum laude, the radio's too louda ... Post meridian, ante meridian, uncle meridian"). <br /> <br /> Other classic scenes include Ramone Maroney, who speaks the English language, but Danny Devito urges Griffin to Dunne after 'Play Ball' Peter Boyle thinks he lost his masculinity The fake VD movie <br / > <br /> This movie is not a home page. But like 'Porky's', it has enough classic comedy bits to make it memorable.
