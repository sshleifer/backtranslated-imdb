I had very little trouble with this movie, and I heard a lot of criticism and said it was over and over. True, it's been more than three hours, but I was surprised it was going so fast. I don't think it's overestimated, I think the IMDb rating is very decent. The film looks striking, with beautiful costumes and excellent effects, and the direction of James Cameron rarely shifts from the focus. Leonardo DiCaprio gives one of his best performances as Jack, and Kate Winslet is beautiful as Rose. David Warner, a great actor, steals every scene in which he is involved. The story is very rich in detail, and is entirely on character development, obvious with the love story that moves a lot when it needs to be, although in the first part of the movie it's a bit slow. The last hour was very loud, and I would admit that I was on the edge of my seat when the Titanic sank. I will also say that the last five minutes have moved a lot. The music score by James Horner was beautiful, but I have never been a big fan of the song My Heart will go. The 1996 miniseries were good, but suffered from undeveloped scenarios and some historical inaccuracies. Overall, I give Titanic an 8.5 / 10. Bethany Cox.
