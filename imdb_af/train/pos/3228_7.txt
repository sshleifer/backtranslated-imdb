David Webb Peoples meet Paul Anderson ... if it's alien to you then you're right because it's. Peoples are known for their scriptures with moral implications of what is right and wrong, the value of life, and so on. He dealt with these issues in Bladerunner, in vain, and almost in all his scenes, there is something along those lines. <br /> <br /> Paul Anderson's first successful movie was a violent thriller. Not surprisingly, it has all its other movies! And here's a violent thriller with moral implications! <br /> <br /> The people's writing is clear in the first half of the movie. Soldiers trained from birth, learned to kill and never had a normal life. They are being replaced by better, genetically engineered soldiers, and Todd, one of the original soldiers, is left on a planet and left dead. There he has to deal with a group of refugees, some want him to keep others hated him and there is an interesting drama here. BUT THEN ... <br /> <br /> ... The bullets start flying as the new soldiers move on the planet for a military exercise and try to kill all the people. Big, violent, harsh action follows and people's writing becomes an Anderson action festival. It is hard to believe that the writing was originally written, but the end product is better than I expected. Entertainment, somewhat, though not much, thoughtful and exciting as soon as the action begins. 7/10 <br /> <br /> Rated R: A lot of violence
