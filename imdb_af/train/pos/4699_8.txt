It did for crime that "Not another teen film" did for school. I laughed all the way while 2 relentless gangs with each other and with each other. An unfinished comedy that uses cute jokes and gags that made me roll all the way. I suspect the biggest gag in the whole movie was that time that never seemed to hold the characters in the 30's.
