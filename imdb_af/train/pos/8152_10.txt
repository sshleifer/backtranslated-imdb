I have just read the most recent comments on this movie and I would like to respond. you are probably not familiar with the original story of rap group N.W.A. dating from 1988, in 1989 the ice cube left the band in 1989 to go solo and eventually in 1991, the band broke up when the dr. which led to a lot of beef that started with the departure of ice cube and dr. dree in 1991. This story was somewhat based on it. <br /> <br /> Even more, this movie was a 90-minute fun spree, the way they explained the bootie juice song to be a political statement is hilarious. Not to mention the "love song" was nice. And when Vanilla Sherbert kicked his ass, the recordmate driver is also hilarious and also has drivers to be shot every time. <br /> <br /> people who don't enjoy this movie probably didn't get it or were full idiots, my opinion
