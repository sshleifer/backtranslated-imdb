A typical Clausen movie, but not typical again. Clausen writes, leads and plays one of the leading roles. It's really a good movie about normal people living normal life and trying to make the best of it. The 4 primary actors were fantastic. <br /> <br /> Fritz Helmut was convincing. You believe he's really sick. <br /> <br /> Sonja Richter plays a nurse who is really an actor, but she seems to be the best nurse to care for the old man. <br /> Everyone has problems and those who believe no one eventually become happy. But nothing good comes easy, they have to fight to win their life and love.
