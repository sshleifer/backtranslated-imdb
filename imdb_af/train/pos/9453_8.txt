Liberation is the fascinating, haunting and sometimes even disturbing story of James Dickey, who changed into a brilliant movie by John Boorman. It's about four businessmen, driven by masculinity and macho behavior, spending a canoe weekend high up in the mountains. Above, they stand with every darkest side of man and every worst form of human misery ... poverty, buggery and even physical harassment! These four men wanted to travel from the adventure and excitement to the river, but their journey quickly turned into an odyssey through a violent and mournful mountain land, completely alienated from all forms of civilization. All of these elements actually make Rescue one of the most nightmare movies I've ever seen. Just about everything that happens to these men, you pray that you will never be in a similar situation. Pure talk film, Deliverance is also a very important movie. John Boorman's best (now followed by Zardoz and Excalibur) was - and still is - a very influential film and features several memorable scenes that have already appeared in many other films. Just think of the awesome Dueling Banjos music count, and of course, the memorable homosexual "squeal like a pig" rape scene. All the actors (haha) deliver perfect stage performances. Especially Jon Voight. A must see movie !!
