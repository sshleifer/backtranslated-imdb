Although not without its flaws, this drama was an appropriate one to show the Easter. It reminds us of our spiritual selves and has shown that we often hide our deepest suffering and experiences behind our facades. There was so much to enjoy in the drama, not least, the runaway teenagers who provided a better musical accompaniment to the drama than the rather poor sounding point in the background. The acting was excellent and Timothy Spall was great again. The climax was very satisfying, rather simplistic. Timothy Spall's "release" of his long-time wife's suicide was credible and reflected the feelings of despair in the teenage girl herself. The decision between the graffiti boy and the Muslim was satisfactory, but less credible. A wonderful drama that my husband and I left, dropped the night. Congratulations!
