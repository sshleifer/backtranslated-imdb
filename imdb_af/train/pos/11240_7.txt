Low budget Brit pop melodrama focuses on a girl who wants to be a star, become one and find it too much. Good throwing and a sense of time and place cannot hide the fact that we have been here before. Several scenes are a bit hysterical and O'Connor's voice sounds like Mini Mouse! She soon disappeared from the face after she made this movie. So life can imitate art! A must see if you want to see a punk version of a Star Is Born.
