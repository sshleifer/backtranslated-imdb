Trick or Treat, Quickie Review This zany skirt of a movie revolves around the 80-year-old culture of Heavy Metal and horror movies - two things I love very much. So, as you can imagine, this movie has almost taken me off. Plus, for no reason, Ozzy Osbourne plays a minister. <br /> <br /> This movie is about an unpopular high school youth that, like all our losers, ended up in a world of "evil" Heavy Metal. His favorite Metaldude dies and of course it is miraculously excited - by playing back his latest unpublished album. It allows the corrupted singer to kill and help people with demons. <br /> <br /> Well, it's sometimes cute, but you know what? It has a surprising number of good features. Good acting (including Gene Simmons as a radio DJ), pretty good special effects, very short nudity, decent atmosphere ... Even though it's a decent horror movie. But what is struggling is the music. Ironic, huh? Well, this "evil" Metal man is one of the most unpleasant, high-end Motley Crue rejected on the planet - and the "Metal" is just over 80's Pop / Hair Metal. He hit all the cliches here, from surrounding like a gay fairy, to mean means, to shouting "Rock and Roll !!!" In a high enough peak to drop King Diamond. Apart from that horrible musical performance, it's actually pretty good. 7/10 <br /> <br /> www.ResidentHazard.com
