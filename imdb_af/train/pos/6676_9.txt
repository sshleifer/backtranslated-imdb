****** WARNING: SHOULD SPOILERS KEEP ************** <br /> <br /> So, who is this "Mystery Men?" Simply put, the Mystery Men is a group of sub-Heroes who desperately try to live out their adolescent fantasy life as they both blunt their true identities and their super-identities. The Shoveller (Bill Macy) works during the day, leaving at night his wife and children leaving home as he crawls the street looking for crimes to tackle his extraordinary and unique Shovel fighting styles. The Blue Raja (Hank Azaria) sells silverware to newlyweds daily, and at night tables at crackpot villas, if his mother does not keep up with the latest snooping. Mr. Furious works in a junkyard to earn his wages, and then takes his frustration on his friends at night. He throws bad pregnant one-liners at friend and foe and threatens to really get angry. ?). Ben Stiller breathes such a life into this character, you can't help him but love him. <br /> <br /> These three spend their nights capturing that 'moment of glory' they dreamed of. Super Heroes. This can of course happen. Champion City has Captain Amazing, after all ... a pilot fighting a super-cop with enough corporate logos on his costume to stop an extra bullet or two. Greg Kinnear starred as a middle-aged salesman to regain his fans' attention in the wake of his career. <br /> <br /> To bring that extra magic back to the captions, C.A. free Casanova Frankenstein, a WAAAAAY over-the-top threat played perfection chilling by Goeffrey Rush. This lunatic genius has created a "psycho-faculty" to decorate champion city in a reflection of his own insanity ... and end with the capturing of C.A. within hours of his release from prison. It only stops the Mystery Men Frankenstein's evil plan, but with such henchmen as the Disco Boys protecting Frankenstein, the trio will need some help. <br /> <br /> Recruitment begins and after a painful recruitment party, the team establishes with The Bowler (Janeane Garofolo), who initially has the only true talent in the team, with her mystical bowling bat that is apparently animated by the shaky spirit of her father. the invisible boy (kel mitchell), claiming to turn invisible when absolutely no one looks at him; The Spleen (Paul Reubens), giving mystical mighty flatulence through an evil gypsy; and the very underutilized Sphinx (West Studi), shown to be able to cut rifles in half with his mind, then spends a lot of the rest of the film-jumping riddles and comes overwhelmingly. <br /> <br /> This movie is really a cross-genre skirt. Anyone who wants to-hole movies in neat little categories fights a lost battle. This is a spoof / parody of the superhero genre. Some of the pseudo-Burton sets are endlessly (and sometimes decorated with more spoofing material) to the ridiculous costumes, the comic-book genre is sent pretty well. But at the same time it is also a serious superhero. Both simultaneously. Although not necessarily a unique idea in itself (for example, this movie is in some ways reflected by D.C. Comic's brief Inferior Five work), it's quite innovative for the big screen. It offers the comic book world that requires a suspension of unbelief to accept anyway, and then throw in the inevitable wanna-best - and we all know that superheroes were really, so these guys would really be. If the Big Guy flies with the S in New York City, you see half a dozen news reports about idiots in underwear to kick their buttocks on a regular basis. Certainly, the Shoveller is fighting very well, and the Blue Raja throws forks with great accuracy - all parts of the superhero world. But do they make them real superheroes? Just in their minds. <br /> <br /> This movie is also a comedy, even if it is a dark one. Inevitably, when we try to point out the patent-peculiar nature of superheroids. One-liners fly like the comic geniuses on stage throwing out many pieces to play. Especially wonderful is the conversation by Janeane Garofalo with her bowling / dad. Still, this is not a comedy in the sense of the laughter or the eternal memorable jokes. It blends into a dose of drama, discovery and romance, but never really works in any of them. <br /> <br /> What makes Mystery Men a good movie in the end is very engaging. The poor / poor good guys are eventually justified and become truly superheroes for one bright moment; justice is served; and the movie ends with a scene of realism (as much realism as possible in a world where bowling balls and glasses make the perfect disguise). If the viewer stops labeling the movie, the movie can be a big skirt. <br /> <br /> Of course, no movie is perfect. Claire Forlani comes so bored and pointless as Mr. Furious' love interest, despite a key role as his conscience. Tom Waits somehow seems confused by his own lines as the mad inventor, dr. Rather, though, she is open to watching open scenes picking up retired ladies in the nursing home. And the villains are never more than a firearm (a point is made in the film). The cinematography is sloppy and untouched (as happens in the average cartoon, so it's excusable), the music sometimes dominates the scenery, and the special effects are never very well integrated into the rest. <br /> <br /> However, this movie is generally incredible. You should probably be a fan of comics and the superhero genre to really appreciate this movie, but it's a fun skirt and a great way to kill a few hours and rest your brain. <br /> <br /> In my opinion.
