"Atlantis: The Lost Empire" was all that the previews indicated it would be. You don't often find that. Most of the time, the previews show only the best parts and then the rest of the movie is terrible. Not so with this one. I was happy with the original plot, even though the sub-plots were not. The animation wasn't breaking like "Shrek", but it was good, but still. The plot and story line were well presented and there were only a few slow spots in them. It keeps you interested. I found myself enjoying this one. "Atlantis" gets your attention. You also have to think a little, but not too much. Once you have thought about it, you can find out what should happen, but you really don't know how to do it. <br /> <br /> The casting was also good. Michael J. Fox, as Milo was an excellent choice. His personality fits nicely. The gruff-natured Commander Rourke was also well-chosen with James Garner. His character reminded me of his performance in "Maverick" I also liked. I really liked the deciding Claudia Christian as Helga Sinclair. Her ability to play a nonsense personality makes the movie more interesting. It's just bad she's a villain. <br /> <br /> All in all, definitely worth your while (8 out of 10).
