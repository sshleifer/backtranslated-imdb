Steven Spielberg had a break from his escape in the early 80's, while Whoopi Goldberg addressed a desperate existence of an African American woman in the 1930s in an adaptation of Alice Walker's "The Purple Purple". See Goldberg playing Celie, it's amazing that it's the same woman who played in movies like "Sister Act". This is the kind of movie that can be easy - no, make it, should be part of the curriculum in Black Studies and Women's Studies. There is one scene that could be the most wonderful editing ever on the screen (you will know it if you see it). I can't believe it didn't win a single Oscar; This could be Spielberg's second best film behind "Schindler's List" (perhaps even linked to it). Also with Danny Glover, Adolph Caesar, Margaret Avery, Oprah Winfrey, Willard E. Pugh, Akosua Busia and Laurence Fishburne.
