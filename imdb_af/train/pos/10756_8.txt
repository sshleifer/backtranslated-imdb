Many interesting and moving documentaries on the tragedy of the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. Its main theme is the heroism of US firefighters trying to save as many people as they can. The film is deeply emotional and very disturbing - many people who have been seen on the screen have lost their lives! Recommended.
