This movie is not just about a school shooting, but it has never been seen. But it just adds to the power that this movie has. It's about people and how they deal with the tragedy. I know this has been shown to the students who survived the Columbine shooting and that gave many of them a sense of closure. The acting is wonderful. All three major players (Busy Phillips, Erika Christensen and Victor Garber) are excellent in their roles. I recommend this movie to everyone. One of those movies you're talking about after you see it. It evokes discussion of not only school shooting, but also of human emotions and responses to all forms of tragedy. It's a tear, but it's worth it, and one I will look at again and again
