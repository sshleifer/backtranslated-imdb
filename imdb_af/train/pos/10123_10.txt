Shinjuku Triad Society: Chinese Mafia Wars is unlikely to spread in the West beyond film festivals. Why? Can your sensors have a movie where police officers rape male and female suspects to have them talk (and the victims enjoy it) or does an old woman tear her eye from her skull? These are just a few of the shocks in the store for viewers of this ultraviolet police and gangster story. This makes Clockwork Orange banned in the United Kingdom for years like a Disney cartoon. <br /> <br /> Would you watch this movie? YES This is fantastic and essential viewing for Asian cinema fans. The shocking moments are there to illustrate what goes on in the world of these characters. If you like this, make sure you catch Death or Live, which is very similar (this, of course, includes the crazy end in DOA). Great for Japan that has a talent like Miike, while working with Takeshi Kitano. The best chance of seeing this movie outside a Takashi Miike retrospective at a film festival is on DVD. If I don't turn you off, try searching for a Hong Kong version on the web, because I'm sure it'll come out in that country.
