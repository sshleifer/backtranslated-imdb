I'm not going to lie, it's a good movie. I saw it at my local theater about 4 months ago. I saw it a second time, and I was somewhat bored in the slow scenes. Sid (the sloth) is not so flattering, but Diego (a mountain lion, I think) is really good in the movie. The animation is outstanding, and the story has a pleasant ending. It is worth taking children 10 and less, but teenagers will probably find it a bit boring. Also the uniqueness of the characters is so interesting. As I said, it's a good movie, but I'll upgrade "Toy Story 2" or "Shrek" higher. 8/10
