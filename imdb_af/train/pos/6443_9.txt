Yesterday I watched this movie for the third time. It was introduced to me a few weeks ago. I've never seen it or even noticed it, as it falls (so typical) in the category "Swedish movie" and those who have risen with Hollywood productions tend to be skeptical about foreign films. Hell, what a paradigm shift! The movie touches me because it just keeps my hopes on, man can change in a better way. The Swedish village is just a pattern for all areas on earth where people live together - controlled by religion, misunderstandings, lack of courage, predictions, disguised cruelty, but also the ability to have fun, meet, sing ... It takes an outside trigger to tear off the masks of everyone (who likes one) and to make them feel that we are all just human beings with the desire to live our own lives. I can never stop seeing stories like this because it keeps my hopes up as described above. The five minutes that included the story of Gabriella's song, including her performance, is one of my highlights ever! Thank you Kay Pollak only for these 5 minutes, which made me happy!
