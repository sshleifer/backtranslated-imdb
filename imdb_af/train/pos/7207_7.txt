I went in Deathtrap with a well orchestrated and intriguing thriller; and while this is something like this movie; I can't help but think it's just a poor man's Sleuth. Of course, the classic 1972 movie is an inspiration for this movie; not specifically in terms of the plot, but certainly this is the case with the execution. Michael Caine's decisive role in the central role just confirms it. The film is based on a play by Ira Levin (who previously wrote Rosemary's Baby and The Stepford Wives) and focuses on Sidney Bruhl; A playwright whose best days are behind him. After his last game bombs, Sidney finds himself low. and it is not helped when a play called Deathtrap is called; written by an amateur he has learned comes to his doorstep. Deathtrap is a guaranteed commercial success, and Sidney will soon make a plot of its own. which involves inviting the amateur writer, killing him and then shutting down Deathtrap as his own job. <br /> <br /> Despite all its clever turns and turns; Deathtrap falls on a primary element, and these are the characters. The film fails to give a similar character, and it is very difficult to care about the story when you are not rooted for any of the players. It is not helped by the acting. Michael Caine puts in a good and entertaining performance as you would expect, but no one else prides himself. Christopher Reeve is uncomfortable in his role, while Dyan Cannon somehow manages to make the only possible character indignant with an honestly annoying performance. It is fortunate then that the story is good; And it's just good enough to save the movie. That plot has many twists and turns; some work better than others, but there is always plenty to keep the movie interesting. Director Sidney Lumet also earns a credit because the movie's style is another big plus. The central location is interesting in its own right and the films play the film. Overall, I must admit I enjoyed this movie; but it could have been much better.
