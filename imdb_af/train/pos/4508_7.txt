I was impressed with the beautiful photography in this movie, shot at Alaska. Although technically a melodrama, we see many activities. Eskimos is involved in, like hunting, dancing, building igloo, etc. And their customs, such as offering their wives to visitors, are often in the story. The hunting ranges were sometimes out of stock, as it was easy to recognize rear animal projection screens, but even that was fascinating. Spear fishing for salmon, hunting for walrus, caribou and even a polar bear and a whale sometimes considered it a documentary. There was no molded listing, which strengthened the documentary flavor. The filmmakers have tried to make it look very authentic, with the natives speaking only in an Eskimo language translated by someone on the screen or by intertitles. The introduction said that, except for the white dealers and the Royal Mounted Canadian Police, there were no actors in the film, but it was not quite true. The two leading characters, played by Mala and Lotus Long, were Eskimos at birth, but were professional actors with credits for previous films and you could see that they sometimes had makeup. But they were excellent in their roles and they had Hollywood careers. All in all, the movie is definitely worth it.
