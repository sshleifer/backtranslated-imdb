Why does it have such a low rating? I really don't get it ... Is it because of the bad acting? The bad dialogue? Well, who cares about these things in low-budget horror movies? Seriously, the acting and the dialogue are not important in those movies. People who only hate movies due to bad acting and bad dialogue should not be allowed to rate cow-like low-budget movies. Those movies shouldn't be taken seriously. Period. <br /> <br /> Anyway, time to talk about the movie, right? Well, I loved it! I bought it because I expected a feast, but it's not a fad and the gore is pretty bad. Most of the time it is just the act of being on the body of the actors and it is lame. movie is hilarious! The characters are hilarious, the acting is hilarious (bad play is a good thing in low-budget horror movies). The dialogue is hilarious (bad dialogue is a good thing in low-budget horror movies). The zombie rapist big dick is hilarious, the flying demon baby is hilarious and I can get on and off, but I don't want to say too much ... BUT I have to mention there's a scene in which a girl has a sex masturbate doll as it is alive fun! Oh, and the zombie rapist falls in love with the sex doll! <br /> <br /> Best lines in the movie: <br /> <br /> Detectives: * Sniffs Coke * Detective Sloane: What the * beep * do you, Manners? What did you cut? What is hell? Detective Manners: It's not a man, it's ... Ehh ... Cold medicine ... <br /> <br /> Detective Manners: * Spray heroin in his arm * Detective Sloane: What the * squeak * does you, Ways? Are you * beep * insane? Detective Manners: It's a cold medicine. <br /> <br /> Detective Manners: * Repeatedly shoots a random man. * Detective Sloane: What's the hell going on, Manners? What are you doing? Detective Manners: This maniac was walking around demons and then he threw his head on the rock! He just started beating his head on the rock! I think he's on PCP or something! <br /> <br /> LOL!
