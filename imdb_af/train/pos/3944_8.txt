This little movie has long been on my "guard" list. Do people know how stressed, menopausal, emotionally abused women (as well as mentally disabled) are really treated by the medical profession at the beginning of the century? !! All the pious, sincere Christian attitudes of that time were deadly to investigate TRUE emotional feelings that would allow us to embrace, leave, explore suffering what it means to embrace our humanity. Can you really (according to today's standards) suggest that Walt Whitman's books were banned because he recognized women as feelings and emotional reactions as well as men? Think about it! The sensitivity of this movie still gets me and I give the director credit to capture it through his eyes.
