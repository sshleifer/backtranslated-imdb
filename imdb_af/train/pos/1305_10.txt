This film put me to the test when it started in a Arizona cafe and Richard Grieco, (Rex), Dead Easy, 04, decided to eat something and warm and bother about a very hot, sexy waitress. While Rex walks out of the cafe, he sees a state smoker and asks him: "ARE YOU MANY?" and then hell breaks in more ways than one. Nancy Allen (Maggie Hewitt), "Dressed to Kill," 80, is a TV rep and is always looking for a news bulletin to broadcast. Maggie wind in a hot tub and Rex appeals to her to tell her he wants a show, Western style, with the local top police in town. It's another movie, but Nancy Allen and Richard Grieco are the only two actors to help this picture!
