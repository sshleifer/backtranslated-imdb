This show only lasted one season but was interesting to audiences because it required visual skills and a steady hand. One false move would disqualify the contestant from winning the prize, although it was clear, the contestant got the right answer. It was always exciting, as the participant started to sign, wondering if they would complete or delete the drawing; so that the other contestant can easily win the match. It was a light-hearted performance, but it was clear that the participants were often embarrassed by a stupid mistake that was unintentionally made. Rarely did the game show not survive the past one season. Just a seasoned game show addict will remember this show as it seems quite unpopular, although game shows have made a big return to the TV screen after the scandals of the 1950s shows. But it was a unique concept for a game show and one that has never been seen again.
