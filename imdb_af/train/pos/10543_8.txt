A light-hearted comedy, Nothing shows us a world we sometimes want to escape: a world of nothing. Anything you don't like, whether it's a stack of accounts, a bad memory or even hunger can disappear on your desire. They approached this movie very well, and with a nice starring duo, there were only a few things I didn't like about Nothing, and they were not even part of the main movie. First, The post-credit scene (and yes, there is one): Good for a nice, but what did they try to achieve with it? I was confused and eager to see a return to something after a whole movie of nothing. Instead, we only hear a random variety of sounds and they shout. It seems to me to be a sequel, and it wasn't really necessary, and it wasn't funny either after the tortoise scratched out of the frame. <br /> <br /> Second, the trailer: I saw the trailer on the DVD, and as others have already said, it promotes a horror movie that never came. Oh well, poor marketing I think. <br /> <br /> If you see it at your movie rental shop, look because nothing is a good movie to watch. However, if you have a large screen, you may want to wear shades.
