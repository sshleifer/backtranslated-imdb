After reading very good reviews about this movie, I decided to take it for a turn (I bought it on DVD, hence the "spin" play ... I'm a dork). The start was everything I hoped for, a perfect set-up (along with a few quotes I heard on several Wu-Tang albums) that had to be a good movie. But the plot I heard was so good, was so predictable. Every time I saw a character (except the lizard), I guess what poison he was. Plus, the only cool character is killed in the middle of the film. Okay, so the plot wasn't very good, but at least there were some good kung-fu right? Wrong. The battles were very short and few and far between. All the different styles were pretty cool, but I wish the battles were longer. I was hoping to see the Lizard running and doing a little crazy on the walls, but it never happened. I was hoping to see the Centipede do a little quick, but it never happened. I was hoping to see the Scorpio in the movie for more than 7 minutes, but it never happened. In short, there is not much going on. The battles are all pretty routine. Don't just be deceived as this movie has a plot, it doesn't mean it's a good one.
