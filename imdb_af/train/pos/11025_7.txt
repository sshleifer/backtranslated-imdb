Cliffhanger is a decent action crime adventure with some bugs by director Renny Harlin who is admirable in making this movie about a knowledgeable climber who finds himself being taken hostage by a fellow friend of a gang of dangerous criminals on the search for packaged cases of stolen cash in the Rocky Mountains. Sylvester Stallone is impressive as Gabe Walker is the expert climber, especially in the action / battle order, but some of them are definitely on the line of unrealistic. For the sake of the movie although I want to suspend my unbelief. The rest of the film, such as John Lithgow, Michael Rooker, Janine Turner, Rex Linn, Caroline Goodall and Leon are respectful of the supporting characters in the movie. The action / battle order is well executed, but as already mentioned, some are not very realistic, however difficult you are. However, the climbs were very well done, because instead of making the entire movie in a studio, the places they chose were very real and the Ariel views of the mountain ranges were wonderful, adding the reality of the movie by. The deaths are inventive, while others are predictable. The villains are sturdy, but it would have been better if they focused on one central rather than having many of them. The performance of the movie was a bit slow, but the heavier than the bad in this one. If you are a big fan of Harlins or Stallone's as chances, you will also enjoy this one. Overall Cliffhanger has character development with enough action, drama, excitement, excitement, excitement and good performances by the cast that makes this movie worth the time.
