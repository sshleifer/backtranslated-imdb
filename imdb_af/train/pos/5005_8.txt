With the films like Wallace & Gromit and Chicken Run under their band, the good people from the other side of the dam, Aardman Animation, now set us some of their twisted humor in the form of "Creature Comforts" <br /> <br /> Coming from a short time early in their careers, "Creature Comforts" is a cut-of-life show where snippets of conversation are removed from their context and given to some kind of animal . <br /> <br /> Aardman Animation went over the land and questioned people with innocent questions, such as: "Are you a liar?" <br /> <br /> The answers, while looking annoying and commonplace, are actually pretty funny. If you understand, the dialogues come first and the animals are added later. . <br /> <br /> How many of these animals look like the person making the statements? One of the characters discussing what he was looking for in a woman, "I like them so thinly." is an insect, the Walking Stick. <br /> <br /> There are two dogs that discuss odors and odors, while the back of a poodle sniffs, as they talk about the different smells of a woman. <br /> <br /> There are two birds in a cage. As the woman tells her, her long-suffering husband is with her and says nothing. <br /> <br /> While it may take time for "Creature Comforts" to find its "legs", it should find a place on television for those who are tired of the ordinary. While there are more reality shows than Carter has liver pills, "Creature Comforts" is one of a kind and definitely worth watching. Some of the humor may seem a little racy, it's the clay that attracts the attention of the kids (like the old Batman series of the 60s, the jokes are subtle enough, the kids won't get it) and that's the jokes for adults.
