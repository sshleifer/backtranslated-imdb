I was addicted from beginning to end. Big horror comes from disturbing images and organic shocks that aren't created to make you jump, but to let you go "What did the f * ck just see?" All the other commentators have briefly summarized what the film is about, so I won't repeat what has already been said. I told other people about this movie days after I saw it just because it still haunts me. I even had a bad dream after seeing it, and I'm a real horror fan, who is not easily haunted by a fear like 'The Wrudge' or even 'Silent Hill'. What gave me the bad dreams was the discomfort I felt about what I would do if I were with those guys in that cell. What would be my personal horror? my subconscious took me there, and it wasn't nice. That my friends are doing a good horror flick to you! The best part of this movie is that it is subtle. It's not about Bogeymen who walk out on you, alien invasions or tons of gore. This is the opposite. The horror you create in your own mind. The irony for the four characters is that the horror does not come from an external force that claims it may be over them. Simply, the men are asking for the one thing they desire, and they get it ... but not in the way they thought. So on the one hand, they get what they want from an occult book, but can finally wish they didn't. Sometimes it is locked in a prison cell, the best place to be!
