I think the idea of ​​the plot is perfect to examine first of all the emotional experiences of the people involved and secondly, as someone else wrote in a comment, the implications of this kind of relationship (incest and lesbianism) in the Romanian society. <br /> <br /> So ... to start with the second aspect ... to make it short, it wasn't visible at all. <br /> <br /> as for the first .. as I said, it had much more potential ... I think that type of relationship carries much more stress ... much more tension ... and the potential excitement did not pass ... <br /> <br /> I think the soundtrack could be more than the few songs in the background and the theme (which was nice but not enough and not always in the right moments) ... yes ... I could have the absence of a better soundtrack. <br /> <br /> The actors ... I think they were somewhere from 7 to 8/10 ... not enough sensuality in the key moments. <br /> <br /> a total of 7/10 .... mostly for the story
