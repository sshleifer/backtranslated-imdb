In the World Depression Era Prague, it is the story of an ambitious shop clerk who falls in love with a mysterious woman with whom he exchanged romantic letters, just to discover that the mysterious woman is no one else but the shop assistant. , which seems to be in constant contact with the colleague. Add a little doubt (the owner is convinced that his favorite employee -Stewart has a relationship with the owner's wife), which Stewart briefly dismissed, along with an acknowledgment that the saleswoman held 'Stewart' the happy ending is inevitable. <br /> <br /> Although very dated (references to poverty and - I have a wife and two children to consider - are overused, along with the indication that many small objects of pleasure, such as a musical cigar box, is out of reach for ordinary people's enjoyment), this movie is very effective (and more credible) than in the 1990s, again "You've Got Mail". In the repetition of Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, the real chances of the chain of events are so incredible that the viewer's intelligence is severely offended. <br /> <br /> "Shop Around The Corner" is an innocent lane of memory in a less complicated, less hectic and more romantic time and place known as a novel's Utopia.
