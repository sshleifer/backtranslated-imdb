This movie is for Halloween which is the hilarious Christmas story for Christmas. Both are relatively low-budget, non-big-name star-type movies ... and both are two of the absolute biggest and funniest movies available, both seasonal classic !!! "Spaced Invaders" comes from the start with warmth and humor and excellent character characters. All five goofy Martians, Klembecker the Realtor, Russell the deputy, Vern at the fuel distribution depot and so much more! You just have to watch this movie to believe it, and like 'Christmas Story' it just gets better and better with every look, and you count on fun little things every time! BUT DEFINITELY A TEN !!!
