Nice movie about three vibrant sisters from Switzerland (often seen in similar outfits) who want their parents back together (apparently, mommy is still the torch for the father) - so they go to New York to stop the dad Marrying a blonde gold engraver he calls "precious". Dad didn't see his daughters in ten years, they didn't seem sensible and thought he was wonderful. Meanwhile, Precious seems to be leading a life run mainly by her excessive mother (Alice Brady), a woman who just wants to see her daughter marry a rich man. The sisters get the idea of ​​pushing Precious on the road of a drunk Hungarian score and tricking the two golden digging women into thinking he is one of the richest men in Europe. But a case of wrong identity makes the girls believe the score is RayManand, who goes with the scheme, because he has a love of sister Kay. <br /> <br /> This movie is enjoyable, lightweight. Barbara Read as Kay so nice and beautiful, Ray Milland looks oh so young and beautiful here (though, unfortunately, little is given to do), Alice Brady is pretty good as the twilight mom - but it's Deanna Durbin, a true sweetheart and cute as a button playing the youngest sister Penny, who pretty much steals the show. With many beautiful choirs, she sings several songs throughout the film, although I really wanted them to find her even more. The plot in this movie is a bit silly, yet I found the movie entertaining and fun.
