I voted excellently for how good the acting was, not for the content. It still gives me cold fever after I read the book and then watched the movie. Two ex-disadvantages travel to their destination to rob a family of money from a safe one of the disadvantages taught in prison. During the ride, the tension begins to climb as the soundtrack in the movie adds to the overall expectation. After the murderers had done their work on the farm, the family's remains were found the next morning by the daughter's church friend. The blood-spreading scream, as the scene on the phone rinsed with the cut cord, made my blood thrive and gave me cold fever. The fact that the killers meet their fortunes is a small consolation for this doomed family. Robert Blake was excellent in his portrayal of Perry Smith. The book is also excellently written by Truman Capote.
