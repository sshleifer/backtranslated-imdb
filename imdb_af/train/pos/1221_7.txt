For the longest time, I liked this movie better than the original Care Bears movie. Well last summer, I looked at both of them and decided I was wrong. The first one is a better Care Bears movie (as you might guess if you read my review for it). This one is not a BAD movie, it's just ... VERY STRONG. <br /> <br /> First of all, as some people have mentioned, it is quite the knowledge of the first movie. I can't think of another successor who contradicts the original so blatantly (especially with the generations of some characters and how they all met). When I was small and looked at it, I was rather confused and confused. I felt the same way as an adult! <br /> <br /> For the reasons why the movie is pretty good (if you release it from the first movie). I can't think of another movie for little kids with a DEMON as it's villa! Now I'm not for a moment suggesting that evil demons who want to steal the souls of campers and caregivers are good, I just find it cool that there is a VERY US IN a movie for little kids! It's like the bizzare "Santa Clause vs. Satan" movie from Mexico you sometimes hear. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the devil's name is Darkheart and he wants this chick to help him get the Care Carriers in exchange for him who gives her special powers. Very dark for a kiddy flick eh? And did I mention that Darkheart is the most common girl as a WHYY-VOICED 10 YEARS OLD BOY ??? Strange! Meanwhile, there are other children in Care-a-Lot looking at BABY CARE BEARS! Oh man! Demons and Baby Care Bears IN THE SAME MOVIE !!!!! <br /> <br /> Needless to say, everything is finally cleared up (but not before we see Darkheart, the Care Bears souls fall into this scary chandelier thing in one [surprisingly] deeply disturbing scene). But I have the question whether this film has found the cult that deserves it so richly. I might see it again myself.
