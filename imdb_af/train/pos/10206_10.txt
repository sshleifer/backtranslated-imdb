In my years of attending film festivals, I have seen many small films like this that never get theatrical distribution, and they end up in the $ 3 bakkie at WalMart. I only found DVD from Yank Tanks there, great doc, but how sad it is to end up as a rock bottom. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie, wish I saw it at the theater. That's all. I chose New Yorker Films to translate the title directly. It's good for Americans to stretch a little. If the movie's title helps the American audience to explore random chaos, better. Cinema imitates life and vice versa. <br /> <br /> Also, I deduced that the captions prices are in dollars. Come on! The euro is not hard to figure out, making the gringo audiences the math. If you see a movie, especially one shot in Paris, the viewer should not spoil the effect by being reminded. I'm an American watching a movie and they translate the Euros into dollars for me. <br /> <br /> Look forward to seeing more of these actors and more of the writer and director.
