I thought it was one of the best movies I've seen in a very long time. It was a good story line and showed that people are so complicated in all sorts of ways. Recommend it to all my friends !! I always enjoy a good story line and this movie has one of the best I've seen in a long time. I could see that I have a daughter and do the same things Natalie did to know more about her life and love. It showed us not only living with our families; but also parts of our lives that we do not share with them - as it may not be in their best interest to do all the details of things we do, we are so proud of them. <br /> <br /> I look forward to another such movie, and keep my eye out.
