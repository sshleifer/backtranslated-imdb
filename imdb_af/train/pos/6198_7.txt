I'm one of those people who want to crawl a mile through broken glass to see a Hal Hartley movie. From TRUST and IRIS to HENRY FOOL and (my Hartley favorite) NO THING, Hal's unique brand of movies is an acquired taste. The collection of equal parts mystery / spying with wispy comedy seems to be his forts. The comedy is not necessarily in your face, and often runs through a whole scene before it comes into being. And this is the case with FAY GRIM, the successor to Henry Fool. <br /> <br /> Parker Posey stars as Fay Grim, Henry Fool's abandoned wife and Henry's only son Ned. Fay lives a quiet life until one day she comes home to find a CIA agent in her kitchen. His name is Fulbright (Jeff Goldblum, MAN OF THE YEAR) and he wants Henry's notebooks. There are many Henry Fool notebooks and they were all previously nothing but crazy walks. Apparently, there is much more to them. Secrets weapons research or roads for terrorists? Who knows Henry? Agent Fulbright tells Fay that her husband is dead, but it is quickly considered a ruse to get Fay out of her house and look for Henry (and it works ... but not as they think). <br /> <br /> Fay is fighting several spy rings to collect Henry's notebooks and to find him. She also made an agreement with the CIA to get her brother Simon (James Urbaniak) out of jail. (He helped Henry escape the country into the original Henry Fool movie.) Several overlapping events occur quickly: spy rings shoot each other to death Henry discovers he is being held in safety by a jihad. Fay frees her brother, but unknowingly threatens her son's life, and the CIA is getting his way to jeopardizing Fay. <br /> <br /> Of course, Hal Hartley likes playing with themes. And he does it to the limit here. Even character names (Grim, Fool, Fulbright, Fogg) have implicit meanings of their own quite funny. Oil's overall espionage films are also given a lot of screen time, as guns are blowing into stop sequences and never beat our heroine, though she is right in the firing line. <br /> <br /> Having been praised for this creation, I would say that Parker Posey's excessive portrayal of Fay Grim is not the best part of the movie, it is a pity to consider how much time she spent on the screen is. I realize this was probably what Mr Hartley wanted: an uncovered woman with hand gestures to the Italian extreme. But it was always painful to watch. <br /> <br /> Yet, fans will probably devour and beg for more. Although it wasn't my favorite Hal Hartley movie, I know I'm right.
