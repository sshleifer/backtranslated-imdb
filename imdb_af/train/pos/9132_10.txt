I started my first encounter with Prince's music. It was in a bar, on my 39th birthday and a girl danced naked until 1999 played on the speakers. I asked people, who is this singer? I said it was prince. It was so good that it distracted me from a beautiful, top-class dancer. Later I started to hear other Prince songs and really "dig" them. When Purple Rain came out, I didn't know much about this co-lover. The movie blows me away. I immediately got Prince's No. 1-fan of the "War Baby" generation. Later I found out that one of my cousins ​​was his secretary, and she had me and my cousin in a V.I.P. Prince concert where we sat next to his mother ... how cool it is! To come back to the topic ahead, I agree with Siskel & Ebert, who called Purple Rain an immediate classic. I've seen it 17 times and love it absolutely. I thought Prins's play was good, Apollonia struggled a bit, but everything was fine. John Gielgud was not available to play 'The Kid', so Prince played the role. The film is visually stunning, played brilliantly (it never slows down), and corrective. I rank it among the best movie music of all time. The last time I looked at it was after a gap of 7 years and it still delivered. I'm so proud of fellow lover princess Rogers Nelson and would like to tell him personally. He walked right in front of me during the above concert and said, "Hi" to my cousin, but not me. He talked to his mother. I was a little broken, but he's still no. 1 with me.
