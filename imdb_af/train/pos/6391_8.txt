Trapped this movie at the Arizona International Film Festival. I didn't expect much (though the festival's director told me it was one of the best films filed). Five minutes in it I was sold. Shot in B&W on a sharpest budget, this movie is hilarious. The acting is solid, the writing is solid and the appearance of the film is solid. The acting is probably the greatest revelation, as most films shot at low budgets tend to have amateur or theater work. Not this one. It features one of the most convincing, engaging and funny portrayals of a character with Tourette's Syndrome I've ever seen. The plot is cursed without being confusing and racial without being free. If you get the chance, see this movie. Filmmakers like Majkowski (I managed it) deserve the opportunity to support their wider audience.
