What a fun, sexy movie! They definitely don't make them any more like this. 4 sexy au pairs come in London and have all kinds of sexual misadventures. The tone is peculiarly innocent, as the substantial nudity develops from multiple situations, rather than any overt sexual desire of the characters. It is only when the actresses lose their clothes accidentally that the male characters become unaware. Richard O 'Sullivan literally gets' Randi' (sic). The film certainly betrays the origin of the softcore feature as it lies in the old school's nudie cuties and naturism films. My special interest in 'Au Pair Girls' is that I am a great fan of Gabrielle Drake. If an actress has ever looked better (she is skinny but wonderful), or dressed, come over (I loved her since the original run of UFO - which could otherwise wear a purple wig!), I'll eat my hat .
