The first thing I thought when I watched these movies was: It's not really a movie, at least it's not spontaneous when we hear the word "movie". it is completely symbolic, everything in it has a figurative meaning. So if you are not used symbolically to express things, you will find it strange if you are not familiar with philosophy, religion, spiritual life, you will think it is just a fairy tale ... and even a strange, chaotic. For me, the legend of Zu is perfect. And I like that. It tells us the story of the struggle between light and darkness, the struggle that is as old as mankind, and everyone who is looking for the senses in this life is confronted. The film is of course made by Buddhists. I'm not a Buddhist. My religion and the vision of the world and man are different. But as far as we are all human beings and have the same human nature, we necessarily have common experiences and can understand each other. This is a very nice movie! And I had more movies like this - movies that matter. There are too many empty stories that are only good to make time pass faster.
