It was a wonderful movie. How these women tried to save their husbands. I thought the actors' performances were great. I had to think about the film for a long time. I think every student should see this movie so they can think about war, relationships, friendship and love. I love the movie because it told me and showed me how strong love can be. I wish I could be as strong as a woman. I really liked it because it tells me something about relationships and that is what I would like to see in a movie. I think you can compare the movie to Der Untergang, The pianist. If you join these three movies, you have a good idea of ​​what happened during the war. We must remember something like the war forever.
